            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it may perhaps, be onely an affected, or a pretended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet it is a moſt ſevere Truth in me, when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I had not Publiſhed this Romance, but at the Requeſt and Commands of ſome choice Friends, being
<pb facs="tcp:46063:3"/>
ſenſible that a piece compoſed in my greener Youth, and moſt of it during the intervals of a ſharp diſtemper, cannot be ſo mature and ſound in all its parts, as it might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if undertaken in a more advanced Age, and healthful Leaſure. And therefore, to decline the Vanity of ſuch as make the Preface rather a Panegyrick to their Books, then an Advertiſement to the Reader; I declare, that this is onely to deſire thoſe that ſhall peruſe the following Story, not to impute the</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Faults to me, ſince there
<pb facs="tcp:46063:3"/>
will be enough beſides upon my own ſcore, to Exerciſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet do I not intend by this Ingenious Confeſſion to ſubmit my ſelf to every trivial Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer: For though I ſhall acquieſce in the Judgement of the Wiſe, yet have I too much Spirit to endure the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant reproof of ſuch buſie Drones as make a humming noiſe, indeed, like Bees, and often light upon the ſweeteſt Flowers; but yet want the faculty to extract the leaſt drop of Honey thence reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſuch ill Conſtituted Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:46063:4"/>
as convert the moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Aliments into corrupt and contagious humors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe, I therefore juſtly may appeal to ſounder judgements, ſuch as examine with as much skill as equity, and conſult with reaſon and underſtanding, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either giddy Folly, or beſpattering envy to bias them: before whom I dare affirm, that if I deſerve cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in ſome places, I merit no leſs approbation in others; For if my expreſſion be not very Eloquent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:46063:4"/>
is it very Languid; and if novelty be therein plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I am confident ſome will finde ſatisfaction; for though my ſtile may ſeem to limp, compared to the more Polite and Smooth Language of ſome others, yet does it not fall into Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity or obſceneſs; nor leave ſuch uneven furrows as to make the Readers ſtumble, unleſs their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or Malice lay an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome block in their own way.</p>
            <p>Such as can reliſh no <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> that is, not forced with
<pb facs="tcp:46063:5"/>
Extravagant Impoſſibilities (no leſs Ridiculous then improbable) will find little Guſto and cold entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here; wherefore I wiſh ſuch to ſtop at this Preface, and make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Progreſs, for I have endued my Heroes with no greater ſtrength or courage, then may reſide in generous perſons; nor do I fill their Veins with ſtreams of blood greater, then thoſe ſmal channels ſhould contain.</p>
            <p>I know, indeed, this were an eaſie task, if that were all, that is required to gain
<pb facs="tcp:46063:5"/>
applauſe; it being without diſpute more facil to rough-draw a Gyant (with a fenſing quil) who ſhould ſingly rout whole Armies in every page, then really diſarme the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt Coward that dares but ſtand in the leaſt defenſive poſture.</p>
            <p>And who ſees not the fair advantage I might now take to ſet off the actions of my Heroe by heightning and exagerating them with ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Hyperboles, ſince he is liſted one of the greateſt Conquerours in the Rolls of Fame; But treating of a real
<pb facs="tcp:46063:6"/>
Hiſtory, for the moſt part, though it be controverted by ſome, I keep cloſe to probability, and give him the Character of a man, who was indeed inriched with a more then vulgar Soul, but whoſe body was not above the Standar of Mortals, nor diſproportionate to that condition.</p>
            <p>For, in Truth, how cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſoever Fictons may paſs, yet can it not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed wiſdome to compoſe ſuch as only pleaſe and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour extravagant and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fancies, but that predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
<pb facs="tcp:46063:6"/>
faculty of the Soul, the judgement; ſhould limit them within the naturall bounds of Reaſon and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; And ſo <hi>Romances</hi> ſhould be no other then the faireſt Pictures and juſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of Truth, from which it is as blameable to deviate, as to add Tinctures to the Roſe or Lilly, ſuch aids being onely an ugly and groſs paint, that inſtead of encreaſing their beauty, blurs them with deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46063:7"/>
               <hi>But it may be Objected, that I am my ſelf guilty of thoſe lapſes, I here condemn, and chide ſo much in others; ſince I have feined the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers of ſo many perſons, and principally</hi> Birinthea, <hi>never mentioned by any ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Reply, that my deſigne, being not only to tranſcribe former Hiſtorians but to take my riſe from thence for freſh inventions; I think them very pertinent and excuſable, ſo long as they are within the compaſs of
<pb facs="tcp:46063:7"/>
probabillity, and are not found impoſſibilities. In fine, it may ſuffice to tell you, that this is a <hi>Romance</hi> accommodated to Hiſtory, to whoſe Text I have added thoſe Auxiliary Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rather to Illuſtrate, then Diſguiſe or Corrupt it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the night had not come on and ſurprized them, the battle had not been ſo ſoon ended: but the Sun, which contributes to the life of all things, ſeemed to precipitate his courſe expreſly with the greater ſpeed (as if unwilling to be any longer a Witneſs of the death of ſo many men) and reſign'd it's Empire to the gloomy ſhades, that during the obſcurity, they might be forced to a truce, the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46063:9"/>
Combatants looſing both the ſight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Never did <hi>Bellona</hi> exerciſe the fury of her Arms with more rage then in this occaſion; thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were ſlain, together with their King <hi>Labynetus</hi>; and all the remainder could do, was to fly by the favour of the night, and ſteal themſelves away from the victorious <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> who ſeemed to breath nothing that day but ſlaughter, and ſought to triumph over the lives of Men, rather then over their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. The King of <hi>Lydia</hi> perceiving likewiſe, that the <hi>Aſsyrian</hi> Troops had all forſaken the Camp, thought it vain with a feeble reſiſtance to adventure the deſperate hazard of an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat and ruine; Wherefore giving command to all his men to ſeek their ſafety by a timely flight, of all that grand equipage which before attended him, he only took eſpecial care to ſave ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which were extreamly dear to him.</p>
            <p>On the morrow, at the firſt birth of day, <hi>Cyax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Nephew, were already preparing themſelves to aſſault the enemies Camp, when preſently they found they had a pillage to make rather then a fight. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared to their ſight, but the horrid ſpectacle of wounded, or dead bodies: and ſome whoſe dying groans eccho'd in the Souldiers ears for pitty, called but a mercileſs hand to ſtrip him of his cloaths and end his life the ſooner.</p>
            <p>The fruits of this victory reliſhed ſo ſweet to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> that contenting himſelf with theſe firſt favours fortune had beſtowed, he exhorted <hi>Cyrus</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46063:9"/>
to taſte them in a quiet repoſe, and not hazard the looſing them in a ſecond adventure But, that generous Prince, in the heat of that youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courage which made him hope for, and aſpire to the Conqueſt of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> earneſtly implored his permiſſion to perſue the enemy, to whom it was not ſafe to allow a breathing time, leſt they ſhould ſet thoſe puiſſant Armies on foot again which were ſo formidable for their numbers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps light on ſome advantage to tear thoſe Palms of Victory out of their hands again, which they had newly gathered with ſo much ſweat and blood. He obtained in fine, the liberty to give them chaſe with thoſe <hi>Perſians</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and ſuch <hi>Medians</hi> likewiſe as would go voluntarily, had free leave to aſſiſt him: the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt amongſt them very Nobly accompanied him in this expedition; and he was advanced already very near the Enemy: when ſome Officers adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him of the arrival of ſome <hi>Hircanian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, who ſaid they were come to treat with him concerning an affair of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: He commanded they ſhould be brought into his Preſence, and underſtood by their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Letters, the deſign their Prince had to quit the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> party, by whom he was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to joyn with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that he might not be ſurprized by too much credulity, inform'd himſelf by them of the poſture his Enemies were in, and ſeveral other particulars, which gave him the fuller aſſurance of their reality: after which he refuſed to take thoſe Hoſtages they profer'd; and when they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46063:10"/>
preſſ'd him to retain them, he generouſly reply'd, that he needed them not, having power enough to puniſh their perfidiouſneſs, in caſe they ſhould deceive him; as he had alſo ſufficient means to reward their amity by a retribution of his own, which he promis'd them inviolably, if they prov'd faithful and conſtant.</p>
            <p>He had no ſooner concluded with the <hi>Hircani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but he immediately placed ſome of them in the front of his Army to ſerve for Guides, and ſo marched the whole night; at the end of which, finding himſelf in fight of the Enemy, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a <hi>Hircanian</hi> to his companions who were in the rear, to advertiſe them by a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to rank themſelves beſides the reſt of their Party, which they ſpeedily performed with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of joy, which much augmented, the fear and terrour of the <hi>Aſſyrians. Cyrus</hi> no ſooner beheld the <hi>Hircanians</hi> in their due places, but that he might lead them on to fight during that heat, and the Enemies confuſion, he aſſembled all his ſuperiour Officers, and after he had uſed ſome particular ceremonies towards his new confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, he harangued after this manner.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dear Companions, it were needleſs to advertiſe you, at preſent, that we muſt fight: As it is the cauſe that made you come from <hi>Cyaxares</hi> with ſo much haſte and reſolution; ſo I promiſe my ſelf, my companions, that none here will refuſe the preſent occaſion, which now preſents its ſelf ſo fairly to us. Yea, I ſhould wrong you, ſhould I exhort you to that thing, for which you followed me with ſo much cheerfulneſs, and which you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46063:10"/>
begun with ſo good ſucceſs. This Battle fellow Souldiers, and worthy Officers, will be but the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Crown, which the firſt victory hath prepared: It might ſlip from us if we ſhould give ſo much reſpite to our Enemies as to reſume their ſtrength and ſpirits; Or if the fear which but now affrights them; ſhould be let alone till it turn'd into deſpair. Yet do I not indeed queſtion, but you would have as much ſucceſs, as you have true valour, though they were in a poſture to reſiſt you more vigorouſly than now they can. But not to expoſe you to the hazard of fortune, who refuſed them the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a victory ſhe might have beſtowed on them; and which they cannot now obtain, but by your unmanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let us ſhew dear Companions, that we have no valour nor ſtrength now, which they ſhall not be a full witneſs to aſſert is irreſiſtable. And now that they are in diſorder, having already loſt the beſt part of their Army, with their King; And that the <hi>Hircanians</hi> the ſtouteſt of their friends are on our ſide.

            <p>Theſe words being pronounc'd with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary vehemency, the Officers and Souldiers returned to their own places; <hi>Cyrus</hi> drew the <hi>Hircanians</hi> up to the Front, and on each Wing two bodies of Horſe. He had not advanced far, but he was on the Enemies skirts, whilſt there was yet but light enough to diſcover them: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Army more ſurprized with fear and dread than this of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> at their approach. The weakneſs and diſorder they were reduced to by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46063:11"/>
their firſt defeat, made them uncapable to ſuſtain the attaque of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> who charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſo much precipitancy and mettle, that running here and there, allarmed they ſoon fell into a mighty confuſion; ſome to oppoſe, others to eſcape, bridled their Horſes, and the nimbleſt mounted and ſaved themſelves: ſome took their Arms as their beſt ſecurity, others threw down theirs to fly with the leſs incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. In fine, the greateſt part of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and their confederates being ſlain without any conſiderable oppoſition, this Victory was only ſignaliz'd by the illuſtrious names of ſome of the dead: The King of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> and the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> were killed upon the place, with many other conſiderable perſons, both for their valour and qualities. In this action the <hi>Hircanians</hi> gave infallible proofs of their fidelity and courage; they were the firſt at the onſet, and laſt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat: few of the Enemies that had ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Death, could eſcape from Captivity; moſt of them being made Priſoners, and thoſe few that fled, and drove the richeſt of their booty before them, were ſo cloſely perſued, that the <hi>Hircanians</hi> returned laden with riches, and with a great number of Chariots full of Women. <hi>Creſus</hi> was almoſt the only man whom they could not overtake, who having taken the advantage of the whole night before with all his party to ſhun the next dayes ſhock, retired, being winged with fear, out of their reach.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the priſoners that were preſented to <hi>Cyrus, Sybaris</hi> his Lieutenant General, the choiceſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46063:11"/>
of his friends, beſtowed upon him by the gods for a Companion in his fortunes, took notice of one he knew, and inſtantly embraced him with teſtimonies of ſo particular an amity, that all the beholders were amazed: And <hi>Cyrus</hi> asking him whom that was he did ſo much careſſe; My Lord, replyed he, If this Prince were treated according to the merit of his valour and birth, you ſhould behold him rather with a Crown on his head, and Palms the trophies of Victory in his hands, then in this preſent unhappineſs of a Captivity, which nevertheleſs cannot but be glorious to him, ſince it cannot but be an effect of his courage.</p>
            <p>This Elogy which <hi>Sybaris</hi> made of his friend, render'd <hi>Cyrus</hi> the more curious to know whom he was, and having heard his Name and place of birth, with the gallant deportment had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in the fight, he approached him with all the civilities that were due to ſo illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Captive; and having diſcourſed with him ſome time, this Priſoner anſwer'd in ſo brave a manner, that it plainly appeared to him, thoſe praiſes which <hi>Sybaris</hi> had ſpoken, were rather the teſtimonies of ſincere truth, than of any particular affection.</p>
            <p>Their Complements being ended, <hi>Sybaris</hi> to whoſe care <hi>Cyrus</hi> eſpecially recommended him, conducted him to his own Tent, where he was nobly received; and having given him for ſome time the liberty to repoſe himſelf alone; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience he was in to learn by what adventure he was drawn into that action, made him return and intreat him to relate the ſtory of his life, ever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46063:12"/>
ſince he had left him in <hi>Margiana. Merame,</hi> who could not refuſe to unlock that ſecret to <hi>Sybaris,</hi> with whom he had ſo long ſince contracted a real friendſhip, began in this manner.</p>

                        <p>I Can give you no particular reaſon of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, and the occaſion which brings me here, but that alone, which as I beleeve, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cauſes the misfortune of all men, I mean Love.</p>
                        <p>At that time when you reſided in <hi>Margiana,</hi> I did not yet know the puiſſance of this deity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had not then felt his piercing darts; and I may ſay, I then lived in content, though in the Court it may ſeem a thing next to impoſſibility, amidſt the Monſters of Ambition, and Envy, whereof the one flatters with its deluſive hopes, while it conſpires and plots our utter ruine; the other bytes and knawes our hearts, becauſe that ſome are happier then our ſelves. I can aſſure you, nevertheleſs, that I was not at all tainted with them, whether my blooming age were yet too green and innocent, or that I were reſerved to ſome more rugged Fate. But ſince that time, all thoſe dayes which other men have injoy'd with ſome tranquillity, have been ſo many hours of misfortune to me; Or if I have taſted ſome momentory intervals of happineſs, I have been ſure to pay for thoſe little pleaſures, at the dear rate of more continued ſufferings: but I am
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46063:12"/>
tranſported too much with the reſentment of my miſeries, as if it were my task only to make my moanes, forgetting that you deſire to know what has hapned ever ſince our ſeparation, which that you may the more fully underſtand, it will be very neceſſary that I ſtep back a little in my diſcourſe, and begin it farther off.</p>
                        <p>You know that I was born in <hi>Margiana</hi> of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which, being of the ſame blood of thoſe Princes that are the Soveraigns, is not a little conſiderable in that Country: and beſides this advantage, the more then ordinary care of my Education was added, I being the only child after twelve years marriage 'twixt my Father and Mother. As ſoon as I had paſt my date of infancy, a learned man was ſent for from <hi>Perſia</hi> to be my Governor, and to inſtruct me in thoſe Sciences which are very ordinary in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but ſomewhat rare in ours: He had the charge to enrich and poliſh my mind with learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judgement, whilſt another Maſter had the care to teach me ſuch bodily exerciſes as were fit for a perſon of my quality. The great pains they both took in my behalf, was not altogether fruitleſs. And I may without vanity affirm, that I profited much by their learned inſtructions: which induced <hi>Balden,</hi> Our Prince who had a particular eſteeme for mee, to oblige my Father to let me be alwayes neer his Son <hi>Seniſra</hi>; and, as there are few at Court that refuſe ſuch favours, it was accepted of as a great honour, that I was choſen to be a companion for the young Prince: and whether it were the equality of our Age, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46063:13"/>
the aſſiduous devoirs I rendred him, or only his fair and free inclination, I cannot tell, but he expreſſ'd ſo great and fond an amity, that he would hardly be an houre without me: We paſſed our time in all kind of divertiſements: But one day, when <hi>Seniſra,</hi> being poſſeſſed with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſadneſs, would needs injoy himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the importunate throng of Courtiers which uſually beſeiged him, we retired to a Caſtle called <hi>Coupava</hi> belonging to my Father. In that vaſt ſolitude the Prince began to be acquainted with the nature of his Melancholly, and found that ſome new entertained thoughts which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally invaded his mind, was the ſole cauſe of it; and as he cheriſhed me with much tenderneſs, he would needs impart this diſquiet to mee, and did me the honour to reveale, that ſince the late aſſembly and intertainment at the marriage of his Siſter, where all the Court Stars appeared in their brighteſt glory, <hi>Themira</hi> was ſtill preſent in his memory, that indeed he had beheld her with more admiration, and entertained her with much more content then any other: that ſince having ſeen her again accidentally, he had not been able to guard his heart from a particular inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it reſented for her beauty, nor could he part from her, but with I know not what conſtraint, which fill'd his boſome with diſquiet, whilſt he was abſent from her.</p>
                        <p>We were both of us yet ſo young, we could not gueſs the name of this new breeding paſſion, but in a very ſhort time after experience fully taught it us. The ſhort abode we made in that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46063:13"/>
Caſtle augmented the Princes trouble, and gave birth to mine. I chanced to ſee amongſt the Captives that were in the Keepers cuſtody, a young Maid, whoſe handſome meen, and the Majeſtick features of her face invited me particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to conſider all her actions; the more I ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her perſon, and demeanour, the more I found her rare, which cauſed me to bewail her conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. From this compaſſion ſprung up the curioſity, which made me enquire of her Mother of what Country ſhe was, and the ſad diſaſter that brought her into ſlavery. All that I could then learn was, that at the taking of <hi>Sina,</hi> ſhe fell into the hands of ſome of our Souldiers who had ſold her to this Keeper, and that her condition deſerved no regrets, ſince it had never been much better than at preſent. I could not be ſatisfied with this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but rather wiſht ſhe might have loſt many things of advantage and importance together with her liberty, that might have ſpoken her of a greater quality, though I could not have heard that neither without ſorrow; and bearing to the Court, as well the remembrance of her miſery, as the Image of her beauty; I conſidered them both a long time, only with a ſence of tenderneſs and indifferency.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, <hi>Seniſra</hi> at our return was fully acquainted, that what before we had been ignorant of, was called Love; and whatever other paſſion he eſteemed that trouble in his ſoul, he found it anſwer only to that Name; and in this knowledge he eagerly ſought the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meet <hi>Themira</hi>: But the firſt time he came into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46063:14"/>
her preſence his tongue was tyed up in an unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſilence, which put him into ſuch a trouble, as never till then had befaln him, inſomuch that he could not ſalute her without a ſtammering impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, and his ſudden change would have been eaſily remark'd, if ſome Ladies had not put him upon the diſcourſe of his hunting, and thoſe other divertiſements, they imagined he had been to ſeek in the Country. He indeavoured afterwards in many other encounters to behave himſelf more confidently in her preſence, and went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prepared expreſly to entertain her in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but immediately a ſudden inward diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence controuled his ſtrongeſt reſolutions, ſo that in two months time all he could do, was rather to expreſs his grief upon his face, then proclaim it with his tongue. He often complained to me, that he knew not what reſpect hindred him from declaring himſelf openly. In fine, conſumed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with a flame, he could not handſomely bring to light, he reſolved to extinguiſh it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, by not ſeeing her, knowing her preſence only nouriſhed that heat. But when the pleaſant ſeaſon had invited his Miſtreſs to return into the Country, not being able to indure her abſence, whoſe only memory excited ſuch troubles in his breaſt, he asked me, if I would accompany him to <hi>Coupava,</hi> that Caſtle being not far diſtant from <hi>Themira</hi>'s: I told him it would be a very great honour to me, when ever he would vouchſafe to go there, &amp; to receive him in the beſt manner that could be; I ſent my Father notice of his deſign, &amp; two dayes after we went, only with ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46063:14"/>
as might not too much diſcover us. The whole journey he entertained me with his Amours, and complained of the cruelty of his Fate, in that he fore-ſaw his Father would never condiſcend to it, though <hi>Themira</hi> ſhould fairly correſpond, which he likewiſe placed amongſt his doubts: I mildely told him, he ought to attempt all means and remedies before he yeilded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and that I could not believe <hi>Themira</hi> would refuſe the honour of his noble affection, ſhe having too great a ſtock of wit not to diſcern the infinite advantages might follow, provided ſhe could clearly penetrate his juſt and honeſt intentions.</p>
                        <p>Ariving with the entertainment of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes at <hi>Coupava,</hi> we were ſomewhat ſurprized finding <hi>Themira</hi> there, who accompanied her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was come to viſit mine. <hi>Seniſra</hi> was extreamly joyful of that good fortune, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already late, the ſmall portion of that dying evening paſs'd in uſual Complements and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The next morning all the Nobility and Gentry that inhabits near thoſe parts come to pay their obedience to the Prince, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready talked of nothing but hunting to divert him: when having told them, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to taſte the ſweeter repoſe of that ſolitude, every one retir'd to their dwellings, leaving him the free liberty to compleat his deſign. The firſt time we attempted to viſit <hi>Themira,</hi> was with my Mother, but their ceremonious reſpects, and the ſplended treatment they made for him, hindred him from making known any thing of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The next time we waited on her, he began
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46063:15"/>
to diſcover ſome ſparks of his great flame, though ſparingly; and my Mother and <hi>Themira</hi>'s being retir'd, we remained alone with that beauty, who had the charge to perform the honour of the Houſe, and ſhew us all the rarities, of which <hi>Seniſra</hi> took ſo little notice, that although there were very many which deſerved a curious ſurvey, and might have challenged our admiration, yet he could hardly be ſo much the Maſter of his patience and reaſon, as to vouchſafe to look on them. <hi>Themira</hi> who quickly perceived his ſmall complaiſance, told him ſhe was extreamly ſorry there was nothing worthy his view; yet ſhe wondered not he took ſo little delight therein, becauſe as it was unworthy of his nobler fancy, ſo it was an abuſe to his patience to ſtrive to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him any longer in that dull ſolitude, it being eaſie to judge his more choice contentments ſummoned him back again to Court.</p>
                        <p>This complement wakened the Princes ſilence, which his ſoft paſſion had rocked into a muſing ſlumber, and obliged him to a reply, rather that he might not be thought incivil, then to ſhew himſelf amorous; yet his paſſion favourably over-biaſſed his will, and perſwaded him to ſhape his anſwer in theſe words. If, as you tell me beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Themira,</hi> my ſatisfaction were rather to be at the Court, than in this place, I cannot ſee what reaſon could oblige me to leave it; the intereſt which called me hither, be it what it will, muſt needs be moſt powerful ſtill detaining me here: but I know not what ſtrange enigmatical Fate mine is, that having ſo happily found what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46063:15"/>
came to ſeek, my melancholly is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs augmented. Truly reply'd ſhe, It amazes me to think how it is poſſible you ſhould be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with too much contentment, for I cannot believe you came to ſeek out trouble. Alas! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered he, 'Tis the nature of that charm which poſſeſſes me, to find no more repoſe, amidſt my joyes, than my afflictions.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall wonder now no more, reply'd ſhe, ſince it is a cauſe not to be found in nature; You have reaſon, ſaid he, it is altogether divine; if it were an ordinary thing I might withſtand it: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Themira,</hi> if the Sun be not guilty of their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who too boldly expoſe their ſight to his bright rayes; if the Sea be not culpable of the wracks of thoſe many veſſels which voluntarily throw or launch themſelves into its watery Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, what cauſe can I have to complain of that trouble which I have my ſelf courted and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without the leaſt of its allowance? It belongs to you, alone then, reparted ſhe, to ſeek the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but, ſaid he, my Cure, as well as my Malady depends on the ſame Subject; So that although I alone have brought my ſelf into this ſtraight, yet does not the remedy thereof reſide within my ſelf. If it be ſo, anſwered ſhe, then diſcloſe your grief, perhaps 'tis not a thing inſenſible like the Sea, or Sun: True, ſaid <hi>Seniſra,</hi> yet nevertheleſs it is more bright and reſplendent then the one, and more unbridled and tempeſtuous than the other; in fine <hi>Themira</hi> it is Love, Love! But — he ſtopt at that word, proceeding no further, and ſhe reſum'd the ſpeech ſmiling, and ſaying: But
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46063:16"/>
what Sir? Goe on I beſeech you—yet, I muſt condemn my own curioſity, ſince it may well ſuffice me to know, that if this place does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing to your delights, no more does it adde to your Melancholly. It is true, anſwer'd he, ſomewhat troubled, the place of it ſelf would be indeed very indifferent to me, if it did not contain ſomewhat that might be the bleſſed ſubject of my joy, as it is now of my griefe.</p>
                        <p>The Prince finding himſelf in ſo fair a path, endeavour'd to expound his thoughts more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly; and let her know all this diſcourſe pointed at her: But ſhe having a very ready wit, ſharpe judgement, and preſent memory, ever turned the ſence of his ſpeech another way: and whether ſhe feigned that ſhe did not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, or really believed he only ſpoke this out of Gallantry and complaiſance, ſhe ſo handſomely warded all his complements, that when we were returned to the Caſtle, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined all her behaviour, we could not fathome any thing of her deſign, or lay hold of the leaſt ſillable that might ſeem to ſound favourably on the Princes behalf.</p>
                        <p>But, not to detain you any longer by this reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of a Hiſtory, of which I ſhall mention nothing, which does not ſome way concerned me, you muſt know, in fine <hi>Sybaris,</hi> that <hi>Seniſra</hi> at another time, made an ample declaration of his affection for <hi>Themira,</hi> who yeilded not immediately; That fair lady reſiſted for ſome time, till ſhe found his love was as reall and honeſt, as it appeared vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46063:16"/>
afterward ſhe conſented to entertain his noble affection with all the mutual correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that honour would allow of. But for my own part, that paſſion, that made me ſigh for the captivity of the fair ſlave, inſpired me by degrees with a deſign to lighten her ſufferings. To this effect, I deſired the Keeper to treat her leſs rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the reſt, and not dare to put her to any unhandſome or ſervile labour, and to make the fellow the more obſervant, I cauſ'd an old woman who had been my nurſe, to tell him, that my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had an intent to take her to her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>During my reſidence there. I delighted much to be in the Hall, where ſhe was often working with many others. The pleaſure I took in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her, made me inſenſibly waſte much time there, whereof <hi>Seniſra</hi> many times asked me the reaſon, which ſhame obliged me to conceal: Though I had often told him, how much the beauty and modeſt gracefulneſs of this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſurpaſſed the reſt of them. <hi>Themira</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Court drew us with her, for my part, I left not <hi>Coupava,</hi> but with much repugnance, and before I went, I would needs be acquainted with the fair Captives name, and learnt that ſhe was called <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria.</hi> At that word <hi>Merame,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his diſcourſe, caſting his eyes up towards Heaven, after he had ſet two or three deep ſighes at liberty, and then again went on with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. That ſweet name came as often into my mouth, as her fair Idea into my mind. I often retyr'd into my ſelf to forme it the more lively, and when my imagination had done it's utmoſt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46063:17"/>
I entertain'd my ſelf with theſe ſoft whiſpers, all that I can imagine of beautiful and perfect, is <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>; but what? <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> is a Captive, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion brought no leſs ſorrow, then the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Image brought content.</p>
                        <p>A while after my returne to Court, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that a ſlave belonging to the keeper of <hi>Coupava,</hi> was come to the City to provide things neceſſary for his Marriage with <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria.</hi> I was more ſurprized at this novel, then I ſhould have been at a thunder-clap, and as if I had already declared my ſelf for her, I reſolv'd abſolutely to oppoſe this match, and not conſidering any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what could intereſs me ſo powerfully, I ſtole from the Court greedily, and being wing'd with love and anger, rode all that night towards <hi>Coupava.</hi> I was Infinitely aſtoniſhed, at my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the next morning, to find the Caſtle empty of all its inhabitants, and my aſtoniſhment ſweld to deſpair. When it was told me, that all the people were in the Temple, aſſiſting at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>'s Marriage. I was alighted from my horſe, but, as if it had been a long journey thither, leaping into the ſaddle again, I preſſed him forward with the greateſt ſpeed, towards the Temple, where being haſtily entred, I ſaw the aſſembly neer an Altar laden with victims, and one of the Prieſts of the god of Marriage, claſping the hands of the intended husband and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>'s together. I knew not whether the ceremony were already compleated, for the fear I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted hindred me from minding that inquiry; but perceiving the Bride melting in tears. I would
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46063:17"/>
needs know the reaſon, and it was told me, that it was impoſſible to perſwade her to a conſent to accept of him, ſhe not giving any other anſwer, then ſighs and tears: and as I would have asked her the cauſe, ſhe fell down at my feet, and fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſuppliant arms about my knees: Ah! my Lord, cry'd ſhe, protect me againſt a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, from which neither the Sanctity of this place, nor the Deity that is adored could defend me: I know the condition of my Captivity obliges me to receive what Spouſe is alotted me, upon fair terms; but I do not believe they can conſtrain me to take an infamous vilain, whom my Keeper hath hired to this purpoſe, that thereby he may compleat his own ugly deſigns, deſiring to gain the ſame power over my unſtained Chaſtity, as he hath over my Liberty. The Deity's are Witneſs of the truths I tell you; and I hope for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from your goodneſs, and authority, which I now conjure you not to refuſe to perſecuted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</p>
                        <p>If thoſe words in that mournful accent ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them, were capable to move the moſt indifferent Spectators, who now began to plead for her, I leave you to judge what deep impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they made in me; and whether ſhe had need of ſuch powerful Advocates as her eloquent tears to implore a mercy, which I had a more eager deſire to grant, then ſhe could have to beg for: I raiſed her inſtantly up, and telling her the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her ſorrow and complaint was too juſt not to be allowed of; I cauſed the Ceremony to be abruptly broken off, after I had highly menaced
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46063:18"/>
the Keeper, if ever he gave <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> the leaſt cauſe to complain hereafter; and putting her into his Wives cuſtody, told her, ſhe ſhould give me a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere account of her. Then my devoirs which called me again to Court, forced me with infinite regrets to leave <hi>Coupava,</hi> and I got home again the next morning that they might not examine or gueſs the cauſe of my abſence and journey. But before I parted, I received thanks from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>'s Mother, for the ineſtimable favour I had rendred her daughter, and promiſed her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my Protection and beſt ſervice as long as ever they ſhould remain within the Precincts of our juriſdiction.</p>
                        <p>When I came to my Mothers preſence, I related all this ſtory to her, but in ſuch a diſſembling manner, that ſhe could not perceive the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt I had, or that I harboured any other thoughts, but only of equity and charity; which nevertheleſs moved her to remove them from that lewd fellow, as indeed ſhe ſoon after did. And—when my Mother took <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> into her houſe, I received and entertained her in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and heart entirely, and Love ſoon made me know he was my Soveraign Maſter.</p>
                        <p>You may have perhaps learned whilſt you were in our Country, that we have a natural antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy againſt the <hi>Scythians</hi> who are indeed born our Enemies: beſides the frequent quarrels betwixt Princes for their intereſt foments that imbred hate; ſo that if we ſometimes put up our Swords, it was but to unſheath them with the more fury afterwards: It ſeemed, however, that at this time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46063:18"/>
there was a moſt firm Peace eſtabliſhed; yet, as it is impoſſible long to ſmother the flames of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fewd and antient animoſity, ſo the frontire Garriſons of either Nation began from ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular differences betwixt their reſpective inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to blow the covered ſparks into an open fire of contention and War, which having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Balden</hi> our Prince, knowing the mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration the <hi>Scythians</hi> made againſt him, finding himſelf alone too weak to reſiſt thoſe formidable numbers of men which they do ordinarily amaſs together, ſent Ambaſſadours to the Prince of <hi>Sogdiana,</hi> to put a period to all their own private differences, and ſecure their States by a timely union and conjunction of their Forces, which might defend them againſt the common Enemy, to whom their former unhappy diſſentions had given many great advantages, which they had found to their ſad prejudice. The <hi>Sogdian</hi> Prince opened both his arms and heart to welcome this propoſition; and to tye up their amity with the moſt indiſoluble bands, he profered his daughter, a beautiful and vertuous Princeſs to <hi>Seniſra</hi> for a Wife: So that our Ambaſſadours proſpering in their negotiation above their hopes, laden with Preſents, returned with thoſe perſons whom the <hi>Sogdian</hi> Prince ſent to ſee the Articles of Peace ratisfied, which we eſteemed very advantagious, and particularly for the profered Match betwixt their Princeſs and brave <hi>Seniſra.</hi> But he, who expected no other but the publick intereſt in this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46063:19"/>
agreement, was much aſtoniſhed that they had engaged him in a buſineſs that concerned him ſo particularly, without ever communicating it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and finding himſelf driven to this great ſtraight, either of reſolving to looſe <hi>Themira,</hi> or renounce this Match; he did me the honour to ask me what courſe he ſhould take for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his repoſe and ſatisfaction; but I was not in a capacity to give him any ſolid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at that time, having my own heart burdened with as great a freight of trouble. The day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, one of my Uncles came to viſit me, and having led me into the Palace Garden; after a ſhort preface, which promiſed me the higheſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity I could wiſh for in the world, he told me that <hi>Balden</hi> had ſo particular an amity or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for me, that he would needs have me find out a Miſtreſs for my ſelf, that ſo we might be ſharers in the bleſſings of his Sons triumph and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize our Nuptials on the ſame day. And if for that end, I had any inclination at Court which were ſuitable to my quality, I might freely declare it, that they might uſe their endeavours and care to ſatisfie <hi>Baldens</hi> commands and my deſires. I was not readily furniſhed with any other anſwer, but only that I had hitherto beheld the Ladies at the Court with too much indifferency to have any particular inclination, and that if they would allow me time, I was yet young enough to paſs ſome years thus ſingle, and it would not be too late hereafter to think of ſuch a weighty buſineſs; Think of it then on your part, ſaid he, and we will conſider of it on ours, and ſo left me. Theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46063:19"/>
words filled me with more diſpleaſure, then he had flattered me before with hopes. Amidſt the ſtrange diſorders it cauſed in me when I was by my ſelf; I nicely examined all that he had ſpoken, and reflecting on the Ladies of my acquaintance, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> only came to my thoughts with pleaſure, ſhe only inſpired me with ſentiments of Love, and did ſeem to me moſt worthy of affection.</p>
                        <p>With theſe thoughts I was carried, where I might behold her to confirm my ſelf in this truth, and I was by her preſence fortified in the high opinion I had conceived that my eſteem was very rational, and that there was none could deſerve ſo truely to be cheriſhed and prefered. In fine, I reſolved with my ſelf to give no ſatisfaction to my Uncle in what he had propoſed, nor to lend any more an ear to ſuch diſcourſes; and ſo far was I from making any particular addreſs to the Ladies at Court, that I left off that freedom and familiarity I had otherwhile practiſed amongſt them; I was ever of a more ſullen humour, and avoided even the converſation of thoſe with whom I had moſt intimacy.</p>
                        <p>This change of behaviour was ſoon taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of at Court, where moſt men are rather apt to pry into others actions, than to regulate their own: every one admired at me, eſpecially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was put to my choice to elect any ſhe I could beſt fancy. My deareſt friends were hugely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at my black melancholly, and could not poſſible imagine that to be the cauſe of my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which they judged rather might be a juſt reaſon to make me rejoyce, but my diſpleaſure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46063:20"/>
was utterly concealed from them all. <hi>Seniſra</hi> was the only Privado to whom I uncaſed my mind; but, I found him as ſenſibly tormented as my ſelf: for having lived hitherto very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his affection, he was now fallen into diſpair, becauſe his deareſt <hi>Themira,</hi> when he laſt went to viſit her, had nothing but reproaches for his infidelity in her diſcourſe, wherewith to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him, inſtead of thoſe delightful amorous accents ſhe was uſed to ſooth his paſſionate ſoul withal at former meetings: And, indeed, in the hot fits of his reſentments he would often ſay, Would to God <hi>Merame</hi> we were yet both of us free from this Tyranny of Love: you would not then have a Miſtreſs that is a Captive, nor I a Subject, whoſe haughtineſs or cruelty tramples on my affection and ſubmiſſions; 'tis thoſe alone that thus divert both your devoir and mine from running in the due channel of filial obedience, we owe to our Parents; but your condition is happier yet then mine, you have not yet been treated unhandſomely, or at leaſt unkindly by <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> as I have by <hi>Themira</hi>: For having lately underſtood my Fathers Will touching my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the <hi>Sogdianian</hi> Princeſs; I was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurprized, that conſidering how much it traverſed my Love and deſign for <hi>Themira,</hi> I durſt not attempt to viſit her for three or four dayes, not deſiring to acquaint her with it, till I had found ſome way whereby to aſſure her that my fidelity was unalterable: at laſt, amidſt that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diſtraction which had beſet me, not being able to lay hold on any other ſupport but my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46063:20"/>
own reſolved conſtancy, the only pillar I could reſt my hopes on, I went to ſee her. But, O gods, what a change did I meet with from her; She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me as her Princes Son, not as her fond Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I found her in a temper of ſuch cold civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as made my blood turn even to Ice. This ſurprize and aſtoniſhment, inſtead of proving my true innocency, appeared to her diſtruſtful eyes, as if it had been the face of guiltineſs, which made her anger ſucceed in theſe harſh words, which ſhe utter'd in a diſcompoſed tone. Your viſage, <hi>Seniſra,</hi> betrayes your intentions, it's alteration and often ſhifted colour ſpeaks your perſidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor can your conſcience which writes its ſelf upon your changing Countenance, ſuffer your deluſions to be hid any longer, which to perſiſt in were a weakneſs unworthy of any ſlave, much leſs a Prince. But what then? I have been as highly preſumptuous in my eaſie faith, as you are reproveable for your hypocriſie: had I never conſidered you as my Lover, but beheld you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes as my Prince, I ſhould have no juſt cauſe to wonder, as I do now, in vain, that your heart can adore and pay the full tribute of affection and veneration to this ſtranger Princeſs; yet have I reaſon for complaint however, that you forſake <hi>Themira,</hi> after you have ſo ſolemnly engaged your faith to her; But this is ſome conſolation and retribution, that I can ſtrive to correſpond with you in every particular; and it ſhall ſuffice me, that you cannot but know, it is the noble heart and vertuous diſpoſition rather makes a Gentleman a Prince, then his Birth or empty Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46063:21"/>
whoſe blood if tainted, and whoſe ſpirit if degenerate, tumbles him beneath the meaneſt of his Subjects in the records of Fame and Honour. I would have anſwered her, but that cruell and unjuſt Lady ſtopt her car againſt all my ſpeeches, by which I might have wiped away the aſperſion of ingratitude ſhe ſtuck upon me; and then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly quitted me in a place, where I could neither conveniently follow her, nor be moan my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The Prince entertained me with this his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, when <hi>Balden</hi> his Father entred into his Chamber, and ſpake thus to me, well <hi>Merame,</hi> what preparations doe you make againſt <hi>Seniſra's</hi> wedding? you are ſad me-thinks, may it not be, that having a long time aſſociated with him, as his moſt faithful compagnion, and ſeeing him now provided of a Miſtris, and your ſelf without any, you mourn your ſolitary condition. But if ſo, or not, I doe not intend that you ſhould only be an idle aſſiſtant at the ceremony; but rather help to make up one of the ſweeteſt parts in the full har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of joy and pleaſure, Come follow me, he went forth as he ſpake theſe laſt words, and lead us to his wives Chamber, where catching me by one hand, and taking <hi>Geroſe</hi> the Daughter of his Favorite <hi>Hylebas</hi> by the other, I doe not believe ſaid he, that you have any objections to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my deſign, and your Parents conſent; The choice could not be more equal then by this match, nor can you, according to the opinion of every one; live happier then together: may the gods bleſs you with as much felicity as your hearts can wiſh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46063:21"/>Neither of us made any other reply, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found obeyſance, and I was very glad the many complements we received from thoſe that were preſent exempted me from thoſe I ſhould have been obliged to make in particular to <hi>Geroſe,</hi> on whom in common civility I was obliged to waite upon to her own lodging, where I quitted her coldly. Being returned to my own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and freed from the importunity of thoſe that did exalt and bleſs my good fortune, I ſhut my ſelf up within my Chamber; where, what I either thought or ſaid, during my firſt tranſports in that Melancholly Cell, were too tedious to relate. My reſolutions, in ſine, made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to give a cleer diſcovery of my paſſion to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> and profer her Marriage if ſhe could but conſent to love me, as I did her fair ſelf. I left my chamber with this intent to ſeek her out, and though the night were very much advanced, and moſt perſons retired to their repoſe, I deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into the Garden by a back way, and ſoftly ſtealing along the wall to a place cloſe by <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>'s chamber, whoſe windows gave them the full proſpect of a long alley. I there made a ſtand, hoping at leaſt to have the bleſſing of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer her perſon. What can you think, in fine, <hi>Sybaris</hi> if the effects of my paſſion? Though the night were muffled up in its thickeſt clouds, yet I pryed every where hoping to meet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſome ſmall beam of light, whereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her: and hearing a voice. I liſtned atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and underſtood it was her Mother, who was thus diſcourſing to her. I thought, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Fate had no more wayes left to afflict
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46063:22"/>
us; and that we were arrived at the laſt Stage of all our miſeries; But I perceive cruell Fortune is not yet glutted with our ſufferings. He that had declar'd himſelf thy Protector, is become thy enemy, and if he eſpouſe (as 'tis to be feared) the Fathers quarrel, with the daughters perſon, we muſt reſolve to periſh. Wherefore, replyed, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>? If you have been but as religiouſly ſecret as my ſelf, we have nothing to fear. Ah my deareſt Daughter, anſwer'd the Mother, thoſe two families being united together by that ſtrict alliance, thou canſt no longer hide a face, whoſe features, though truly innocent, are too too dangerous for thy ſafety. Mother reparted ſhe, we muſt commit all to the goodneſs of the deities, who have preſerved us hitherto. We muſt not pry into the book of deſtiny, the Characters are not legible to Mortals, and we find every day, that what befals us, is contrary to what we either feared or gueſſed. Let us live, in the mean time, in hope; and ſince our arms are too ſhort to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty this marriage knot, thoſe knots, its ſaid, being all made faſt in heaven, we will reſerve our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, if it muſt be ſo, till we ly under the Evil that ſhall fall on us. Her Mother, could not bar her tears from falling at this diſcourſe, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to embrace her, as I perceiv'd by a faint light, ſhe ſaid, Ah worthy Daughter, no, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that heaven has given thee ſuch a full ſtock of vertue and courage, to let thee continue long in this condition.</p>
                        <p>They ſaid ſomething more afterwards, but whiſpered it ſo ſoftly, it did not reach my eare
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46063:22"/>
perfectly: then ſuddenly after they were wholly ſilent. Yet I remained fix'd in the ſame place, with a moſt greedy attention till day break, and then fearing diſcovery I return'd to my Chamber: Being thrown upon my bed, I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their whole diſcourſe a thouſand times, without being able to comprehend or fathom the depth of it. What, ſaid I, ſhall I dare believe ſhe ſpoke of me? and may I flatter my ſelf with this vanity to have had the rareſt jewel of nature in my protection? No, no, theſe words were meant of ſome other, it being impoſſible but that I ſhould love her alwayes tenderly, ſo that if her Protector is become her Enemy, they cannot be addreſſed to me. Nevertheleſs, I am he, into whoſe fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate arms ſhe caſt her bleſſed ſelf at <hi>Coupava</hi>; and I am alſo commanded to marry <hi>Geroſe:</hi> But, what is that particular intereſt that makes her apprehend this alliance ſo much? Thus was I weather-beaten 'twixt theſe ſeveral troubleſome fears and doubts, when a ſoft ſlumber, cauſed by my over-long watching, and deep penſiveneſs, ſtole unawares upon me, and made a happy truce in my minde for ſome few hours.</p>
                        <p>'Tis, ſaid <hi>Sybaris,</hi> the only thing that is not an enemy to us, all nature elſe declares it ſelf againſt the unhappy lover, when ſleep as a courteous friend many times renders him contented with a pleaſing dream, which awake, the whole world denies him: But, alas! 'tis too imaginary and ſhort liv'd a joy, to recompence thoſe daily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
                        <p>It grew ſomewhat late, perſu'd <hi>Merame,</hi> and I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46063:23"/>
was yet bound faſt in the eaſie chains of ſleep, when my Father commanded ſome to call me, that I might prepare myſelf to receive <hi>Hylebus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Wife and Daughter whom he had invited to dinner. I had ſcarce the time to ſlip on my cloaths, when ſome of the company ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and the pretended Miſtreſs with them, whom I received with the greateſt civility and the leaſt affection imaginable. I was forc'd, however, to wear out that day in diſſimulation, nay, and many more beſides: whilſt the frequent bluſhes that invaded my cheeks, ſent thither from my heart as the Meſſengers of its trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, though imputed to my juvenile modeſty, opportunely concealed the indignation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain which a paler face would have told them, filled my breaſt againſt all Love for her.</p>
                        <p>Many dayes ſlipt thus away er'e I could have a happy tyde of opportunity to entertain <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> in particular; and I took notice that ſince <hi>Hylebas</hi> frequented our houſe, ſhe endeavoured to keep out of our preſence and Society. The impatience I was in to ſpeak with her, taught me to ſend her Mother word by a ſervant of whoſe fidelity I had many proofs, that I had ſomewhat to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to her; this Meſſage allarmed her, and brought her quickly to me, ſomewhat affrighted, where I waited for her, with a no leſs troubled ſpirit; but her aſtoniſhment grew above both our fears, when I enquired for what cauſe ſhe and her daughter were of late ſo cloſely confin'd, and ſeemed to be the only two in the whole Family, that expreſs'd no ſigns of joy for the hopes of my
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46063:23"/>
ſudden Marriage, with <hi>Geroſe</hi>? That, for my part, I would continue to be ſtill the ſame I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them to be; and if any diſcontent were the juſt cauſe of their retirement, I would engage to procure them all the ſatisfaction it was poſſible for me to make them. I had before decreed to break the ice altogether, and acquaint her further; but, then, had not the power to pronounce the bleſſed name of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> ſo that without any fuller diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, I left her, after ſhe had anſwered me, that they had received many favours in our houſe as great as numerous, and that if they had been ſo unhappy as not to attend for ſome dayes paſt, the ſervice of the Family, and their juſt devoirs, her Daughters indiſpoſition was the ſole and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable cauſe of it. I was vext that I had not abſolutely diſcloſed my intention, and fearing leaſt what I had told her, might redouble her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, as ſoon as ſhe had left me, I approached their window to hear what report ſhe would make to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> to whom ſhe ſadly ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Well, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> had I not reaſon to fear the ſiniſter adventure I conjectur'd, and couldſt thou think the gods would have indued thee with ſo much conſtancy, and generoſity, but that they knew thou ſhouldſt one day ſtand in need of it? <hi>Merame</hi> would never have ſpoken of his alliance with that Family, in ſuch a manner, if he had not known the certain reaſon why we evaded the fatal preſence of <hi>Hylebas</hi> ſo carefully. If Heavens indulgent goodneſs had but at leaſt preſerved <hi>Soixa,</hi> perhaps he might have found out ſome happy Stratagem, whereby to have releaſed us
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46063:24"/>
from this Captivity. 'Tis in vain, ſaid <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> to contend againſt Fortune, whatever doome the deities have pronounced is no leſs juſt the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable; we muſt ſubmit without reluctancy; and then we ſhall have this conſolation at the leaſt, that although our ſorrows like a ſtrong net entangles us on every ſide, without any hopes of releaſe, yet we doe ſuffer innocently. The event will declare the will of heaven more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſince there is no griefe ſo bitter, which the leaſt bleſſing from above cannot turne into joy and happineſs, let us not diſpaire, our woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſpirits may yet be cured? and for <hi>Merame</hi> I eſteeme him too brave and generous to lend a hand or heart to the unworthy deſigns of his Father in Law.</p>
                        <p>I would ſtay no longer there, but thought my ſelf ſufficiently inform'd wheron to ground a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler inquiry afterwards, and if I were hitherto very indifferent to <hi>Geroſe,</hi> this inſpired me with a mortall averſion for her, as being conſtrained to act the feigned part of a Lover towards her, who was the daughter of my <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria's</hi> capitall enemy. This neceſſity of diſſembling to her did ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe me, that I fell ſick of a moſt violent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Which kept me priſoner fifteen days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, during which time, the beſt meanes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my recovery, was the comfort of <hi>Geroſe's</hi> abſence, and the pleaſing remembrance of the beautiful <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> whoſe intereſts became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dear to me. One day as I walked in the Garden, under a pretence of taking the freſh ayr to perfect my dawning health, but indeed to

have the opportunity to ſpeak to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> and her Mother. I ſtept aſide, and ſtole into their Chamber, when there were none, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and finding them ſurpriz'd, doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my preſence ſaid I to them, you have a ſecond <hi>Soixa</hi> in my perſon, and I engage, out of a true affection only, to render you all the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he could poſſibly pay you: Let not the alliance with <hi>Hylebas</hi> diſturb you, if it oppoſe your intereſt, it does no leſs thwart my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if the unparralell'd <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> vouchſafe but to accept my faith and hearty ſervice, and doe no longer make the cauſe of her misfortunes a ſecret to me, I hope I ſhall not be uncapable to procure her happineſs.</p>
                        <p>They were both ſo ſurpriz'd with this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and requeſt, that they could not for the preſent contrive any anſwer, ſo that renewing my diſcourſe and courtſhip, Is it your diffidence, or wonder at the unexpected novelty of what I tell you, that makes you wrap up your mindes in ſilence? Ah <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> if you ſuſpect my ſentiments, doe but examine the heart that conceived them, it is in your poſſeſſion, and you ſhall evidently find it contains nothing but affection for you. The Mother would have caſt her ſelf down at my feet to have anſwer'd, but having prevented it, ſhe ſaid, we never doubted Sir, of your more then ordinary generoſity, we have already found the benefits of it, in many happy trialls, but you may be pleaſed not to wonder, if having falen already into ſo many unexpected ſnares, we feared that which menaced us ſo evidently.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46063:25"/>
And ſince you have ſo much curioſity and noble care, as to enquire the reaſons, I will reveale ſuch things which if made known to any other, but your worthy ſelf, might hazard our very lives: But I doe gladly find, that heaven has placed us under your protection, as the Tutelary Angel of a family broken and ruin'd by <hi>Hylebas,</hi> of whom, as I beleeve and have too many reaſons to fear, we are at preſent the only ſad remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> had the Prince of that great City for her Father, and I for my brother; If you have ever heard by what accident it fell under your Princes power, you may know, that the Army which beſeiged it was commanded by <hi>Hylebas,</hi> who for his private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and to revenge ſome corrections for his youthful inſolencies, engaged <hi>Balden</hi> in that war. He had formerly made a vovage into <hi>Perſia,</hi> to learn in their famous <hi>Academies</hi> thoſe vertues which he never put in practiſe. At his return, be made ſome ſtay in our City, where his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being known, he was very civilly treated in all companies, As then he was but young, and truly more compleat in garb and perſon then in judgment or wit; for manners obliging him to waite upon the Prince <hi>Dizman,</hi> and his wife <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> he inſtantly tranſgreſſed in that reſpect that was due to them both. As ſoon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held that Lady, whoſe rare perfections had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this general acknowledgment thorow all <hi>Aſia,</hi> that nature had never brought forth ſo great a miracle there, as ſhe was, he was inflamed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46063:25"/>
her, but with ſo impure a heat, as that glorious Planet had never produc'd in any ſoul, but his. For the Majeſty of her adored face, had ever imprinted and inſpir'd as much reſpect and veneration as love: only the heart of <hi>Hylebas</hi> was ſuſceptible of that unlawful wild-fire; and he brute man, had ſo much preſumption, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve what ever he undertook in that deſign would proſper as he wiſht it. This made him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide there longer then he intended, during which time, he diſplaid all his wit and gallantry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which nevertheleſs was no better received or eſteemed then at the higheſt rate of pride and folly. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, in the end, that his confidence had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded him, and that <hi>Meyrem</hi> had ſo ſevere a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as would not ſtoop or give indeed the leaſt audience, to his deſires and paſſion; to attain his pernicious deſign, he reſolved to take in the aſſiſtance of inchantments to allure or quell that vertuous Lady's heart, as full of honour as his was of luſt.</p>
                        <p>As there are many in that Country who make a particular profeſſion of Magick, it was eaſy for him to come to the knowledge of an old woman, who was reputed to be very skilful in that Art; to whom he diſcover'd his black ſoul, that ſhe might the better ſuit her black experiments to it: and that ſorcereſs having, in fine, promis'd him the effecting of what he ſo greedily deſired, by her witchcraft, he thought to ſeal up her lips with a gold ſignet which he beſtow'd upon her: but his profuſion by which he thought to conceal his plot, was that which brought it firſt to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46063:26"/>
For this old covetous witch imagined, that if ſo much were given to hide a ſecret, others would be as liberal if ſhe reveal'd it: and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with her ſelf, that what ſhe had already in poſſeſſion was her own and could not be retir'd, it would be both more ſafe and profitable now to gain a new Fee by detecting him, and ſaving her ſelf from danger, into which poſſibly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what ſhe had then undertaken might let her fall. She haſtned therefore to a publick Magiſtrate of the City, and informed him that a ſtranger of quality had been to ſolicite her to contrive a miſchief as much beyond her power as well to perpetrate; but becauſe he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably addreſs himſelf to ſome other more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and leſs honeſt to bewitch or charme <hi>Mey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi> to love him as he deſired; her tender heart had moved her to give him this honeſt advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſo he might acquaint <hi>Diſman</hi> and prevent <hi>Hylebas.</hi> The interrogatories they more particularly put to this woman, ſoon brought the whole myſtery of iniquity to light; but the buſineſs being tetchy, and his condition too lofty to proſecute him the ordinary way for ſuch diſcoveries: They judged it more politique to lay hold of that woman, then to charge it upon him, whereby he finding his deſign diſcloſed, might of himſelf quit the Town, fearing the juſt reſentments it might awake againſt him. All ſucceeded as they had judiciouſly conjectured; he left the City, but did not give over his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy project. At that time he made war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Scyth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

was general, to which high command himſelf ſucceeded. Your Enemies, who were already advanced far into our Country, taking their advantage pillaged us moſt ſtrangely. We made our juſt complaints, but for ſatisfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning us no other anſwer but this only, that our neutrality was ſuſpitious to them, and that they would ſtill treat us as Enemies, unleſs we would openly declare our ſelves; This violence quickly obliged us to take up Arms, but it was to ſide with yours; and our Forces being thus united decreaſed the Enemies much, ſo that for four years ſucceſſively, we counter ballanced that conqueſt which manifeſtly inclined to their ſide before.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Martial employments how ever, did not take <hi>Hylebas</hi> off from the thoughts of attaining his impure deſires. He attempted to ſteal away <hi>Meyrem</hi> by the aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>Scythians</hi> whom he had hired to that end, becauſe it might not be ſuſpected he was the Author of ſo unhandſome an enterprize; but ſhe being ever attended with a numerous Guard, all thoſe Setters forfeited either their lives or liberties in the attaque; and one Officer of the Crew, hoping thereby to obtain his freedom, confeſſed they were ſet on by <hi>Hyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and had acted nothing but by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order. <hi>Dizman</hi> was preſently made acquainted of it, who had already found much backwardneſs and diſcontent amongſt his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Though he had much ado to quell and keep in his indignation, yet he would not pull off the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of diſſimulation till he heard you had a clandeſtine Treaty on Foot with the <hi>Scythians,</hi> then he thought it tameneſs to bridle it any longer; wherefore waiting with <hi>Hylebas</hi> to confer about their Warlike affairs, he complained that his good affection was very ill requited; that they ought not to treat their aſſociates as if they were Stipendaries, but that all ſhould ſhare equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as well in the benefits of Treaties and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as in the Troubles and Dangers they had participated largely in: <hi>Hylebas,</hi> anſwered him very coldly, that having never done nor treated any thing, but what he was a Witneſs of, he could not but wonder at this diſcourſe. Nevertheleſs, reply'd <hi>Dizman,</hi> you cannot hinder the change in your countenance from witneſſing againſt you, nor had I voted in the deſign of ſurprizing <hi>Mey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> to which purpoſe you employ'd the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> This made <hi>Hylebas</hi> bluſh yet more, how ever with a quaint expreſſion he reply'd, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what you mean: you ſhould do well to be aſſured of ſuch things before you give any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to them: if you ſpeak with more truth, you would allow it more ingennity and plainneſs. Say what you pleaſe, return'd <hi>Dizman,</hi> but I have ſpoken no Enigmaes but what you may unfold; nor can you deny the verity of theſe reproaches without a manifeſt falſhood, which this ſhall vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate when we meet in a place convenient to diſpute our intereſt, ſaid he, ſhewing his Sword. Thoſe that were preſent could not prevent this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46063:27"/>
diſorder, though they calm'd their ſwelling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from flying higher for a time. Two dayes after, the Generals quarrel had interreſſed the Souldiers, and that put them into diſſentions. This diſſention provoked them to words, and theſe injurious words begot blows. The Officers haſtned to appeaſe the tumult, but <hi>Hylebas,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf well accompanied, inſtead of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the broil, charged ours ſo furiouſly that they were fain to give ground, till <hi>Dizman</hi> put them forward by his preſence and example: whoſe courage and heat did ſo quell your men, that they had much ado by their retreat to ſave themſelves, or their General <hi>Hylebas,</hi> who received many wounds from our Princes own hands This affront out deeper than his Sword, and therefore diſpatching a Meſſenger to <hi>Balden,</hi> he ſo diſguiſed the whole action, that we were charged with all the guilt and blame, as the ſole Authors of this mutiny: and your General received expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to conclude a Peace with the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and by their aſſiſtance to take a full revenge upon us. <hi>Dizman,</hi> who well foreſaw what would befall, had cauſed our Army to retire, and gave ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for freſh Levies, to be in the better poſture to receive his Enemies. But before he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what was fit, <hi>Hylebas</hi> marched with his Army, and the aſſiſtance of three thouſand <hi>Scythians,</hi> and laid cloſe ſiege to <hi>Sina.</hi> Though we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided, yet he loſt much time, pains and men, and nothing but his treachery had ſucceſs. The Daughter of that old Hag, whom he would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while have employ'd to enchant <hi>Meyrem,</hi> was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46063:28"/>
then ſo beſotted with love of <hi>Hylebas,</hi> that her paſſion and ignorance made her imagine, his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Meyrem</hi> was the only obſtacle that did hinder his return of love to her again, ſo that ſhe beheld that Princeſs as her rival only. When ſhe ſaw <hi>Hylebas</hi> ſo near the City, her deſires grew hotter at that her amorous Planets approach, and her hatred became ſo violent againſt <hi>Meyrem,</hi> that ſhe had the confidence to undertake the delivery of the Garriſon into his hands, upon condition he would ſatisfie her wiſhes, which ſhe preſumed ſhe partly deſerved long before, but much more if ſhe atchieved that exploir.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hylebas,</hi> who had often felt the fury of our allies, was very eager to redeem his bleeding honour at ſo eaſie a rate, and therefore willingly promis'd all that her longing heart could prompt her to demand of him. The Gold Signet her Mother had received of him, and the addition of wealth beſtow'd by <hi>Dizman</hi> for their diſcovery, had ſo well furniſhed her, that ſhe was married to the Officer who kept the keyes of the City Gates. Whoſe priviledge did much facilitate the means her paſſion had ſuggeſted to her, to let in ſome of the Enemies Troops into the City.</p>
                        <p>Though ſhe were married, yet was ſhe very amorouſly perſecuted by a young man, whom ſhe began to ſooth with hopes, and in ſhort to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him what he ſued for if he at an appointed time, could but find the means to caſt her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band into a ſound ſleep, which ſince the ſiege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan he ſeldome gave way to. Love, as you may take ſome notice of, would be the only fatal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46063:28"/>
of our ruine. This fellow immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a ſtrong ſomniferous draught, which ſhe firſt made trial of on ſome other, and being now provided, ſhe ſent word to <hi>Hylebas</hi> that ſhe expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him punctually at midnight, at the Eaſt Gate, which he ſhould find open and no Guards to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him.</p>
                        <p>At night to make her promiſed treachery good, ſhe mixed ſome of that potion in her Husbands drink at his ſupper, and was as careful to beſtow ſome of it on the Souldiers which had that Port that night: and at the time appointed ſhe waited at the place aſſigned whilſt the whole Guard were in a profound ſleep. <hi>Hylebas</hi> failed not to ſend a party firſt to make ſure of the Gate, which being poſſeſſed and he advertiz'd of it, he advanced with ſpeed commanding his Troops to follow with the ſtrickteſt ſilence imaginable: and being enter'd the Town by this wile, he gave orders to put every one to the ſword that ſhould make the leaſt oppoſition.</p>
                        <p>The Inhabitants and Souldiers were ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the terrible alarm, that ſeeing no body make head, he eaſily marched directly towards the Palace, whither Love, Hatred and Revenge, led him with fury and precipitation.</p>
                        <p>Imagine a Troop of enraged Wolves, that had ſtrangled the drowzy dogs ſet to guard a flock, ruſhing into the ſold, where thoſe timerous, but innocent creatures, thought themſelves as ſafe, as they were ſtrongly guarded: ſuch was the poor Peoples confuſion, the Souldiers diſorder, and the Princes amazement, who nevertheleſs cauſed

the by ſtreets to be inſtantly chained and barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado'd, but to no end, the multitude that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd towards his Palace as their laſt refuge and Sanctuary, broke them ſoon down again, and left the way open for his men to draw up in a great place which faced it. There <hi>Hylebas</hi> began to cry out Victory, and that his blackeſt actions might be apparent, though Heaven had hid its ſelf with the thickeſt curtains of Clouds; that ignoble Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, cauſed the contiguous buildings to be fired, that the obſcurity of the night might not hide from him the objects of his vengeance. <hi>Diz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> finding the loſs of the City was inevitable, and willing at leaſt to ſave what was deareſt to him in the world, ran to <hi>Meyrems</hi> Chamber which looked towards the Sea, where but a few dayes before, ſhe was delivered of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring her to embarque her ſelf immediately in a Ship which lay at Anchor juſt before them, he promis'd to follow her immediately. That ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Lady, anſwered him, no otherwiſe, but that whatever ſhe did, ſhe neither would fly or ſave her ſelf but with him: and if he muſt dye, ſhe would as chearfully dye, as ſhe had lived with him: that ſhe would not complain of her own Fate how ſevere ſoever, provided her children were but ſafe; and haſtily putting <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> into my hands, with a ſhower of flowing tears, and her ſon <hi>Zarif,</hi> a child of two years old, into her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, go, ſaid ſhe, to us, embracing us with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs mixt with courage, and ſo much love as cannot have its full expreſſion, ſave theſe dear and innocent creatures at leaſt; and would to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46063:29"/>
Heaven this might not be the laſt of our adieu's! The noiſe of thoſe that enter'd pell-mell into the Chamber unty'd thoſe ſad embraces, and drove us down a pair of ſecret ſtairs to the Ship which received us. <hi>Meyrem,</hi> as I have been ſince inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithſtanding her weakneſs and indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſguiſing her Sex, armed her ſelf that ſhe might go and relieve her Husband, who expired before her face, pierc'd with a thouſand wounds.</p>
                        <p>That woful object which had doubtleſs been able to blunt the higheſt courage, did but whet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hers, grown indeed leſs vigorous by ſome blood exhauſted from her, precious veins, ſo that hearing <hi>Hylebas,</hi> who had diſcovered her give command to take her alive, ſhe forced her way thorow thoſe that were about him, who in obedience to the command their General had given them, fearing to kill her, hindred her not from joyning him; and ruſhing upon him with the like fury as a Lyoneſs would do on him who had rob'd her of her whelps: Traytor, ſaid ſhe, ſtriking at him, doſt thou command them to ſave my life, that I may take my juſt and full revenge on thee; know at leaſt, that though I cannot redeem my Husband from death, yet I can dye with honour for his ſake: two full blows ſhe diſcharged upon him, which made him ſtagger, and diſpenc'd his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from longer obedience, who preſently flew on her in multitudes, yet could they not hinder her from making way till ſhe came to her dear Husbands dead Corps, on which ſhe made a ſad ſhift to caſt her ſelf and die.</p>
                        <p>We being now in formed by certain other ſmall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46063:30"/>
Barks, that we were cloſely perſued, and that to glut his rage, the bloody <hi>Hylebas</hi> had given ſtrickt orders being come again to himſelf, that we ſhould be ſought for every where with diligence, thought it ſafeſt to go on ſhoar at the firſt place we could make land, which we did changing our habits, and ſuddenly parting from each others, that we might not be taken altogether, in caſe they ſhould hear of us. But as the decree of Fate is inevitable, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> and my ſelf fell into the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ſome who were ranging about the Coaſts for a prey; and we were afterwards ſold to the Keeper of <hi>Coupava,</hi> whilſt my Husband, who had more ſtrength and agility, ſaved himſelf in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wood near hand with <hi>Zarif,</hi> whither they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe follow'd him, but how they fared I never ſince could have the leaſt tydings.</p>
                        <p>And this, Sir, is the ſad hiſtory of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; the remainder of our diſconſolate lives is not unknown to you, and we are now more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in your goodneſs and eſteem, then our beſt hopes could ever fairly promiſe, ſince after ſo long a ſilent and mournful Captivity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, you have unpinion'd our reſtraint and given us leave to breath our ſorrows by lending ſo curteous an ear to this doleful relation.</p>
                        <p>This ſtory mov'd my very ſoul to compaſſion, but I was yet more tranſported by thoſe tears the faireſt <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> let fall, whilſt her Aunt made the relation of it. Nor could I keep mine from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſon, before I had expreſt my ſelf thus to her: Ah! Madam, what cauſe have I given you to cheriſh ſo ill an opinion of my perſon; why did
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46063:30"/>
you not ſooner make me acquainted with your ſufferings, ſince you could not be ignorant how much I might have lightned the too too heavy chains of your Captivity. Can it be poſſible you ſhould not have perceived the vehement heat of my love for you? though I have kept it ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lock and key of a timerous ſilence; yet my flame having been as bright as chaſte and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet, might well have been gueſs'd by you: and ſince you knew that I have acted nothing for <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> which any indifferent Judge would not have conſtrued more an effect of paſſion and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then common charity, why have you made your fear or ſcorn the cauſe of your own ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and thoſe torments my own reſtraint has put upon me? But I ſhould never mention my own troubles, did I not lye under the guilt of having left her, who was the bleſſing of my heart, ſo long under Captivity in my own Fathers houſe: and then, perfidious <hi>Hylebas,</hi> do not believe, thou haſt ſcaped the juſtice of the gods, Heaven has defer'd its puniſhments only to make it fall the heavier on thee, for though Divine Juſtice comes but ſlow, yet it comes ſure, and I believe and hope that I am choſen the juſt Miniſter of it, which I ſhall inflict with ſo much the more ſecurity, as the intereſts of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> are dearer to me than thy <hi>Geroſe.</hi> It depends but upon you my Princeſs, ſaid I, addreſſing my ſelf to her, to allow of it; and if you will not command me to execute it, for my own reſpects, yet let me do it for juſtice and your illuſtrious Parents ſakes: a deep ſigh, which ſhe fetch'd from her heart, as the Prologue
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46063:31"/>
to her following diſcourſe, impoſed a willing ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on my tongue, whilſt ſhe ſpake thus. <hi>Merame</hi> your promiſing goodneſs, which perſwaded my Aunt, to tell you the ſad tale of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, does likewiſe encourage me to accept of thoſe fair proffers you have made to me: I ſhall not therefore demur, but accept of them in the beſt manner my unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition admits of now, I meane, rather under the notion of protection then of ſervice. And yet, reply'd I, if you would but conſider your preſent condition in relation to me, you will ſoon find it ſpeakes you miſtreſs and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of my ſoul; but perhaps, you find it an unhappineſs, that perſons of more power and greater quality then my meanneſs are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſerve you. Not ſo, anſwer'd ſhe, for beſides that I am too well acquainted with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and my own abaſement to harbor ſo unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil an inmate as pride, ſo I have already received too great a ſum of obligations from your boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be ſo ingrateful; and I aſſure you, that if I cannot make you a full retribution for your favours, you muſt impute it more to my want of Fortune, then good will.</p>
                        <p>This happy declaration and condeſcention to love was concluded with as much ſatisfaction as I had ambition or love; and I took a reſolution to ſearch out ſome confiding friend, who might ranſome this illuſtrious Captive out of her thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Her confinement infinitely troubled me, yet was I forced to defer it a while and cloak my griefs. During this reſtraint, all the happineſs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46063:31"/>
I could reap, was to entertain her daily with my reiterated vowes and promiſes, and this ſomewhat abated the diſpleaſure I ſuffer'd in the neceſſity of ſeeing <hi>Geroſe,</hi> towards whom ſhe enjoyned me, not to expreſs any averſion, nor could I afford her any ſillable of pretended affection.</p>
                        <p>In fine, the Age of winter being much increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I underſtood of the preparations were make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive the Princeſs of <hi>Sogdiana,</hi> whom <hi>Balden</hi> was to ſend for by extraordinary Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. I intreated her to let me caſt about for ſome meanes whereby to free myſelf from <hi>Geroſe,</hi> whom I was already bid to look upon, as her, that was to be my wife, within the ſhort date of two months. The buſineſs preſs'd us equally, and this urgent neceſſity made me ſoon vote the reſolution to declare myſelf openly an Enemy to <hi>Hylebas,</hi> thereby to unty the chain of Marriage and alliance with his daughter. He had a Son name <hi>Zadarem,</hi> in whoſe company I was to goe to meet the now young Princeſs: His humour was as little pleaſing as his Fathers, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meer timpany of Pride; he had few friends at Court, as being one whoſe favour any man would have eſteemed too dearly purchaſt at the cheap price of a complement: yet thought himſelf too eminent to be ſo familiar as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in quality of friends or aſſociates. He had been otherwiſe extravagantly amourous of <hi>Themira,</hi> and becauſe ſhe had treated him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the merits he fancied in himſelf, his angry love was turned into hate, which made him take occaſion to disoblige and affront her all he could.</p>

                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:46063:32"/>Whilſt <hi>Seniſra</hi> ſtood fair with <hi>Themira,</hi> the leaſt concern'd had taken notice by thoſe aſſiduous addreſſes he made to her, that he took a more then ordinary delight in entertaining her; but his deſcreet behaviour rather made them gueſs then certainly know his purpoſe and deſires; Only <hi>Zadarem,</hi> who lookt upon't thorow the Perſpective of love and jealouſy, had more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſcried his mind; and led on by his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he wrought ſo far by his impoſtures upon <hi>Themira's</hi> ſpirit, that ſhe at laſt was poſſeſſed with the belief of her Princes infidelity, as you have already underſtood: and he likewiſe had infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Balden</hi> that the inclination his ſon had to <hi>Themira,</hi> was the only cauſe he expreſt ſo little joy and willingneſs to have the Princely virgin. <hi>Balden</hi> having exactly informed himſelf in this particular of ſo grand concernment, had prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <hi>Seniſra</hi> upon the penalty of his ſevereſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure not to ſee <hi>Themira</hi> any more, whom he alſo expreſly commanded to confine her ſelf to her country habitation, to which her own troubled fancy had already cauſed her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate.</p>
                        <p>The time being come, that we were to goe fetch the <hi>Sogdian</hi> Princeſs, I went to take leave of <hi>Seniſra,</hi> and then communicated the plot I had laid to ſpring up ſome occaſion of conteſt with <hi>Zadarem,</hi> whoſe ill contrived behaviour promis'd me ſubject enough. He condiſcended, in fine, to let me lay hold of fortunes foreſtep to free my ſelf from my <hi>Geroſe,</hi> and aſſured me of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his protection and power on al occaſions,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46063:32"/>
or accidents, and withall to give order in my abſence for my <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nerias</hi> liberty, which he ſoon after nobly procured. No ſooner were we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>Sogdiana,</hi> and had paid our civility to the Princeſs, who was indeed rich both in beauty and vertue, but <hi>Zadarem</hi> began amongſt the praiſes he ſhowred upon her, to let fall ſome drops of Mediſance and ſlander upon <hi>Themira's</hi> reputation: he went every where proclaiming that the Prince needed not ſo much regret her loſs, ſince the chaſter flames this worthy Lady might kindle in his heart, could not but extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh thoſe lighter fancies and careſſes of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris. This malice was ſo apparent that every one reſſented it as very ſcandalous, there was not any in our company that was not well acquainted with the fair <hi>Themira's</hi> unſoyl'd vertue, and had valour and will enough to aſſert it; but they all flung their looks on me, who am allyed to her, expecting I ſhould ty up his inſolent tongue from beſpattering her with ſuch abuſes. One day after I had mildly reproved him, he had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to ask me, whether the Prince had ſo far loved me, as to let me ſhare with him in that gentle fortune, ſince I took upon me to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him; and if ſo, that he had yet ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion left in ſtock, as not to wake his ſiſters jealouſy with the report of it; and when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that I had no farther intereſt in her, but only what every Gentleman would be oblig'd to for his kindred, to preſerve their reputation, which therefore engaged me not to hear a perſon of her high worth ſo unhandſomely calumniated;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46063:33"/>
he promis'd me, but in a kind of raillery, that ſince it concerned me ſo neerly, he would be very careful hereafter not to let fly any thing that might call up my anger: which nevertheleſs he did not obſerve; He could not reſtrain his itching tongue from publiſhing a hundred wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Tales, and noiſed the reſſentment I had ſhown, which I was forc'd to pocket up till we were returned into <hi>Margiana,</hi> as unwilling to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that reſpect we owe to ſtranger Countries.</p>
                        <p>The ſame day we had paſſed the confines of <hi>Sogdiana,</hi> about the evening I accoſted him, and having led him to a private place, where I before had ſent a gentleman with two weapons, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to make choice of one, and I would take the other. The unexpectancy aſtoniſht him more then the danger of the combat; but as he was truly valiant, after the preparation of a few words, we proceeded to blowes; he defended himſelf with as much skill and courage as I aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; I received and gave ſeveral wounds, but, in fine, juſtice being in my armour, I gain'd his ſword with this advantage of being able to goe off my ſelf, whereas he lay extended with ſmall hopes of life, which made me ſend to his ſervants to goe and fetch him thence.</p>
                        <p>In the interim, to ſecure my ſelf, I poſted back from whence we came that day, and ſecured my ſelf in a Caſtle belonging to a <hi>Sogdian</hi> gentleman, whoſe friendſhip I had purchaſed by ſome civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in his Princes Court. The news of this duell which brought aſtoniſhment to every one that heard it, cut deeper in my parents minds then

any accident that ere befel them, they having promiſed themſelves the beſt of fortunes in my alliance with <hi>Hylebas</hi>: whereas now <hi>Balden</hi> having examined the ground of our quarrel, vow'd he would ſatisfy the juſt reſſentments of his favorite by our utter ruine. I ſecretly made <hi>Seniſra</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the place of my retreate, and the ſame moment wrot a letter to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> by which I conjured her to bleſs me with her preſence at an appointed place, within ten dayes time, that ſo my troubles might not be without ſome allay of hope and conſolation; and that from thence we would goe to <hi>Bactriand</hi>: But becauſe I was to goe thorow a part of <hi>Baldens</hi> Territories to reach this place, I ſhrowded my ſelf in a diſguize ſo ſtrange, that I blinded all ſuſpition and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Being at the exact time moſt proſperouſly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I lighted on a perſon whom ſhe had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give me notice that ſhe was repoſing her ſelf in a place but very little diſtant thence, where ſhe had borrow'd the benefit of a friendly ſhade, till the exceſſive heat of the day were waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and being big with impatience to reach thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I haſtned to horſe and in my deſires flew ſwiftly towards the place.</p>
                        <p>What think you now, <hi>Sybaris,</hi> of this meeting? doe you not preſume I muſt be very happy in it? yet ô gods, how are you miſtaken? if you gueſs ſo, you wander in a miſtake; and miſs the truth, as much as I did my hopes; I was ſoon alighted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and approached her with a becoming ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and ſhe advanced to receive me in her bleſſed arms; when the ſtrangeſt accident imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46063:34"/>
ſnatch'd her away, before I had the time to be let into her imbraces! a Troop of villains iſſuing out of a neighbouring wood, greedily ceazed on thoſe were neereſt to them: <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> was the firſt prey they lighted on, and her they hurried away before my eyes. Pardon me <hi>Sybaris,</hi> that I cannot keep in theſe unruly ſighes which interrupt my diſcourſe. The ſad, yet ſweet remembrance of that fatal enterview does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſting my ſoul by the remembrance of it now, as it did when it happened. The tranſport I was in, wing'd me with haſt and fury after thoſe wilde raviſhers, with my drawn ſword, but being then on foot, they galloped into the thickeſt of the wood, which ſoon ſheltred them from my longing eyes. I ran amazedly ſometimes one way, then another, according as their doleful cries directed me, often hearing my dear diſtreſſed <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore and ſummon her <hi>Merame</hi> for aſſiſtance. That voyce haſtned my pace, but ſoon after, when the greater diſtance had loſt her to my Ear, as well as Eye, my breath and ſtrength took flight after her, and left me to fall under my own weight: where I lay without motion, till the noiſe of ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which paſs'd by, having rowz'd me, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived turning my head that way, that one of thoſe fellows fled with a woman in his armes, whom I diſcerned to be <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nerias</hi> Aunt: He paſſing back again neer the place, where I was unſeen by him, I caught his horſes bridle, and at the ſame inſtant gave him ſo full a blow with my ſword, that he ſoon tumbled off with the woman, whom I was ſtriving to convey away in the wood to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46063:34"/>
her from the reſt: when they came ruſhing ſo ſuddenly upon me, I was fain to leave her to provide for my own ſafety. I made all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance a deſperate man could levy, but was at laſt preſs'd down under their numbers. I fell betwixt their horſes feet ſo full of wounds, they thought that to take me up, was but to burthen themſelves with a dead carkaſs: ſo they only took away <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nerias</hi> Aunt, whoſe fear and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had kept her in a continual fainting. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the effuſion of ſo much blood as I loſt ſo enfeebled me, that the cryes and languiſhing lookes I endeavoured to ſend after them, were ſoon wrapt up in a deadly ſwoon together with the reſt of my ſences. Some of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nerias,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who by a generous reſiſtance had ſaved themſelves out of their hands, entring the wood to ſeek more unhappineſs then they deſired to find, lighted on me in a condition that promiſed but little hopes of life. How-ever, they bound up my wounds to ſtanch the ſtreames of blood, and took me up to carry me to the Citty, and as they feared, to my grave at once. Whilſt they were going, the agitation having a little reviv'd my ſpirits, I ſent forth a ſigh, which faintly told them there was yet ſome remainder of life dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in me, but no more, then to ſhew I was ſtill dying. In this beleef, as ſoon as they entred the Citty, they took councel about my interment, and endeavour'd no longer to conceal whom I was. The Governor heard by their publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets that 'twas <hi>Merame</hi> they mourned for, and preſently diſpatch'd away a Meſſenger to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46063:35"/>
                           <hi>Balden</hi> of it, who after the death of <hi>Zadarom</hi> had given orders to all the Frontire Garriſons to ceaze me.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt thoſe whoſe curioſity had invited them to ſee me, there hapned to come a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chyrurgeon that had formerly been my Fathers houſhold ſervant: This man deſired leave to ſearch my wounds, and not finding any of them mortal, judged that it was only the loſs of ſo much blood at once, had brought me to ſo feeble a condition; wherefore finding ſome ſparks of life and warmth ſtill in me, he aſſay'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive me by ſome potent Cordials, which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd unhappily for me, ſince his conjecture had not deceived him. He felt my heart begin to beat a little, and ſome ſmall dawning appearances in my face, which made him proceed to ſuch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applications as reſtored me once more to my ſences. The firſt apparent ſign I gave them, was a languiſhing look, which I ſent as my only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt Meſſenger to ſeek for <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>; and that was ſeconded by my tongue which at its firſt motion call'd upon her Name: but when I had gather'd a little more ſtrength and found my ſelf in that condition amidſt ſo many ſtrangers, and began to remember how I had loſt her. Oh gods, cry'd I, can I be yet alive, and ſhe that is my ſoul be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from me? Then turning my eyes on thoſe were helping to dreſs my wounds, who deſired me to be quiet, Friends ſaid I, you are more cruel than thoſe Villains that hurt me, it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reaſon they would have ſlain me, after they had deprived me of her for whom only I

                        <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe requeſts and moans, their care and remedy's brought me by ſoft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to ſtrength again; When finding I muſt live, I reſolv'd to bend all my endeavours to a reſearch of the loſt <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>: and was already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the way to ſet about it, when all my hopes were again ſnatched from me. <hi>Hylebas</hi> had ſome correſpondants in this City, who gave him notice of my begun recovery; and that Traytor, whom I may juſtly ſtile the plague of my life, did immediately renew the Governours Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to lay hold of me, who came himſelf, and ſhew'd it me ſign'd under <hi>Baldens</hi> own hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing himſelf that his office obliged him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Commiſſion, contrary to thoſe real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires he had to do me ſervice.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as they thought me healthy enough to undergo the fatigue of a journey, they conducted me with a Troop of Horſe to <hi>Bacheher,</hi> where I was thruſt into a Tower, in which they ordinarily kept their priſoners of quality. My Father and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46063:36"/>
Mother with my neareſt relations had once the liberty to come and viſit me: <hi>Seniſra,</hi> who was now married to the Princeſs I formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not obtain it, and what ever endeavours he made to procure my pardon, they could not bow the angry <hi>Balden</hi> to pitty; who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding had not declar'd how he would deal with me, but whoſe concealed fury, ſhook my friends hearts with fear, having indeed ſome more then ordinary reaſon to fear that clap of thunder, which ſo long threatned to break forth againſt me, yet kept its lightning ſtill cover'd with a Cloud.</p>
                        <p>During the afflictions of my impriſonment, ſometimes the lively remembrance of my beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> invaded my melancholly thoughts and gave them cauſe to make me rejoyce; but when from her bright face, I let fall my thoughts on her black deſtiny, turning the other ſide of the leaf to read our misfortunes, my ſorrow ſwell'd above the power of comforts to allay, and then my ſighs and tears were too abundant to be expreſt in words. What ſhall I ſay more, <hi>Sybaris,</hi> when as if there had yet wanted one weight of ſorrow more to ſink me to the bottom of miſery and diſpair; One of thoſe that were taken with her, having made his eſcape came into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Priſon, to tell me ſuch ſad tydings as utterly extinguiſhed the leaſt glimpſe of hope I had yet remaining in me. He aſſured me, that thoſe Thieves had found <hi>

                           </gap>eſign, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo piercing a ſorrow, that it converted into an accute Feaver, which quickly cauſed her death, for whom the <hi>Scythians</hi> had ſo much eſteem and veneration, that to expreſs their regrets for her loſs, they had erected a very ſtately Monument for her, which he had often ſeen and lamented over.</p>
                        <p>The recital of this funeſt adventure, ſtruck me into the deepeſt ſilence poſſible for a long while: It ceaz'd upon my reaſon too, and made me ſo much looſe the helm of judgement, I was like to run and Shipwrack upon diſpair: ſo that I ſought for ſome weapon, wherewith to put a period to that heap of miſeries, which I could bear no longer on my tortur'd boſome: But finding that means was deny'd me, I had recourſe to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: Ha! what ſaid I, does <hi>Balden</hi> withhold the execution of his vengeance only to make me linger in my miſeries? Is his cruelty become ſo witty, to make me taſte a thouſand deaths for one? muſt I yet live upon this wrack of torments, and not be allow'd the mercy of a ſudden death? Cruel and inexorable Butcher, you have now found out the way of full revenge indeed, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering me ſtill to live in a condition that has more of horrour than many deaths could frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me withal; and thou, bleſt ſoul, do not thou charge me with backwardneſs and want of Love and courage; thou ſeeſt I ſearch out all the wayes I can to follow thy too haſty flight: and ſince I
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46063:37"/>
am yet bound under the ſad neceſſity of ſtaying longer than my ſoul deſires, comfort me with thy bleſſed ſpirit, that I may not be left thus ſtill alone with thoſe wild thoughts: and here again my griefs came flowing in ſo faſt, they quite choakt up the paſſage of my ſpeech: I was thus a long time mute, and that Gentleman taking at laſt his farewell, left me rather in the poſſeſſion of my ſorrows than my reaſon.</p>
                        <p>A few dayes after <hi>Seniſra</hi> ſent a Gentleman to comfort me, whom I intreated to tell the Prince, that the only favour he could procure me, would be, not to follicite any longer for my pardon, but to joyn his purſutes with thoſe of my Enemies to haſten my end; and that, as this was the laſt, ſo it would be the greateſt favour I could implore, and the moſt welcome honour his mediation could confer upon ſo miſerable a perſon.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to the prayer of this Petition, that Generous Prince, fearing ſome ſiniſter accident from this diſpair, beg'd of his Father ſo earneſtly, that he obtain'd permiſſion to give me a viſit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He found me in a poſture which begot as much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as compaſſion in him. My Chamber was very obſcure, having only the faint light of one little window which I had half vail'd over with a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I was thrown on my bed, my arms croſſing my breaſt, my eyes fixt upwards and ſo weather-beaten with the ſtorms of tears that bubbled from thoſe ſprings, and my viſage ſo melancholly, wan and diſcompoſed from its natural dreſs, that he might well miſtake me, as he did, and think his feet had led him unawares, into ſome doleful
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46063:37"/>
Cell, where only grief and mourning kept their diſconſolate Court; my thoughts had buried my mind in ſuch a deep ſence of my Calamities, that I did not perceive when he entred into the Chamber, ſo that he came cloſe to me without diſcovery; and after he had gaz'd ſome time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, I turn'd my head that way, and look'd upon him with an eye ſo full of trouble, that he believed it furious. Being firſt amazed to behold me in ſo woful a condition, and perceiving me immoveable, his pitty made him firſt ſalute, then call upon me, when finding I made no reply, he proceeded thus to rowze me by a gentle check, Is it thus <hi>Merame,</hi> you mean to receive and ſlight the viſit of <hi>Seniſra,</hi> and is it ſo importunate as to deſerve this ſilence and theſe forbidding looks? theſe words brought him to my knowledge, and ſtriving to ſalute him, I hardly had the ſtrength to ſhew it, by a little inclining of my head: which I follow'd with theſe languiſhing accents, Noble <hi>Seniſra,</hi> the infinite ſorrows that overwhelm me, are the cauſe of my incivility: but what Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies can you expect from a man equally in diſpair of life and death, who during the violent agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this perpetual agony does neither live nor dye? a combat ſo much the more cruel, becauſe it continues ſo long in one poor heart, and does not yet quite burſt it. Gods! how mercileſs are your decrees againſt me; why ſhould you thus delight to oppoſe all my happineſs, and will not ſend death, after you have curſt my life, and blaſted all my juſt deſigns, which how unhappily they have ſucceeded you can judge: I drew <hi>

from my Mothers houſe with the fond hopes of delivering her from a Captivity, which was more advantagious, then that liberty afterwards prov'd to be: If I juſtly revenge her injuries on the deſtroyers of her worthy Family, and her own ſweet repoſe, that becomes the ground work of all my misfortunes; when I imagine I am going to embrace her, and graſpe the higheſt felicity in my arms, I find it rudely ſnatch'd away, and ſhe hurry'd to her fatal end, whil'ſt I am left the ſport to Deſtiny, and example of the greateſt ſufferings mortality ever taſted of and lived under. Cruel thoughts, ſorrowful remembrance, which ſtings my very ſoul with bitterneſs, that I my ſelf ſhould be the ſad cauſe of hers, and thereby my own ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine! had I not better have continued to love and adore her in ſilence? But oh — Here the Prince interrupted me, and mildly ſaid, Ceaſe from becoming yet more guilty by your loud murmerings: you muſt not blaſpheme againſt ſo ſage a conduct as that of Heaven; Are the gods tyed to let fall proſperity on all our actions and purpoſes? no, they more wiſely do diſpoſe, of what we commonly propoſe moſt wildly to our ſelves: Nor ſhould we think our ſelves ſo harſhly dealt with, did we but well conſider, how lamely we go about moſt, if not all our deſigns, and how we ſwerve from thoſe ſtrickt rules of Vertue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed us to walk in, to attain our juſt ends: Is it poſſible, <hi>Merame,</hi> that when you intended to fight with <hi>Zadarem,</hi> you ſhould not plainly foreſee, my Fathers heat of paſſion and anger, ſince you ſo ſoon fled from it? and who had enſured <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>'s
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46063:38"/>
ſafety in her journey to meet you? the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance appointed to convey her, did not that ſhew what fears you had ſhe might fall into thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, did afterwards unhappily light on her? Believe me, <hi>Merame,</hi> you do ill to complain ſo much for having reap'd thoſe thorns your ſelf had planted: your miſadventures cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel'd again, I mean thoſe that are paſt, do not kick at Heaven, but mildly ſubmit to what Fate and your ſelf have caſt upon you: 'tis better yeilding obedience to the gods, than call more anger down by a rebellious impatience. I, you know, made ſome oppoſition againſt my deſtiny, but in vain, we muſt bow down our ſtubborn wills at laſt, therefore ſtrive to content your ſelf with what Heaven does. The love, the Prince ſhew'd, in his affectionate and rational diſcourſe recalled my reaſon back to her firſt temper; I found, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I gave my ſelf up to diſpair unnobly, and with much weakneſs; and before he parted I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him to ſuck at every flower that could but promiſe the leaſt probability of yeilding any comfort to me. He, afterwards ſent very often to viſit me, and had obtained ſo much favour, that my chains of cloſe reſtraint were drawn out to ſuch an extent of liberty, that I might now walk freely in a wide Park adjoyning to my Priſon, where frequently my friends came to give me comfort, and helpt to wear out the tedious hours I ſpent in my confinement. One day, whilſt it was yet very early, a Gentleman came to me from <hi>Seniſra,</hi> and told me, with a ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which gave me hopes of ſome approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

This ſudden tranſport from a depth of ſorrow, to ſuch a height of joy, had almoſt made me looſe my ſelf in wonder: and, not minding or caring, indeed, how, or by whom this Paper Embaſſy was come to hand, I kiſs'd it many times firſt, and then tore it through impatience to read its Contents. I yet keep that precious pawn of her affection, which, I may ſay, was ſigned with her blood. But ſince I cannot behold or read it without a prologue of tears, oblige me ſo far <hi>Sybaris,</hi> as to eaſe me of that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by reading it your ſelf. <hi>Sybaris,</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded it, found theſe words,

I expected a quite contrary ſucceſs, and had no place to doubt, but it would have eſtabliſht your happineſs moſt firmly. Indeed, purſued <hi>Merame,</hi> the affliction this Letter brought with it, was by ſo much the more ſenſible, as it was unexpected, it cruſh'd down all my young ſpringing hopes, and the weak props my reaſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confidence had borrow'd, and ſo infinitely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my heart, it never could have riſen from under the weight, if <hi>Seniſra,</hi> having ſucceeded his Father, had not quite knock'd off my fetters of reſtraint, and uſed all the noble endeavours poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to perſwade me, not to throw away my life ſo cheaply, but try to carve out a brave revenge for my <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria.</hi> To this purpoſe he made up a reconciliation betwixt <hi>Hylebas</hi> and me, whom he afterwards commanded to quit the Court, and doing me the honour to admit me to the ſame degree of favour, as my Antagoniſt had enjoy'd under <hi>Balden,</hi> he committed the diſpoſal of all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to my Father, whom he elected for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Army.</p>
                        <p>Mean time, the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who hoped for ſome advantage in this grand mutation, broke out into an abſolute War, which their daily pilferings and ſmall incurſions on either ſide had long threatned. <hi>Seniſra,</hi> finding the army his Father had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46063:40"/>
in a condition to march, commended my Father to prevent the Enemies haſt, on whoſe Frontiers he appeared before they could have leaſure to imagine it: I was impatient till we came to blowes, and as ſoon as we had newes of them by our ſcouts, I went out with a party to diſcover, or rather to attaque them. That firſt enterprize ſucceeding happily, for thoſe I engaged were all either cut off, or taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; there was not any one of thoſe whom I had ſubdued, of whom I enquired not particularly concerning <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi>; who, I told them was that fair Captive in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana,</hi> they had put to death a few days ſince. One only of them all, told me ſomewhat, he affirmed that their Prince and his ſon had both been moſt paſſionately in Love with her, but that the Father prompted by his jealouſie had cauſed her to dye, to roote up the ſons hopes of injoyment. Since himſelf could not allure her to his own deſires, her noble vertue having bravely repulſed the hotteſt of his luſtfull on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets.</p>
                        <p>The report and the love I had to <hi>

horſe, that being unable to cut my way back again, the numerous herd flying to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hurried me away in the throng with them. The richneſs of my armes and habit ſhew'd me to be of a condition which promis'd them a fair ranſome, which made them treate me civily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſecure me in a Caſtle very ſtrongly guarded, which faced the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea.</p>
                        <p>My impriſonment was not ſo cloſs, but I had ſometimes the liberty to breath the freſh ayr in a large encloſed paſture, at the other end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there ſtood another Caſtle, where I was told they kept thoſe fair Captives, choſen, for their more then ordinary beauty, to ſatisfy their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces luſt; which awakened my thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my loſt <hi>

Notwithſtanding amidſt this hope, and freſh aſſurances of her faith, I reſented ſome little grudgings of jealouſie and diſtruſt againſt him that thus undertook her freedome: and this ſecret ſuſpition would have ſtifled all my joy, if the over eager deſire of ſeeing her, had not quite thruſt it out of my mind.

By reading it I underſtood, that about midnight a Man would come and conduct me down a pair of private ſtayrs, which led to the ſea ſide, where I ſhould find a ſmall

Weepe therefore, weepe, till you are blind, as ſhe for this ſad funeral of all your happineſs! The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my grief cut of all further complaints, and ſunk me down upon my knees beſide her: where ſoftly kiſſing, ſometimes her cold cheekes, then her colder lipps, and bowing my head down in a dejected manner ſighing and ſhedding floods of tears, I gently took up one of her white hands, which ſhe had lockt together, and perceived a Dagger in it, and a peece of linnen in the other, which ſhe had torne off from her neck, upon which theſe words were charactred in blood, <hi>To keepe my ſelf intirely thine, I muſt dye Merame.</hi> Ha! well ſaid I, ſince only I am guilty of thy death it is but juſt I ſhould be puniſhed: and I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to expiate the crime by offring my own heart thy ſacrifice: but would to heaven, you rather

had hated me, than given ſuch woful teſtimonies of it! I ſhould have no regret in dying for you, were it not after you are dead for me, which is ſo ſtinging a conſideration, I doubt it will not leave me quiet in my grave. Too, too dear pledge of her immortal love, purſued I, kiſſing the Sacred relique; whereon her blood had left ſome bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for my demerits; Receive the impreſſions of mine alſo, which I reſolve to ingrave. And then taking up the dagger, thou fatal inſtrument of our diſcourteous deſtiny, bathe thy ſelf in my blood, to waſh that ſin off thou haſt contracted by letting out of hers. Then having again kiſs'd my <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>'s pale lips and reeking wound, and noted where abouts it was made, I ſtabed my ſelf as near my own heart, as that was to hers, and with the firſt drops wrote thus upon the ſame linnen, Merame <hi>dyes for</hi> Uneria <hi>who is dead for him.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange, me thought that blow gave me the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eaſe I ever felt, by disbanding that diſpair and load of grief that ſo oppreſſed me: and feeling my ſtrength decay apace, I laid my ſelf down cloſe by her, on the ſame bed of earth, embracing her as ſtrictly as I could, reſolving to be united to her at death.</p>
                        <p>All my ſences were now taking their laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well and flight together. When ſhe preſſed that hand wherewith I held her faſt; I ſtrugled to raiſe my ſelf again, and willingly would have thruſt death from me, ſince <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria</hi> yet lived, to have aſſiſted her: but the loſs of ſo much blood as guſhed from my deep wound, cauſed me to faint, ſo that I was wholly deprived of all ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46063:43"/>
Whilſt I was in this trance, the owner of the little Cottage, a good antient man, hapning to come by, was moved with compaſſion, and uſed his beſt means to recover me again: by his care and helpful charity I came at length to my ſences again, and as ſoon as I was Maſter of ſo much ſtrength and reaſon as would guide my tongue, I enquired for <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neria,</hi> whom he told me was conveyed away by certain ſtrangers he never had before beheld, he being much amazed at his return from his fiſhing to ſee a horſeman bear away a woman from thence, and to find me on the cold earth ſwiming in blood.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs I had much ado to refrain quarreling with the old man, for ſuffering any to raviſh her away. The uncertainty, balancing my mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt hope and fear, whether it were a friend or enemy had taken her thence, ſtrugled ſo long with my diſpair which ſolicited for death, that it, in fine, made me deſire to live till I could know the certainty: conſidering it would be time enough to take that Sanctuary, when I was ſure ſhe was utterly loſt, who had been as miraculouſly as often preſerved above all expectation.</p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe, I conjured the good man to tranſport me to ſome ſuch concealed place as might ſecure me; who was ſo ſenſibly touched with the relation I made him of ſome feigned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters had befaln me, that he ſoon conſented to put me in a place of ſafety, before any one could have the time to be informed of my flight. So he, accordingly, conveyed me to a little petty Iſland, where he had found within the hollow womb of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46063:43"/>
a Rock, a place large enough to lodge in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, when he minded not to return to his other habitation. His Wife was there at that time with a child or two, who received me with the ſame kindneſs as he had brought me; and they there took ſuch pains and care to advance my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that within fifteen dayes, I had acquired a great deal of ſtrength. In the interim, this honeſt fellow brought me intelligence, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons, had made inquiry for me at his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, asking him whether he could give them any notice of a man whom they deſcribed much of my reſemblance: but they not mentioning either the Lady, or the misfortunes I had related, he thought it might be ſome other. However he was reſolved and did keep me hid, till thinking it convenient to remove, I got him to conduct me to the chops of the River <hi>Oxus,</hi> not far thence, where being ſafely landed, I went directly to <hi>Sina</hi> in the Province of <hi>Derbices,</hi> the Governour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was one of my moſt intimate friends.

            <p>The Prince that commanded them, was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable ancient gentleman called <hi>Gobrias,</hi> who cauſing his man to make a halt, advanced, only with a ſmall party to attend him, demanding to ſpeake with their General; the Majeſty of his countenance imprinted reſpect in all thoſe that

            <p>I would not, Sir, that you ſhould beleeve I preſent a traytor, or perfidious man before you, if my revault were an act of baſeneſs, I ſhould not dare to caſt my ſelf into the armes of the moſt generous Prince in the world, but the Subject of it having the appendages of juſtice and honor to warrant it legal, I hope when you are made acquainted with the reaſons of my deſerting the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> party to embrace yours, that I ſhall find a noble reception from your infinite goodneſs. <hi>Cyrus</hi> having intimated how glad he ſhould be to know the occaſion that urged him to come in ſuch a manner, <hi>Gobrias</hi> went on thus.</p>
            <p>I am an <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> by extraction, the eldeſt of one of the moſt illuſtrious and puiſſant families, from whom their Princes are deſcended, I have the Soveraign command of the Province of the <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meens,</hi> where I have many places of great ſtrength and plentifully ſtored. I came from thence with a party of thirteen hundred horſe to find out <hi>Labynetus</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who was ſlain in the firſt battle they fought againſt you. I was one of the moſt intimate friends, and had ſerv'd him divers times in his armies in quality of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, with ſo much happineſs as to merit my favours from his noble acknowledgement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all which, the moſt advantageous was the

deſire he had to allie me to his family. He haſt one only ſon, and a daughter, and I was bled with a like paire: So that to make our kindred firme by an indiſſoluble knot, he ordain'd his ſon <hi>

            <p>The time was neere at hand to celebrate thoſe nuptialls, and all things preparing for ſo illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a ceremony, the Court expecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of it with much impatience when a ſtrange accident ſuddenly ruffled this calme of promiſing joyes into a ſtorme of unhappineſs, which then ſwallow'd up my deareſt ſon, and ever ſince all my content and felicity.

            <p>But, Sir, the rage of this degenerate Prince, was not yet glutted, though he ſaw him weltring in the ſtreames of his own blood, he would not ſuffer them to carry him to the City, fearing leaſt, his wound not being ſo mortall, as his own curſed hate there might be a poſſibility of his recovery: and therefore to prevent all my endeavours, and deprive me of the ſad conſolation to behold him once again, he caus'd him to be caſt into the river <hi>Tigris.</hi>

            <p>The King his Father, immediately after he had learnt this woeful accident, came to me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to teſtify the reſſentment he had of my juſt griefe, complaining with much tenderneſs, of thoſe conſiderations which hindred him from puniſhing the Author, and ſeriouſly proteſted that if he had but any other ſon to inherit his Crown, he would have made him the object of

My daughter the generous ſiſter of <hi>Melzune,</hi> who was deſtined to be that Tyrants wife, will gladly receive you, whoſe pungent ſorrow will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no leſs pitty then my own. I bred her, as I have already ſaid, to be the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Queen, but though I had pointed out <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez</hi> to be former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the object of her love, ſhe now conſiders, him only as the Subject of her deepeſt hate, and and whatever that Traytor has projected to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe her indignation, yet ſhe had ſo much ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in her, as to tell him one day aloud, before his Father, <hi>Sabinetus</hi> that ſhe more then admir'd he had the confidence to hope for any affection, or reſpect from one whoſe brother he had baſely butcher'd, that the mourning vail ſhe wore was an evident teſtimony of his blacker crime, and that as ſhe could never ſhew too much regret, by her continual griefe, for what ſhe had loſt, ſo conſequently ſhe could never manifeſt too great a hatred againſt him that had ſo ignobly raviſh'd it from her, and further ſhe would never ſuffer that man, though a King, to be her husband that was her brothers aſſaſſin, but he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expect the ſudden effects of the ſevereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her mortal hate, and anger could levy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, then the leaſt inclination from her extinguiſh'd love.</p>
            <p>If fine, to ſhun the importunate purſuites of that unworthy Prince, ſhe baniſh'd her ſelf voluntarily from the Court, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one of my ſiſters into <hi>Garamee,</hi> that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46063:51"/>

of imploying his friends, who were very potent, to ſue his pardon, he perſiſted to declare, that he deſired not to live but to performe that by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond attempt which he had ſo unhappily miſs'd in the firſt, it being a deſign too juſt to be thrown by. If any other but a Prince had appeared in it, I might perhaps have fallen under their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of being confederate, but it was above conjecture to imagine that a perſon of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would be but anothers inſtrument, and therefore he alone was adjudged guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>He was condemn'd to pay down his head for the price of this treaſon, and becauſe this peece of juſtice was to be exemplary, the execution was defer'd till the Kings returne, who was at that time within a dayes journey of <hi>Ninus,</hi> that the whole Court might be aſſiſtant. My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the interim was made acquainted with the ſentence pronounced againſt him, and feigning as if ſhe were to goe a hunting, as ſhe frequently did, being well mounted, ſhe went directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ninus,</hi> where ſhe arriv'd (juſt the evening before the fatal day, which <hi>Emuin</hi> reck'ned as the laſt in his unhappy Calender disguis'd under the ſhrowd of ſuch a habit, as was not uſuall to her ſex.</p>
            <p>The day following all the Court being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, with the herds of common people, the King and his ſon being there preſent with their extraordinary guard of ſoldiers, they drew the miſerable <hi>Emuin</hi> forth of the priſon, to end his life and miſeries at one blow, but whilſt every one had their eyes fixt on him, deſcanting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46063:52"/>
on his misfortune, they were ſuddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off to behold a freſh object which preſented it ſelf in that black Scene, it being a perſon vail'd all over, making way through the croud with two Trumpeters marching before.</p>
            <p>It was the cuſtome, of a long ſtanding, amongſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that if any one could reveal ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which might aggravate the offenders crime, or could fully clear and diſcharge them, they were to come thus diſguiſed, to preſent their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. According to this order the Judges inſtantly ſuſpended the execution to know what this might be, they carried the written informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, who was amaz'd that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which brought it, accus'd himſelf as the ſole author of the attempt, and fully diſcharged <hi>Emuin,</hi> as having only undertaken the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, out of a blinde obedience to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons command.</p>
            <p>Many had formerly been known to bring in ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, but hardly ever any preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo voluntarily to certain death. In this general conſternation, they caus'd the unknown perſon to approach near the King, who was no ſooner within reach, but before he gave ſo much time as to examine a word, ſnatch'd off the vail which concealed the admired perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> None could at the firſt inſtant diſcover who it was, and truly it were difficult not to be extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with ſuch an unlook'd for object as a Lady ſo generouſly out-braving death it ſelf. 'Tis my Daughter <hi>Azimea,</hi> who as I ſaid before under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of hunting ſtole away from me, with a full
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46063:53"/>
reſolution to ſave that Prince, and who with an incomparable courage addreſs'd her looks and words thus to <hi>Vectorez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou wouldeſt pretend, infamous man, not to know me becauſe of this diſguiſe, thou find'ſt, my preſence like thy own conſcience the Monitor to reproach thy bloody cruelties, and an authentick Witneſs of the juſtice of my enterprize to take away thy life, which is ſo clear an evidence that I would almoſt think Heavens juſtice ſlept when I miſs'd of my hopes in puniſhing thee, for a reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of my deareſt Brothers life. Ah degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, do not turn back thy ſight, maintain that bloody action, thou hadſt then impudence to commit, thou trembleſt, Traytor, to ſee her in thy preſence from whom thou didſt expect the ſofteſt careſſes, avouch ſhe is thy deadly enemy, and wiſh ſhe could have buried a dagger in thy heart: but, tell me, what wonder doſt thou find in this change, haſt not thou oblig'd me to it, can I manifeſt leſs revenge, and hate againſt my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſaſſin, and be a Princeſs ſtill? Tell me what crime there is in this attempt? or rather what juſtice does not authorize it? can leſs than thy ignoble life ſatisfie for that worthy ſoul? or doſt thou think me ſo tame and cool to paſs by ſuch an injury, and not reſent it. If I be guilty 'tis only for my want of due revenge, and leaving it to be committed by a hand that was too weak, when I ſhould rather have undertaken it my ſelf, which Heaven, without doubt, would not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed ſo unhappily: but thou doſt make no anſwer, and thy penſive ſilence gives a ſtrong
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46063:53"/>
aſſent to theſe indictments, and are alone ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make good the juſtice of my intentions againſt thy guilty perſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe publick reproaches dy'd with ſuch ſharp and vehement language, did ſo aſtoniſh the Prince and gall his ſoul, that he had not the power to anſwer her one Syllable, whom he yet dearly lov'd; but the King his Father perceiving his confuſion, ſtood up and ſpoke, to take her off from ſtretching her bitter reproofs out further againſt that horrid crime ſo openly. He ſent forth <hi>Emuin</hi> to confront her, who confirm'd the whole infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and all that ſhe had ſpoken, after which he was return'd to the Priſon again, and <hi>Azimea</hi> was carried to the Palace, where ſhe was ſtrongly guarded till my arrival.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Labynetus,</hi> as I told you before, affected me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, and ſent for me, whilſt I was in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fears in the world for my abſent daughter, to come to Court and hear news of her; According to this meſſage I haſted with the moſt diligent ſpeed, and having preſented my ſelf full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity before him, he ſent for <hi>Vectorez</hi> and <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea,</hi> and related, in the preſence of his choiceſt Nobility, all that had befallen; and told me, that notwithſtanding all the reaſons of State and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his Crown, he found it equitable to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Daughters attempt, ſince he had been oblig'd to leave his own Son unpuniſh'd; and that his regret was the more ſenſible, becauſe his Succeſſor by this unhappy accident, was expos'd to the juſt hatred of our generous family: but as a ſatisfaction of my Sons loſs, he now reſtor'd my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46063:54"/>
Daughter, pretending by that means to bury our quarrel in oblivion.</p>
            <p>I accepted the Kings mercy to <hi>Azimea</hi> with all the teſtimonies of acknowledgement my duty bound me to, without relinquiſhing the hate I had conceiv'd againſt his Son. I had forgot to tell you, that his Daughter was preſent at this enter-view, who being no leſs paſſionate of my Sons memory, than ſhe had formerly been of his Perſon, upheld the intereſt of my Family ſtoutly, and confeſs'd openly that if <hi>Vectorez</hi> had not been ſo near of blood to her, ſhe would not have been ſo bravely prevented in the deſign of revenge.</p>
            <p>During the little abode I made at Court, my Daughter in her agreement making a ſuperficial reconciliation with the Prince, obtain'd his rivals pardon, whom they were content to baniſh, and withall made the Prince renounce his pretence of Marriage with her, by an abſolute refuſal of that proffer'd love he often made, which poſſeſs'd him with as much violence as ever.</p>
            <p>Our affairs being thus handſomly compoſed, I return'd to <hi>Garamee,</hi> where I was no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, but <hi>Labynetus</hi> ſent an expreſs, for me to go and joyn my troops with his, to carry on the War commenc'd againſt <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> I was already on my way to this purpoſe, when I receiv'd tyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his death, which made me change my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and turn my courſe towards you, to whom I fly for Protection againſt that bloody Tyrant whoſe cruelty, not fully gorg'd with my Son's innocent blood, has often made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that if he ever came to be Soveraign, he would
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46063:54"/>
by force conſtrain us to repentance, and make my Daughter flexible to the laſt of his deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gorgias</hi> having thus wound up the ſeveral threds of his diſcourſe, <hi>Cyrus</hi> again repeated his embraces, and the promiſes he had made for his revenge, proteſting he ſhould find in him the readieſt perſon in the world to ſecond his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and his Daughters extraordinary ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity.</p>
            <p>This converſion was not broken off, till the <hi>Medes</hi> came in a joynt body, to preſent him with what they thought he would eſteem the richeſt of their purchaſe lately taken.</p>
            <p>It was a woman of <hi>Suſiana,</hi> whoſe miraculous beauty darted aſtoniſhment and dangerous won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into every eye that gaz'd upon her, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſad indeed, but yet that ſadneſs was mix'd with ſo much conquering Majeſty, that it was eaſie to be read how little power the unhappineſs of her Captivity had gain'd upon her ſpirit, <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelf, who had no eyes but for the bleſſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he ador'd, could not refuſe them ſuch a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight, he ſtood ſtill a while wrapt with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of her perſon, and after he had receiv'd her with all thoſe high expreſſions of civility her condition ſeem'd to claim, he underſtood ſhe was the Wife of <hi>Abradate</hi> Prince of <hi>Suſiana,</hi> whom the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King, had ſent to the King of <hi>Bactria</hi> to make a confederation of their Armies. The knowledge of her condition put him into the ſame terms of reſpect towards her, as her beauty had of admiration, and therefore unwilling to detain her in a prolix diſcourſe, which could not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46063:55"/>
but diſpleaſe in ſuch a condition, he left her the full liberty of returning to her own company, with whom ſhe might condole, and try to diſmiſs her ſorrows, only giving charge to a young <hi>Perſian</hi> Lord, nam'd <hi>Araſpe,</hi> to have a particular care to treat her with that honour which was due to her birth, and merits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araſpe</hi> had from his youth been bred up in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Academies with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to whoſe fortune he had ſince particularly ty'd himſelf. It ſeem'd that <hi>Cyrus</hi> impoſing the Commiſſion on him to guard this Woman, had conſulted with his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for before ſhe was preſented to him (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd by the ſecret motions of that fatal deſtiny which none can avoid) <hi>Araſpe</hi> had already ſought her out amongſt all the other Priſoners, and being only invited to a compaſſion for her Captivity, he had look'd on her with a more then ordinary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Panthea</hi> (ſo was the name of this beautiful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) at that preſent was but meanly clad, ſitting amongſt her maids, who ſhew'd her no reſpect, more than to any other, thereby to hide her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from diſcovery: but raiſing her ſelf before <hi>Araſpe,</hi> whom ſhe judg'd to be ſome extraordinary perſon by the great throng that follow'd at his heels, he preſently imagin'd that nature had not plac'd ſo much Majeſty, as he remarked in her action, and port, to one of ordinary birth and beauty.</p>
            <p>His opinion did not deceive him, for the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he expreſs'd, having oblig'd her to unvail that Divine face, which ſhe till then had alwayes hid
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46063:55"/>
behind that cloud, his eye not only met with ſuch a raviſhing complexion, and ſweet feature as did ſurpaſs the power, and liberty of fancy to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: but he reſented the vertue of thoſe charms (whoſe ſecret Magick had compel'd him to ſeek her out) diving into the very centre of his breſt with love, and all-controuling paſſions. He had no ſooner ſeen her, but he deſir'd to eclipſe her from all others: but having ſuch a crowd of Witneſſes, he was conſtrain'd, diſpite of all repugnancy, to conſent that ſhe ſhould be preſented to <hi>Cyrus</hi> as the <hi>Medes</hi> had propounded. This new-born paſſion ſhe had ſhot into his ſoul, ſhook him with apprehenſion leaſt <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould accept of her, and one may truly ſay that he received with more joy, (though not without the allay of inward trouble) the command of guarding her, then if they had beſtow'd the richeſt Crowns, and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> who perceiv'd the emotions of his heart; charactred on his tell-tale face, would have known the cauſe, and wiſh'd him above all things if he found himſelf too feeble to withſtand her charms, not to undertake the charge: the combat being the more dangerous, becauſe that fair enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever preſent, he muſt lye at a wary guard to defend himſelf each moment, and enjoying yet a liberty that was uſurp'd by none, it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to refuſe that bewitching Sex, invading it ſo ſweetly: he added more-over that 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to behold a beauty like <hi>Pantheas</hi> and not love it, but then he muſt preſcribe that affection within the limits of vertue, becauſe it did import
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46063:56"/>
them, very much to preſerve the reputation of their victory unſtain'd, by right of which, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were indeed become ſubject to their juſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but not to their unlawful paſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araſpe</hi> having recover'd his ſetled countenance, anſwer'd that it was true indeed he had not been able to eye ſo many miracles in one perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſtoniſhment, neither could he believe that any man living could be ſo dull as to behold her, and not find the like ſentiments of reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, as he did in his ſoul; but yet he was not ignorant of the rules of his devoir, and the trouble which might have overſpread his face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only an effect of his admiration, he aſſur'd him that whatever inclination he ſhould cheriſh for <hi>Panthea,</hi> it ſhould never exceed that which one ought not to deny to any beauteous perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> in fine recommended the conſtancy of this reſolution to him, and told him at parting that he ſhould remember, it was difficult to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the fire and not be heated, that love deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treacherouſly in all his wayes, he muſt ſuſpect him, as one that never flatters but to hurt. <hi>Araſpe</hi> promis'd on his part diſpite of all thoſe notions in his heart that he would never go beyond an eſteem for her. But the rapid ſtreams of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination drove him far beyond all theſe bounds, and after a few dayes ſiege, which he maintain'd againſt thoſe potent paſſions, he was compel'd to yeild to their violent aſſaults, upon no better compoſition than their uncertain mercy.</p>
            <p>If the firſt ſight and preſence of <hi>Panthea</hi> had ſo powerfully charm'd him, 'tis eaſie to imagine that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46063:56"/>
her noble converſation wholly vanquiſh'd him: ſhe ſtudied every day, finding he treated her with ſuch choice reſpect, to oblige him by a thouſand new civilities, expreſſing a great care for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and rendring him in fine all the teſtimonies of love and amity that he could have expected from a Siſter. The effect of <hi>Panthea</hi>'s civility was very different from what ſhe deſired, her deſign aiming only to gain him for her friend, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ſhe ingag'd him as a Lover. This poor Prince ſtifling the flames affection kindled in his breſt, by his diſcreeter ſilence, that he might not break the promiſe he had verbally ſeal'd to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> conceal'd his paſſion. But this contagious malady of the mind infected his body, and fir'd that frail Cottage with a burning Feaver, whoſe flames brought thoſe ſecret thoughts to light, which he till then had kept hidden, and though there did appear ſome extravagancy in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd ſpeeches, yet it was eaſie to be known, that the remembrance of <hi>Panthea</hi> did alwayes feed his imagination. She went often to viſit him, and though his fits redoubled at her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet he was ſometimes of a more compoſed ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it than when ſhe was not there. One day when ſhe enquired of the Phiſitians of his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they told her that in the extremity of his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he moſt times ſpake of her, but yet ſhe could not ſuſpect in the leaſt that this was any effect of love, but was perſwaded that being often in his ſight, the image of her perſon might often preſent it ſelf to his fancy.</p>
            <p>But coming another time into his Chamber
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46063:57"/>
when he was troubled in his wilder thoughts, he turned towards her, and with a vehement ſpeech; Well Madam, ſaid he to her, is it not enough to torment me with your remembrance, but you muſt come to kill me by your ſight? ſhall I have no releaſe from thoſe deep ſufferings? and my recovery being deſperate, am I forbidden the leaſt conſolation? Yes, continued he, turning ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from her, and whiſpering to himſelf in a ſad tone; Lets dye ſince 'tis the will of Heaven, for death is the only remedy for my afflictions. Ha! <hi>Panthea,</hi> cry'd he again, darting his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, after a little ſilence, <hi>Abradate</hi> is your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>Cyrus</hi> has forbidden me, I have promis'd it, your devoir will not permit you, I ſhould violate my own: But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> —I have reſiſted to my utmoſt, and 'tis you conſtrain me, is it not true Madam? with theſe words which he pronounced ſomewhat loud, he ceaſed from ſpeaking, and caſt his looks wiſhly upon <hi>Panthea,</hi> who being in amazement at what he had talked with ſo much confuſion, not being able to comprehend it, ſhe approached nearer to his bed, and finding him as ſhe thought in a calmer temper; Is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Araſpe,</hi> that I ſhould be ſo unhappy as to have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted any thing to your ſufferings? what have I done, which is ſo harſh to your remembrance? what can it import you, that <hi>Abrodate</hi> is my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? what has <hi>Cyrus</hi> forbidden you? what have you promis'd him? wherein have I treſpaſs'd againſt my devoir? what have I conſtrained you to do, good gods, 'gainſt which you have ſo much reſiſted: Tell me, <hi>Araſpe,</hi> and aſſure your ſelf
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46063:57"/>
that if your health depended upon me, though 'twere to be purchaſed with my life, you ſhould not be one moment longer in this languiſhing condition, and though I am unhappy in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, believe it, I will not lye under the guilt of ingratitude for thoſe noble favours I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſhall eſteem the fortune of my captivity a bleſſing, if there be any means left me at preſent whereby to ſerve you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araſpe</hi> after a great ſigh, anſwer'd her with a ſoft voyce, I perceive Madam, that the violence of my Feaver has made me diſcourſe extravagantly, I am aſham'd to be ſo unprovided of fitting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes for it, and beg your pardon, if I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd your ſelf, or worthy Husband in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers: In that condition you may gueſs, that being not the Maſter of my reaſon, I only talk what my extravagant imagination ſuggeſts, and that, which it may be, my Devoir would forbid me once to think on. <hi>Panthea</hi> would not preſs him further, and eaſily believ'd, that what ſhe had heard was only the effects of his troubled fancy; Therefore after ſhe had a while longer entertain'd him with much mildneſs, ſhe left the ſad <hi>Araſpe,</hi> more turmoiled with his paſſion than his Feaver, which both together ſet upon him with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, preſently after her going, that the Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans began to diſpair of his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus, Tygranes, Artabaſus,</hi> and many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality being informed of it, came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to viſit him, they found him in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he had been, and he no ſooner perceiv'd <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who drew near to his bed, but caſting a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46063:58"/>
furious look upon him: 'Tis you likewiſe cruel—ſaid he, that ſeconded the Tyranny of her Devoir; I ſhould be leſs unhappy were it not for you, nor ſhould I meet ſo many obſtacles to my content, were I not conſtrain'd by your conſideration. Hence, cruel, hence, what you are come to perſecute me with your preſence, and take away the very liberty of complaint. Ah 'tis too, too much! his ſobs, and hollow ſigh's blockt up all the paſſages of ſpeech, and the Phiſitians perceiving his tranſport, intreated <hi>Cyrus</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, with all thoſe that accompanied him, to give him a little repoſe. He was no ſooner left alone but his reaſon returned to her ſeat, and quickly tam'd the tempeſt of his mind, ſo that he commanded one of thoſe that waited in his Chamber, to go and beſeech <hi>Panthea</hi> in his behalf to come to him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe arriv'd he caus'd all the reſt to avoid the room, except one Gentleman, whoſe fidelity he might confide in, and one of <hi>Panthea</hi>'s Maids, and then ſeeing himſelf at liberty to ſpeak, he began thus: I find, Madam, that you are no leſs ſurpriz'd to ſee me in this tranquility of ſpirit at preſent, than you were before, when I had loſt the helm of my reaſon and judgement. The ſame cauſe nevertheleſs has produc'd theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects, and that which occaſioned my rude diſtempers, does now reſtore me to ſo ſmooth a calm, that I can diſcover a ſecret to you, which I ſhould yet conceal, did I not find that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death obliged me to it. This laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, Madam, may excuſe me if there be any
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46063:58"/>
temerity in declaring it to you, which ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my life, that 'tis the only thing which makes me looſe it now. Judge, Madam, whether I may not reveal it without a crime, I know however you will not hear it without ſome diſpleaſure, but I am confident likewiſe that you are too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to refuſe my pardon, which I implore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dye, together with the permiſſion to diſcloſe it. At theſe words he made a little pauſe, to hear what ſhe would anſwer in that vacancy, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his propoſition either too melancholly, or too obſcure to gain a reply; What, Madam, ſaid he, do you not yet underſtand me, muſt I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that in plain terms, which I would hide in ſome manner from you, and will you not take notice of my paſſion, unleſs I ſay expreſly, that I love you? Ah, Madam, that word will coſt me my life, I can add no more, and 'tis ſufficient for my ſatisfaction that you know it. He could not command ſtrength enough, either to draw out the thred of his diſcourſe any longer, or to expect her anſwer, his ſences taking their flight together with his ſpeech, and <hi>Panthea</hi> beholding him in this condition, reſſented the uproar of many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſtrugling in her breſt together: modeſty, anger, and compaſſion invaded her mind, ſo that ſhe was ſome moments in a deep ſuſpence, but ſeeing thoſe that were by, ſo buſily imploy'd to aſſiſt him, ſhe recover'd ſo much pitty as to lend her beſt endeavours, and truly one may ſay that ſhe alone was able to revive him, as ſhe had only been the occaſion of his troubles. So ſoon as ſhe was approached, his nature gather'd up its
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46063:59"/>
ſtrength, and his eyes returning to their firſt offices, beholding her in that obliging imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his tongue unty'd it ſelf in theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Ha, what, Madam, will you not have me dye after ſo preſumptuous a declaration, do you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cure me, ſtriving to make me live. Yes, reparted <hi>Panthea,</hi> I will not have you dye, though I do not pretend your cure, having no remedy for your malady, you only are the cauſe of it your ſelf, and if you found any inclination to love, you ought not to have undertaken the charge of me. Nevertheleſs what help I can contribute, without a prejudice to my honour, you may juſtly hope for. To love is not a crime, I confeſs it, <hi>Araſpe,</hi> and provided you manage your affection accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of vertue, I conſent to it: but do not break the rules which I preſcribe you, if it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you, as you would have me believe, that I ſhould only be acquainted with it, I ſhall eſteem it ever real, ſo long as you do not offend my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, look to your health only, and make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to <hi>Panthea,</hi> who intreats you, that your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being not guilty, is capable to bring you as much repoſe and content, as it hath coſt you trouble.</p>
            <p>If I have ever wiſh'd to dye, reply'd <hi>Araſpe,</hi> to end my torments, I do as earneſtly now implore the gods, to ſuffer me to live, ſince you command it, Madam, that I may teſtifie by my reſpects, and ſervices, the immortal obligations I owe to your infinite bounty, which does concede far more than my moſt flattering hopes could ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46063:59"/>
by permitting me to love you: my ambition reach'd no higher but to diſcover it before my death, and I ſhall be, if I may live, henceforth too happy, in my aſſiduous endeavours to make known that the bent of all my worthieſt actions tend only to the honour of your ſervice.</p>
            <p>This conference gave no leſs eaſe and comfort to <hi>Araſpe,</hi> than it occaſioned trouble, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Panthea.</hi> She was no ſooner alone, but examining in her own chaſt thoughts all that had paſs'd, ſhe accus'd her ſelf of too much complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, as if ſhe had forfeited that ſevere vertue in which the world does make a Ladies honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and feared leaſt the permiſſion ſhe had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to continue his fair affections, ſhould ſpur him on beyond reſpect and decency. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe excus'd her ſelf of fondneſs upon that weight of obligations which ſhe ow'd, and thought ſhe could in civility do no leſs, than ſuffer an honeſt and vertuous friendſhip.</p>
            <p>On the other part, <hi>Araſpe</hi> had quite a contrary opinion, he conſtrued <hi>Panthea</hi>'s civility ſo much to his own advantage, that taking the conſent ſhe allowed his affection, to be meant a retaliation equal to his paſsion, he took a nice care of his recovery, that he might be able to reap the fruits of his deſires. This vain preſumption had almoſt loſt him, he laid by all reſpect, which he till then had obſerved towards her, and follow'd his own head-ſtrong paſſions, ſo that <hi>Panthea</hi> finding her ſelf dangerouſly perſecuted by his inſolent court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, was conſtrain'd to prefer the bill of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who weighing how important it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46063:60"/>
was towards his affairs not to offend a Princeſs, whoſe Husband with his forces might go near to turn the Scale on either ſide, whom he pretended to court to a compliance by the mediation of his excellent Princeſs, he took her out of his keeping, and made her all the noble ſatisfaction that was poſſible for her to expect.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Cyrus</hi> went into <hi>Garamee,</hi> hard by the City of <hi>Oroba,</hi> where <hi>Gobrias</hi> was making preparations for his reception. He encamped there about, and being attended with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers and Nobility of his Army, made his entrance, which was as magnificent on his part, as it was proud and coſtly on the inhabitants. The peoples loud acclamations declar'd with how much joy he was receiv'd. <hi>Gobrias</hi> with a great Train of Nobles gallantly mounted, and richly cloathed, went forth to meet him, and conducted him to his Palace, where his Daughter the generous <hi>Azimea,</hi> and all the great Ladies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them: this ceremony being performed on either part with a thouſand civil expreſſions. They made him preſents of a vaſt ſum of money, and all the other rarities which the Orient does produce, the which he nobly accepted, but it was only to reſtore them to <hi>Azimea,</hi> to whom he profer'd them ſo gracefully, that ſhe could not refuſe them with handſomeneſs, after ſhe had long diſputed with him for generoſity, and that he had proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more-over that if he commenc'd that War againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> for reaſons of State, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſerve her and to revenge her juſter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts ſhould be henceforth the principal cauſe to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46063:60"/>
make him continue and carry it on, to confirm which, having given her his hand, he followed her into many ſpacious rooms, whoſe furniture for beauty, and magnificence gave no leſs wonder than delight; and afterwards taking his quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for a ſhort ſpace (having contracted ſome wearineſs in viewing the rarities of one of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt houſes in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and viſiting the fortifications about the City) being ſomewhat refreſhed of that toile, he took his farewell of <hi>Gobrias,</hi> (who earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly intreated him to honour him with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at ſupper, and paſs away ſome dayes in that City) and returned to his Camp, preferring that ſober frugality which the <hi>Perſians</hi> obſerve in their diet, before the delicacy of thoſe exquiſite meſſes which <hi>Gobrias</hi> prepared at his ſplendid entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe whom the beauty of the Ladies of <hi>Garamee</hi> had inamour'd <hi>Hiſtaſpe</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Cavalry, was one, being conquer'd by <hi>Azimea</hi>'s, but whatever advantage he promiſed himſelf from <hi>Cyrus</hi> favour, who dearly loved him, to whom <hi>Gobrias</hi> had abſolutely committed the diſpoſal of his Daughter, yet he durſt not fly his thoughts ſo high as to pretend affection towards a Princeſs, who had been elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Scepter of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and ſo generouſly refuſed it. He propounded nevertheleſs to ſerve her, and to become, if poſſible, the miniſter of her vengeance, to merit at leaſt by that action ſome acknowledgement from her goodneſs, if he durſt not expect it from her love.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was full of moſt ſtrange
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46063:61"/>
inquietudes, he appear'd ſo ſad, and was ſo troubled and impatient, that the warlike occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations for the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> not being able to divert him from the thoughts of his dear Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it ſeem'd that <hi>Sybaris</hi> and <hi>Abracome</hi> were too ſlow in ſending him the news he languiſht to hear. <hi>Gobrias</hi> who was unacquainted with the cauſe of his trouble, and had a great deſire to be informed of it, meeting <hi>Artabaſe</hi> in a Garden walking with <hi>Merame,</hi> and the <hi>Hircanian</hi> Prince accoſted them, and having molded his diſcourſe upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it tempted the <hi>Hircanian</hi> Prince, and <hi>Merame</hi> with the like curioſity of enquiry, who joyntly declaring to <hi>Artabaſe</hi> the obligation it would be to inſtruct them in the happy knowledge of what ſo nearly concern'd their noble General, being all ſeated in a pleaſant Arbour, <hi>Artabaſe</hi> to feed their greedy deſires and attentions, commenc'd his diſcourſe in this manner.</p>
            <p>You may have great reaſon to wonder at the black melancholly of a Prince victorious over his enemies, glorious for his heroick actions, and happy, in fine, in all appearance, if ever any man were. A Prince to whoſe high valour all others yeild their powers, either in ſeeking his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or flying from his preſence. The melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nevertheleſs, which is ſo legible to you on his countenance, is one of the effects of his firſt victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he gained in this War, the Lawrels which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that Crown of triumph, were interlaced with thoſe Thornes which yet torment him, he having loſt his repoſe and liberty amongſt thoſe whom the chance of War had made his Captives:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46063:61"/>
but that I may entirely ſatisfy the curioſity which you may have to know the compleate hiſtory of this young Heroe, who in his tendereſt yeares perform'd ſuch actions as are too rare to be paſs'd over in ſilence, you muſt permit me to take my riſe from thoſe times.</p>

                        <p>You cannot but have heard of thoſe celebrous Academies in <hi>Perſia,</hi> where vertue alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and where they are ſo well taught to practice it. 'Twas in thoſe learned ſchooles. Our Prince was bred and inſtructed, whoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not diſpenſe him from the ſeverity of thoſe lawes which they obſerve, they gave him no other but the ordinary courſe nouriſhment of bread and creſſes, and ſatisfied his thirſt with natures plain beverage, a diſh of water, thereby to accuſtome him to undergoe hardſhip when he ſhould come to be more neceſſarily acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it in time of war: they taught him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſhoot exactly with a bow, and caſt a ſpear, with all thoſe other exerciſes which concern the agility and vigour of the body. In a word, he was treated with the ſame rigour as all the other were, the only difference that could be noted was, the wonderful aptitude, and readineſs of his attaining every thing with facility. Amongſt all his condiſciples there was not any that could paralel his activity of body: and for learning,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46063:62"/>
none ever made a greater progreſs in ſo ſhort a time: and concerning all thoſe little intrigues, and differences, which ever happen amongſt children, as thefts, rapine, calumny, ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, deceits, and other ſuch like crimes, he was made judge, and ſo behav'd himſelf, that ſuch as are moſt perfect in the lawes; and have a long time weilded the ſword of juſtice, never pronounced more equitable and judicious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, nor could the ableſt barriſter have ſhap'd better pleas to defend innocency, or have heap'd more preſſing reaſons on the head of guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, then he continually did.</p>
                        <p>Theſe rare advantages of body and mind, conjoyn'd to his illuſtrious birth made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo famous, that <hi>Aſtiages</hi> his Grandfather formerly King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> the Father of <hi>Cyax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arez</hi> having heard a recital of ſo many wonders, was extreme deſirous to ſee him. <hi>Cyrus</hi> as you know is ſon of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane</hi> the daughter of <hi>Aſtiages.</hi> His Mother would needs go into <hi>Media</hi> to conduct him to his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, who found by him, that Fame, which uſually exceeds in her report of other things, wanted both mouthes and breath to proclaime all the excellent qualities of this young Prince. He found him more compleate every way then report had blazon'd, the diſpoſition of his body and poſture, was handſomer and more taking then he could poſſibly fancy, and beyond that, he found ſo mature a judgement, and ſuch a ſparkling vivacity of wit, as he confeſs'd, that all what had been related, though that were many
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46063:62"/>
ſteps above a fond beliefe, was yet ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the exquiſite indowments he now really met with in his perſon, that nothing but the teſtimony of his own ſight, could ever have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded as a truth. In a word, the infinite charmes and graces of his perſon, and ſpirit were ſo many, that it may juſtly releaſe me from repeating them it will ſuffice to tell you, that in an age ſo tender and Blooming, which eaſily receives any impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not having yet ſtept over fourteen yeares, he had ſuch ſolid principles of vertue, that the delicious and ſoft lives they led in <hi>Media</hi> could never corrupt his nobler ſentiments.</p>
                        <p>The firſt time he ſaluted his grand-father <hi>Aſtiages,</hi> ſeeing him richly habited, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny jewells, and a ſweet cloud of perfumes about him, he freely avowed that the modeſt plaineſs the <hi>Perſians</hi> obſerve in their veſtments, pleaſed him far beyond it, and he prefer'd the ſober fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of his former wholeſome diet, before the dainty viands they now preſented to his taſte. In fine, amidſt all that delicacy, he kept himſelf up ſtrictly, to that rigid vertue he had practiſed at home, all that he learned amongſt them was to mannage a horſe, becauſe in his country it was neither ſo frequent, nor ſo perfectly taught, as ſoon as he had attained this skill, he went continually to hunting with <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the ſon of <hi>Aſtiages,</hi> in which exerciſe having given many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident proofs of his valour and activity, he added one more alſo of his courage in an occaſion of war which proffer'd it ſelf at that time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aſtiages</hi> having been advertis'd that the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

endammaged his frontiers by their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pillaging, and frequent incurſions, ſent <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi> with a competent ſtrength to repulſe and tame them. Then was it that <hi>Cyrus</hi> felt that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ardour firſt boyling in his youthful veins, which the alarm's of war does uſe to kindle in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant breaſts. In lieu of following his unckles ſteps as a volunteer, he put himſelf in the head of their troops, as if he only had been their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſo that neither <hi>Cyaxares</hi> nor the <hi>Medes</hi> had any other conduct but his own, nor could the god of war himſelf have inſpir'd them with more courage then did his noble examples. He was ſo heated in the fight, and thruſt himſelf ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the thickeſt of the enemies, who already began to fly before the fury of this young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> fearing leaſt he ſhould too eagerly engage himſelf in a further purſute, was conſtrain'd to goe in perſon and fetch him of. In fine all his actions bred every day new and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving admiration, nor did <hi>Aſtiages</hi> returne him to his Father <hi>Cambyſis,</hi> but with regret, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted to have ſo ineſtimable a jewell in the poſſeſſion of his own dear embracements, having heard what a new luſter and glory his freſh victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had put upon his fame. Returning into <hi>Perſia,</hi> he carried all the hearts and affections of the <hi>Medes</hi> along with him, which they paid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily down in myriads of happy wiſhes, &amp; bleſſings at his departure, ſo generally he acquir'd their love and zealous reſpects, by thoſe good offices he render'd them whilſt he reſided there, and the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46063:63"/>
obliging carreſſes with which he treated all men.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after his returne from <hi>Media, Aſtiages</hi> died, and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his ſon, and his ſucceſſor to the Empire, found himſelf dangerouſly aſſaulted by all the <hi>Aſian</hi> puiſſance at once. <hi>Labynetus</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> having already ſubdued all <hi>Siria,</hi> rendred the <hi>Arabians</hi> tributaries, and vanquiſht the <hi>Hircanians</hi> and the <hi>Bactrians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that if he could but hang his chains upon the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> he ſhould find no more enemies ſo powerful as to diſpute his intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Aſia.</hi> He had ambition enough for this deſign: but doubting of his ſtrength to carry him thorow, he wrote to the King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to him of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> to the <hi>Phrigians, Indians,</hi> the people of <hi>Caria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> cajolling and intreating them to enter into confederation, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a war with him againſt the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> whoſe ſtrong alliance he perſwaded them to feare, repreſenting how neceſſary it was for them to knit, and unite their force together, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and diſſolve them, whom alone they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be able to ſuppreſs, or reſiſt, This reaſon engaged ſome of theſe Princes to joyn with him, the others being oblig'd alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent either as being their vaſſalls, or their friends.</p>
                        <p>The mighty preparations which were made in all thoſe nations for this war, could not be ſo ſecretly managed, but <hi>Cyaxares</hi> had notice given him of it, and leaſt this tempeſt, which ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly menac'd him, ſhould ſuddenly breake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46063:64"/>
his head and over-flow him unprovided, he quickly caus'd a numerous Army to be levied in his own kingdome, and wrote to <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> intreating him to joyn forces with him, ſince the intereſt to oppoſe theſe Enemies was equall to them both, and to conſtitute his ſon general of thoſe men he would ſend, becauſe he was ſo indeared to the <hi>Medes,</hi> and they built ſuch mighty confidence and hopes on his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, by thoſe early proofs he had already car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with his ſword when he was amongſt them, that they believ'd the greateſt helpe that ever heaven could lend them, would be the preſence, and conduct of that young Prince.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cambyſes</hi> hugg'd the propoſition of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> with the more willing embraces, becauſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eſteem they ſet upon his ſon concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo neerly. He caus'd thirty thouſand ſouldiers to be raiſed with all poſſible diligence over whom <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by the full vote of the Councel of war was elected general, and the very next day having caus'd his army to be rang'd in battalia, he eſtabliſht him in this high office, whilſt they were offering the ſacrifices, uſual on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the ayre was fil'd with extraordinary light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and thunders, which ſeem'd to ſpeak the gods conſent to this ceremony, to which the ſouldiers repeated a thouſand loud acclamations of joy, which they ſent up to Heaven for his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
                        <p>The air in fine having recover'd the beauty of its former ſerenity, <hi>Cyrus</hi> impoſed ſilence thorow the whole Army, and ſtanding in an eminent

The appointed day being come, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> would needs accompany him to the borders that were contiguous to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> (where being arrived a mighty Eagle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard flying at his right hand) and having taken his laſt leave of his Father, and the gods of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> at his entrance into <hi>Media</hi> he adored their deities, and went to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his unckle, who was advanced very near the frontires to receive him, and teſtified by all the becoming tokens of civility and affection, the joy and infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he reſſented at his arrival.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cyrus</hi> who as yet had let in no other paſſions to governe his young ſoule, but the ambition to improve the glory of his courage, hearing the Enemies were yet at a great diſtance, imploy'd his time in the continual exerciſes of war, for which he ordained many prizes which he moſt commonly won fairely himſelf, with more agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and skill then fortune: but at length being tyr'd with their long ſtay, fearing leaſt the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delights of that country ſhould ruſt or enervate his ſouldiers wonted courage, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his unckle to give him leave to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> whoſe tedious delay ſhew'd ſome unwillingneſs in them to come to any blowes, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> who ſtudied nothing but to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46063:66"/>
defend himſelf, becauſe he knew his numbers leſs then the Enemies and being ever poſſeſs'd with a kind of feare, made the arrival of ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors the pretext to ſtay him, ſhowing him the neceſſity there was that he ſhould know the ſubject of their negociation before he precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his affairs, Theſe Ambaſſadors being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted audience, declar'd the command they had from their King to ſpeak with him, and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarch, to know, what reaſons moved them to make war, and aſcertain thoſe that ſhould proceed moſt juſtly, of a powerful aſſiſtance from him, on their behalf, and after they had learn'd from <hi>Cyaxares</hi> own mouth, that he arm'd himſelf only to withſtand the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and bridle their inſolence, and ambition, they took their leaves of him, and bearing away with them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that detain'd <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they left him full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to preſs his march with more eagerneſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cyaxares</hi> nevertheleſs, who believ'd he wanted as much ſtrength as he did courage, indeavour'd by many conſiderations to keep them back ſtill, the cheifeſt there of being a want of money at that preſent, which is the only ſoule, and life of war. But this which he propounded as an obſtacle, ſpur'd him on with the greater ſpeed, and gave the firſt motion to his generous expeditions, which have rais'd him ſince to the proudeſt pitch of glory that ever Conquerour could hope or wiſh: for being perfectly acquainted with all his uncles affairs, he remembred that he had heard ſay <hi>Artaban</hi> the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> had refus'd to pay him the tribute of fifty talents which he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46063:66"/>
ow'd him for thoſe Provinces that <hi>Aſtiages</hi> had formerly conquer'd, nor was he very haſty to anſwer their demands of thoſe troops he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to furniſh them withall: wherefore he told <hi>Cyaxares</hi> that he ought to begin his war firſt with his own rebells, that ſo he might not have any domeſtick Enemies within his bowels, and that by reducing <hi>Artaban</hi> to his becoming Devoir, it would caſt a bridle on the remainder of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects necks, and keep them in the roade of due obedience.</p>
                        <p>This propoſition having been canvas'd, and conſulted on in the Counſel of war, was found to be very rational, and they judg'd it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to attaque the <hi>Armenian,</hi> who fed his ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne inſolency, only with the faire promiſes of protection from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> For this purpoſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> made a great match of hunting thereby to draw ſome troops, under that colour, neer the mountains of <hi>Armenia</hi>; and <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> to take of all ſuſpition of any ſuch deſign, feigned that he went to viſit the frontier garriſons in perſon, in each of which he left a good number of ſouldiers, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> afterwards ſecretly ſent under the command of <hi>Chryſante</hi> to poſſeſs themſelves of ſome paſſages, in the mountains, of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
                        <p>Before <hi>Artaban</hi> could be informed of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, <hi>Cyrus</hi> diſpatched a Courier to him, by whom he gave him notice that he was entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his dominions to receive that money, and thoſe ſouldiers he was obliged to furniſh his uncle with, or to fetch them in perſon at the head of a potent army, who would ſoon wring
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46063:67"/>
this out of his hands, if he refus'd a preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.</p>
                        <p>Never was Prince more perplexed, or amazed then <hi>Artaban</hi> at this demand, he never could i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> having ſuch puiſſant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could think of any thing but to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: the promiſe he had made to the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> not to ſend any aſſiſtance to the <hi>Medes,</hi> and the preſence of a reſolute Army which threatned to force him to his devoir, ſuſpended his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a while.</p>

After ſeveral interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations made to him, this unhappy King could alledge nothing to excuſe his rebellion but the deſire to gain an abſolute liberty for his ſucceſſor, by ſhaking of the yoke of being tributary, he made him firſt acknowledge how unjuſtly he had refus'd to furniſh his uncle with the men and money he demanded, having ſo good title to them, and how baſely he had proffer'd aſſiſtance to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> with whom he had ſecretly treated, and having afterwards asked him how he would chaſtiſe a vaſſal that ſhould thus betray him, he drew that neceſſary condemnation out of his own mouth, which ſentenc'd him to death.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt <hi>Cyrus</hi> was imploy'd about this ſad doom, <hi>Chryſante</hi> arriv'd, who brought in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Queen and her children as priſoners: but to obey the command he receiv'd from his Uncle to put that miſerable Prince to death, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ordered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that they ſhould not ſuffer them to come together, nor let them in the leaſt know what was intended, to ſhun that conflict of compaſſion which their tears, and the rigour of his duty would raiſe in his noble breaſt.</p>

forth from the Tent circled within a Guard of Souldiers, with a viſage whereon the expectation of death had already epitomized all his fears and horrors, ſhe threw her ſelf down ſuddenly with bitter cryes; and renting the vail which covered her head, with extream violence, ſhe furiouſly bent her precipitate ſteps toward thoſe that held <hi>Artaban,</hi> endeavouring with earneſt prayers, and interrupted reproaches, and threats to wreſt him from their hands; when <hi>Cyrus</hi> warn'd of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order by the ſad noiſe and moans which reach'd his ear, came forth to know the Original of it.</p>
                        <p>The fury of this almoſt diſtracted woman, whom he knew not to be the <hi>Armenian</hi> Queen at firſt ſurpriz'd him, and being told by one of the Souldiers who it was, he approach'd to appeaſe her: but ſhe continued ſtill her fruitleſs violence, perſiſting in her mournful cryes, that they ſhould either lead her with <hi>Artaban,</hi> or kill her preſently? till being told that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was there preſent, ſhe no ſooner knew him, but falling at his feet, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing her furious tone, changing it into accents of ſupplication; ſhe implor'd him with all the melting language thoſe dolorous paſſions could ſuggeſt to one, who having already loſt her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty, beheld her Husband led away in chains, by whom alone ſhe could conceive the ſmalleſt glimpſe of hope to be reſtor'd to any happineſs again. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was ſtooping juſt to raiſe her up when the noiſe of ſome approaching Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers interrupted his civility. They brought him a new priſoner, whom at firſt ſight he had no cognizance of, but which the Queens redoubled
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46063:69"/>
ſhrieks, and cryes ſoon made him know. It was the Prince <hi>Tygranes,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Artaban,</hi> who is at preſent in this Army, he being then juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from a Voyage he had made, fell into the <hi>Perſians</hi> hands, before he was acquainted that any Enemies had footing in his Fathers Country. His Mother no ſooner ſpied him, but ſhe cryed out ſo dolefully that it increaſed his aſtoniſhment, and the beholders pitty; and you dear Son, will you be likewiſe one addition more to our heap of ſorrow? the anger of the gods would not be fully ſatisfied, if their injuſtice had not drag'd you hither, to compleat the ſad cataſtrophe of our ruine. Come, come, approach yet nearer Son: ſuffer him, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to ſee his Father once before he dyes. Conſider, <hi>Tygranes,</hi> in what a loſt condition is <hi>Artaban</hi>? and how undone your Mother, Wife, Siſter, and all relations are, and then, ô tell me wherefore you came hither? but you unmerciful and angry deities, why have you brought him to us? is it to catch the falling Crown and Scepter, and ſupport the reeling Throne which your injuſtice batters down ſo cruelly. Ha! no, 'tis to involve the heyre, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the other leſſer reliques of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Family, in one general deſtruction, leaſt any ſhould ſurvive our rugged fate. You gods therefore, I do retract my former words, for I perceive there is ſome kind of equity in your judgements, it being more juſt, if our ruine be ſo inevitable, that we ſhould fall together, then that any ſhould be reſerved to weep our ſad calamity. Come near my Son, come children, come, cry'd

ſhe in a ſharper tone, calling thoſe who ſtood at a little diſtance, fetter us altogether, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the ſame chain, and if you can be ſo merciful in your cruelty, let one blow put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to all our miſeries, for this will be a more welcome favour than alone to raviſh <hi>Artaban</hi> from us. Her ſwelling ſorrows ſtopt the current of further diſcourſe, and the frequent ſobs, and ſighs that throng'd out of her boſome, left her no other power of expreſſion, but her fugitive tears.</p>
                        <p>Mean while, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was wrapt into the greateſt aſtoniſhment that could be; <hi>Tygranes</hi> had been otherwhile his particular friend, they having had their breeding together in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                        <p>The unhappineſs of this Prince, and the Queens tears fill'd his eyes with horror, and his heart with pitty. He knew not whether he ſhould anſwer the Mothers moving plaints, to whom he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given full aſſurance of her own, and all her childrens lives, or comfort the Son whom the amazement of ſo unlooked for an accident had ſo ſurpriſed, that of all his ſences he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the uſe of none but his ſight, to be the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that funeſt ſpectacle.</p>
                        <p>His Father <hi>Artaban,</hi> who had not enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to ſtand the ſhock of his own particular miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, ſeem'd to increaſe it, when he was made acquainted with the miſerable condition of his Wife, and Children; and whether his grief were too great for expreſſion, or that the extremity of his affliction, ſeeming to ſting him beyond the help of conſolation, caſt him into diſpair, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46063:70"/>
hardens the moſt timorous ſpirits with reſolution, he now endeavour'd to comfort his Wife, and his Son <hi>Tygranes,</hi> ſhewing them that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was obliged to ſave the reſt of his Family by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and juſtice which ruin'd him; ſince they were no way guilty of that rebellion he had alone been Author and occaſion of. That they ought confidently to expect a milder treatment from his clemency than himſelf, becauſe his death would ſatisfie the reſſentments of <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and that they ſhould endeavour by their vertues to regain the glory of his Houſe, which he had ſo eclipſed, and ſtain'd by his perfidious act, proving by their future ſervices, and fidelity, how free they truly were from being his accomplices in that crime. He could not keep thoſe tears that hung at his blubbering eyes from ſtealing down his face, nor ſuppreſs a multitude of ſighs his grief tore from his heart, when he ended this generous diſcourſe, eſpecially when he beheld his young Son <hi>Phraorte,</hi> his Daughter <hi>Birinthea,</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa</hi> wife to <hi>Tygranes,</hi> whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had cauſed to be brought to him.</p>
                        <p>Never was any ſpectacle ſo mournful, pitty had ingraved ſo much ſorrow on each viſage, that it was difficult to diſcern the Conquerours from the Captives.</p>

<q>Ah Sir, what muſt we expect from this deep ſilence, is it an effect of the compaſſion our unhappineſs ſtirs up in your heart, or the ſeverity of your ſentence? what, is it not enough to take away the Crown and Scepter from a Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and ſo many Subjects from their King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out depriving a Woman of her Husband, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing the Father from ſo many children, who deſire nothing of all what they have loſt, but the liberty to dye preſently with them, or to have him remain a miſerable Captive amongſt them? does this Petition ſeem to be unjuſt? what right have you to deny death to us, ſince you believe it to be ſo juſt towards him? or if you do conceive him to be alone guilty, wherefore do you puniſh us more rigorouſly than him, letting us live with the regret for looſing him which is a thouſand times more ſenſible to us then death it ſelf? but I perceive what 'tis cauſes his condemnation, 'tis not your ſelf, Sir, nor the reſſentment of <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> that pittileſs, reaſon of State does murther him, and you fondly believe there is no more cauſe to fear, after the Leader of a Rebellion is thruſt out of the world: a poor conſideration, and weak argument of unadviſed policy, what then do you imagine the children of Kings, have ſuch low ſpirits, and ſo ſmall courage that in what ſtate ſoever they remain, they will not endeavour to revenge a Fathers death (who was ſo dear and tender in his affection to them) by all the means that hatred, and diſpair can ſtore them with; 'tis true indeed the head of ſuch a faction is thereby taken off; but know, Sir, 'tis a <hi>Hydra</hi>

which ſtill ſprouts new ones forth, and of all thoſe you now behold in your preſence, as <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> children, expect the ſame fixt reſolution ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye with him, or elſe perpetually to ſeek a full revenge. Or if, Sir, we are not criminal in your judgement, let your vertue appear in its full extent, do not confine it, generous Prince, within ſuch narrow and ſevere limits, let the Father taſte part of that mercy your clemency confers upon the children, who humbly implore the life of <hi>Artaban,</hi> which I perceive your own compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and noble ſoul prompts you to grant him; vouchſafe it therefore, Sir, and bind a King by this immortal obligation, to endeavour by his faithful ſervices hereafter, to teſtifie he holds the poſſeſſion of it only by your extraordinary good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And if you did believe he was able once to prejudice you, you may as well think him not altogether uſeleſs by making him your friend. Take away all the ſubjects of your apprehenſions from him, place your Souldiers in Garriſon in all the places of ſtrength in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and only leave him and his children wherewith to ſerve you in their own perſons, and to the <hi>Armenians</hi> (who love him too affectionately to ſuffer his loſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſſentment) the power to teſtifie the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſhall ſo juſtly owe you for their Princes life.</q>

as it was poſſible for a man to be, for one he ſo dearly cheriſhed, and that without thoſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing arguments he had alledged, the friendſhip they had contracted together during their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was but too powerful to obtain all that he could in reaſon deſire of him, but in this occaſion, what he demanded, depending not upon his will, but the devoir of his charge, and birth; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched him to accuſe his hard fate, and he ſhould evidently finde by the treatment which the reſt of the Family ſhould receive at his hands, that what he was compel'd to now, was utterly againſt the inclination he had to ſerve him.</p>
                        <p>He had no ſooner ended theſe Proteſtations, but, fore ſeeing that if he gave ear to their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaints, which had already awaken'd his heart to pitty, he ſhould not be able to reſiſt their clamorous petitions, he would have withdrawn himſelf within his Tent, commanding thoſe that held <hi>Artaban</hi> to conduct him where he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and <hi>Chryſante</hi> to withdraw his priſoners.

<q>Do not fly, my Lord, nor ſtifle all the thoughts of mercy in your breaſt decide, before you go, whether the children ſhall follow their Fathers doom, or the Father partake of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens fortune: or rather, ſacrifice them all to

your juſt anger to expiate <hi>Artabans</hi> crime, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve only him, ſince the gods will not gratefully accept a victime that is not truly pure, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate. And we being innocent, ſhall better ſatisfie their juſtice than he can, becauſe he is ſo guilty. Then ſtoping her ſpeech a while and finding he anſwered not a word; Ha cruel, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſhe, lifting up the vail which cover'd her face, and looking on him with a countenance whereon ſo many foot-ſteps of grief and ſorrow appear'd, as would have melted a heart of Braſs into compaſſion, thou reply'ſt nothing, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the proffer I make is fair to glut thy cruelty, and if thou art ſo greedy after blood there is more plenty for thee in our youthful veins, than in his aged body parched through time and labour; ſpeak cruel man, and if ever thou knew'ſt what bleſſing a Father is, or haſt the leaſt ſentiment of nature in thee, let that work ſome ſence of pitty in thy ſoul.</q>

them to do his utmoſt to obtain his pardon from <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> to whom he immediately wrot for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>When the Meſſenger, whom he had diſpatched, return'd and brought him word, that he might abſolutely diſpoſe of the life of <hi>Artaban,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he pleas'd to think convenient, this news did ſo fill his mind with a particular joy, and he found himſelf ſo puiſſantly intereſſed for <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> preſervation, ever ſince <hi>Birinthea</hi>'s mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he would be himſelf the bearer of it. He went to the place where they were yet detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed priſoners, where their divided fears and hopes held them in a trembling ſuſpence what would be the event concerning <hi>Artaban,</hi> whom at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment they entertain'd in a converſation compoſed more of ſighs, and tears, then words. His unexpected viſit ſurpriſed them extreamly, and they were timorouſly weighing in their thoughts the reaſons of it, which he cleared to them, by declaring the cauſe thereof: This bleſſed news notwithſtanding did not wipe off their tears, they wept for joy, as they had wept for grief, and in this firſt tranſport, whilſt they tender'd him millions of thanks for his infinite goodneſs, with all the ſubmiſſive acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were capable, <hi>Birinthea</hi> mov'd him no leſs by the reſſentment ſhe witneſſed for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and grace, then ſhe had done before, by thoſe bitter reproaches of cruelty ſhe charged him withall. He afterwards concluded the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pardon, he vouchſafed to <hi>Artaban,</hi> by which the King obliged himſelf to pay yearly double
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46063:73"/>
the tribute which <hi>Aſtiages</hi> had formerly impoſed and to give up all the places of ſtrength into <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares</hi> hands, and voluntarily offer'd beſides to furniſh him, towards this War, with forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and eight thouſand Horſe, and for ranſome of his perſon, and his wife, he intreated him to accept of all the treaſure his Father had left him, which amounted to about three hundred talents: and ſeeing he had nothing left remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſatisfie for his children, he claſped his arms about <hi>Cyrus</hi> knees, the tears hanging at either eye, and told him he refer'd them to his own genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, not being able to proffer any thing elſe but the aſſurance to pay that debt, by the continual exerciſe of his daily ſervices, and a plentiful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of all his noble obligations.</p>
                        <p>This manner of expreſſion touched <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the moſt ſenſible part of his vertue, who could not have ſuppreſſed his generoſity in things, for which he had leſs inclination, the Articles in fine were ſigned, and the <hi>Armenian</hi> King obtain'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what he had handſomely intreated, many choice favours which his hopes could not expect, on condition however that as an aſſurance of this treaty, the young <hi>Phraorte</hi> his Son, and his Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Birinthea,</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Media</hi> to remain as Hoſtages for their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                        <p>It would poſe me to tell you whether <hi>Cyrus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd this Princeſs, for his Unckle <hi>Cyaxares</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or his own inclination only, but this I am certain of, that after ſhe had dryed up her tears, and recover'd the luſtre of her beauteous face,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46063:73"/>
which thoſe clouds of grief and ſorrow had dreſs'd in mourning weeds, he was firſt conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to admire thoſe freſher graces, and then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt his admiration into this open acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that notwithſtanding the ſeverity of thoſe doctrines he had learnt in the Accademies of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> which denyed a Conqueror to look upon his Captives with any other eyes than thoſe of a Victor: yet it was impoſſible to behold ſo imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a beauty and not efform rather ſentiments of ſervitude and worſhip, then of triumph and Empire. This declaration, nevertheleſs, paſſed only for an expreſſion of galantry, and perhaps himſelf as then, believ'd it ſprung from his own mind on no other conſideration. He invited the Royal Family that ſame night to a ſumptuous Feaſt, and afterwards requeſted the Prince <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> (amidſt their other pleaſing diſcourſe of former acquaintance to which <hi>Cyrus</hi> had engaged him with much affection) to relate the Hiſtory of his life ſince the time they were ſeparated, from whence he now came when he was taken, and particularly in what alliance he had found ſo fair and vertuous a Princeſs as his wife, <hi>Tygranes</hi> ſatisfied his curioſity to the full, and told him all the marvellous accidents which had hapned in their amours, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> heard with infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and perhaps you would find as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the recital did I not fear ſo prolixe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion would tyre you.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hircanian</hi> Prince <hi>Gobrias,</hi> and <hi>Merame</hi> having told him they ſhould rejoyce exceedingly to be made partakers of it, he was diſpoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

to tell it them, when perceiving <hi>Hypocratides</hi> walking in the next Alley, he propounded to hear it rather from his relation, as being one who alwayes had a great ſhare in <hi>Tygranes</hi> fortune, and who was more fully acquainted with each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity.</p>
                        <p>They went joyntly to intreat him, and that Gentleman being glad of an occaſion to entertain ſo noble a ſociety, firſt intreated them to excuſe him, that he was oblig'd to commence with the Hiſtory of <hi>Arthemiſa</hi>'s Father and Brother, becauſe it was abſolutely neceſſary for the intelligence of the other, and then began after this manner.</p>

caſt his looks for this purpoſe on all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princeſes to find ſome object ſuitable to his condition; but whilſt he was thus in queſt, his unhappineſs met a woman, who under the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching appearance of a florid beauty, cover'd the poiſonous ſentiments of a moſt vicious ſoul. It was the cruel <hi>Erixone,</hi> whoſe luſtful flames kindled that diſſention which hath cauſed ſo much misfortune to her Family: having ſifted out his inclination, ſhe knew ſo well how to gain that Prince by her affected flatteries, that in fine, he married her maugre all thoſe reaſons of State which oppos'd his affection, all which he trampled under foot. The blindneſs of <hi>Cteſiphon</hi>'s love, and <hi>Erixone</hi>'s ambition, forged this ominous match: but this unhappy woman loving nothing in his perſon but the vain quality of Prince and Soveraign: being ſatisfied now with that, reſolv'd unlawfully to ſeek elſewhere for greater pleaſure, than <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> could feed her inſatiate brutality withal; inſpir'd with theſe deteſtable thou his and deſires, ſhe ſhot her poiſonous glances at every one in whom ſhe ſpied any lovelineſs; her aſpiring vanity ſoothing her with the fond belief, that none could poſsibly reſiſt her piercing eye, when it was edg'd with ſo much paſsion, nor refuſe the ſweeter correſpondency with her temptations: yet fearing leaſt the unwary indiſcretion of ſome, or the too reſerved prudence of others ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſque her wanton deſignes, ſhe thought it moſt ſecure to ſingle out one alone, and ſhe could find none more deſerving to be doated on then <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramene.</hi>

This ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretext was a long time the cover to diſguiſe her paſsion, and though ſhe were moſt ſubtil in her behaviour, yet could ſhe not make <hi>Theramene</hi> take notice of any thoughts beyond his Devoir. Not but that ſhe diſcover'd her ſelf apparently enough ſometimes, as he related ſince; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the purity of his ſoul being incapable to let in ſo ungrateful and horrid affection, he could not ſuſpect ſo baſe an ambuſh then.

ſhe conceiv'd as much violent hatred in the beginnings of her diſpair, as ſhe had cheriſhed love for him in her ſoul, ſhe reſolv'd to oppreſs the Princes vertue, if ſhe could not corrupt it, and in the means ſhe fought to ruine him, ſhe found the ſatisfaction of theſe two different paſſions which ſtrugled in her breſt, becauſe ſhe fixedly intended to throw off all diſſimulation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and break through the baſhful laws of Scruple, and nice decency, by making a manifeſt declaration of her love, to which if <hi>Theramene</hi> gave a willing ear, and correſpondency, hers ſhould be fully glutted in the fruition; and if he ſhould recoile by his too cold denials, ſhe voted ſuch a deep revenge, that he ſhould ſink under her enrag'd diſpleaſure, if he became not flexible to her more ſoft deſires.</p>
                           <p>This Princes extraordinary civility furniſhed her with frequent occaſions to execute her igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſigns, there was not a day paſs'd wherein he did not ſee her, he reſorted every morning to her Chamber as ſoon as decency permitted him a becoming entrance. One time above the reſt <hi>Creſiphon</hi> being ſomewhat indiſpoſed, ſent <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene</hi> to give her the <hi>bon-jour,</hi> and communicate certain affairs to her, ſhe made her maids and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men retire, and though ſhe were yet undreſs'd, led him to her Cloſſet under a pretence of telling him ſome important ſecret, and forbad any one to interrupt her. There was ſhe aſſaulted with the ſeveral paſſions of Love, and Hatred, Hope, and Diſpair Confidence, and Fear, and after ſome moments ſilence, in which a buſie eye might have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46063:76"/>
read her thoughts in her countenance, which though not truly underſtood by the Prince, did ſomewhat raiſe his aſtoniſhment, and invite him to beg the knowledge of the trouble he peruſed in her face, (ſo often ſhifted from its natural ſweetneſs, into betraying bluſhes) ſhe ſet two or three ſighs at liberty, and darting her looks upon him fuller of Love, than Anger. <hi>Ha Prince,</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>What do you expect more! would you have a clearer evidence, or more apparent teſtimonies of that which I have endeavoured ſo long time to reveal? are you alone inſenſible in the world? and nature that has enjewel'd you with all the exquiſite qualities that can render a man admirable in a Soveraign degree, has ſhe depriv'd you of all ſentiments of Love, as well to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of others, as your ſelf.</hi>

                           <p>The Prince was ſo amazed with this diſcourſe, that he could not get his troubled thoughts to ſhape out any anſwer, he heard indeed ſhe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the name of Love, but could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend from whence this declaration proceeded, or why it was addreſs'd to him, and therefore they ſtood gazing a long time upon one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pronouncing a ſillable, but ſhe recovering her ſpirits again, went on thus. <hi>You are ſurprized me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, as if it were news for Love to raign in a young heart, or that a woman as I am were capable to affect, and adore a man like you, have I now explained my ſelf and broken the Ice enough? do you now underſtand my looks, and thoughts, or muſt I bring more light yet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo fair a flame? your ſilence which cannot be in you a ſign of ſtupidity, is it a mark and effect of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain you have for me? am I too poor in beauty? or is my

<q>Madam, I now
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46063:77"/>
find that true which had been ever ſaid of love, if it be poſſible that you love me in ſuch a manner as you have expreſs'd your ſelf, the blindneſs of that paſſion has ſo hood-winkt your ſight and memory, that you have quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten who I am, you do not remember, Madam, that I am <hi>Cteſiphons</hi> ſon, that <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> is your dearer husband, and you his lawful wife: this is enough, and this weighty conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were ſufficient to inſtruct you that I have been as little capable of ingratitude as inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility on your behalf, ſince I ought not to be ſuſceptible of any love for you, as I muſt needs beleeve you do but feigne towards me: but, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it was unneceſſary to repreſent you theſe conſiderations, to make you ſee a fault of which ſurely you are no wayes guilty, 'tis only I am ſo by thoſe unhappy ſuſpitions you have ſtarted, that I ſhould be ſo raſhly inſolent to hatch ſuch baſe deſires contrary to my duty, and reſpect; this declaration muſt be only to try me, I ſhould wrong your vertue to beleeve otherwiſe, for you have too much judgement.

                           <p>She ſtopt her ſpeech a while to fix her looks more ſtead faſtly upon him, hoping by thoſe hot glances to melt his frozen boſome, at which ſhe had ſo vainly knock'd for entrance with her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring words, but finding the ſweetneſs of her amorous beames had not that powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhe presum'd, and only excited more aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in him, ſhe reſum'd her ſpeech again, and tuning her tongue to the recover'd gaiety of her ſmiling countenance, ſaid to him in a cajoling accent;
<q>And wherefore would I not love you, ſince the devoir and vertue you object are, but bugg bear <hi>Chymera's,</hi> which the baſe jealouſy of men invented? I being more forcibly oblig'd to obey that fatality which ordains me to love you, then their poor fancies; <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> is not wrong'd in this, I love him enough to correſpond with his affection, and how little ſo ere I have for him, young as I am, I doe but ſatisfy, too much the paſſion of an old decrepit man.

child better then you doe of a wife, and I could almoſt ſtrangle thoſe conſiderations which tye my hands up from ſpeedily revenging the affront you caſt on <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> did I not cheriſh his honour more then you, my exaſperated indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould immediately light on your head.</q>
He went out haſtily after he had ended theſe words, and though he indeavour'd to compoſe his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet every one perceived his trouble and alteration.</p>

Love had reſign'd its throne to hatred with which inſtantly ſuggeſted a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand wayes to ruine him, of which her rage choſe the moſt bitter, but the moſt expedient for her purpoſe, intending to imploy the Father as an unhappy inſtrument to deſtroy his own ſon, as ſhe before deſign'd to make the child ſin againſt his Fathers honor. She reſolv'd to anticipate the complaints which <hi>Theramene</hi> might make, and the ſame moment this came into her mind ſhe left her cloſet to prepare her ſelf to goe ta <hi>Cteſiphon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>During the little portion of time ſhe waſted in dreſſing her ſelf, ſhe conſulted how ſhe might moſt cunningly prepoſſeſs her husbands mind: flattery and ſweetneſs ſeem'd the moſt catching, and deceitful, and ſo ſhe having decreed that, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46063:78"/>
being come in his preſence before he could have time to note the trouble in her face, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him by a moſt earneſt prayer whereby ſhe deſired him to grant her one favour.</p>
                           <p>The particulars which I ſhall now tel you, were diſcover'd to me by one of my friends who was then preſent, whom ſhe was glad to have for witneſs to publiſh her rare vertues, and the crime ſhe faſtned on <hi>Theramene. Cteſiphon</hi> who was not accuſtomed to refuſe her any thing, nor could deny the leaſt of her deſires, without informing himſelf of the particulars of her requeſt, gave her a full aſſurance that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an abſolure aſcendant over his will, ſhe might ſafely promiſe her ſelf all that was poſſible for him to grant. The better to delude <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> ſhe would not rely on his bare promiſes, ſhe made him firſt ſolemnly ſwear that he ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any reſſentment for a great injury which had been deſign'd againſt him, and that what ſhe now deſir'd with ſo much importunity was a full pardon for it. Theſe words of injury and pardon aſtoniſh'd <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> he knew not where to fix his thoughts, but <hi>Erixone</hi> who had as much ſubtilty as malice, having proteſted by ſome tokens of affection, which ſeemed to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with more truth then falſhood, that her intereſts being inſeparably united to his, ſhe would never have deſired the pardon of a fault, which were not excuſable in its nature, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in a perſon whom of all the world muſt be moſt deare unto him, ſhe thus prepar'd his ſpirit as ſhe pleas'd, and told him the crime was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46063:79"/>
love, the moſt venial of all ſins, and the ſubject <hi>Theramene</hi> that was guilty, who beſt of all men deſerved a free pardon, having imprudently ſuffer'd himſelf to be ſurpris'd with that paſſion towards her: but the violence of it having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to make an open declaration, ſhe hoped that ſhe had cured his diſtemper by thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances ſhe had made to him on that ſubject.</p>
                           <p>Here ſhe broke of her diſcourſe to ſee what effects it wrought in <hi>Cteſiphon's</hi> ſpirit, who could not keep in his anger. He loved <hi>Theramene</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not ſo paſſionately as he did <hi>Erixone,</hi> the render goodneſs which that woman had feigned towards his ſon, imploring his mercy for an act, which wounded him ſo mortally, touch'd him with the more fondneſs towards her, and vehemence againſt him, what, cry'd he <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramene</hi> is my greateſt Enemy, and my only ſon? He, he alone will raviſh from me my cheifeſt joy, you have too great a bounty, Madam, for ſo ignoble a perſon: if this crime were pardonable, it would be ſo in any other but himſelf, and if you truly love me, you will permit me to revoke the grace I had conceded at your petition, and ſhut my eyes on all the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature, for a ſon who tramples on them all towards his Father. What <hi>Theramene! Erix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi> who found it not ſo fitting to let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further at that time, ſtopt him with her diſſembled tears, and gently ſweetned his ſavage fury with theſe words.
<q>The gods know, <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> whether I love you, and without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other witneſs you likewiſe know it your ſelf,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46063:79"/>
the exceſs of my affection is ſufficiently evident in this occaſion, ſeeing the infinite care I take to preſerve your ſon. 'Tis that inſpires me with theſe deſires for him, though I am far more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly offended then if he had attempted againſt my life, I acknowledge he does wrong you? but 'tis in my own perſon, and you muſt confeſs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the higheſt affront is given to my devoir &amp; vertue: nevertheleſs, ſir, if ever you had any eſteem for me, and if there be the ſmalleſt roote of it remaining, vouchſafe the pardon for a fault which he committed involuntarily, ſince my unhappy beauty is the cauſe, and that it is a ſin of youth, rather then of his perſon; and if you doe deny this favour, never expect any content again from <hi>Erixone,</hi> her griefe would be above the remedy of conſolation, if after having caus'd unwittingly your ſon to love, ſhe ſhould be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the occaſion of his diſgrace, therefore if ere you purpoſe to endear me, prevent this laſt misfortune.</q>
                              <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> demonſtrated that <hi>Erixone</hi> was more choice to him in all reſpects then <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene,</hi> and as her intereſts was the chiefe ſubject of his anger, her prayers in fine calmed his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſhe wrought him ſo pliable to her will, that ſhe made him vow, he would never teſtify any diſpleaſure unleſs <hi>Theramene</hi> ſhould impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently repeate his baſe purſuites, which if he offer'd, ſhe promis'd him not to hinder his juſt anger and revenge.</p>
                           <p>You may note in this occaſion, that if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times jealouſy has been more powerful then love, love in this did triumph over jealouſy; ſhe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46063:80"/>
did not intend to ſmoother his reſſentments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, but only bridle their violence for a time. <hi>Erixone</hi> had ſo much ſway over her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands paſſions, that ſhe not only fully perſwaded him to her mind, but having made him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be the miniſter of her vengeance, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd him ſtill the more in his fond beleef of her affection by the intereſt ſhe diſſembled in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning his dear ſon. Some ſmall time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which ſhe had purpoſely ſlipt over to hide her malice, having pent in her husbands wrath only to make it burſt forth with the greater violence when ſhe thought fitting, ſhe judg'd it would not be convenient to defer it any longer, leaſt the Princes more ſevere vertue, who omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to complain out of reſpect, being ſtirred with the importunity of new ſolicitations ſhould be forc'd to break his modeſt ſilence, ſhe declar'd to <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> that not being any longer able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the daily inſolencies of his ſon, ſhe wiſh'd him to provide for the ſecurity of her honour, and to abuſe him the more neatly, ſhe councel'd him to imploy, if it were feeſible, no other meanes but ſweetneſs to reclaim him.</p>
                           <p>This unhappy Father whoſe judgement was corrupted through his jealouſy, and who from his ſons countenance, that never could appear in <hi>Erixones</hi> preſence, but with much change and alteration, had falſely gueſs'd it to be an effect of love and not that noble indignation he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt her, reſolved to ſacrifice him to his paſſion, and ſent the Captain of his guards for that purpoſe to ceaze upon his perſon, with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46063:80"/>
ſtrickt command to ſecure him in a Caſtle, a little diſtant from the City, till he ſhould further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how to diſpoſe of him.</p>
                           <p>I was with <hi>Theramene</hi> when they firſt took him, that Prince having ever perfectly honor'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſubmitted without reſiſtance to thoſe who had the order to apprehend him, and not being able to imagine the cauſe of his reſtraint, told them aloud, that though he knew himſelf to be purely innocent, he would freely follow them even to his own death, to ſatisfy his Father, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom perhaps he was too guilty, ſince he was ſo unhappy, as to have given him cauſe to think ſo. I accompanied this poore Prince into the Priſon, where his guards likewiſe kept me till they had order for my freedome; whilſt I was with him, he communicated all that paſs'd twixt himſelf and <hi>Erixone</hi> to me, and not finding himſelf fat all guilty of any thing, but the disdain of her baſe luſt, he knew he could incurr only the hatred his averſion had bred in her, and could conceive no other reaſon for his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that ſhe who had been ſo wicked, as to entertain ſo deteſtable a paſſion, taking a pique at his refuſal, had certainly accus'd him of ſome horrid crime againſt his Father; theſe words bred new aſtoniſhment within me, for the opinion every one had lived in of <hi>Erixone's</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vertues, ſeem'd to render this impoſſible; ſhe had ſo craftily manag'd her affection, that none had ever diſcover'd the leaſt ſpark: but it was more impoſſible for <hi>Theramene</hi> to ſpeak falſely; I had a particular eſteem for him, and the amity he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46063:81"/>
honour'd me withal as his Privado, and confident in his moſt ſecret actions, was capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to any thing. After I had made ſome ſhort reflexions on ſo ſtrange an accident, and had proffer'd him all that depended on my beſt ſervices, on the aſſurance he was intirely poſſeſt of my Faith, he commanded me to ſee <hi>Learchus</hi> the ſame, that was preſent, as I told you, when <hi>Erixone</hi> accuſed <hi>Theramene</hi> before his Father, and becauſe he was intimate with <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and that he alone was his chiefe counſellor, he thought I might learne ſome thing from him concerning his confinement.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Learchus</hi> was extremely my friend, an honeſt man, and one that had teſtify'd as much affection as reſpect towards the Prince, I went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to viſit him, and having ſpoken ſomewhat of <hi>Theramene's</hi> impriſonment, he proteſted he was a ſtranger in the knowledge of it. The little aſtoniſhment however which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in his words and actions, perſwaded me that he was not altogether ignorant of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; therefore I ſifted him more narrowly, and conjured him at laſt in the Princes name, to tell me what he knew. <hi>Learchus</hi> at this, looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly upon me, anſwer'd, he much admir'd the Prince doubted of the cauſe, and ſought to learn it from others, becauſe he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> who loved him ſo tenderly would treate him ſo ſeverely, unleſs he had moſt urgent reaſons for it, and that his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could better informe him, then any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. When I perceiv'd he ſpake ſo ſparingly, I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46063:81"/>
told him what <hi>Theramene</hi> ſuſpected, he anſwer'd me, that there was more diſguiſe then verity in that ſuſpition, and that if the Prince were not minded to conceale his thoughts, I might as he beleev'd eaſily gueſs the ſubject of his disfavour. Not being able in fine to diſcover any further at that time, I made a faithful report of all he ſaid to <hi>Theramene,</hi> and <hi>Learchus</hi> was as ready in relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all what I had asked him for <hi>Cteſiphon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Father blinded under the double vail of love and jealouſy together, commanded <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> to goe to the Prince, and reproach him how much his crime was offenſive without adding this impudent diſguiſe, and the effrontery to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her, whoſe innocency was fully enough vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, by the more then common care and goodneſs ſhe imploy'd to excuſe him. <hi>Learchus,</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Theramene</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> punctually diſcharg'd the duty of a faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: his amity towards the Prince could not make him ſwerve, and though it did imprint compaſſion for his misfortunes, his due obedience and the blackneſs of the crime, of which he was accus'd, oblig'd him to repreſent, with bitter reproaches, that guilt which mov'd him the more ſenſib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>, becauſe he was moſt innocent of it.</p>
                           <p>The ſmall change it wrought upon the Prince; abated the edge of his ſeverity, he reade the motions of juſt anger upon his viſage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the lineaments of perſecuted vertue there, but not the leaſt character of a guilty conſcience, which uſually imprints it ſelfs condemnation on
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46063:82"/>
the face, and therefore he gave a very willing and patient eare to the diſcourſe he made in his own defence. And whether, or no, he were before perſwaded of <hi>Theramenes</hi> fault, he now return'd in ſome doubt of his innocency, and was more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over inclining to a full beleefe of it, if that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity which ſo ordinarily prepoſſeſſes men to credit the firſt impreſſions, had not yet ſuſpended his opinion. The relation he made to <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> found not the ſame ſucceſs, he rather would faſten the crime upon his ſon, then his wife, and <hi>Learchus</hi> had no ſmall a doe to oppoſe the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he had taken to put him inſtantly to death, by ſhewing him how neceſſary it was to have more certaine evidence, and ſtronger proofes.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Erixone</hi> who well fore-ſaw, that if he had the leaſure to deveſt himſelf of paſſion, and lure his reaſon to her ſeate again, which now did wildly flutter, he would ſcent out her ſecret projects, and turn the horrid tempeſt of revenge upon her head, mightily preſs'd to have him puniſhed; <hi>Learchus</hi> defer'd it alwayes, and knew ſo wiſely to interpoſe the importance of ſuch a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> that he yeilded to the Princes friends, and eſpecially, to the Princeſs <hi>Arthemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's</hi> moving prayers, to have him confronted with <hi>Erixone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To this effect they brought <hi>Theramene</hi> forth of his priſon, who appear'd before his father, and thoſe that were aſſembled there, with as much noble confidence, as <hi>Erixone</hi> did with trembling feare: this infamous wretch had woven her ſubtill accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46063:82"/>
with ſo many ſoft expreſſions of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her husband; and the Prince ſhaped his with ſuch becoming reſpects for his dear Father, that as I have already hinted, every one having ſo faire an opinion of both their vertues, would needs beleeve they were both innocent, and could not tell on whom to lay the guilt. The neceſſity hoever of deciding this controverſy, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided their opinions, and as it is impoſſible our inclinations ſhould be balanced ſo equally, as not to weigh more towards one then another, either of them had partiſans, who did ſuſpect the others crime and defend their beleeved innocency.</p>
                           <p>Amongſt thoſe who more particularly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed themſelves, one <hi>Tarſus</hi> embraced <hi>Erixone's</hi> cauſe, and <hi>Learchus</hi> ſtood for the Princes: the firſt inſiſted with more noiſe and heate, but the ſecond with more plenty of reaſon, inſomuch that the difficulty to give a certain judgement plung'd <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> into ſuch ſtrange perplexities, that according to the various motions of his trouble, he ſenſibly touch'd the Peoples hearts with pitty. <hi>What ſaid he, have I ſummoned you here to leave me in the labyrinth of a doubt, I thought your judgements would have ſoon unravil'd? And if we have no cleerer proofes of the crime and innocency, with what juſtice can we chaſtice the one, and recompenſe the other? Cruell inquietudes, how am I involv'd what to judge of my wife, or ſon? Oh ſad neceſſity which fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordains me to looſe one or other, if heaven would needs find me an enemy, could it not with more juſtice have cul'd out any others, but ſuch as owes me as much love, as I did cheriſh for them; but what ſhall we deliberate

Speake wife, reply my Son? to which of you am I become ſo hateful, which muſt I looſe of the two that are ſo infinitely deare unto me, and to whom I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanted in my affection.

                              <hi>Erixone</hi> would have ſpoken likewiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who during his diſcourſe had by her often ſhifted counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance given many infallible tokens of her crime, if any one had ſtudiouſly perus'd it: but <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> ſtarting up, much troubled, commanded the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to return with the Prince, and retir'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Cloſet, whence coming forth again, <hi>Erixone</hi> who attended him, threw her ſelf at his feet, and feigning a deſpair, fearing her life in danger, ſhe ſob'd forth theſe words before a great number of people. <hi>Wherefore do you defer my death, my Lord, if you eſteem me guilty? Is it becauſe you know, that it would be a more welcome puniſhment than the ſuſpition you have of my infidelity: Yes my Lord, I have plainly diſcern'd, that</hi> Theramene<hi>'s artificial plea has gain'd more credit than my ſingle vertue, 'tis fit you ſhould ruine a woman to preſerve a Traytor, becauſe he is your only Son and heir, I ſhall appeal no farther, but to give this laſt aſſured and becoming teſtimony of my love, I am reſolv'd to dye for him, ſince in the doubt you dwell, I can no longer be affected by you.

I wrong'd my ſelf moſt in this caſe, ſince I oppos'd my own hotteſt deſires, which makes me languiſh to deſerve as great returns of love from you, as I cheriſh for you: the evidences which you give me of your affection, oblige me to a full retaliation, and are ſufficient to aſſert the crime of that perfidious child, whoſe ſudden chaſtiſement ſhall ſatisfie your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and my provoked anger.</hi> He told her a great

                           <p>There he reſolv'd poor <hi>Theramene</hi> ſhould dye, but the moſt ſecretly that might be poſſible, to prevent the clamour, and commotions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſome Officers who dearly reſpected him. This black deſign however could not be contrived ſo ſecretly, but one might eaſily ſee it on wicked <hi>Erixones</hi> joyful face, which ſhe endeavour'd not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to hide, by a diſſembled intermiſſive ſorrow for her Husbands trouble. <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> who watch'd inceſſantly to preſerve her brother, was advertis'd ſecretly by ſome that <hi>Theramene</hi> had but a ſhort ſpace to live, and that it was high time to ſet all poſſible means a work to ſave him.</p>
                           <p>She had diſcover'd a clandeſtine intelligence betwixt <hi>Erixone</hi> and <hi>Tarſus,</hi> which gave her much apprehenſion, becauſe ſhe knew that man ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the higheſt nature, and one capable of any miſchief.

                              <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> the cloſer to conceal his pernicious intentions againſt his Son, treated him with leſs ſeverity then he had done before, his friends had the liberty to viſit him, and <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go for ſome dayes to a Country Houſe, twenty Leagues diſtant from the City, would take her farewell of him. The reſpect all gave her, facilitated her Noble deſign: every one retyr'd when ſhe came to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and then ſeeing her ſelf alone, ſhe in a few words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the intention ſhe had to change habits with him, that ſhe might remain in his ſtead in the Priſon, whilſt he eſcap'd in her diſguiſe. <hi>Theramene</hi> being at firſt ſurpriz'd with this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, would have offer'd ſome conſiderations on this enterprize, and eſpecially the perill he ſhould leave her under: but <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the leaſure to conſult his prudence, quickly made him diſroabe himſelf, and dreſt him in her own cloaths. If their ſeparation had not been ſo ſudden, <hi>Theramene</hi> would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd more fully to his deareſt Siſter, how much this rare effect of love obliged him: but finding himſelf compell'd to be gone, after they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd with infinite affection, he quitted her, and paſſing through the midſt of the two firſt Courts of Guard, he acted her part and geſture ſo handſomly, that the Souldiers deluded by the perfect reſemblance of his viſage, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he hid in part, and his ſhape and habit, thought him to be <hi>Arthemiſa.</hi>

                           <p>He was already deſcended into the firſt Court, and now thought he had no more to fear, when

looking towards the Gate he perceiv'd <hi>Sitalces</hi> coming, the Nepveu of <hi>Tarſus,</hi> who in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontation had pleaded for <hi>Erixone</hi>: This ſight at firſt amaz'd him, but quickly recovering and imboldning himſelf, he haſtned his pace to meet him under the Gate, which being more obſcure he judged it would the better cover his diſguiſe; yet he could not prevent <hi>Sitalces</hi> from abording him before he came to it, who eſpying him afar off, and thinking him to be the Princeſs, had imediately alighted, and came with more then ordinary ſpeed to meet him. I am confident you are in as much impatience to know the ſucceſſe of this rencontre as <hi>Theramene</hi> was in fear, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he counterfeited as well as he could poſſibly the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> Civility, and excuſing his great haſte, becauſe it was very late, went with a winged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to his Siſters Chariot, which waited at the Gate, without being diſcover'd.</p>
                           <p>I attended near that Road by which the <hi>Princeſs</hi> went to the Caſtle, with a dozen of my intimate friends, about two miles diſtant in a thick wood, where as ſoon as he arrived, not ſtaying ſo long as to change his Cloaths, we mounted him on Horſe-back, and ſwiftly gallop'd through many by-wayes to a little Town whereof I was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, reaching thither after midnight: And after we had there refreſhed our Selves alittle while changing our Horſes, we bent our courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Armenia,</hi> where we were received by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taban</hi> and <hi>Tygranes</hi> his Son, with all the civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we could deſire. But whilſt <hi>Theramene</hi> is in ſecurity, and puts the whole Court to their

wonder at his rare qualities, let us ſtep back alit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to <hi>Arthemiſa,</hi> and ſee in what manner ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <hi>Sitalces,</hi> who inſtantly demanded to ſee the Prince, and whom ſhe had diſcovered out of her Window when he aborded her brother, not knowing what had paſſ'd ſince. The fear which that doubt had thrown on her, taught her to ſend him word that being ſomewhat indiſpoſed, and deſiring to take alittle reſt, there was no poſſibility of receiving a viſit that day. <hi>Sitalces</hi> ſatisfied with that excuſe, without ſuſpecting any further, returned to Court again, with the newes of this feigned Malady: <hi>Erixone</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Alarmed with it, and fearing this ſickneſs might rob her of the Subject of her revenge, ſhe went immediately to <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> and ſolicited him to ſend to know the verity. The Meſſenger could not come to ſee her, becauſe She made as if She ſoundly ſlept, the longer to conceal her ſelf, and give her Brother the more ſcope to get away, ſo that after he had throughly informed himſelf of thoſe that waited uſually on <hi>Theramene,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> that the Prince was taken ill, but ſince the departure of <hi>Arthemiſa.</hi>

                              <hi>Erixone</hi> who was of an extraordinary mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and diſtruſtful Spirit, began to entertain ſome doubts, that the Princes indiſpoſition was onely a pretence whereby to forge ſome means for an eſcape, which perhaps <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> or ſome other had undertaken to manage for him. The abſence of that Princeſs, mine and my friends together increas'd her Inquietudes and Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, ſo that ſhe reſolv'd either to loſe her
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46063:86"/>
hopes of full revenge, or bring it to effect the night following. At the ſame moment ſhe ſought out <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and knew ſo well by preſſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to repreſent the likelihood of her ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hide her own guilt of conſcience, that the unhappy father conſented to put his Son to death before he ſhould have opportunity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Intended flight, which they believed was projected, and which the Subtil <hi>Erixone</hi> had urg'd would be her husbands ruine. <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> gave warrant preſently, and <hi>Tarſus</hi> had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to provide Executioners, and ſee it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; the night was extreamly tenebrous, and I believe the Heavens had ſpread their blackeſt Sables to maſque their ſight from ſuch a horrid ſpectacle, and withall ſecure <hi>Theramene</hi> in his Journey: when <hi>Athemiſa</hi> heard a rude knocking at her Chamber Door, where none had yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince ſhe diſſembled ſleep. This Inſolence, and the ſufficient time ſhe thought ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured her brother for his ſafety, made her fling open the Door immediately: When the Captain of the Guard advancing himſelf, preſented her a Letter, which contain'd the Sentence for <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramene</hi> to dye, ſign'd with his Fathers own hand. She had no ſooner read it, but ere that Officer could have the time to diſcover her, ſhe with a gallant Confidence ask'd for the Executioners which were appointed, and he that had brought the Order; When <hi>Tarſus</hi> approached to make a bad excuſe, that againſt the inclination he had to ſerve him, he was conſtrain'd to obey the Kings abſolute command, who would needs by this Act
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46063:86"/>
make a particular tryal of his Fidelity. <hi>Arthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa</hi> could not contain her ſelf any longer, but was confirmed in the Opinion ſhe had conceived, that the cloſe Intellegence this Wicked Fellow held with <hi>Erixone</hi> was an effect of Love and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: <hi>I had reaſon, Hang-man, ſaid ſhe to him, to expect this Commiſſion ſooner from thee then any other, 'tis this thou haſt ſo long been hammering with</hi> Erixone, <hi>and ſure enough thou haſt promis'd</hi> Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene<hi>'s Head to that Luſtful Adultreſſe for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of her wanton Favours, but thanks to Heaven and their Juſtice, thou art deceiv'd</hi> Tarſus, <hi>thou ſhalt not this day take away my Deareſt Brothers Life: But if thy black Commiſſion extends to</hi> Arthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa, <hi>fulfill it Traytor, come Command thy cruel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to Deſtroy me, I will not oppoſe, provided I can but ſave my</hi> Theramene; Here ſhe diſcovered her ſelf, and ſurprized all that were preſent with that aſtoniſhment, which you may better gueſſe then I diſcribe. <hi>Tarſus</hi> wrapt with amazement at this Accident, and the juſt reproaches ſhe aſſaulted him withal, retreated ſneakingly without a word, and preſently gave information thereof to <hi>Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> and <hi>Erixone,</hi> whom he found together; the one buried in ſadneſs and diſcontent for being obliged to murther a Son, the other netled with impatience to hear the certainty of his death, whoſe life was ſo obnoxious to her. It ſeem'd that <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> though he were not yet penitent for his fault, ſhew'd no great ſignes of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for his Childs eſcape by <hi>Arthemiſa</hi>'s aid, but keeping his wonted poſture of deep Melancholy, he told <hi>Erixone</hi> ſhe muſt excuſe a Siſters indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46063:87"/>
affection towards her Brother, becauſe it ſprung but from the root of Nature and Reaſon: but that ſhe muſt expect the puniſhment of his crime would fall upon his head from Heaven it ſelf, ſince 'twas not in their power, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the gods reſerved this vengeance to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make it the more weighty, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary.</p>
                           <p>Whilſt this diſconſolate Father, after his trouble had made him chuſe his bed, began to think of tenderneſs towards his Children; <hi>Erix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi>'s Sentiments flow'd from another Spring, her diſpair made her diſtracted with rage, ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd no other deſignes, but to ſacrifice all ſhe could to her own ſafety, and to Authorize her firſt crime by a greater, ſhe wrote a Ticket to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> by which ſhe injoyn'd him to come to her, as ſoon as day appear'd, to ſettle their affairs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer convenient to boggle or diſſemble, but to ſecure their lives and their contentment, to the deſtruction and coſt of all thoſe that might oppoſe them. The trouble and perplexity ſhe was in, made her utterly forget the ſtrickt order which <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> at her importunate Solicitation, had given that evening, to ſuffer none to go forth leaſt they ſhould uſe ſome means to ſtop the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Son: ſo that it hapned to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, though he that carried it had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized his Meſſage with the name of <hi>Erixone,</hi> and it was immediately delivered to <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the command impos'd on all the Officers. There was no need to rouze him from his ſleep, the wracking thoughts which were his bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46063:87"/>
with their unquietneſs had ever kept him waking, and when they preſented the Ticket to him, the paſſions he had towards <hi>Erixone</hi> were newly entred in his mind. He was powerfully ſurpriz'd, finding ſuch ſecret correſpondence twixt her and <hi>Tarſus,</hi> which he was ignorant of before: but prepoſſeſs'd with love and fondneſs, he at firſt imagin'd that ſhe ſummon'd him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to aſſert her innocency, then to back her crime: but preſently theſe thoughts were ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd out again, to make way for the ſuſpitions, his jealouſie began to inſpire, and till morning was renew'd; he lay in a moſt cruel agony of trouble, and then haſtily aroſe to ſpeak with <hi>Erixone,</hi> who expected <hi>Tarſus</hi> with a ſtrange im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience.</p>
                           <p>I muſt impoſe a neceſſary ſilence on my tongue, and intreat your Judgements to conceive how infinitely ſhe was ſurpriz'd when <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> entred her Chamber, and accoſted her with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>What need She had of</hi> Tarſus <hi>for her ſafety, and if he were not ſufficient to protect her from any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, what diſorder ſhe apprehended in her affairs, what buſineſs ſhe had conceal'd ſo ſecretly, which the preſent conjuncture obliged her no longer to diſſemble; in a word, who were thoſe that durſt have attempted againſt her life?</hi> This diſcourſe ſo affrighted her, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admoniſhed by her guilty conſcience, ſhe wanted little of caſting her ſelf at his feet, to ſupplicate for pardon of thoſe crimes ſhe thought he had diſcovered: but being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impudent, with the ſame bold confidence ſhe had undertaken them, ſhe pleaded excuſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46063:88"/>
for having been obliged to ask the councel of <hi>Tarſus,</hi> whom ſhe knew to be a man ſo faithful, and affectionate in his Princes Service, to defend her innocency openly, which was the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuſpition, becauſe perſecuted by his own Children, whoſe intereſt ſhe knew his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct would ſooner incline him to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate then hers: and that it was not the care to ſave her life that troubled her, but to maintain her honour, to prevent his unjuſt jealouſie from charging her exceſſive love with blame, which ſhe preſerved ſo devoutly towards him. <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> having anſwered her diſſembled expreſſions of feigned affection with his more ſincere acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements, returned thence, as fully perſwaded and ſatisfied, as was poſſible with her diſcourſe, As ſoon as ere he had quitted the Chamber, <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> arrived there, to whom ſhe made ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſucceſs of that accident, which ſo much ſtartled him that ſhe began to fear he would not have the reſolution to perform what ſhe had already projected.</p>
                           <p>In this apprehenſion ſhe courted and ſolicited him by all the probable conſiderations, and eſpecially thoſe of ambition and love, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to her deſign; and in fine, perceiving he ſtill waver'd, ſhe repreſented the danger and laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of their affairs ſo preſſingly, that as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair ſteeles the moſt leaden courage, ſhe engaged him in all her undertakings, and leaſt his blood ſhould coole, or his Spirit turn edge thorow long delay, ſhe put him immediately to carry on the Plot, going to her Husband, juſt when <hi>Arthemiſa</hi>
                              <pb n="161" facs="tcp:46063:88"/>
was come out of the Priſon, to juſtifie what ſhe had acted to ſave her Brothers Life. And ere ſhe gave her leaſure to take any notice, ſhe highly prais'd her for the generous amity ſhe had ſhown to <hi>Theramene,</hi> eſteeming her ſelf unhappy the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Laws of honour forbid her the like pitty, <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> who could no longer endure the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious hypocriſy of that Woman, broke forth into bitter reproaches, and had undoubtedly convinc'd her, if <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> who was offended they ſhould Characterize the perſon he loved, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtably infamous, had not impoſed ſilence, and told her, ſhe ſhould be contented to have rob'd her Brother from his juſt vengeance, without maintaining his crime ſo inſolently: the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhe ow'd her father, made her ſilent, and <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> having withdrawn himſelf into his Cloſet, ſhe diſdainfully left <hi>Erixone,</hi> who would have entertain'd her, and whom this diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie precipitated to that horrid attempt ſhe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died againſt <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> with the more eagerneſſe and ſpite.</p>
                           <p>Of all the wayes ſhe had bethought her ſelf for her cruel purpoſe, the moſt ſecret ſeemed the moſt facile Her inclination feeding her with the ſad delight of miſchief, ſhe had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly bent her mind to know many experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of poyſon, and amongſt the ſecrets which you know thoſe of <hi>Colchus</hi> are very curious to ſtudy; She found one which ſhe thought moſt fit to imploy in this deſign, the virtue whereof was to make the perſon miſerably languiſh upon whom it was practiz'd, caſting them after ſome
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46063:89"/>
time into a Lethargy paſt cure. None could ſuſpect her in the leaſt to have cauſed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which daily waſted <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> the world attributing his malady to thoſe diſpleaſures and misfortunes which invaded his Family.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time the news came, that <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene</hi> was refugiated in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> received Letters by an expreſſe, who informed her that <hi>Artaban</hi> was ſending Embaſſadours to her Father, either to clear the innocency of his Son, or to obtain the pardon for his offence if any were. Theſe tidings did ſomewhat alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the affliction ſhe was in for her Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, who every day ſenſibly decay'd. Soon after the <hi>Armenian</hi> Ambaſſadours Arriv'd together with the Prince <hi>Tygranes,</hi> who would needs accompany them in perſon the better to Sollicite for <hi>Theramenes</hi> favour and return, whoſe eminent virtues had particularly acquired his Friendſhip. Had not <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> been in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of danger for his life, their coming would abſolutely have thrown the wicked <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixone</hi> into diſpair: that unhappy Father began to regret the abſence of his Son, and blame his own raſh haſt, that had condemned him without any other evidence then his own paſſionate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his Wives intereſt, who knowing well that if he once return'd, her impoſtures would be unmasqu'd, and laid open to every eye, was preparing to impede his coming, or prevent it, when the poor <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> by his death left her a power &amp; fit opportunity to maintain that crime, and commit many freſh ones.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="163" facs="tcp:46063:89"/>Every one bemoan'd this loſs with ſigh's and tears, but <hi>Erixone</hi> did ſo far out-Act a <hi>Theatrical</hi> diſſimulation in her regret and mournings, that even <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> who perfectly knew her falſe heart, and had her own Soul filled with the ſharpeſt grief, could not but be moved with it, and for a while doubted if it were poſſible that a woman could ſhow ſo many ſignes of deep affliction for a husband ſhe had betray'd her ſelf ſo treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and whoſe impudent deceit ſtretch'd ſo much further, as to intreat the <hi>Prince Tygranes</hi> and the Ambaſſadours, to haſten <hi>Theramene</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn withal convenient ſpeed, whom ſhe moſt willingly pardon'd, that he might come and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle himſelf in his due Succeſſion, thereby to eaſe her of the cares and troubles of Governing the State, which ſhe had took into her management only to keep things in good order till his Arrival: that afterwards in a more ſolitary retreat, ſhe might have full ſcope ſadly to bewail, with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Tears and Sorrows, the loſs of that Dear Husband, who during Life, ſhe loved with all the reſpect and tendernes that any woman is capable of.</p>
                           <p>Who ever could believe Treaſon ſhould lurk under ſuch ſpecious ſhowes; her <hi>Crocodile</hi> craft deluded the moſt prudent and concern'd. The Ambaſſadours returned better ſatisfied from her, then they had been by <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and <hi>Tygranes</hi> remained charm'd with <hi>Arthemiſa</hi>'s excelling beauties, to whom he had already proteſted the aſſurance of his Love and Services.</p>
                           <p>How be it when every thing ſeem'd to be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46063:90"/>
huſh'd in peace, and all their troubles in <hi>Colchus</hi> buried with <hi>Cteſiphon, Erixone</hi> who continually watched the iſſue of her projects, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the <hi>Prince</hi> was coming from <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſent the choiceſt of the Country to receive him on the borders, whom <hi>Tygranes</hi> at her requeſt, and to oblige <hi>Arthemiſa</hi> accompanied with much State and Magnificence: But Oh gods what a Reception, what Entertainment was it, what Treaſon more black, or deteſtable, then ſhe now dip'd her hands in, could the moſt curſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of malice ever have invented? The Young <hi>Prince</hi> who thought he was fairly invited to come and take the full poſſeſſion of his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and that <hi>Erixone</hi> by a generous and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance had wip'd out her grievous faults, had already drowned the remembrance of all his troubles in the Sea of promiſed hopes to enjoy a more tranquil Life, when the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable rage which <hi>Erixone</hi> and <hi>Tarſus</hi> had hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him, burſt forth. He thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, and only ſtudied handſomly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the many Teſtimonies of his Friends affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and eſpecially <hi>Tygranes.</hi> Here, <hi>Hippocratides</hi> interrupted his Diſcourſe, and they were all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to put off the continuation till another opportunity, to meet <hi>Cyrus</hi> whom they ſaw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them through another alley, with an action which had the face of much inquietude and anger.</p>

            <p>They were not long without knowing the Cauſe, <hi>Cyrus</hi> as ſoon as he came near them, complained as if <hi>Artabaſe</hi> had contributed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46063:90"/>
ſomewhat towards his diſcontent, becauſe <hi>Cyax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares</hi> had given him that antient <hi>Prince</hi> his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as a pledge of their good intelligence, and faithful correſpondence. <hi>Artabaſe</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>Give me an Account of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles intentions, tell me pray what deſignes had he when he put the ſword into my hands, and what reaſon at preſent, whilſt he at eaſe enjoyes the Sweetneſs and benefit of that Victory I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd, to blaſt the Lawrels of my Triumph, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the beauty of my Glory by the unhandſome treate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ignoble purſutes he practices to raviſh the Honour of</hi> Tygranes <hi>Siſter.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Write to him</hi> Artabaſe, <hi>that his paſſion miſguides him, and makes him forget how I put</hi> Birinthea <hi>into his hands as a moſt vertuous Princeſs, in quality of an hoſtage, and not as a ſlave, and that without infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſpect I owe him, I will protect fair vertue, and punctually ſatisfie thoſe promiſes I have ſworn, to anſwer for her fitting entertainment where ever ſhe be.</hi> And you, continued he, generous Prince, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his Speech to <hi>Tygranes: Suffer me to joyn my intereſts to yours, and leave me the care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your Siſters Honour, I ſhall have power enough, ſince I have ſo much Juſtice, and reaſon to tame my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles unruly paſſion</hi>; Yes ſaid he, <hi>Turning again to</hi> Artabaſe, <hi>I give all the</hi> Medes <hi>that will, free leave to returne, I ſhall not deſire to with hold one here; Conduct them,</hi> Artabaſe, <hi>to their</hi> Prince, <hi>againſt whoſe paſſion I openly declare my ſelf an Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artabaſe</hi> having proteſted he would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, complain'd at the ſame time for the ill
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46063:91"/>
opinion he had of him, in that he thought him ſo weak, as to abandon vertues cauſe, to embrace vices, as if he wanted judgment to diſtinguiſh what obedience he owed to his Prince to whoſe will he muſt be indiſpenſably ſubject, onely ſo long as he maintain'd it reaſonable. The <hi>Medes</hi> that waited upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> repeated the very ſame, and they immediately went to the Camp, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing by their ſhouts and acclamations they would never leave him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Artabaſe</hi> who was ignorant of the Cauſe of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s anger, and patiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his reproaches, was very Joyful to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it from a friend who had been in preſence when the Meſſenger that <hi>Abracome</hi> had ſent to <hi>Cyrus</hi> from <hi>Media</hi> related how <hi>Cyaxares</hi> tyr'd with his vain purſuits, and <hi>Birinthea</hi>'s conſtant virtue, was reſolv'd to ſatisfie his beaſtly paſſion what ever hapned, and having already raiſed a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full comment on <hi>Abracomes</hi> Journey to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the further Intelligence of an old woman, whom he had placed as a wary ſpie over all her Actions, had made him abſolutely jealous: and being confirmed in thoſe fears and doubts, he had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſent her into ſome concealed place, which could not yet be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Artabaſe,</hi> whoſe long experience had taught him much prudence, heard this News, he preſently gueſs'd the importance of that quarrel this might beget betwixt the Uncle and his Nepveu, if the intereſt of their paſſions ſhould foment it, the one having the ſubject of the injury in his power, and the other the means
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46063:91"/>
to revenge it: therefore he diſpatch'd a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of his own with him that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent back to <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> to inform him by divers conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the many diſorders that would inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, the unwarrantable raſhneſs of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the unhandſome blemiſh it would caſt upon his Nepveus victory and reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> cruelly combated betwixt his love, for <hi>Birinthea,</hi> and choller at her impriſonment, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, was almoſt reſolv'd under a diſguiſe to goe and learne further concerning it, and if the uncertainty to find her had not ſtop'd him, he had given up the advantage his ſword had already gain'd upon the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to render the homages and ſervice to his Princes which were ſecretly vowed. He nevertheleſs, was ballanced a long time on the thoughts of going into <hi>Media,</hi> the letter from <hi>Birinthea</hi> preſſing him ſo earneſtly, and beleeving his preſence would have more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence then <hi>Abracomes</hi>: but when he was in ſome manner fully reſolved, the incertainty whether it were beſt to goe ſecretly to releaſe her, or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare himſelf her Protector, or rather her lover ſuſpended him: he fear'd if he ſhould hide his perſon with his paſſion, he could not become conſiderable enough to perform any thing: and on the other hand, he apprehended to make too cleer a diſcovery of his heart to that man, whoſe bare ſuſpitions made him already jealous, and if he did reſolve on either of theſe wayes, then a new doubt ſtept in, whether he ſhould imploy perſwaſion, or power for her liberty, though he were confident, amity would never be able to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46063:92"/>
match his unckles love. In fine, pruning himſelf with better hopes from <hi>Birintheas</hi> prudence, and noble vertue, then any expectation of what he might perform: he deſign'd to march towards his Enemies, and divert his ſadneſs by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> (on whom he diſcharged the effects of a ſmart anger) till he might heare ſome gentler news of his Princeſs.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, he gave order next day for all his men to be in a readineſs to march, and being with-drawn together with the <hi>Hircanian</hi> Prince, and <hi>Gobrias</hi> on whoſe experience he leaned very much, he inquir'd of many particulars concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the country, that might advantage his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of breaking and ſhattering the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, who ſeemed to refuſe to cope with him ever ſince their firſt defeate, indeavouring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out open force or oppoſition, to ruine and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away his army by idleneſs, which in a ſtrange Country does oft-times come to paſs for want of action.</p>
            <p>The Counſell of theſe two great men out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh'd the generoſity of his ambition which blindly prompted him to undertake every thing that ſeem'd to contribute to his glory, he joyn'd in opinion with them, to tempt the diviſion of their forces by enticing away a great party of their men who ſerved the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> only out of feare and conſtraint.

            <p>THe next morning at the firſt birth of day he led his Army directly towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; arriv'd at the confines thereof, after four dayes march, &amp; there having reſerv'd thoſe whom he judg'd to be the choiceſt, and moſt faithful of his troopes to remain with himſelf, he commanded the reſt to ravage and ſcoure the Country, and not give quarter to any that were found in arm's The ſpoile which theſe plunderers brought in was very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and after the Prieſts had made choice of what they eſteemed moſt precious for their gods, and that he had diſtributed ſomewhat to the ſouldiers, he beſtowed the remainder, with the conſent, and in the name of the Army, freely upon <hi>Gobrias,</hi> in retaliation of that noble treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46063:94"/>
they had all received at his hands. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ranged his Army in Battalia, which he cauſed to march within ſight of that proud City, towards which he diſpatched a trumpetter with <hi>Gobrias</hi>; who being approached neer the walls, told an Officer whom the ſentinel had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiz'd, that he came on the behalf of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to challenge <hi>Vectorez</hi> to a ſingle combat, or if he deſired rather to have a general one, the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> would be ready to meet him in the next plain. This generous defy did not ſo much gall the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King, as the diſpite of having it brought by a man that was borne his Subject, and to whom he was ſo inveterate an Enemy. He return'd him anſwer by the advice of his cheif Counſellors, whom he ſtraightway-aſſembled for this purpoſe, that concerning the propoſition of a Combat, he was ſo ſurpris'd, that he found himſelf not yet diſpoſed either to receive, or give it, till a moneth after, at which time he promiſed to ſatisfy <hi>Cyrus</hi> his deſire, and that for his own particular, the moſt ſenſible diſpleaſure he felt was to have let <hi>Gobrias</hi> ſurvive one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after <hi>Melzune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> having heard this anſwer, thought that his honour obliged him to give the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> the leaſure to be able to make his Victory the more compleat and glorious by a more vigorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and therefore drew off his Army: but not to let them ruſt in idleneſs, he took a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to goe into <hi>Gadates</hi> Countrys, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to come out and defend them, and by this meanes find ſome opportunity to treate with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46063:94"/>
him. <hi>Gadate</hi> who was within <hi>Babylon,</hi> had no ſooner intelligence of the Enemies march, but he ſtraight went forth with thoſe forces which he commanded, to oppoſe <hi>Cyrus</hi>; which <hi>Gobrias</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving immediately underſtood by his ſcouts, he ſent him a Gentleman of a try'd fidelity, who making a ſhow of plundring the Country with ſome few troopers, was willingly taken by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who conducted him into the preſence of <hi>Gadate,</hi> by whom he was known to belong to <hi>Gobrias</hi> whoſe intimate friend he was, and having received him very civilly, he inquir'd of his Maſters health and affaires, upon which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman taking an occaſion to ſpeak with him in private, preſented him a letter of Credence from <hi>Gobrias,</hi> and aſſured him by word of mouth of the protection which <hi>Cyrus</hi> proffer'd him againſt <hi>Vectorez</hi> if he would quit his party, as he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant reaſon to doe. This propoſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently awaken'd the deſires <hi>Gadate</hi> had to revenge himſelf of that Tyrant, and therefore without much conſultation, he inſtantly reſolv'd to ſend the Gentleman back ſecretly, to certify <hi>Cyrus</hi> that he would ſuddenly come in to him: but not to give my body cauſe to ſuſpect their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, he craved only the time to diſpoſe of thoſe things which might prove obſtacles to his deſigne, and in the interim it appeared very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to him that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould draw neere, and make as if he would beſiedge a place which he named, that ſo getting into it under a colour of relieving it, he might by ſome ſmall ſalies diſpute the delivering of the place, till ſuch time as he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46063:95"/>
ſhould find occaſion to ſurrender it handſomely into his poſſeſſion: as he very plauſibly did after he had made a capitulation that was honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, feigning that he yeilded out of neceſſity of proviſions, to which they had reduced him. At his leaving of this City, he went to waite on <hi>Cyrus,</hi> before whom he proſtrated himſelf according to the cuſtome of that Nation with the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found adorations.</p>
            <p>If the reſpect wherewith <hi>Gadate</hi> ſaluted <hi>Cyrus</hi> were extraordinary, the civility that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd him was no leſs; he expres'd ſo much affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and honor by his careſſes, that <hi>Gadate</hi> was fully ſatisfied and comforted in finding ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Protector againſt the Tyrant <hi>

               <hi>Cyrus</hi> after he had a while entertain'd him, was deſirous to know the cauſe which could excuſe that infidelity and rebellion againſt a Prince, whom nature and his birth had made to be his Soveraign. <hi>Gadate</hi> would have made the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him: but <hi>Cyrus</hi> intreated him to repoſe himſelf in a Tent, prepared for him after the toiles of his ſiege, whilſt he would heare the ſtory from thoſe of his ſervants, who beſt knew the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of it.

                        <p>MY Maſter upon leſs grounds then now he has, might very juſtly have diſpenc'd with the Obedience he owes <hi>Victorez,</hi> and you will quickly find, that he is too generous to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken that party, if that Tyrant had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him by ſuch cruelty as is above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in not only denying his Subjects the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of innocent actions: but even the moſt becoming and Ligitimate deſires as will appear by the following diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>You may have remarked, that beſides the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of his Birth and Condition, there are other very conſiderable qualities in my Maſters perſon, which Nature has with a liberal hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon him, which made him eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Grandees in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Court. He was eſpecially reſpected of all the Ladies in General: but amongſt thoſe whoſe affection he had particularly acquir'd, ſhe who was the moſt paſsionately in Love with him, was alſo the moſt unhappy. She was the Widdow of a great Lord, who had lived but five or ſix moneths with her: but Young, and Handſome if ever any were. The King Affected her above all the Ladies of the Court, and <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> ſo was ſhe named, who was prepoſſeſs'ed with the affection ſhe had towards <hi>Gadate,</hi> generouſly refuſed that which ſo many others eagerly ſought to obtain with all the Arts they could.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:46063:96"/>
                           <hi>Vectorez</hi> who was as much concerned for her diſdain as her beauty, firſt ſought all the means imaginable to make her read and underſtand his paſſion: he imploy'd a thouſand grateful paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to charm that god, who has nothing of Childiſhneſs in him but his ſtature, and who in his littleneſs may juſtly vaunt he is the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Univerſal cauſe of all things. But finding her entertainment very cold, and at a diſtance, and having an opinion, that he ſhould rather be courted then denyed, he judged that what oppoſed his contentment, muſt needs be the conſideration of ſome rival, who had taken poſſeſſion of her heart and fancy. Theſe thoughts prompted him to ordain ſpies to uncover that fair Ladies Actions: but what vigilancy or care ſo ere they uſed, they could not lay hold of the leaſt conjecture of her Love; ſhe having ever conceal'd it with great diſcretion, believing it was not befitting the Reputation of a Woman, to anticipate <hi>Gadate</hi> by a too evident ſign, or any Declaration that might leave the Print of her ſhame written in the bluſhes of her Cheeks.</p>
                        <p>The King having loſt a great deal of time without any hope of ſucceſs to his content that way, imagin'd that to make her ſenſible of the worth of his eſteem for her, he muſt feign it loſt as towards her, and beſtow it upon one of her Neeces, whoſe Name was <hi>Prinea,</hi> with whom ſhe entertain'd a ſtrickt League of Amity: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with envy, and the diſdain he ſhould teſtifie towards her, ſhe might reſſent the loſs of his Affection, and endeavour to redeem his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46063:96"/>
again. This Plot might perhaps have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken effect had it been practized towards any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> becauſe that fair Sex, to whom the higheſt reſpect is due, are the leſs able to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer diſdain, by how much they challenge reſpect as a particular Tribute due to them. But it wrought no change in her, only in ſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a ſenſible diſpleaſure for having loſt that Noble prey out of her toyles and chains, ſhe manifeſted how much his love was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and importunate to her that could by no means correſpond in the ſame terms with him again, though he were a perſon to whom ſhe ow'd the greateſt reſpect and reverence of any in the World.</p>
                        <p>The ſucceſs of this ſtratagem in fine betray'd the intention of <hi>Vectorez,</hi> and inſtead of ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will and Affections of <hi>Chryſeide</hi> to him by this craft, he ingaged <hi>Prinea</hi> by thoſe falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of love he acted to a moſt violent paſſion for him, and this <hi>Bizarre</hi> event caus'd infinite diſorder and trouble to him, for that his diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation had produced a real love in the one, &amp; his real love had not been powerful enough to gain a civil Correſpondency from the other. This made him diſpair, the other was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and clamorous, and that which added moſt to his trouble was to have raiſed ſuch an Enemy againſt her, he ſo dearly loved. <hi>Prinea</hi> knowing what a bar the remembrance of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide</hi> was to her affection, beheld her as a rival who diſputed her the Crown and Scepter: So that ſhe perpetually watched to hinder <hi>Victorez</hi>
                           <pb n="180" facs="tcp:46063:97"/>
from Meeting and Conferring with her; who had not ſo well diſſembled, but ſome flames of that Love he cheriſh'd, for <hi>Chryſeide</hi> appeared thorow his falſe maſque: Inſomuch that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed <hi>Prince</hi> ſeem'd in this Act to become his own cruel Executioner: himſelf having twiſted that fatal Cord of his own misfortune which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtrangled his greateſt hopes; for had not he feined Love to <hi>Prinea,</hi> ſhe never had oppos'd or ſtruggled ſo much againſt his deſires and content. He was many times in the mind to diſcover his mind, end caſt himſelf at <hi>Chryſeides</hi> feet to implore her pardon: but knowing her to be extream haughty, and Nobly Generous, the fear to reveal thoſe poor unhandſome Arts he had practiſed to vanquiſh her, which in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would but encreaſe her averſion, hindred him for ſome time: But as his ſhame did mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and curb his impatience, ſo his Love preſs'd and ſpurr'd him with a moſt ſtrange vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And he in fine was conſtrain'd to declare himſelf openly; but not having ſo much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to preſent himſelf before her, whom he had ſeemingly ſlighted, he rather choſe to write a letter, in theſe following expreſſions.</p>

                        <p>If <hi>Chryſeide</hi> received this Letter with a great deal of wonder, not imagining the King thought now in the leaſt of Love to her, ſhe read it with no leſs diſpleaſure, finding her ſelf again perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by one, from whoſe importunate ſuite ſhe bleſt her late hoped delivery. She ſent him word, <hi>That it ſeem'd he relied very ſtrongly upon her diſcretion, ſince he did not fear leaſt ſhe might, Publiſh that Embaſſy to</hi> Prinea, <hi>who alone received offence by his diſſimulation: if it were true he had fein'd Love to a perſon, whoſe Beauty merited a more true paſſion, and whoſe ambition would hardly brook ſo great an affront;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46063:98"/>
that for her part ſhe would never be wanting in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir, which was ever to bear a greater reſpect and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, then Love towards her Soveraign</hi> Prince.</p>
                        <p>This Anſwer brought the amorous <hi>Vectorez</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the opinion which flatter'd his paſsion, he now thought <hi>Chryſeide</hi> had been more civil then cruel, and that having perceiv'd the difference there is between the receiving the adorations or diſdain of her <hi>Soveraign,</hi> ſhe had acknowledg'd her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by that word of reſpect, which ought to be conſtrued in the mouth of a Subject, and a woman for an expreſsion of Love, which the mear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of that ſex forbids them to expreſs more plainly. He could give himſelf no repoſe or reſpit till he waited on her, to be confirmed in his flattering opinion: but the preſence of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide</hi> which he gueſs'd ſo favourable to his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, quickly undeceived him. Not that ſhe was wanting in what ſhe had promiſed: for at his reception, ſhe treated him as a King: but as ſoon as he laid by that Magiſtick Garb to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Perſon of a Lover, ſhe expreſs'd all that froideur and coynes, which is practized ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by ſuch as have not the leaſt ſentiment or ſpark of affection. <hi>Vectorez</hi> was moſt ſenſibly netled at this entertainment; and perceiving all his ſubmiſſions and Cajolleries were fruitleſs, he proceeded to <hi>Menaces</hi>; and told her at parting, that ſince he was better treated when he acted as King towards her, he would henceforth never change that quality, that ſo he might make uſe of the power that preheminence gave him, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which ſhe refuſed ſo proudly both
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46063:98"/>
to his Prayers, and ſubmiſsions.</p>
                        <p>Theſe threats imprinted ſo much fear in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide</hi>'s heart, who was acquainted with <hi>Vectorez</hi> violent Nature if provoked, that ſhe decreed abſolutely to ſeek all poſſible means whereby ſhe might decently make known her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Gadate</hi>: that ſo obliging him by affection to joyne to her intereſts, ſhe might be the more able to reſiſt all that <hi>Vectorez</hi> could indeavour and deſign againſt her repoſe and honour. <hi>Gadate</hi> who had all the Sentiments of a heart truly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, quickly perceiving by the looks <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide</hi> ſecretly level'd at him to invade his liberty, what it was ſhe deſired from him, would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Conqueſt much; but having ſeriouſly conſider'd the Merits and Virtue of that amiable Woman: beſtow'd all his affections on her as a perſon whom he was bound to Love and Honour intirely.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand <hi>Prinea,</hi> whoſe envious jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie made her continually watch and ſtudy her ruine, that ſeemed to rob her of <hi>Vectorez</hi> heart, whoſe falſe-hood ſince he forſook her, had ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affronted her Reputation, was the firſt that diſcover'd the affection which theſe two Lovers would yet have clouded from the eye of the World, till ſuch time as they had ſetled their affairs in ſuch a poſture as to out-bid all fear and oppoſition when it were Publiſh'd. One day whilſt ſhe was complaining to the King of that Infidelity, ſhe pretended he had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, and ſtrove to lure him back to her deſires again. She ſhow'd him how hood-winkt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46063:99"/>
his paſſions were to diſpiſe her that cheriſh'd him ſo tenderly, and to give his reſpect and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his love upon an ingrateful Woman who diſregarded him, and from whom it was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to expect any return of affection, becauſe ſhe had already made a gift of it to <hi>Gadate,</hi> who alſo loved her moſt paſſionately again.</p>
                        <p>This Intelligence was the Fire, and Stubble, and bellows which wholly inflamed the Rage and Jealouſie that had ſo long been ſmoother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Paſſionate Kings boſome, and which his late viſite to <hi>Chryſeide</hi> had already begun to ſtir and awaken; he intreated <hi>Prinea</hi> to be the Miniſter, as having a principal intereſt, to ruine and take away that obſtacle to her felicity. And he engag'd that provided ſhe would give him more certainty of this intrigue, that he would acknowledge her affection by a juſt retaliation of his own, and the reſſentment of the Injury he would caſt upon that ingrateful Creature that had ſlighted him. <hi>Vectorez</hi> might have ſought long enough in vain amongſt all thoſe Friends, in whom he moſt confided, before he could have met with a perſon more careful and exact to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Commiſſion. She immediately learnt by one of <hi>Gadate</hi>'s Servants whom ſhe had bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with money, the ordinary time when he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſecretly left his Houſe, and ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Chamber-Maid belonging to <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide,</hi> her acquaintance of old, that juſt at that hour <hi>Gadate</hi> viſited and waited on <hi>Chryſeide</hi> in a private place, where they had the liberty of a free entertainment. This led her afterwards to

the knowledge of the party, to whom they both confided the ſecrets which they wrote of their affection, and by whom they ſent the paper Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of their appointments, and as She narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch'd his goings and comings betwixt theſe lovers by her many truſty ſpies: one day as ſhe return'd from <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> whither <hi>Gadate</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him: She caus'd him to be ceazed on by ſome unknown perſons, who having ſearched his pockets, took away a note, by which ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to come to one of her Aunts, where ſhe would be infallibly that evening to meet him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vectorez</hi> whoſe Jealouſie had rendred him a mortal Enemy to <hi>Gadate,</hi> had no ſooner know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Randez-vows, but he reſolved to way-lay him himſelf, with ſome of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in a place, which he muſt neceſſarily paſs, that by one blow he might rid himſelf of the object of <hi>Chryſeide</hi>'s love, and his own vengeance by depriving him of life. He went very early to the place appointed, in a diſguiſe; and ſent ſome unknown perſons, who were very well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Gadates</hi> face, to ſpy, when he entred, and take notice of his habit and perſon: for fear leaſt at his return they ſhould faſten upon ſome other by miſtake. Theſe Scouts ſaw <hi>Chryſeide</hi> go in and ſeveral other people, without perceiving <hi>Gadate,</hi> whom one of his kindred had carried thither in her Coach, dreſs'd in a womans habit; they were yet expecting his coming, when <hi>Vecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> excited by his impatient jealouſie went to them; and underſtanding that they had not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46063:100"/>
ſeen his Rival yet come by, he fixed his reſolve to ſteal away <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> or rather raviſh her thence by force, if <hi>Gadate</hi> eſcap'd his hands. During theſe thoughts and deliberations, he ſtaid till all the company came forth of that houſe; and perceiving he could not diſcover him, againſt whoſe life the Plot was framed, when <hi>Chryſeide</hi>'s Coach had advanc'd ſome diſtance from him, he preſently made after and aſſaulted it. The Cries and Moans of thoſe within the Coach, was all their defence, and though moſt times thoſe feeble Succours are altogether ineffectual: yet now they were ſo powerful and ſucceſsful as to preſerve them, by alarming <hi>Gadate</hi> who was not very far of. That Lover preſently flew with ſpeed at his Ladies firſt doleful Summons, and prompted with the intereſt of that love, he had in her whom they would raviſh from him, he fell upon one of thoſe that ſeconded the Kings vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and having wrung the Sword out of his hand, he ran directly to the throng that had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqu'd them, who not expecting from one that appear'd to be a Woman, any other reſiſtance but noiſe and clamours were unawares diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and amazed at his furious blows.</p>
                        <p>There Love on either part exercis'd its rage and fury. The King who had the greateſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in this action, did firſt oppoſe <hi>Gadate</hi>: but wanting the aſſiſtance of Juſtice in this quarrel, he began to give way to his rivals fury, whoſe vigerous arme he had already felt: when thoſe that accompanied him, leaving <hi>Chryſeide</hi> to ſave <hi>Vectorez,</hi> gave her opportunity to eſcape from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46063:100"/>
them, and took away all means from <hi>Gadate</hi> to compleat his full revenge. Their number in fine, ore'whelm'd him, and after a brave reſiſtance equal, both to his love and valour, whereby he had laid three at his feet, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſunk down pierced with wounds amidſt his Enemies, <hi>Vectorez</hi> was in ſo grand a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion for this defeat, and ſo enfeebled by thoſe wounds he had received, that not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring or minding to diſcover who this was, he left him in the Street, commanding them to convey away his men, and was himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carried to his <hi>Palace,</hi> no leſs covered with blood then ſhame; and to hide it from all knowledge, he commanded his <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgeons,</hi> to give for a pretence that he was not ſeen abroad, that 'twas ſome other indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which afflicted him, and forbad thoſe who had aſſiſted him therein, ever to whiſper the leaſt word of it to any other. You may gueſs with what diſquiet he paſſed the reſt of the night, his anger gave him leſſe repoſe then his wounds, and his jealouſie quickly ſuggeſted to his thoughts, that the tutelary <hi>Demon</hi> which had robbed him of his <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> muſt aſſuredly be <hi>Gadate</hi>: who the better to hide his amours, diſguis'd himſelf under the feined ſhape of a Woman.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt he was wracked with theſe ſuſpicions <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> who notwithſtanding her danger and fright could not goe far from him, but thorow feare of his diſaſter had conceal'd her ſelf at the corner of the ſtreet, to ſee the event of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46063:101"/>
combat returnd as ſoon as the noiſe was over to ſeek for him. The night was not ſo dark, but that at ſome ſhort intervals the wind ſweeping the clowds with ſome impetuoſity left the face of Heaven ſo cleere and ſtarry, that by their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table light, this unhappy lover ſoon found what ſhe ſought, for with ſo much feare and grief, and which nevertheleſs ſhe expected, as now appear'd too true. He lay ſtretch'd upon the pavement cloſs by a doore towards which he had trail'd himſelf, but the loſs of his blood and ſtrength ſtop'd him before he arriv'd there.</p>
                        <p>The cries which this woeful ſpectacle made her at firſt direct towards heaven, which ſhe with melting eyes petition'd for juſtice againſt the cruell aſſaſſins, were loud enough to be heard in the loftieſt ſtar Chamber of the gods above, who reſerv'd the vengeance, ſurely, to be performed by the hands of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Her ſobs interrupted thoſe firſt clamours, &amp; letting fall her lookes upon the object of her miſery, after ſhe had ſome moments fix'd them there, ſhe ſoftly bow'd her head upon him, calling him with an accent compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of love and ſorrow both together, <hi>Gadata, Gadate,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>my deareſt life: and raiſing her ſelf up a little, purſued ſhe or rather my dearer death, ſince thou replieſt nothing, thou art no longer to be counted amongſt the living; but if it be true that thou haſt loved me, can thy faire ſoule be gone and leave mine here? and wherefore muſt I live ſince I have loſt him who alone inſpir'd me, where is thy ſoule fled, my</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, <hi>can it be that which makes me live ſtill: here
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46063:101"/>
take it then again, ſaid ſhe Kiſſing his lips affectionately, I breath it back into thee with all my heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>She felt a little breath remaining in him, which the faint motion of his heart atteſted, which made her ſtoop to marke with more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether it were truly ſome ſmall remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of life yet in him, or the laſt knell of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring lover: but finding it continued ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, I heare thee, ſaid ſhe, <hi>my deare ſoule, thou anſwereſt me: but is it to take thy laſt adieu, or to call me to follow thee?</hi> ſaying this, ſhe ſoftly laid her trembling hand upon his heart, and finding it beat and throb a little; <hi>let us not die my Dear</hi> Gadata, <hi>ſince I yet feel the motions of our ſoule within thy boſome: live for my ſake, unleſs you'l have me ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way die for yours.</hi> And having ſaid this, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd her hand was bathed in blood: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being again afrighted, ſhe ſought for that wound whence ſo much blood did iſſue.</p>
                        <p>But oh ſtrange! ſhe ſeem'd to ſhew, more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for this ſame wound, then ſhe had done whilſt ſhe beleeved him dead, and tearing the linnen ſhe had on her head, ſhe made a ſhift to ſtop the blood from flowing, whilſt with her teares that waſh'd and bath'd his face, ſhe ſtrove to call him from his ſwoun'd to life again: but finding her indeavours all in vain, ſhe ſent her careful looks abroad to find ſome other aſſiſtance: when inſtantly a man preſenting himſelf, told her, that being moved with her doleful cries, he came to lend her all the ſervice he was able, and asking the cauſe of that funeſtuous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? ſhe briefly related the truth of that ſad
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46063:102"/>
ſtory, and then beſeeched him, by all that was moſt deare to him on earth, to help her carry her deare <hi>Gadate</hi> inſtantly to ſome neer place, who without ſpeedy remedy would breath his laſt. The man whom ſhe believed heaven it ſelf had ſent to her aſſiſtance profeſſing ſolemnly he ſhared in her griefes, ſtoop'd down as 'twere to helpe her take him up, when ſuddenly the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous vilain, inſtead of performing that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table office, unſheath'd a dagger and indeavour'd to plunge it into <hi>Gadates</hi> heart.</p>
                        <p>The unhappy blow was ſo much the more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> becauſe it deluded the hopes ſhe had joyfully conceived of his timely aſſiſtance: yet ſhe immediately flew at him, and being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a kind of fury, cryed aloud, <hi>Traitor, thou haſt miſtaken, if thou wouldſt murther</hi> Gadate, <hi>ſtrike my breſt for here his ſoule is houſed, and he does live in me; but thou haſt now kill'd only me infernall Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in his perſon.</hi> Love had lent ſo much ſtrength to <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> and this juſt reproach ſtruck ſo much terror into that baſe butchers heart, that he had force enough to ſtay him, though he mainly ſtruggled to ſcape out of her hands, till thoſe that had bafore fled from the danger, ſent ſome armed men thither to reſcue her, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſtriving with this aſſaſſin, ſoon ended that unequal combat, by killing her Enemy. His death contributed very much to <hi>Gadates</hi> life; <hi>Chryſeide</hi> was no ſooner delivered from that Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but ſhe haſtily ran to him, and perceiving that he lived yet, and that the laſt wound he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was not ſo dangerous as her feares had
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46063:102"/>
made her doubt, finding her ſelf too weake, to carry that deare burden alone, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe eagerly coveted to doe: ſhe admitted of their aſſiſtance that were preſent to beare him thence: till the coach ſhe had ſent for, met them; in which they laid him, repoſing his head upon her panting breſt. Whilſt they were thus going, as if <hi>Gadate</hi> had been in a condition to anſwer her: ſhe entertain'd him, with what her love, ſometimes trembling for feare, and othertimes flattering with hope, did ſuggeſt to her thoughts; and being at laſt arriv'd at his own dwelling, ſhe would not leave him till the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians had given her a confident aſſurance of his recovery, and that himſelf having happily recover'd his ſpirits and knowledge again, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly conjured her to goe and repoſe her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>In the interim, the King full of impatience that he ſaw no return of the party he had ſent to diſpatch the poor <hi>Gadate</hi> if he were yet alive, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly commanded another to goe and make a diſcovery what had paſs'd, who brought him word how he found him dead on the pavement. What ever plaints and moanes the ſmart of his wounds tore from his mouth &amp; breſt, his jealouſy and paſſion troubled him more when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he whoſe valour had carried the prize of <hi>Chryſeide</hi> from his weaker arme, and whom he gueſs'd aſſuredly to be <hi>Gadate,</hi> had yet eſcap'd. what <hi>Demon,</hi> cry'd he; for there can be no men ſo bold and temerary, hath fetch'd away my Enemy, and traverſing my intentions, hath ſlain my faithful Miniſters? Gods, doe you cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46063:103"/>
Kings to make them ſo unhappy, and doe you grant them ſo much power, to have ſo little uſe, and command of it, when they have need to imploy it. Take back the Crown which you have placed on my head, I will not hold the Scepter: if that be the bar which ſeparates me from <hi>Chryſeides</hi> love, the advantage of ſwaying it; bringing the more confuſion, by the ſhame for not being puiſſant enough to ſubdue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a woman, to the ſame compliance which ſhe yeilds to one that's but my ſubject. How unjuſt you are, all the power you give me, is it but only to commit murthers and aſſaſſinations? and the abſolute dominion I have over the lives of men, might it not better have been limited only, to reach the wills of thoſe that are my vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals? Or had you but ſeconded that violence I undertook by the authority I hold from heaven, which is to have no other law but my own will; I ſhould acquieſce in your decrees: but to deride and better ſcoff at me, or rather in truth, to bring contempt and ſcorne upon your ſelves, ſince I am your own Image here beneath, you bring a woman in the liſts whom I cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and if you ſend a man in for her ſecond, he too muſt be diſguis'd under the habit of that timerous ſex. But no, I wrongfully complain of you; the irregularity of my paſſion does abuſe me; let us make open triall of that Soveraignty is given us, that, that alone can be effectual: ſince ſoothings and deceits have proved vain; let <hi>Chryſeide</hi> be inſtantly ſent for, and what reſiſtance ſoere ſhe make, let her be brought whether ſhe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46063:103"/>
condiſcend or not. Some of thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his Chamber, were already putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a poſture to obey him, whom he again ſtop'd by theſe words: Stay, ſaid he, <hi>I doe not think on what I undertake: if there were only</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide <hi>with</hi> Gadate <hi>to reſiſt me, my paſſion might be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied: but I have love to conquer; nor have I any cauſe at all of ſhame, if the higheſt gods having bowed to his yoake, I alſo yeild to his inevitable doome. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever let's try to traverſe his intents in all that can be poſſible, and have no more reſpect to that divinity at all that uſes ſo much cruelty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His Phyſitians and Chyrurgians perceiving him much heated with theſe boſome conteſts, beſeeched him to calme his thoughts a little, leaſt it ſhould cauſe ſome inflammation in his wounds, which otherwiſe were out of the reach of death and danger. He could hardly contain himſelf: but reflecting afterwards upon the deſign he had propos'd to hide his paſſion, he quarrel'd with his own raſh tongue, for having proclaim'd ſo much, and ſtrictly enjoyned thoſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-him, never to impart thoſe ſecrets.</p>
                        <p>They all obſerved this command ſo religiouſly, that none could imagine for what reaſon <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> would not be ſeene, nor ſuſpect him to have conſorted in the rape of <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> and the foule attempt againſt <hi>Gadates</hi> life. What ever infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations they could make were loſt labours; and it would be lock'd up in ſilent ſecreſy ſtill, if ſhe who it rather ſeem'd had moſt cauſe to cover it ſince ſhe had managed all the bloody tragedy, had not reveal'd it firſt. <hi>Prinea</hi> having heard no
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46063:104"/>
news from the King, who had through neglect wholly forgotten her, but only as an inſtrument that had caus'd his ſhame and unhappineſs, and having certain intelligence that <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez</hi> had a full intent to have ſtollen away <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> was even pin'd to death with grief when ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that her ſelf had procured that happy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as ſhe judg'd it, for her rival; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to ſhake off the fond opinion of the Kings affection to her, ſhe thought it would be the more compleat revenge for his disdain, and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by rendring him the more hateful to her whoſe love he hunted for through ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and danger. And that to this purpoſe it would be beſt to let <hi>Chryſeide</hi> and <hi>Gadate</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that 'twas <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez</hi> who had attempted the rape of the one, and murther of the other; and at the firſt viſite ſhe made her couſin, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the whole ſecret to her.</p>
                        <p>Though <hi>Chryſeide</hi> were ſtruck with amazement, yet ſhe was eaſily induced to beleeve it, becauſe ſhe was no ſtranger to the Kings violence and paſſion; and knowing it was now too late to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale her affection to <hi>Gadate,</hi> and his reciprocally to her again, ſhe gave him immediate notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Gadate</hi> who was extremely generous, could hardly beleeve the deſign of ſo black a deed could be hatch'd in the mind of ſuch a man, who was borne a Prince, and to whom the gods had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo much Authority, only that he might doe juſtice to his ſubjects. The notice however they had taken of the villain that was laſt kill'd, who was well known to be one of the Kings Officers,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46063:104"/>
before they had carried him thence, was a ſtrong argument of this truth, beſides many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities which ſhe told him, to which he had not till then lent any obſervation, or beleefe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez</hi> notwithſtanding to take away all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, and wipe out all thoſe impreſſions that <hi>Chryſeide</hi> might ſtamp in his mind, ſent to viſit him, and let him know, that if he had not been conſtrain'd to confine himſelf to his Chamber, by reaſon of a ſlight indiſpoſition, which hindred him from going abroad, he would have come in perſon to witneſs his ſorrow for that accident, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him only to be careful of his recovery, whilſt himſelf would take care to ſeek out his Enemies, to make an exemplary Juſtice by which it ſhould appear that they had mortally offended him in his perſon.</p>
                        <p>To combat theſe malitious impoſtures, <hi>Chryſeide</hi> was forc'd to diſcover the ſecret of the Kings paſſion, towards her, to <hi>Gadate</hi> in that exceſs which he as yet had not imagin'd, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Seals his letter contain'd which ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him, and what <hi>Prinea</hi> had related as a farther proof in this point.</p>
                        <p>The certain knowledge of ſuch a puiſſant ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val began to diſquiet his ſoul, and would have wholly diſcompos'd his mind, if that faire Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture who ſoon read it by the alterations in his face, had not quickly diſpel'd the tempeſt which his jealouſy was gathering, by theſe Words; <hi>Feare not</hi> Gadate, <hi>you have no cauſe to feare, I know what the ſadneſs of your lookes expreſs, but let not the higheſt proofes of his love I have revealed, raiſe any
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46063:105"/>
doubts. If this puiſſant rival whom you dread, have found no greater obſtacle to his love then the diſpoſitions I had towards you, when by his reſpects and adorations he endeavour'd to alure my ſoule to himſelf: What can you apprehend now ſince he has affronted and wronged me ſo baſely, and that the inclination I had for your deare ſelf is converted into love: but what love</hi> Gadate, <hi>alas ſhall I dare name it, you know it enough already, and the laſt evidence I have given you cannot but place your beleef above all doubts, if there were roome for any. What greater proofes can you demand, Speake</hi> Gadate, <hi>muſt I die to gain your full beleefe: Ah, what was there wanting, tell me prethee, did I not ſeek for death, when I durſt cope with him that came to quench that ſmall remaining ſparke of life in the ſtreames of your own blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I know indeed, reply'd</hi> Gadate, <hi>that I have nothing to feare, ſince you forbid it, But, Madam, I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crown, nor Scepter to reward your affection, nor with my perſon can you eſpouſe any thing, but the hatred of a King, who now can make you a worthy Queen. The regret that you ſhould looſe thoſe advantages in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of me, and that I am not able to recompence that loſs, but by the Grandeur of an affection, which truly has no paralel (but which nevertheleſs can procure you nothing elſe ſuitable to it) is that which caſts me into ſo much trouble. That</hi> Chryſeide <hi>ſhould refuſe</hi> Uecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, <hi>to embrace</hi> Gadate, <hi>put by a King, to entertain a Subject; is a Prodigy of grace and goodneſs which ſhould ſurpaſs, the hopes of ambition it ſelf, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my Deare</hi> Chryſeide, <hi>theſe are not only things which I may fondly hope for; but ſuch as your aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

crownes me with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moſt rare effect of love, but yet produced by a cauſe more rare: Adorable</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeide, <hi>at leaſt permit me as an earneſt of my affection, to avenge the baſe attempt of that ignoble King, you have leſs reaſon to endure the affront he would have acted, then to refuſe the Crown he proſtrates at your feet by this meanes you ſhall no longer have that loathſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your batred in your Eye, nor I have further cauſe of any apprehenſion.</hi> Chryſeide <hi>would not ſuffer him to goe on, but abſoluttly forbad him to expreſs any reſſentment towards the King, who ſeem'd to repent his crime, ſince he confeſs'd his ſhame by hiding it. They afterwards vow'd an eternal love, to which they call'd the gods for witneſs, and reſolv'd to ſecure their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at ſooneſt by a ſpeedy marriage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the ſame time that they propounded to roote and eſtabliſh their content, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez</hi> ſtudied to undermine it.

could have the bleſſed opportunity to tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cloſer by the indiſſoluble and holy knot of marriage which he apprehended above all things, and which he nevertheleſs foreſaw would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, unleſs he haſtily caſt in ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to obſtruct it. As he was forecaſting this ugly deſign, a fit occaſion preſented it ſelf to him to put in execution; the inhabitants of a remote Province did inſolently raiſe a mutiny; and it being neceſſary to elect ſome perſon of eminency and Authority, as well as of ability and courage, to quell theſe ſeditious ſpirits and range, them to their juſt Devoir, his jealouſy eaſily ſuggeſted him inſtantly to impoſe this Commiſſion on <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,</hi> thereby to ſnatch him away and part him from <hi>Chryſeide.</hi> He propounded it to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, who ſoon approved his choice, as the fitteſt perſon of his Court; and not conſidering the particular intereſts that lead him to it, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſpatched all the orders requir'd towards this expedition.</p>
                        <p>This buſineſs did indeed call for a diligent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of affairs: but yet the jealous impatiency that nettled <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez</hi> made him precipitate that departure the more ſuddenly; ſo that his rival had ſcarcely time, to ſet his own domeſtick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in order, becauſe the King feigned to have received freſh intelligence, that without a very quick remedy, that fire of rebellion which kindled more and more, might perhaps ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enflame his neighbouring Provinces.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gadate</hi> plainly perceived what poſted him from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that his deare, Deare <hi>Chryſeide</hi> who
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46063:106"/>
made him part with ſo much trouble and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, was the ſole cauſe; yet he was forc'd to yeild to Soveraign command, and obey the Kings abſolute power without delay, leaſt he ſhould utterly ruine his hopes and future for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                        <p>The evening before his departure, he waited on his <hi>Chryſeide</hi>: where though theſe two faithful friends had very much to ſay to each other, yet were they ſo overwhelm'd with grief, that for a long time, they could demand no other expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but mournful ſighes and teares: but when they perceiv'd the fatal moment of their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion approached, <hi>Gadate</hi> in fine broke ſilence with theſe words. <hi>We muſt part, fair</hi> Chryſeide; <hi>'tis heavens decree, as well as the Kings will: but what muſt we expect in ſo long and tedious an abſence, if we find ſo much trouble only to ſay adieu? A love reply'd</hi> Chryſeide, <hi>which ſhall never untye the union of our ſouls, whatever fortune plot or contrive againſt us; love me ſtill</hi> Gadate, <hi>but as I ſhall, and doe, love you; and we ſhall thus triumph over all oppoſition, and make them know, our conſtancy and promis'd Faith, is firmer rooted and founded, then their obſtinate and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome malice.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>That I ſhould love you for ever reparted</hi> Gadate, <hi>is to command me a thing from which I cannot poſſibly decline, ſince no object can ever poſſibly be ſo lovely as</hi> Chryſeide, <hi>as nothing can be ſo pleaſing and charming as the ſweet, and, too ſorrowful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your preſence.

thunder immediately, rather then ſuffer me to be falſe to her: but no you ſhall never chaſtiſe me for that crime, what power ſoere you have over us, for ſince you cannot ſhape a beauty more glorious, nor furniſh a ſoul with more perfection, ſhe ſhall be eternally the only object of my affection and veneration. Yet I muſt leave you deareſt</hi> Chryſeide; <hi>to pleaſe the jealous humour of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val who teares me from you, rather then for that intereſt of State which is pretended, I muſt be my own Enemy by this ſelf baniſhment, to humour him, and under the pretence of ſerving my King and Country abandon you, to the danger of a Tyrant.

                        <p>A deep and violent ſigh on either ſide, ended this ſad diſcourſe; and they had no more power of ſpeech left after it, but only to give a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly farewel at the laſt. <hi>Gadate</hi> at parting left her his picture, and in a noble Exchange was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46063:107"/>
inrich'd with hers. If the trouble, and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this cruel ſeparation, diſturbed them of that repoſe, which ſleep might otherwiſe have afforded them: the joy that flowd in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez</hi> mind, did the ſame to him. The pleaſing thought of having procur'd their parting kept him ſtill waking; and the impatience of ſeeing him, though night were almoſt neere its end, ſo wrack'd him, that he accuſed the Sun of ſloth and lazineſs, for not driving away the clowds of darkneſs ſooner and appearing in that Horizon, to uſher in the long'd for morning, that ſhould abſent his rival.</p>
                        <p>Hardly was the night diſmiſt, but he ſent <hi>Gadate</hi> word he muſt conſult with him; not that he had any new buſineſs; but only he thereby meant to rob him of the opportunity of being with <hi>Chryſeide</hi>; and when he was come, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him with a thouſand diſſembled careſſes and civilities: even till the houre of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then would ſee him mounted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted out of the Palace Gates, after which he immediately deſired an Aſſembly of all the Court Ladies, where <hi>Chryſeide</hi> could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                        <p>What diſorder and torments, good heaven, did ſhe not ſuffer, when ſhe beheld him neer, that had abſented her choiceſt friend ſo far from her? however ſhe diſſembled the beſt ſhe could, not to irritate him, from whom ſhe had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſuch teſtimony of anger and Tyranny, and of whom ſhe feared worſe: But to ſhun his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for the time to come, ſhe reſolv'd to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46063:108"/>
baniſh her ſelf from the City, and intreated one of her kindred to pitty her misfortunes, and by carrying her into a remote dwelling, where her husband was in the Country to free her from one part of thoſe troubles that fit ſo heavy on her ſpirit. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ectorez,</hi> who was informed of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent immediately ſummon'd that ladies husband to the Court; and having taken away the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Chryſeides</hi> journey, detained her in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>; and to engage her the more to that abode, he beſtowd an office at Court on the Unckle ſhe ſojourned with, which tyed and confined her conſequently within his own walls. But finding his moſt ſedulous endeavours could gain him no advantage upon her inflexible Spirit, and that whatever art he uſed to conquer her, ſhe countermined and made ſhift to defeate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, he was fired with rage and anger; and having found out that theſe two lovers kept a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent correſpondency by paper Embaſſies, he bethought himſelf of a Stratagem, to breed a disaffection in their hearts, by the ſame meanes that they made uſe of to confirm and cheriſh the affection they had ſo ſolemnly vow'd each other. To this effect he ſought to corrupt the fidelity of of a woman to whom <hi>Chryſeide</hi> and <hi>Gadate</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſweet commerce of their amours; and having gained her by the brightneſs of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mettle, which corrupts the integrity of moſt people, ſhe deliver'd up thoſe letters which they interchangeably ſent to one another, in whoſe innocent lines, he quickly read the reſolution which <hi>Chryſeide</hi> had taken to fly to my Maſter, for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46063:108"/>
Sanctuary, againſt his Perſecutions, and injoy that reſt in his boſome, ſhe did in vain expect from the others reſtleſs importunity. He cauſed <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> hand to be exactly counterfeited in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein he intreated her not to ſpur on her deſigne with ſo much haſt, and this he cloſed up with a Seal of theirs, left in their unworthy She-Secretari's hands, to make this falſe Coyn paſs the better by that currant ſtamp. It need not beget your wonder, that <hi>Chryſeide</hi> did not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this forgery, Lovers read over their welcome Letters with too much haſt and paſſionate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to examine ſo nicely; She, in fine, returned him Anſwer, that She waited for his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an impatience, great as her Love.</p>
                        <p>And to delude <hi>Gadate,</hi> as they had <hi>Chryſeide</hi>: he cauſed her writing to be perfectly well imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and informing him, that being neceſſarily detain'd at Court for ſomewhat, that much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd their happineſs: ſhe beſeeched him to let her defer her Journey yet a while, that ſo ſhe might contrive to do it afterwards with the more ſafety, and leſs trouble. Thus was the fair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of theſe two lovers betray'd and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with as much malice as dexterity; and though <hi>Vectorez</hi> had more of anger and rage, then love in the paſſion he cheriſh'd for <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> yet could he not endure ſhe ſhould have the leaſt inclination for any elſe. And to make the moſt advantage every way of their abſence, he gained ſuch of eithers Friends, as they moſt confidently relied upon, whom having once ſeduced, he cauſed a report to be blown about, that he was
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46063:109"/>
going to have <hi>Chryſeide</hi> match'd to one of his Kindred; and at the ſame time, in retribution of my Maſters eminent Services, that he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him the Daughter of a Prince, who reſided in that Province, which his late approved Valour and Prudence had happily ranged and ſetled in the obedience they juſtly owed their King.</p>
                        <p>Theſe perſecuted Lovers were firſt advertiz'd of the odd report that had been raiſed; and ſoon after their falſe Friends confirmed this falſer ſame, by their infamous Meſſages, and withall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the ſhort and feeble reſiſtance that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had made to the firſt aſſault and propoſition of renouncing their firſt Love, to let in a new gueſt, which ſhould be confirmed by ſudden Marriage, proved evidently that they had given a full aſſent. This News being convey'd to both, by ſuch as they highly reſpected, and heartily believed, made up the fulneſs of that trouble, which their long abſence had but begun; and as the hopes of either was anchor'd, only upon their mutually ſworn Faith and Stability, ſo the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born jealouſie this treachery had brought forth, caſt them almoſt into diſpair.</p>
                        <p>What, — whiſpred the mournful <hi>Chryſeide, — Is it poſſible that</hi> Gadate <hi>ſhould prove unfaithful; that</hi> Gadate <hi>whom a few dayes ſince my Love, reſcued from that death which his Rival was dragging him to.

Rather ſtrike him that is the Author of my doubts, and ſuſpition: Has not that Tyrant yet exaſperated your anger long enough to make you dart your Puniſhments at him? Or may he, becauſe a King, eſcape unpuniſhed by Heaven, for thoſe black and deep crimes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits upon Earth?

Chryſeide</hi> ſcarce gave me leaſure to end thoſe words, before She chang'd her Countenance and harſh Language, into this ſweet tone of, — <hi>Pardon me, Sir,</hi> Said She, <hi>If I do tell you, that it's not true I ever wrote to</hi> Gadate <hi>what you affirm: on the contrary, I burned with deſire and impatience to know the reaſons why he would ſtop me.</hi> And I can aſſure you in his behalf, return'd I, that he was no leſs amazed, and at a non-plus, when he read what you wrote. Then I repeated at length all what my Maſter had learn'd touching her promiſe of Marriage, and how he having ſent her a Meſſage, to which her ſilence was the only anſwer, he began to credit what report had proclaim'd, and what he for a long while before had only let into his ear, which he after ſilence could not but ſuffer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his heart as a real Truth.</p>

                           <hi>What Demon,</hi> cry'd She, <hi>does thus betray our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents? the trouble and diſſatisfaction for not procuring his Anſwer to me, about the ſame Melancholly inquiry, firſt brought upon me this fit of misbelief, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is his chief Malady and diſtemper too, proceeding from the ſame Cauſe.</hi> Ha! <hi>Would he had contracted no more guilt then I in this particular, and you, happy Meſſenger, if I dare believe what you affirm, how truly bleſſed am I; What then, it ſeems</hi> Gadate <hi>is faithfull ſtill, and yet he could ſuppoſe that I had falſified my vowes to him; Let ſome body fly to him, if you cannot Poſt thither your ſelf, to eaſe and inform his Noble mind, leaſt he become more ſinful, by longer thinking I am ſo.</hi>
                        </p>

this, and I hurried a faithful bearer away with thoſe refreſhing tydings, whilſt we were gueſſing afterwards who could be the perſons that had ſo ignobly, and ſubtily ruffled the quiet and till then, ſweet commerce of theſe Lovers: to find this out the more facilely, <hi>Chryſeide</hi> ſent for that woman, I already mention'd, by whoſe manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they convey'd all their ſecrets, who was not a little ſurprized at my appearance, becauſe ſhe was of my acquaintance. <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> having required an account of the letters they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to each other, but had not been delivered, and of thoſe that had been counterfeited in their ſtead, this unhappy woman had no leſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to excuſe the fact, then ſhe had malice in the acting it, and maintain'd boldly, that her change being only to ſend the papers, ſhe had punctually delivered all thoſe that came to her hands, but could not give any account of what they did contain.</p>
                        <p>We could not, in fine, get any thing elſe from her, and the diligent care we took to gain ſome exact knowledge of this cover'd Miſtery, pull'd down the laſt and heavieſt miſchief on theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers heads, and made way for the Enemies of their happineſs to compleat the deſign of their abſolute ruine. This wicked inſtrument was no ſooner freed from Examination, but ſhe went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and inform'd the King, that it was time to put in practice, what he had contrived, to divert and deſtroy the inclination of theſe Lovers: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a Gentleman ſent from <hi>Gadate,</hi> who could eaſily wipe out thoſe apprehenſions

and impreſſions which his feigned Letters might have left upon her Spirit.</p>
                        <p>The words of this Malicious woman, who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſcovered, ſoon blow'd his rage and jealouſie into a ſtorm, which at firſt made him think to ſend away immediately to have my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter murthered, but one of his Confidents, leſs paſſionate then himſelf, to whom he had opened his fowl deſign, having wiſely pointed out the difficulty, and danger of enterprizing on the life of ſo conſiderable a perſon, who was ſo well arm'd againſt all aſſaults with the Forces he then commanded, moderated ſomewhat of that firſt fury, and reſolv'd to watch and ſpy me circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, and learn what time he meant to begin his Journey, that ſo they might ceaze on my Maſter. And likewiſe he confirmed the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in her unworthy imployment, by new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, whilſt himſelf contriv'd to preſs forward the pretended Match between <hi>Gadate</hi> and the before mentioned <hi>Princeſs,</hi> and <hi>Chryſeide</hi> with his own Kinſman.</p>

immediately ſend ſome Troopers to plunder and deſtroy his Country, he meant to prevent him, and propounded to <hi>Cyrus</hi> to permit him to go with a party of <hi>Cavalry,</hi> to oppoſe the Enemies paſſage, and ſecure his Subjects, whom his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would hold up in a poſture of Loyalty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Yet was it not without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy that <hi>Cyrus</hi> did ſuffer him to go, only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by his own Forces: but conſidering that a numerous party as that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> laden with much proviſions, could not arrive there ſoon enough, he let him ſet out firſt with ſpeed and diligence, whilſt himſelf diſpoſed his forces to march after him.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers had already conceiv'd ſo high an eſteem of <hi>Gadates</hi> merits, that they likewiſe gave teſtimonies of their impatience to aſſiſt him. <hi>Cyrus</hi> perceiving them in this heat of willingneſs, gave haſty order for the Armies March, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recommended the Lady's and Proviſions to <hi>Gobrias</hi> care in whoſe protection and charge he left them with a ſufficient Guard, he offer'd the cuſtomary Sacrifices on ſuch occaſion, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Troopes in this following order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chryſante</hi> had the Command of the Van-Guard, and that all the party, might follow convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he placed the Curiaſſiers, which were arm'd heavieſt there, at the head of whom he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Centureons to March. <hi>Artabaze</hi> had Command over the <hi>Perſians</hi> that bare Bows and Bucklers; <hi>Adramias</hi> was ordered to follow with the <hi>Median</hi> Infantry; and <hi>Embas</hi> with the <hi>Armenian.</hi> After theſe came <hi>Artuchas</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46063:115"/>
the <hi>Hircanians; Thambrades</hi> the Sacques on foot, and <hi>Damates</hi> the <hi>Caduſians,</hi> which two Nations had lately deſerted the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All thoſe that carried Bucklers, had the right wing, and the Archers or Bow-men the left, with the <hi>Centurions</hi> at their head. Next theſe came on the Troopes that guarded the bagage and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary proviſions. In the Rear Guard, <hi>Madate</hi> led the <hi>Perſian</hi> Cavalry (whom their <hi>Centurions</hi> had order to diſpoſe as the Infantry) <hi>Jeroſombate</hi> the <hi>Median: Tygranes</hi> the <hi>Armenian:</hi> and in the Train of all were, the <hi>Sacques</hi> and <hi>Caduſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This puiſſant Army being thus ranged, <hi>Cyrus</hi> bravely mounted upon a white Horſe, who by his ſtately gate, ſeemed to be proud, of having him for Rider that Commanded ſo many Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy's, rode all about to take a review, and after ſome Speech to them, he particularly required them to be ſilent, as being to March by night, in which there would be more need of their eyes then tongues, and ſet Scouts abroad, whom he often relieved: fearing too weariſom a duty might render them leſs vigilant. The Souldiers, mean while, had leave to reſt themſelves, till a March were ſounded, but they had been ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully animated by their Generals preſence, that they waited for that hour, with deſire and huge impatiency. <hi>Cyrus</hi> having again ſurvey'd the ſeveral Troopes, and called to them all, or the moſt part, by their particular names, he begot ſuch high thoughts in them, of their own worth by ſuch a fortunate mention and knowledge, that they heartily aſpired to make him better
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46063:116"/>
acquainted by ſome rare proofes, of their deſerts and valour: and nothing in effect can be a greater ſpur to worthy actions, then the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and policy to ſhew, before thoſe that are Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of ſuch Gallantry, the proofes of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected proueſſe, as their confuſion and diſgrace is greateſt, that have ſuch Heroick Spectators for their Witneſs, when they do things unhandſomly.

            <p>About the midle portion of the Night, when darkneſs covered the whole face of Heaven, <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave the word to March, and having provided experienc'd guides to attend on <hi>Chryſante,</hi> who led the Van, he cauſed them to go ſlowly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whilſt he made the others advance after: and then having put them all in a poſture to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they began to quicken their pace. At the break of day, ſeeing that the <hi>Caduſian</hi> Infantry, who were in the Rear, were not ſeconded with any Horſe, he drew up ſome Squadrons to joyne with them, and be aſſiſtant in caſe the Enemy ſhould attaque them, and ſent out freſh Scouts to diſcover their Quarters. At the ſame time, that he was going to ſecure his Friend, the unworthy perſon that had formerly betray'd <hi>Gadate</hi> in his amours, and who had ſent that falſe Intelligence to <hi>Chryſeide,</hi> how he was forſaking her, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting how he might ruine him, and give him up into the hands and cuſtody of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> He was well acquainted with his Maſters moſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46063:116"/>
Important Affairs, who had diſpatched him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to advertize his Friends, that he was haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their protection, with a potent Army: But this perfidious wretch, inſtead of performing that Commiſſion, ſent ſpeedy notice to the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> of <hi>Gadates</hi> deſign, and his approaching Forces; and gave ſtrickt command to the Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of a well Fortified Caſtle in their paſſage, of which himſelf was Governour, to admit them, and give them fair entertainment, till he next morning could lead <hi>Gadate</hi> into that Ambuſh he had prepared for him, and wherein he, indeed, inevitably fell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gadate</hi> being arriv'd on his own ſpot; and not finding the face of any Enemy or Oppoſer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a few Chariots, and ſome run-aways, whom his Forlorn-Hope ſtill beat before them, undertook with the ſmall handful of men he had, to purſue a flying party of Horſe, who ſtill fought retreating, till they had drawn him and his eager followers into the ambuſh they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. He hoped to ſave himſelf by beating his way into the Caſtle, which this falſe fellow had ſurrendred to the Enemies, where he had indeed a willing entrance, but with the hazzard of his life, which had been there paid for it, had not the impetuous haſt of the firſt Court of <hi>Guard</hi> who flew with fury at him, given him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that he was in the hands of Enemies, where he thought to find a ſanctuary, and had not four or five that ſcorn'd ſo baſe a murther put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a poſture to defend him. By their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; <hi>Gadate</hi> had, indeed, ſav'd himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46063:117"/>
hurt, and eſcap'd from the Caſtle, had he not unfortunately in his retreat met with the curſed fellow that betray'd him, whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching as a friend, from whom he expected that ſuccour, he ſo much needed, inſtead of it, met with an unexpected wound from him in his ſhoulder, which the other would have directed to his heart, who ſuddenly wheeling from him, ſpurred towards thoſe <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> that had left the Ambuſh to ceaze upon <hi>Gadate,</hi> who yet feared not to purſue them with that inconſiderable Remnant of Friends that were remaining: and had there certainly bravely ſold his life, had not the Enemy been alarm'd with the approach of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his whole Army, which made them ſoon change their ignoble aſſault upon <hi>Gadate,</hi> (who had already laid his falſe Friend dead at his feet) into a more needfull flight to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their haſt, however, could not carry them away ſo fortunately, but that ſome fell in the purſuite, and the reſt were made Priſoners with a great part of the bagage they had deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> having cauſed the retreat to be ſounded, to Rally his diſperſed men, who returned to the Joyful Camp laden with Spoyle, was in ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion for <hi>Gadate,</hi> becauſe he had not ſeen him: whom preſently after he ſpied coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; and whilſt he was pleading excuſe for not ſooner arriving to aſſiſt him; <hi>Gadate</hi> was returning him millions of thanks for the ſuccour that had preſerved a Life, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallably had otherwiſe loſt, amidſt their numbers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:46063:117"/>Whilſt theſe illuſtrious warriours gave a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refreſhing intermiſſion to their men, the <hi>Caducian</hi> Prince, who was in the reare-guard, having not arrived ſo timely as to be at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, thought it ſomewhat imported his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to ſignalize the valour of his ſoldiers, by ſome generous enterprize, ſince he had no ſhare in the freſh Victory they had obtain'd. To this effect, without communicating ought to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he ſecretly drew off from his quarters by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the night, and deſperately made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches neer the, City where the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had locked themſelves up: before which place, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſometime urging them to a combat by his bitter threats; but none appeared to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, the Enemy being ſo fear'd with their laſt defeate, they durſt not iſſue out, till being certainly made acquainted, that the <hi>Caduſians</hi> were there alone, they made a vigorous ſally, and after a hot fight, which hung a long while doubtfully between them, the <hi>Caducians</hi> having, in fine, loſt their Prince, were diſtreſs'd to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
            <p>The troopes which <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent to relieve them, met them at their returne towards the Camp, whilſt every countenance diſplay'd the ſorrows which fill'd their hearts for their loſt Prince, but the judicious <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to divert the ſhame of their defeit, receiv'd them with as honorable careſſes, as if they had return'd victorious and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and conſoling them for their dead Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, attributed all to the fortune and giddy chance of warr, which had ſo unſucceſsfully
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46063:118"/>
ſeconded their attempt: and afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Chyrurgions to have a very great care of ſuch as were wounded: there was not one conſiderable perſon but he did perſonally viſit, and promiſed them all, that in revenge, he would not give the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> any long lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to brag of their advantage. In effect, he went with a ſtrong party to fetch off the ſlain, in ſight of the conquering Enemy within the town: to whom he propounded an equal combat, to redeem the honour of his aſſociates, of whom he had no little jealouſy and eſpecially, theſe now mentioned, becauſe he had acquir'd them but of late: but finding that not any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to anſwer his ſummons, he cauſed the whole Country to be ſpoiled and pillaged, and commanded to cut off all the ſtragling Enemies they ſhould meet, as a ſacrifice for his compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> on the other hand, retyr'd toward <hi>Babylon,</hi> and left him the campagne free: of which when he perceiv'd himſelf the abſolute Maſter, he conſider'd, that to oblige the Enemy, and preſerve thoſe Provinces that had ſo freely tendred themſelves to him, he ſhould doe well to call back thoſe Free-booters he had let looſe; thereby to give no juſt occaſion to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to act the like upon his conquer'd neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, when he ſhould be at too great a diſtance from them, to ſave them from plunder. To this end having ſummoned in his men, whilſt they repleniſh'd all his garriſons with neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, he diſpatched a Trumpetter towards

Subject to pillage, and leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to defend them from the Enemies frequent incurſions, willingly accepted the propoſal; and <hi>Cyrus</hi> likewiſe aſſented to a Truce for ſome dayes, at the requeſt of <hi>Gadates</hi> Mother, who begg'd that time of him, to have the conveniency of putting her affaires in order, land ſo diſpoſe of them, as to be in a capacity of following her ſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he remov'd. This good Lady was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with her daughter <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> who gave <hi>Cyrus</hi> no leſs cauſe to wonder at the excellency of her beauty, then her brother had at the effects of his rare courage. And indeed many of thoſe that were obliged to approach her with becoming ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, were much taken with her charming meen, though there appear'd ſome Characters and lines of ſadneſs and trouble in her lookes, which gave the beholders a perfect knowledge of ſome inclination ſhe left behind, whilſt ſhe was forced to waite and abſent her ſelf with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:46063:119"/>This quiet interval gave way to the paſſion of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ſhew its utmoſt power: the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for not hearing any thing of his <hi>Birinthea,</hi> which had been ſilenced by the diverſions of war, now ceazed ſtrongly, on his ſoul. One day as with theſe thoughts, he entertain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Margen of a pretty river, which led its current through a ſhady Grove, having no other company, but ſuch as were his obliged at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants for his guard, he cauſed them to ſtay at diſtance, that he might with more liberty give himſelf up to his Melancholly reflections, and after a long and ſilent thought fullneſs, which can be better gueſs'd at, then diſcribed, but which as ſince appear'd was altogether fix'd upon his deareſt Princeſs, he pronounced her fair name in a bemoaning accent, which yet had not the liberty to get out of his lips, without the interruption of a thouſand ſighes that uſher'd and attended it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was in this uncomfortable poſture, he caſts his looks beyond the river and beheld ſome Cavaliers, with drawn weapons, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqu'd three or four other men in ruſtique habits, who did defend a woman in the like garb, with more valour then could be hoped for, in perſons of their coats; the inequality of the combatants did quickly rowſe and call up his generoſity, he laid by his thoughts of love to make uſe of his courage, and mounting his horſe as haſtily as he could, he ſwam him croſs the water, together with theſe that attended him, but though his diligence were great, he could not get in time
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46063:119"/>
enough to ſave the woman from being hurried away; however he poſted after thoſe Cavaliers, and having demanded, as he paſt along, of one of the company that came with the woman, what perſon it was, they thus forced from them; he was amazed to hear <hi>Abracome</hi> cry aloud, (whom he diſcover'd by his voyce) that it was <hi>Birinthea,</hi> they thus raviſhed thence. That name hindred all other diſcourſe, it was alone more then he would have heard, and being led now, more by the violence of his paſſion, then he was ere while by his valour, it may be ſaid, he rather flew then rode after thoſe theves, that carry'd thence that treaſure (he eſteem'd above all Diadems) out of his ſight and preſence, whom he at laſt ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took long before any of his company could reach thither.</p>
            <p>It were a task next to impoſſibility to relate; with what fury he ſet on them: three or four of them inſtantly made head againſt him, to give their aſſociates the opportunity of getting into a little City neer hand: but he beat thorough them, and as lightning, darting forwards, when he had ſcatter'd thoſe oppoſing ſwords, he overtook the others juſt at their entrance into the gates. Though they were many that reſiſted <hi>Cyrus,</hi> yet had they need of the firſt <hi>corps de guard</hi> to aſſiſt them, but the reſt of his followers being joyned with him did ſo gallantly ſecond his valour that after they had laid many on the earth, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred pell-mell with their Enemies, who to avoid their blowes retreated further within the City.</p>
            <p>The hurry and confuſion was ſo great, that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46063:120"/>
few diſputed his attempt to get in the City, and as if it had been taken by aſſault, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſoon came to his ear, that had the chief commanded there. He was ſo ſurpriz'd with this alarme, that without ſtaying for his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's to be drawn up, he ran haſtily towards the Gate, where he was told the Enemies had made their way: and there found moſt of his men fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome one way, others another, whilſt <hi>Cyrus</hi> eagerly preſſed thoſe that yet durſt hinder him. He ſoon knew by his valour, that he was head of that enterprize: and therefore having reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cowardize of his guards, that could not ſtand againſt ſo ſmall a power, he made them wheele off, and crying aloud to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that it was he muſt be firſt conquer'd, if they would gain the place; he diſcharg'd ſuch a blow that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had much a doe to ſave himſelf, whereby he found that he had now a more dangerous Enemy to deale with: and then, indeed, as if he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſerved his chiefeſt ſtrength, he joyned all his courage and reſolution to his former hear, to buckle with this freſh and vigorous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent:</p>
            <p>Never had Combat been written in deeper wounds, had they not been as skilful to avoid, as they were deſparate to give them; nor had they ended this duel but with death, if ſome of the Governours Officers then arriving, finding him ſo overmatch'd by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> had not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured him by their numbers, who having loſt much blood, ſeemed to be only animated with his love, and after a while ſunk on his horſes

neck and then rol'd off, under his feet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zorbas,</hi> who was this <hi>Governour,</hi> inſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of this fall, was angry with thoſe that cauſed it, whoſe generoſity not brooking, what his Valour had not purchaſed, cauſed him ſtraigtwayes to be lifted up, and finding him co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with blood that ſtreamed from ſeveral wounds, commanded he ſhould be carried to the next Captains houſe, adjoyned to the gate, where he came in, and there took ſpecial care to have both him, and all his followers dreſt by his beſt <hi>Chryrurgions</hi> before he left the place. He alſo gave order to have the Gates ſecured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having waited ſome time to ſee if any other Forces would appear, not having faith enough to believe that thoſe few Priſoners could have alone the confidence to force his Guards. After a while he returned again to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who notwithſtanding the ſmart of his wounds, and the ſhame of his Captivity, teſtified, he thought nothing trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome compared to his fears for <hi>Birinthea,</hi> after whom he often inquired of thoſe that were in preſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zorbas</hi> aborded him ſo civily, that although he were prepoſſeſs'd with thoſe griefs, he could not but obſerve ſomething in him, which is not to be met with in ordinary perſons, and from which he derived (ſetting aſide his intereſts) no ſmall or mean hopes of all the favour that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Noble Enemy. Their firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes were nothing but juſt and mutual praiſes they paid each others valours: in fine, <hi>Cyrus</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:46063:121"/>
prompted by his affection, beſeeched <hi>Zorbas</hi> to let him give him in particular, an account of the reaſons that had urg'd and drawn him to this purſuite of his men even within his Gates, and <hi>Zorbat</hi> being firſt inform'd that <hi>Cyrus</hi> might uſe the liberty of his Speech without any detriment to his health; after he had cleared the Chamber of other Auditours, <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſpake thus to him. <hi>Generous Warriour, I ſhould have reaſon to conceal the Cauſe and Subject of my preſent condition. if I were not to relate it to a perſon who has the gifts of too many other brave quality's, to be a ſtranger to the experience of what has thus engag'd me.</hi>

to a cloſe Chamber, wherein ſhe was lock'd up with a Wench and a Souldier that ſtir'd not from the door. The barbarous Villain ſcarce gave her liberty to bemoan her condition, or breath a ſigh, but ſeeing her in a habit ſuitable to that diſaſterous Captivity, he proffer'd his comforts, and impertinent frenzies to abate her ſorrows, and told her, to dry up her trifling and fruitleſs tears, that ſhe was but too happy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing valued by him that had brought her to this paſs: this inſolent Courtſhip ſenſibly offended her; who muſt needs be Miſtris of a rare patience to endure it, that knew her ſelf to be ador'd by the greateſt of Princes: but ſhe had reaſon in that diſtreſs to ſuffer all this and more, rather then diſcover unreaſonably what ſhe was; and <hi>Zorbas</hi> ſtep'd into the room, juſt when ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending her ſelf againſt the rude careſſes of this rough fellow: She was truly joy'd that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence put an end to the others inſolence: but yet another fear ſtept in to make her fortune leſs compleat, which was an apprehenſion that this was the perſon had ſurpriz'd her for his own baſe ends: nevertheleſs the civility of his mild ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, promiſed more good, and gave her way to reaſſume her firſt fair hopes; and as he was very diſcreet, he had no ſooner met her, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the moſt uſuall and becoming Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Salutation, but he intreated ſhe would be conducted to a Frie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

a thouſand times more then death it ſelf, but <hi>Cyrus</hi> perceiving it, inform'd her better by theſe words, <hi>Fear not to approach me,</hi> Madam, <hi>You need not doubt you ſhall hazzard that now; which I endeavour'd to ſave at the price of my Life: it was to hinder and prevent the unhappineſs you ſtart from, that put me into this wounded condition.

            <p>One day, when the purity of the air, had tempted me to walk with my Maids in, thoſe pleaſant allies, thorow the Royal park, which lead toward the brook, he hapned to be very neer me, ere I was aware: which gave him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to overhear what I ſpake to my Maid named <hi>Diomar,</hi> who has ever been my cheifeſt confident, and taking occaſion to continue the very ſame diſcourſe rather then ſeem to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt what then my thoughts were buſied with, he preſented me his hand, and leading me ſtill in the ſame walk, as well as words, cunningly wiredrawd them to his own ends, which having engag'd me to attention he proſecuted thus.</p>

I would not hide the truth of it from her, to prevent her judgement by my inſtructions from being ſeduced by the King, who I was confident would endeavour to corrupt her, and having ſummoned all our reaſon to aid us in our conſultation what to doe in this caſe, I reſolv'd to diſſemble, and make the King know, I reckned all this but as gallantry and formal complaiſance, and ſtrictly commanded her not to diſcover it to any other, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to give me an exact account if ever the King made any diſcourſe to her concerning it.</hi>

In this conflict, I had much adoe to manage his reaſon, if I treated him ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy he became inſolent, if I checqued his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, he flew into violence, ſo that by the frequent changes of our lookes, and the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our voices when we met, the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoon conjectur'd the matter of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, The Queen who is extremely diſcreet was one of the firſt that gueſs'd it, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with me once in private, relying on the conjectures ſhe had made, ſhe indeavour'd quaintly to know the certainty: but miſs'd her deſign, for I pretended not to underſtand her and turned the current of the inquiry into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother channel.</p>
            <p>The doubt I dwelt upon whether I ſhould make known the truth or not to her, held me ſometime in ſuſpence. I feard ſhe might become my Enemy if I declar'd my ſelf her rival, and on the other hand, I apprehended that if I ſhould conclude my privacy was but a token of my confederacy with the King. In the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, knowing the ſolidity of his vertue, I thought moſt convenient to informe her fully

            </p>
            <p>I was highly ſatisfied with her temper and goodneſs, ſhe bearing ſo great a ſhare of the trouble; and to ſhun the Kings importunate courtſhip, who perſecuted me with a perpetual expoſtulation, I kept my ſelf the moſt that I could with her, becauſe in her preſence he could not ſo well have the liberty of a ſecret ſpeech, or more open addreſs: but when he perceived that I avoided thoſe opportunities, he made uſe of a new Stratagem and engine, having gain'd and notably inſtructed one of the Queens maids of her Chamber to ſollicite and plead for him, who
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46063:128"/>
was ſo over diligent in her duty; that I had ſcarce a minute of intermiſſion when the Queen was abſent. I told the Queen of this new inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſhe was forc'd to ſuffer her, to keep the King in temper, who nevertheleſs began to ſhow ſome anger, and ſometimes borrow'd the threatnings of ſeverity to quell my braving conſtancy, which beat off all the eſſaillants he ſo long had kept in action againſt me.</p>

To this purpoſe, She proffer'd to carry us to one of her Country Houſes, not above a dayes Journey from <hi>Ecba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane.</hi> This reſolution being fixt, to depart within a day or two, I retired my ſelf with my Mother, who was mightily troubled at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, and who would needs be exactly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of every Circumſtance relating to this ſad ſtory.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I would have reply'd, but he gave me not the time, for taking me by the hand, he intreated I would follow him.

This made their ſubtil endeavours become ſo importunate, that it but rais'd up more, thoſe Spirits they would have laid, and inſtead of ſoothing me, urg'd me to ſend them word by an attendant, that if their orders were to procure my content, they could not find a more ready means then by their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſilence.</p>

            <p>The good Offices this Fellow rendred me, did much deminiſh my Melancholly, by his means I oft received and returned Meſſages to the Queen, and my Dear Mother, and I was inform'd, that <hi>Cyaxares</hi> who had a good while left me, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhortly to renew his viſit.

            <p>Though this Ticket were not ſigned, <hi>Zorbas</hi> was ſo happy in the acquaintance of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that he no ſooner received and read it, but he immediately went to <hi>Cyrus</hi>; to whom he ſaid; ſhewing him the paper, that he was hugely ſorry to part with him ſo ſoon, and wanted the due time to confirme ſo ſtrickt an amity as he much long'd to contract with him, but that the decree he held in his hand, had haſtned him to come and let him know, he was at liberty with all his party to returne when they pleas'd: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his wounded body could admit of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. <hi>Cyrus</hi> not being able to conceive from whence <hi>Zorbas</hi> had ſo ſuddenly received theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, beſeeched him to tell it; and <hi>Zorbas</hi> after he had read it, aſſur'd him, it came from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo much his Soveraign, that he would count his life but a mean loſs, if compar'd to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and therefore could conſult no reaſon but hers in what concerned his obedience towards her, which he would never forfeit, whilſt in his power to performe; and therefore earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to let her know at his return, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46063:133"/>
and zealous he had been to accompliſh her injunctions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> having reply'd, with as much generoſity as Courtſhip, that this was the leaſt ſervice he could pay to requite ſo much civility, deſired him, that on the next morning he might free him from the trouble of his unhandſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unhealthy company; by reaſon of his wounds: <hi>Zorbas</hi> however conſented not to it, till the Chyrurgions had aſſured he might be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without danger, and having ended his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he renew'd them by a freſh addreſs to <hi>Birinthea,</hi> ſhaping a thouſand excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for his mens inſolencies, and pray'd her to declare what ſatisfaction ſhe thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, knowing an ordinary death was too cheap a juſtice and payment for ſo daring a crime, wherefore he left them to her ſentence. This Princeſs, whoſe mercy ſwayd above all other ſentiments, told him, that it would ſeem to reliſh of ingratitude, if after ſuch choice obligations, which wip'd out all the other ſcores of injury, ſhe ſhould be ſo unjuſt as to demand their lives. Wherefore as ſhe had reaſon to be concern'd in all that related to him, ſo ſhe not only would profeſs it, but evidently prove it by begging their lives of him, as a particular grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>The night was now much waſted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Zorbas</hi> having anſwerd in a few words, that ſhe might abſolutely diſpoſe of the lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of thoſe inſolent fellows, took his leave, and commanded the miſtriſs of that houſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46063:133"/>
where they lodg'd, to prepare a bed with all things convenient for <hi>Birinthea,</hi> who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retyr'd, to prevent any ſcandal might be taken, if ſhe made any longer ſtay with <hi>Cyrus. Zorbas</hi> likewiſe diſpatch'd away the Trumpetter to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, to take order againſt the next morning for fetching away his priſonners, and gave them ſpecial charge of the letter he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd in anſwer to his Lady.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, our Heroe's exceſſive joy for the ſight of his dear Princeſs, was ſo great it quell'd for ſome time the alarm which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her diſcourſe had disquieted and threatned him withall, and as one highly ſatisfied with his own proſperous affection, he conſumed the remainder of that night with the pleaſing fancies of happy lovers. But then the ſadder remembrance of thoſe leſs promiſing ſpeeches entring again into his mind, when the firſt light of day peep'd into his bed; Ah, cry'd he, <hi>Am I ſo much a falſe friend to my ſelf, as yet to flatter my hopes, did not</hi> Birinthea <hi>tell me, that ſhe could not love me? Nay which is more, that ſhe ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or ſuffer me to love her? Great gods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then did ſhe come to ſeek me out? Does ſhe expect the protection of one whoſe affection ſhe cannot entertain? and does ſhe caſt her ſelf into his armes, whoſe flames ſhe muſt and will baniſh out of her heart? How unjuſt and cruel are you</hi> Birinthea, <hi>if you intend ſeriouſly to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ect my fair pretences, ſince you know I cannot che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh life, but as you cheriſh my love: But in fine, what is it you aime at? Muſt I employ the unlucky reſidue of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46063:134"/>
my power to advance the proſperity and bliſs of ſome triumphant rival? Muſt all my Army fight to tear of my own glorious Wreaths and Crowns, and ſet them on anothers prouder head? What meane you,</hi> Birinthea, <hi>by theſe ſervices you claime? But —O how impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is this curioſity and ſtrugling? and how offenſive to that reſpect and reverence I owe you; pardon dear Princeſs, come lets obey, and ſerve her with a religious and blindfold ſubmiſſion, and whether life or death be the ſucceſs, bow under fate, ſince ſhe commands the triall; ſhe is my Soveraign and may diſpoſe of all my Fortunes, and it muſt needs be as glorious, as it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now to</hi> Cyrus, <hi>to have contributed towards her fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, what ever be the event.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was diſturbed with theſe perplexing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, even whilſt he ſlumbred, till ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants came to his bedſide to tell him, if he had repoſed enough, he might be going thence as ſoon as he deſired. The firſt inquiry he made, was for his Princeſs, and to be inform'd whether ſhe were yet ready, but underſtanding that <hi>Zorbas</hi> entertained her till his upriſing, he ſent to excuſe his lazineſs, and being dreſſed and his wounds lookt to, which were the leaſt of his paines, they carried him in a chayr to the place where <hi>Zorbas</hi> yet converſed with <hi>Birinthea,</hi> and there having paid his beſt civilities and thanks for the favours received at the Governours hands, who repented he was no more prodigal of them, ſince the occaſion of adding to the ſtore was now removing from him, they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46063:134"/>
embrac'd and bad farewel, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was placed in a litter which waited him, whilſt <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthea</hi> was not ſparing of her compliments to court <hi>Zorbas,</hi> who attended and helpt her into the Chariot he had prepar'd, and all thoſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> that were in a fit poſture to accompany them, had ſuch conveniency as made their journey no leſs eaſy, then joyful, in regard of their liberty, to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Birinthea</hi> would have taken their laſt adieu of <hi>Zorbas,</hi> at the Gates, but he would needs convoy them till they meet the little troop which haſtned to fetch and guide them to the Camp, which were but few in number to avoid all ſuſpition and inquiry. Then they repeated — Myriads of new proteſtations and vows of never dying friendſhip, and made their cloſs embraces the laſt ceremonies and ſeals of future amity. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had paſs'd the verge of that River, where he firſt diſcover'd the raviſhers of his dear Princeſs, <hi>Tygranes, Artabaſe, Gadate</hi> and all the prime Officers of his Army, who waited at the wood-ſide, came to congratulate his ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. The Souldiers, all this time, knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till their General was in his Tent, then it was publiſhd openly and they declar'd by their loud welcomes and acclamations, the hearty joy for his return ſo fully, that by it may be gueſs'd, what trouble and diſcontent would have poſſeſs'd each ſoul, had they not lived in the more happy ignorance of his late abſence.</p>
