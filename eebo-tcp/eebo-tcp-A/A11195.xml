            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>fter that <hi>Peter Vendronitz Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneuf,</hi> one of the principallest, and most valiant <hi>Boyars,</hi> had béene magnificently brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie, and most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie received, by <hi>Boritz Fendro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz Godena,</hi> who was then Prince of the countrie: and all this, because of his magnanimious defence, and kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Castle of <hi>Novomerskigrod,</hi> against the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Demetri Ioanavitz,</hi> and that for so valiant an act, he had béene rewarded by his said Prince, with great and rich presents, the which fell out, in the moneth of Februarie, 1605. It happened, that about the 13. of Aprill, the said <hi>Boritz Fendronitz Godena</hi> sodainlie died, not without suspition, of having béene poysoned: and he being interred the day after, his wife a desolate widdowe, and his sonne <hi>Fender Borissovitz,</hi> were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently placed in the Imperiall throne, and received for Prince, and Princesse, by every one of the Citie, and of the Countrie, who did them homage, and sware vnto them, fidelitie, subiection, and obedience. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:7881:3"/>
they dispatched incontinently, the said <hi>Peter Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronitz Basmaneuf</hi> towards the Campe, as he that was Generall of al the men of warre, to sweare them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custome which was performed by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of them. But by reason that the Prince <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metri Ioanovitz,</hi> drew every day, nearer, and nearer, and that his force apparantly augmented, by reason of the great multitude of good fighting men, and other hyred souldiers, which were sent him out of <hi>Poland,</hi> so that those of the champion countrie, presently ioyned with them, principally because by permission divine, all the world was of opinion and fullie perswaded, that hee was the man, which should be true heire, and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor to the Crowne: to which in like manner, many of the <hi>Boyars,</hi> willingly gaue an eare, and those also of <hi>Boritz Fendronitz Godenaes</hi> partie, who knew not well their owne power, and were ignorant how to prevaile with their naturall authority: as also, there was a great part of the men of warre, which desired rather to worship the Sunne rysing, as the said <hi>Basmaneuf</hi> in like manner did, to insinuate betimes into the favour of their new Prince, so that in conclusion, all the Campe revolted, adhering with the greatest part of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> to that Prince <hi>Demetrius:</hi> who drew nearer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, to the chiefe Citie of the countrie, and in his way all the world fell downe before him, and thus the 20. of June, he made his entrie into the Citie of Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covie. The 28. of the said moneth, there arived also, the old Princesse, who was supposed to be the Mother, or rather indéede the wife, of the Tyrant <hi>Ioan Vasilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitz,</hi> who during her widdow-head, had béene shut vp, in a little obscure cloyster, like a poore prisoner, which was distant an hundred leagues from the said Citie. And the said Prince, (by supposition h<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>onne) presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him selfe before her, accompanying her by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots

side, with his head alwaies vncovered, &amp; on foote, never mounting so much as on horse backe, whilst they entered into the Castle: where the said pretended mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, betooke her selfe to an other of the principall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, wherein there was none, but of the greatest Ladies in the countrie, and where she as yet remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, being very well entreated, as a Princesse, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse; and as the wife, and dowager, of an Emperour of that countrie. This <hi>Demetrius</hi> stayed not long, but caused himselfe to be crowned, the 21. of the said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, notwithstanding, that the Emperours of <hi>Russia</hi> were alwaies wont, to put over this inauguration, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fift of September, which is the day, when they begin to count the new yeare. But it seemes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie made him hasten the celebration of this solemnitie, for verie urgent reasons. He had about his person, a guard of certaine <hi>Almayne</hi> Halberdiers, which hée brought with him out of <hi>Poland:</hi> but by reason that this was not the manner and custome of other Princes, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their residence within the Citie, they were all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently discharged, as in like manner all souldiers of any strange nation, were licensed, and cashierd: the which was put in execution so confusedly, and sodainely, as divers were very male-content therewith, by reason they gave them not that which was promised, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, they found themselues but evilly rewarded, and slenderly recompensed for their good services: and namelie, there was a certaine great Lord, and Prince of <hi>Russia</hi> the faire, who was called <hi>Adam Visnevetskie,</hi> that amongst other of his complaints, intimated, how he had lent the said <hi>Demetrius,</hi> while he remayned in <hi>Poland,</hi> about the summe of 80000 Roubles (a kinde of coyne.) Wherefore it is, I cannot well tell, but the said Lord was dislodged, without giving him, either payment, or contentment: and now there runnes a
<pb facs="tcp:7881:4"/>
rumor abroad, that he forageth vpon the frontires of that countrie, with divers others of the same faction, like male-contented people, doing there al damage, and waste, that they can devise. At the verie beginning of this <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Empire, there were many, which as well in publike, as private, affirmed, that hée was in no sort, true successor, heire, or Prince of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, amongst whome, was also a great Lord, and a Monke. But the said Monke was quicklie dispatched, and the Lord, whose name was <hi>Vasilius Ioanovitz Cins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie</hi> (who is now Prince of the countrie) was brought into the open market place, before the seate of Iustice, and stripped, readie to have his head cut off with an hatchet, who notwithstanding at the same instant, and by the intercession of the Chancellor <hi>Ossinassi Ioanovitz,</hi> obtayned mercie, and preservation of his life, and was verie honourablie entertayned, and from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, one could heare no speach of any thing else, but daylie treasons, and all kinde of conspiracies: whereof haue ensued so manie tortures, flagellations, disgraces, releasements, confiscations, and censure of goods, with new confirmations of estates, as it was most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to heare: but this cursed race, and perverse genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vipers, never ceased, vntill they had executed their tyranicall designes, during the governement of a strange Prince. For his owne person, he maintayned his greatnesse verie well: he was a man of meane stature, browne of hew, prompt to choller, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeased, he hath broken many a staffe, and given sentence of death, vpon the Marshalles, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, when they did but a little swarve from their dutie, he liked well to be on horse backe, and loved to go often on hunting, being a man of great expedition, &amp; that would quickly order whatsoever came before him, &amp; commanded with excellent forecast, even in the least
<pb facs="tcp:7881:4"/>
matters: he was a great enterpriser, of wonderfull courage, and inwardly conceived, that all the countrie of <hi>Moscovia,</hi> was not sufficient for him, to purchase a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great renowne, so that he aspired after other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries also, and monarchies: at the beginning, he was verie affable, giving free accesse, even to the meanest: but after he grew to know, and vnderstand the <hi>Russians</hi> false prankes, he provided himselfe, of a guard of <hi>Livo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and afterwardes also, of <hi>Alwaynes,</hi> and other strangers, to witte, vnder three Captaines, a <hi>French,</hi> an <hi>English,</hi> and a <hi>Scot.</hi> Under the <hi>French</hi> Captaine, who was called <hi>Iaques Margarett,</hi> he had an hundred Archers, which carried Partisanes, and were richlie cladde in velvet, and cloth of gold. Under the <hi>English</hi> man, whose name was <hi>Mathew Knowtson,</hi> he had an hundred Halbardiers: as also vnder the <hi>Scot,</hi> called <hi>Albert Fancie,</hi> in like manner an hundred others, who were apparelled in tawnie cloth, with large gardes of velvet, and on festivall daies, in red crymson velvet. The Archers had for the most part, 70. Roubles a yeare, and besides this, the revenewe of certaine lands, whereon they might live. The Halbardiers, over and above their revenew of land assigned them, had 40. Roubles a yeare, and two sutes of apparell; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, he yet farther determined, to have also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained an hundred Muskettiers, yet this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was laid a part. Besides the delight which hée tooke in hunting, he also tooke great delight, to cast pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Artillerie, and not onlie to sée them in hand, but also to prooue them himselfe: for which end, he caused Ravylines, and Rampiers to be erected, to imitate an assault, in which traynings, and exercises, hée would alwaies be in the thickest amongst others, so that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was but hardly entreated, and violently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed. Whilst this calme and peace endured, he sent
<pb facs="tcp:7881:5"/>
the Lord <hi>Ossivassi Ivanovitz Vlussi,</hi> his Ambassador into <hi>Poland,</hi> to demande the <hi>Vayvod</hi> of <hi>Landimier</hi> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in marriage, and to bring the said his spouse into the countrie. The Ambassadour arived at <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and after having procured, and obtayned his request, the avant nuptialles, or espousalles, were verie royally celebrated, and the said Lady, was placed at the vpper end of the King of <hi>Poloniaes</hi> table, above the King, &amp; the Popes <hi>Nuntio:</hi> the like honour being done to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, as to one, holding the place of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Russia.</hi> The young Prince of <hi>Polonia,</hi> togither with the Kings sister, departed presently after, and so the said Ambassadour was conveyed with a most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent trayne, even to the borders, and arived héere with the spouses Father, in the Citie of <hi>Mosco,</hi> the 26. of Aprill, where the day following, he presently made his report, to Prince <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the said <hi>Vayvod</hi> had also his accesse, in saluting all the Courtiers, and verie friendlie embracing one another, who was lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Castle, in <hi>Boritz Fendronitz</hi> lodging. The second of May, the new Empresse, made her glorious entrie into the Castle, being drawne in a Chariot all gilded, which was purposely made for her: and the same Ladie espousall, was accompanied with a great number of Lordes, and gentlemen, that is to say, first, with my Lord her father, the <hi>Vayvod</hi> of <hi>Landimier</hi>; and his sonne, my Lord, the King of <hi>Poloniaes</hi> Ambassadour and the Lord <hi>Swisnevitz,</hi> brother to the other <hi>Vayvod:</hi> also the two brothers, <hi>Steri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fskie,</hi> and many others, which were of the sute of the said Princesse: and then of the Princes traine, there was the Lord <hi>Peter Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manoff,</hi> with all the great <hi>Boyars</hi> of the countrie, they being all most sumptuouslie clad, after the manner of that region: there was also many other Coaches, and Carosses of Ladies, and Gentlemen. The Princesse
<pb facs="tcp:7881:5"/>
shewed her selfe verie benigne and gratious, in saluting not onlie, all the Ladies of the Court, but also, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing verie affably, with divers citizens wives: and thus they advanced towardes the Castle, where there was an high scaffold set vp hard by the gate, vpon the which, a number of trumpets stoode, and kettle drums, making a wonderfull sound, with the loud report of their instruments. From thence the said Ladie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, was conducted to the Cloyster, where the Ladies and Damoselles were resident, being the widdowes, and daughters of the great Lordes, and <hi>Boyars</hi> of the countrie: and there was also the old Empresse, where she was to stay, and spend the time, till the day of nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall celebration. The <hi>Russians</hi> enformed me, that these Ladies were there taught, and instructed in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the faith, and <hi>Russian</hi> ceremonies, and that the same Ladie Princesse, was constrayned to doe the like, and that after this, she must be baptized after the <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> manner: but I rather suppose, séeing <hi>Demetrius</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented thither so daylie, and was there so privately, that he taught her an other Catechisme: and so as the entrie into this Monastery, was made on a Friday, so was her comming forth, incontinently on the Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following. For shée was conducted againe into the Castle, into lodgings verie richly hung, and the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie (through which shée was to passe) was all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with red crimson cloth, and the hangings of the said chambers, were for the most part, of cloth of gold. The day following, at Evensong, the espousalles were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized by the Patriarch in our Ladies Church, where shée was also crowned: the Temple round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, was hung with red cloth, with embroyderie of gold and silke, and the pavement was covered with the like. The Crowne, Scepter, Globe, and Sword, were all carried before the Emperour of <hi>Russia,</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:7881:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Crowne, which was to be put on the Empresses head, was carried vpon a cushen of red velvet: these solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities continuing about the space of two houres, and thus they both went out of the Church togither, leading one another by the hand, with crownes on their heads: on the right hand, the Emperour was led by the Lord <hi>Knees,</hi> or Duke <hi>Fender Ivanovitz Aliholsta:</hi> and the Empresse on the left, by the Duchesse, wife to the said Lord. The trumpets, kettle drummes, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther musicall instruments, made a great noise, and all the Court, was in festivitie, and ioy. But in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there was no great preparation, for it seemes, that the greatest triumphing, was betwixt the new married couple. I forgot to relate, how the King of <hi>Poloniaes</hi> Ambassadour brought with him, very goodly presents, the which he presented, the day after his ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall: which were vessels of silver, guilt, with a great number of cuppes, and goblets, and two goodly horses, with a faire dogge: having delivered his letters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Emperours owne hands, who receiving the letter, and perceiving, that vpon the title of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there was mentioned the title of Emperour, and Monarch of <hi>Russia,</hi> he presently reiected the said letter, and delivered it himselfe to the same Ambassadour: wherevpon the Ambassadour replying, answered, that his grandfathers, and predecessors, never pretended, nor vsurped any such title, and that therefore, none was enioyned, to entitle him otherwise, then by the name of great Duke: but if he did affect any higher stile then his progenitors, that then he should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to conquer the Empires of great <hi>Tartaria,</hi> or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to subdue vnder himselfe, the scepter of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> Emperour, and then he would be acknowledged of all the world, for an Emperour, and Monarch. At which so sharpe, and stinging an answere, the <hi>Vayvod,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7881:6"/>
Father to the spouse, was mightilie astonished, and Prince <hi>Demetrius</hi> so enraged, that hée woulde have cast his scepter at the Ambassadours head. When this choler was over, some body demaunded of the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, whether the scepter was throwne at his head or no? if it had béene (said he) I would have taken it vp, and gone away with the scepter, returning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently into my countrie: notwithstanding, all this spléene passed over eassely, and they retyred themselues peaceably, and verie good friends, but the letter was never read. Mony also was throwne abroad, when the coronation was solemnized, and Friday, which was the 9. of May, that is to say, the day after the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, and consummation of the marriage, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of the Ambassadours, and others of the Court, should have béene delivered, but it séemes, that this good <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who it may be (as having béene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore a Monke) was too devout vpon his Breviarie, he said too long a Masse with his new mistris, in whose companie, he was so ravished, that he forgot to rise soone enough in the morning, and so shewing himselfe in publike very late, the same evening also there was no great banqueting at the Court. But on Satter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which was a very solemne festivall day, so as the <hi>Russians</hi> kept it with greater reverence, then their Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: it vexed the <hi>Russians</hi> wonderfully, to sée this day prophaned by their Princes nuptialles, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, the Emperour, with the Empresse, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their crownes vpon their heads, were set in a great Hall, where first the Patriarke, and then the <hi>Boyars,</hi> and in the end, Merchants strangers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of qualitie, entred in, kissing the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses hand, and everie one offering of their presents: amongst whome, was also your brother, and I, but I would to God we had kept our mony in our purses, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:7881:7"/>
we did it in hope, to have obtayned some privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; this we did out of a good intention, according as we had before received many faire promises from my Lord <hi>Vayvod</hi>: but the disastrous end of all this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivitie, did in like manner frustrate vs of our designes. Wherefore presently the tables were in readinesse, and we were invited, and set in presence of our Emperour, at a most sumptuous dinner, and banquet, but after the manner of that countrie, and we strangers were placed at the table, with our faces towardes the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but the <hi>Russians</hi> were not permitted to doe so, but they must sit with their backes vpon him: this feast might wel deserue a prettie treatise apart, but wée must reserue something till we returne, to report vnto you, by worde of mouth, the braue drafts, that there they carowsed, and dranke off. After this feast, they sent home vnto vs meate in gilded plate, but they forgot not quickly to redemaund their plate dishes againe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it might haue béene supposed, that we received them in recompence of our former presents. There was very excellent musike which was of <hi>Poland,</hi> among the followers of the said Ladie, and this was the best pastime we had, but it was a verie short ioy and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilie.</p>
            <p>The Sonday following, there was yet farre greater feasting, and the king of <hi>Poloniaes</hi> Ambassadour, made it knowne before, that he would not sit downe at the table, except they did him the same honour, which was afforded the Ambassadour of <hi>Russia,</hi> in the royal Court of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> where he was set downe at the Kings ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so he requested, he might likewise have his place, at the Imperiall table, to which the Emperour would not in the beginning consent, but so he let him vnderstand, that he should have his place, above al the <hi>Boyares,</hi> and great Lordes of the countrie: the which
<pb facs="tcp:7881:7"/>
the said <hi>Polonian</hi> Ambassadour flatlie refused, so that at last, the Emperour permitted him to sit at his table, and so he came thither with his presents, which were farre ritcher, then any of the former, and the banquet continued till it was late in the evening. In the reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of themselues, a <hi>Polonian</hi> strucke a <hi>Russian</hi> such a blowe, that being fore wounded, he cryed aloud, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But the vproare was presently pacified, and the two daies following, there was nothing but sounding of trumpets, and kettle drummes, after the Imperiall manner. It was supposed also, that the guard of the <hi>Boyares,</hi> should have shot off their Harquebuzes, and that the Artillerie, and Chambers laden with balles of artificiall fire, should have béene discharged, in signe of ioy, the Cannon was now drawne out of the Citie, and a Fortresse of wood after the moderne fashion was built for an assault: but all this (as an evill presage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was given over. On Wednesday, a day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Russians</hi> eate no flesh, all was verie silent, and still, as also the Thursday following, and by reason the Emperor had alittle inckling of what was a brewing amongst the <hi>Russians,</hi> having alwaies his eare, and eye herevpon, he advised all the <hi>Poloniaus</hi> to stand vpon their guard, commanding all those of his owne guard, that they should repaire to the Castle, with their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzes charged, bullet in mouth, and match light, and in truth, there was to the number of 15000. <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> which were now in readines, to effect their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise: but by reason that the <hi>Polonians</hi> kept good watch, and shot off many Harquebuzadoes in hearing, making a great rutte with their kettle drummes, the <hi>Russians</hi> durst attempt nothing: that present night, which might have served the other well, for an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and fore-sight: as also they might clearely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the ioy of this marriage sodainely ceased,
<pb facs="tcp:7881:8"/>
and that all the time passed away, in an vncouth and dead silence, and the Friday after, there was none that would sell them any powder, or other warlike muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, the young Empresse passed the time merrily amongst her damoselles, in measures, daunces, and masking, intending to have come the Sonday following, in a gallant mummerie to find out the Emperour, when he should be at a banquet, with the great Lords, and to present them yet further, with some new recreations, but all this was interrupted: for the <hi>Russians</hi> now plotted, to put in execution, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, which long time before they had resolved vpon: which was, the same Satterday, being the 17. of May, according to the old stile, about seaven by our clockes in the morning. For this conspiracie to kill the Emperour, was proiected before the <hi>Vayvods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the countrie with his daughter, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking themselues long before, to entrap all the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> which should then be there present, with their armes, and also because by the same meane, they would recover at that instant, all the treasure which had bin sent out of the countrie, to the said <hi>Vayvod,</hi> &amp; his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thus this tragedie began. On the same day, most terribly, the <hi>Boyars,</hi> with their servants being mounted on horse backe, with harnesse, and coates of male on their backes, hauing lances in their handes, iavelines, and darts, bowes, and arrowes, cymitars, and all other kind of armes, the common people run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp and downe, with their stéele mases, stockes, and cymitars in their hands, the number of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so great, as it séemed, that the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> swarmed as thicke as haile stones, all the world ranne hastily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Castle, crying no other thing, along the stréetes as they went, but, to the murder, to the fire,
<pb facs="tcp:7881:8"/>
kill, kill, making one another beléeve, that the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> massacred the <hi>Boyars</hi> within the Castle, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie few of them were lodged within the same: but this was done to no other end, but the more to flesh the rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hell vulgar, against the poore <hi>Polonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This vproare was so sodaine, that divers <hi>Russians,</hi> apparelled after the <hi>Polonian</hi> fashion, were slayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>middest the presse, and incontinently, they belayed the Innes, and lodgings of all the <hi>Polonian</hi> Gentlemen, so as no bodie could either come forth, or assist one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with their armes. They ranne in thousands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Castle, where no resistance was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, by the Princes Archers, who were all <hi>Russians,</hi> and held correspondencie with the rest. And evill fortune went so hard on this miserable Princes side, that where as he was wont to have every day, all 100 Halberdiers, in a corps <hi>de</hi> guard, there was not now 30. no, not so much as one Captaine to be séene, and yet if they had béene there all togither, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their best, in defending of themselues, it had béene nothing against so great a multitude of people, but the slaughter, and butchery had béene so much the greater, besides the evident daunger, whereto was Dutch Merchants, and of all other strange nations should have runne into. The <hi>Russians</hi> therefore, cryed out to them of the guard, (so few of them as there were) that they should lay aside their armes, to come &amp; ioyne with them, and take their part, and then they should have no hurt at all, the which they presently did, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yéelded themselues, with their armes laid aside, The <hi>Russians</hi> then ranne vp towardes the great Hall, with great presse, the above named <hi>Peter Basmaneuf</hi> going before them, who was a verie faithfull friend of the Emperours, and who, heretofore had a servant, who many times spake very evillie of the Emperour,
<pb facs="tcp:7881:9"/>
and defamed him amongst the common people; the same was he, who sodainely stroke his old master, in such a sort, that he died.</p>
            <p>The great troupe then ranne with like haste, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Chambers, and even to the Emperours owne lodging, who hearing this tumult, leapt out of his bed, putting on his night gowne, and demaunding what the matter was: whereupon one of his houshold <hi>Russes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he knew nothing, and that it might be they cryed out for some fire. No, villainous traytor as thou art, (said the Emperour) it is not for fire they thus crie out, but there must néedes be some other matter in it, for all the belles, as well of the Cittie, as of the Castle doe ring alarum. Ah (saide he further) doe you thinke you have to doe with an other <hi>Boritz</hi> and so hée made himselfe ready, tucking vp his shirt sléeves very high, and calling for his two edged Curtleaxe, which they were wont to carry before him, to lay about him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in on all sides, but he who had it in kéeping, could not finde it: and when hée sawe the enemies troupe to presse forward, to flie vpon him, hée requested his Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdiers which were before the gate, that they woulde not thus yéelde him into the <hi>Boyars</hi> handes, shutting the doore himselfe, and so retiring within some other more inward Chambers, even to the stuffe where he was wont to bathe himselfe, whither hée was presently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by his enemies, so that hée leaped downe out of a window, falling a marvellous height, vppon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for his lodging was in the toppe of the Castle, so as it was a great wonder, that he broke not his armes, and legs, or that hée was not crushed all in péeces. One of his Halberdiers, called <hi>Farstenberg,</hi> came presently downe the staires, and found him yet alive, but allhis breast was bruised, so as he did nothing but vomite bloud, &amp; his head was also all to be crushed, &amp; bloudy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7881:9"/>
The saide Halberdier, with others helpe, carried him up againe into his Chamber, where he was alittle refreshed with waters and other comfortative drugges, while hée came alittle againe vnto himselfe, and then the <hi>Boyars</hi> had much talke with him, and interrogated with him vpon some points, but it could never yet he well knowne, what passed betwixt them. And to the end that the saide Halberdier might divulge nothing of such matters as had passed betwixt them, they presently kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and afterwardes they slew their Prince, with many cuttes and thrusts, and so they drew out his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, throwing it downe from aloft with a cord fastned about his privities, and thus hacked, dragged it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the market place like a dogge or some other vile carrion, leaving thus his stript and naked dead body, to the view of all the world, vpon a plancher or stage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected on high, till the fourth day after, and vnder him, the body of his friend <hi>Peter Basmaneuf.</hi> There went e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day thither great numbers of men and women, to sée this hideous sight, and they put an vgly visard vpon the Emperours belly, which they had found amongest the Empresses spoyls, and in his mouth the flute, with a kind of litle bagpipe, vnder the arme with a péece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the valew of halfe a Patar, giving to vnderstand by this, that for the péece of mony hée gave them a hunts vp, or fit of an old song. The popular sort in the meane while, forbare not to runne headlong vp and downe the Castle, and into the Polonians lodgings, killing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, and pilling of their houses, ransacking them in such sorte as they had not a shirt left to putte on their bodies. The Musitions defended themselves a good while, and five or sixe of them escaped, but the rest to the number of about twenty persons, were all hewen in péeces.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Vayvods</hi> house, by reason it was environed
<pb facs="tcp:7881:10"/>
with good walles, and had also a good guard within, was saved: the gates were well baricadoed without, to the end that no man might goe out, or flie away. I leave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man now to imagine, how this poore Princesse with all her Ladies and Damosels, were discomforted in their hearts: for she was presently robbed and spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all her riches, iewells, mooveables, apparrell; and even the cowches, and beds whereon she reposed, were taken away from vnder her: as also all the Lords and Polonian Gentlemen were robbed of all the iewels and presents that had before béene given them. True it is, that they within the towne defended themselves very valiantly in their Innes, but in the end they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to yéelde, and leave the boote to the others. The Lord of <hi>Vituenetskie</hi> onely saved himselfe, and his traine, and killed many <hi>Russes,</hi> though they had planted the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non against his house, and at last séeing himselfe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beset, he hung out a white cloth, in signe that hée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to haue yéelded, causing presently a number of duckats to be scattered before his chamber dooze. The <hi>Russians</hi> ranne thicke and thréefolde to annoint their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers herewith, but his people issued out sodainely vpon them, and so slashing and hewing on euery side, they slue aboue an hundred <hi>Russes,</hi> and made an open way for themselves to goe out, when in the meane while, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>Boyars</hi> of the Castle came, who tooke the said Lord into their protection, and driue out all the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so that in the end, all this allarum was appeased.</p>
            <p>A Polish Gentleman called <hi>Nimetskie,</hi> brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sundry iewels of great valew, and had deliuered them to the Emperour but the day before: as a seruant of the Lord <hi>Vol<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kie</hi> did the like, hauing made shew in the Court of diuers goodly tapistries which he brought, all these things were taken from them. But aboue others, diuers Almaine and Italian Merchants are to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
<pb facs="tcp:7881:10"/>
amongst whom, there was a very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aged man, who was called <hi>Iohn Ambrosio Celari</hi> a Mylanese, that had also deliuered out of his handes at the Court, to the valew of thrée and twenty thousand Florines, who was there most villainously murdered, by the rascall vulgar. In the same lodging remayned also two seruants belonging to Maister <hi>Philip Henbar,</hi> of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> who were recommended vnto me by my friends at <hi>Croeo,</hi> and had also deliuered for the value of aboue 25000. florines in merchandise solde to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and yet they had taken from them, besides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 10000. florins more. There is yet here a merchant of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> called <hi>Andrew Nathan,</hi> which was out in the Court, above 200000. florins, being robbed also of an 10000. florins, in goods and merchandise. Here is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a <hi>Russian</hi> Merchant of <hi>Lemberg,</hi> called <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who hath also lost great store of goods. I am afraid they will never recover any repayment thereof; I spake twice with the Emperours brother now raigning, by way of commending vnto him, the affaires of these honest men, and presented vnto him their petitions, to the end, that by his mediation, something might be obtained from the Emperour: but be gave me no other answere, but that this merchandise was never delivered to the precedent Emperour, by the Treasurer of <hi>Russia,</hi> but that the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> greased their fingers with it, so that the <hi>Russians,</hi> will not now, heare on that side, they alleadging fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that none of all these things were ever found in the Treasurie, but that this Royster (for he tearmed him <hi>Rostrigo,</hi> which is to say, a riotous, or debauched monke, for so he called the dead Prince) had sent it all out of the countrie, and that there was no more mony remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Treasurie, to pay such summes. These <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne</hi> Merchants, had also one of their servants, which was borne in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> being named <hi>Iaques,</hi> who was
<pb facs="tcp:7881:11"/>
miserablie slaine, in this popular furie, and was throwne amongst other dead bodies into a ditch, but I caused him to be found, and drawne out, and did honourably burie him.</p>
            <p>All things had such lamentable issue, in this terrible daies worke, and the peoples crie was so dreadfull, the alarum bell ringing continually, and there being no end of slaughter, that I was in great anguish of mind, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when as I sawe, that they sacked the next house to my lodging, where the Lord <hi>Peter Basmaneuf</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, who was one of the first, that was slaine at the Court, looking every minute, for no better a bargaine then the rest: but in the end, I tooke courage, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on horse backe, I brake through the presse, being accompanied with three of my servants, committing my selfe to Gods protection, and I went to find out one of the Lords and <hi>Boyars,</hi> to obtaine from them a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, for feare of being massacred in mine owne house, the number of them was so great, whome I mette with their cymitars all bloudie, in so fearefull a manner, that I was many times excéedingly affrighted, and thought to have forsaken my way, which had béene my apparant death. But God was so gratious to me, that I mette in the stréetes two Marshalles, which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Justice in the Citie, who left mée one of their men, for my guide, and guard, with whome I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my lodging, but one of my servants remayned, and went with them, who procured me further fix o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their men, to withstand them in the Justices name, if the multitude should have gone about to force my house. I can never be sufficiently thankfull to God, for preserving me in this so evident, and manifest a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And so this alarum continued, from morning till evening, but the night following, there was such a déepe silence over all this great Citie, as though there had not
<pb facs="tcp:7881:11"/>
béene one living soule therein. The Innes of the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Lords, were invironed round about, and kept with a good guard, and all their armes taken from them. If this nation had kept good centinell, and held themselues in armes, and good order, or but set fire on some parts of the Citie, when this alarum began, it had béene the horriblest slaughter, and the greatest effusion of bloud that ever was heard of: for there was a great number of them, and they were well horsed, and had good armes, and there, the houses are all of woode: but God had his hand herein, so that of the two, the lesse calamitie hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: for the <hi>Polonians</hi> have no goodnesse in them, but are full out as villanous, and bad as the <hi>Russians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The furie being thus pacified by this Emperours brother, being assisted by the principall Lords, and <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi> they assembled togither about the election of another Emperour, and so they ioyntly elected for their Prince, the Lord <hi>Vasilius Inavovitz Cintskie,</hi> and this election was made, on the 20. of May. Amongst the Dukes of this countrie, he is one of the most auncient, and of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest, and most renowmed familie, of all the <hi>Boyars:</hi> God give him a long and happie life, and make him to governe well and iustlie.</p>
            <p>The 29. of May, <hi>Demetrius</hi> his body, was dis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and drawne out of the Citie, it being there burnt, and consumed to ashes, and the multitude said, they would have it thus performed: alleadging, how it was to prevent the charmes, of that dead Enchaunter. For the same night after he was slaine, there was such a great, and wonderfull frost, that all the corne of the fields was spoyled, and as divers verie old men also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, in their life time, they never heard of the like, in so forward a season of the spring. All their fruites, and gardens were spoyled, and the leaves of the trees in the forrests, were so withered, as it was to be feared, that
<pb facs="tcp:7881:12"/>
this would cause a great dearth of all things through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole countrie: all corne grew presently double, above the ordinarie prise; but the night after his bodie was burnt, it was yet a farre greater frost, so that these barbarous, and infidell people beléeve, that in his life time, he was a great Nigromancer, but they should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ascribed it, to the great enormitie of their owne grievous sinnes.</p>
            <p>The thirtie day of the same month the Articles of his condemnation were publikely read, and wherefore they made him to be dispatched after this manner. First, they alleadged that he had béene a shauen and graduated monke, whose kinsmen, sisters, and brothers were yet liuing, that is, his father in lawe, and his owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who were brought into the market place before all the people, and their order is so strict, that euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Monke, leauing his order, and prophaning his sacred vow, ought to be burned, and the like is observed towardes Nunnes, there being no remission or pardon graunted for such an offence. For his father in lawe, his owne mother, and his brother, who were exposed, (as hath béene said) to the view of the whole world, they were reputed to be the same, though they resembled him in nothing at all, and whether they had suborned them, to confesse such a matter in the presence of all men, God knowes, this I may be bolde to affirme, that I sée them as wel as many others, and I also sawe them made, to kisse a crosse, and take an oathe thereon, that his name was <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and in their language <hi>Griskie Strepy,</hi> and that he was a Monke of this Cittie in the monasterie of the Castle: men say, that in his youth hée was very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to reade and write, and delighted much to peruse and reade Histories and Chronicles, hauing sometimes serued in the Patriarkes Court, for a Singing man and a Musitian, euer carefully obseruing whatsoever might
<pb facs="tcp:7881:12"/>
further his intentions, neither would he euer goe into the said monastery, as long as hée was emperour, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as men saie) to be knowne by some of those monks, that were drooping and olde, like the good olde Jades of <hi>Galicia.</hi> Men say likewise, that at <hi>Galith,</hi> where hée was borne, hée caused his father in law, his mother, brothers, and al the rest of his kinred, to the number of thrée score persons, to be imprisoned in a tower: all this went cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant amongst the common people.</p>
            <p>The second point was, that he was a Magitian, and that by enchantment he had obtained so many victories, and prosperous successe in attaining to the Crowne,</p>
            <p>The third Article was, that he was knowne to be an heretike, that hée neuer obserued their feasts, nor fasts, and that hée made no accompt of their Images and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>The fourth Article imputed to him, was, that hée had entred into a daungerous and pernicious conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie with the Pope, against their Religion, wholly to supplant that, and to bring in the Romane rites, euen as there were written Letters af the Popes found to that effect, while hée was emperour, wherein hée was exhorted, to put in execution, what hée had before so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes promised to the saide Pope, perswading him, to procure in such sort, that the Jesuites, and other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Priestes, might be established in their Churches, and that Temples and Colleges might be alotted them, to reforme the whole Country.</p>
            <p>For the fift imputation, there were Letters brought foorth, wherein he had treated and concluded with the <hi>Vayvod,</hi> to giue him the principalitie of <hi>Smolenko,</hi> and to his wife, the principalitie of <hi>Novigrod,</hi> to their sonne the country of <hi>Dibiria,</hi> and that they had plotted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue massacred all the <hi>Boyars,</hi> to extirpate their whole race, and to plant in their stead, the Polonian
<pb facs="tcp:7881:13"/>
               <hi>Vayvodes,</hi> and to constitute new <hi>Castelans,</hi> and <hi>Starostes, sed haec non credo:</hi> as also that he had drawen the Canon out of the Cittie, and making shew, as though he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it for some pastime or triumph, to turn them against the Citty, and so to haue bestowed on them so many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonadoes crosse, or a thwart, for their disseverance one from another, and thereupon the <hi>Polonians</hi> should haue fallen into the Cittie, and killed all those which made any resistance, and so to haue made themselues absolute Lordes of the chiefe Cittie in the Country, which might very well haue béene effected, if the Russians had not stoode well vpon their guard: for, whosoever is maister of that Citty, he is Lord of the whole country. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it was, I referre my selfe to a further time, which will discouer all.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, they complained greatly, because the <hi>Boyars</hi> and great Lords of the countrie had so little, and in a manner, no accesse at all to the Prince, who did disdaine them, and after such a sort, as they were faine to attend before the Pallace gate, and oftentimes, were also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed by the Halberdiers, whereas the <hi>Polonians,</hi> entred as often as they would, and being oftentimes outraged, by this <hi>Polonian</hi> nation.</p>
            <p>When they made their complaints, <hi>surdo narrabant fabulam</hi>; there was no iustice done, in revenge of the wrongs they endured, and moreover it was imputed vnto him, that he vndertooke all his affaires, without demaunding their counsalle, or advise in any thing, and when they replied to any point, difficult, or doubtfull, they were driven away with hand-blowes, disgraced, and sent into exile.</p>
            <p>The seaventh was a complaint: about the great, and excessiue expence he had béene at. He made him a gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Throne, on each side of the same, there were six Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gilded, all of massie silver, the which no other great
<pb facs="tcp:7881:13"/>
Duke euer did, and the Scepter and Crowne was neuer carried before any other, as it was before this man, and that excéeding all his predecessors, hée had bought many iewelles, which were found in his cabbinet, as also a number of other pretious things, presenting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers very prodigally: and hauing sent into <hi>Polonia</hi> huge summes of money, so as the treasure was cleane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, and therefore hée had layde great taxes and impositions vpon the countrey, not rewarding for all this, those which deserued well, but euer fauouring, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flatterers, Buffons, and Juglers, to whome hée woulde vsually giue rich giftes, and that very largely too.</p>
            <p>Eightly, hée was grieuously accused to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned the sacred calling of vowed Virgins, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the monastery of Nunnes where his wife was: and going to sée them oftentimes in very dissolute fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bringing thither musitians with him, reveling and dauncing there, and causing them to sing such filthie songs, as wherewith these Virgins were greatly scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, who reputed it for a wonderfull sinne: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, for hauing violated some of them, and amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the rest, one of <hi>Boritz Fendronitz</hi> his daughters, as also for celebrating his nuptialles on the festiuall day of Saint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which he should haue held in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, according to the custome of all the country. And further, that he had the image of the holie Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> standing vppon the bolster of his bed, when he went to lie with his new Spouse: For making little accompt of monkes and Priests, but causing them to be whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, like poore beasts, if they mumbled but a word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their teeth, that he had béene a monke himselfe: and that hée borrowed tenne thousand Roubles out of a Cloyster, to repay them, <hi>ad calendar Graecas,</hi> with other such like matters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7881:14"/>
Ninthly, he was accused to have béene the Authour, and occasion of a great spoyle, and domage, which fell out vppon the riuer of <hi>Volga,</hi> causing himselfe by false markes to be proclaimed the sonne of <hi>Fender Iuanouitz,</hi> whome vnder this pretext he had suborned to come to his succour, with many thousand <hi>Cosaques,</hi> to be the more secured of the countrey. Surely it must néedes be confessed, that hée was the cause of marueilous ruine to the country, for all the Ports of <hi>Astracasses</hi> were sacked, and all the goodes and marchandize there, robbed, and pilled: and out of <hi>Persia</hi> there comes great and inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable treasure, and though some will say, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenews of all the countrey of <hi>Russie</hi> amounteth to aboue twelue millions: so we must suppose too, that all this was too little for such a prodigall Steward, and if he meant to continue his port and traine as hée hadde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne.</p>
            <p>The tenth complaint was (and questionlesse it was an insupportable thing) of the Polonian insolencies, outrages, and villanies, for they estéemed the <hi>Russes</hi> but as dogges, threatning them euery day, beating them like slaues, and saying oftentimes, that they would make them slaues. The women, yea the Ladies and wiues of the principallest amongest the <hi>Boyars,</hi> durst not any more goe abroade in the stréetes, may they would goe and seize vpon them in their houses and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and where an husband walked with his Wife holding her by the hand, they haue cut off his arme, and led away his Wife. Upon all these complaintes, there was neuer no Justice executed. It so happened, that a Polonian was to be put to death, for an offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and as they led the malefactor out of the towne, the <hi>Poles</hi> issued out and slew the executioner, and frées their companion, so that this scéemed a scourge and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment prepared for them, by the wrath, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb facs="tcp:7881:14"/>
of god. They further alledge, infinit other faults, but if these aboue alleadged, onlie are true, such a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let well deserued death: yet it hadde béene much more laudable, to haue performed it, by course of Justice. Some saide, that a little before the verie moment of his death, he requested, that he might make his confession publikely, before all the world, but it was then too late: I am of opinion, if he had borne him selfe more mildely, without medling with the <hi>Polos,</hi> and matched with some Lady of the countrey, applying him selfe to their humor, though he had beene baser then a paunch fed Monke, yet might he haue kept the Crowne on his head: but I beleeue that the Pope, with his Seminaries, and Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, were a principal cause of his ruine, and totall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion. For these murderers of Princes would néedes haue made a Donke, too quickly, and they as suddenly light within the Bée hiue. It is pitty that their heads, were no better shauen, but they were transformed, too cunningly in so secular habit: such maskers, neuer paint themselues lightly, but in gréene. I beléeue likewise, that the <hi>Polackes,</hi> will take héede hereafter, how they bée so insolent as they haue béene, they which yet remaine here behind, beare themselues, and goe in the stréetes as meekely as Lambes, they are distributed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers troupes, of 2. and 3. hundred in a troupe, and so they are sent to <hi>Smolensko,</hi> and <hi>Polotsko,</hi> some horses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appoynted them for their conueyance: and to the end they should not take away those of the paisants, but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their guards asléepe, they killed about a score of them, but the rest awaking, reuenged themselues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently upon the field, and slew about sixe and thirty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, so that they are all cast into gaoles and prisons, of which, peradventure not one shall escape. I iudge that in al, there came short home about twelue hundred <hi>Poles,</hi> and foure hundred <hi>Russes</hi> besides. An Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
<pb facs="tcp:7881:15"/>
is sent from hence, into <hi>Poland,</hi> to informe the King of all which passed héere, and to treate of a peace, and in the meane while, the <hi>Vayuod</hi> must stay here with all the Lords and Gentlemen about him (and so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the aunswere good or bad, which hée returnes, they shall be held or released.)</p>
            <p>It is reported since, by those that haue lately come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that <hi>Iuan Basiliuitz</hi> sonne, the right <hi>Demetrius,</hi> was by this present Emperour digged out of his graue, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing béene fiftéene yéeres buried before at <hi>Ouglitz,</hi> whom hée presented to the view of many, his body being yet whole and entire, and holding nuttes in his handes, with which hee was buried, using to play with them when hee was a childe. Hee is inferred in the Castell Church of Archangell, amongest the Emperours, and the people ascribe vnto him the working of myracles, which they say are daily perfourmed: and when they happen, generall notice is giuen thereof, by the sound of a Bell. They are determined to build a Church ouer him, and to worship him as a Saint.</p>
            <p>These be the principallest of such occurrences as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Cittie, I beseech God to preserue vs from a greater sedition yet suspected.</p>
            <p>The fiftéenth day of June the like beganne againe, for this acursed vulgar are euer hungry after boote and spoile, they would faine euery day beginne againe their former garboiles, but this last commotion was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pacified by the <hi>Boyars.</hi>
