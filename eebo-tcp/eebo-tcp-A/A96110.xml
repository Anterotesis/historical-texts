            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>Opinion,</hi> 'Tis (ſay ſome) the opinion of ſuch as are pious and learned.

            </p>
            <p>The beſt guides may ſometimes go wrong. <hi>Peter</hi> preacheth <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115986:8"/>
the very doctrine of the pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Apoſtles, <hi>Gal. 2. 11. Peter</hi> himſelf was not infallible; the upright man is no adorer of opinion; when the ſtream of Arrianiſme ſwelled ſo high that it did overflow a great part of the world; <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did ſwim againſt the ſtreame; he was invincible in the truth <note n="*" place="margin">Adamas Eccleſiae, <hi>Tertul.</hi>

This is a falſe rule; <hi>The cuſtomes of the people are vaine,</hi> Jer. 10. 3. and as for our progenitors, and anceſtors, a ſonne may better take his land from his father, then his Religion. How many of our fore-fathers liv'd in times of Popery, and ſtumbled to hell in the dark, are we therefore bound to follow their blinde zeal? a wiſe man will not ſet his watch by the clock, but by the Sun.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Conſcience;</hi> 'tis (ſaith one) my<note place="margin">3. Falſe Rule.</note> conſcience. This is no rule for an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115986:9"/>
upright man; the conſcience of a ſinner is defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being defiled may erre; an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conſcience cannot be a rule, <hi>Act. 26. 9. I verily thought with my ſelf that I ought to do many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Name of Jeſus;</hi> he who is <hi>interfector veritatis,</hi> (as <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſpeaks) even an heretick may plead conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> admit conſcience to be a rule, and we open the door to all mutinies, and Maſſacres; if the devil get into a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether will he not carrie him?</p>
            <p>4. Another falſe rule is <hi>providence,</hi>

Providence is a Chriſtians <hi>Diurnal,</hi> not his <hi>Bible.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115986:9"/>When the wicked proſper, it doth not follow that their way is good, or that God favours them, Gods can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) may <hi>ſhine upon their head</hi>

Prayer without faith is like a Gun diſcharg'd without a bullet. The upright man prayes in faith. 3. <hi>He weeps in faith,</hi> Mark 9. 24. <hi>The father of the childe cryed out with tears, Lord I beleeve.</hi> When his tears dropt to the earth, his faith reach'd heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115986:11"/>2. An upright man acts from a principle of <hi>love</hi>

               </note>, Cant. 1. 4. <hi>The upright love thee.</hi> Love is as the ſpring in the Watch, it moves the wheels of obedience; The upright Chriſtian is carried to heaven in a <hi>fiery Chariot</hi> of love; love doth meliorate and ripen every duty, and make it come off with a better reliſh. Divine love is like musk among linnen which perfumes it. This gives a fragrant redolency to all our ſervices: A ſmall token ſent in love is accepted. <hi>The upright love thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hypocrites ſerve God <hi>formidine poenae,</hi> only for feare; as the ſlave works in the gally, or as the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> worſhip the Devil that he ſhould do them no hurt. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites obedience is forc'd like water out of a Still by the fire. The thoughts of hell-fire make the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of tears drop from their eyes.

from love <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>IV. An upright Chriſtian works to an upright end: He makes Gods glory his ultimate end, his aimes are right. Gods glory is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right<note place="margin">IV. <hi>Charact.</hi>

This is the queſtion the upright man propounds to himſelfe, Will this bring glory to God? he labours ſtill to bring in ſome revenues into the Exchequer of heaven; He prefers the glory of God before whatſoever comes in competition with, or ſtands in oppoſition againſt it. If life be laid in one ballance, and Gods<note place="margin">*Licet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulus ex collo pende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at nepos, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet mater mihi ubera oſtendat, &amp;c. <hi>Hier.</hi>
               </note> glory in the other, the glory of God out-weighs. <hi>They loved not their lives to the death,</hi> Rev. 12. 11. If my wife and children (ſaith <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>) ſhould hang about me and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115986:12"/>
me from doing my duty, if my mother ſhould ſhew me her breaſts that gave me ſuck, I would trample upon all, <hi>&amp; ad vexillum cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis avolarem,</hi> and I would flie to the croſſe.</p>
            <p>The upright man prefers the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God before his own ſalvation, <hi>Rom. 9. 1. I could wiſh my ſelf accurſed from Chriſt for my kinſmen according to the fleſh. Paul</hi> knew it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he could be accurſed from Chriſt. The book of life hath no <hi>Errata</hi> in it; beſides, <hi>Paul</hi> knew it unlawful to wiſh he were accurſed from Chriſt; but the meaning is, ſuppoſing, that by his breaking off, and ſome of the Jews graffing into Chriſt, God might be more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuch was his zeal for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he could even wiſh himſelf accurſed from Chriſt: Gods glory was dearer to him then his own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>An hypocrite is known by his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115986:12"/>
ſquint eye; he doth not look right forward to the glory of God, but he looks a-ſquint to his own private intereſt; he ſpurres on Religion through the ſtage of ſome politick deſigne, and then turnes it off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>The hypocrite ſerves God, 1. For <hi>gaine.</hi> He looks at the emoluments<note place="margin">1.</note> and profits which come in by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; 'tis not <hi>the power of godlineſſe</hi> the hypocrite loves, but <hi>the gain of godlineſs;</hi> 'tis not the fire of the <hi>Altar,</hi> but the <hi>gold of the Altar</hi> which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores. This is a religious wickedneſſe. <note n="*" place="margin">Salvian.</note> 
               <hi>Ephraim is an heifer that loves to tread out the corne,</hi> Hoſea 10. 11. God made a Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

cries up the goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> Act. 19. 27. but it was not her Temple but her ſilver ſhrines he cared for; many fall in love with Religion, not for her beauty, but her jewels. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> a French Divine ſpeaks of a Lawyer in his time, who turn'd Proteſtant, only for worldly reſpects, that he might get prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There's a ſtory of a Monk, who went like a mortified man with his eyes down upon the ground, who afterwards was made <hi>Abbot;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked why he went in that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe lowly poſture with his eyes down? ſaith he, I was looking for the keys of the <hi>Abby,</hi> and now I have found them. The Moral of it is good: The Hypocrite doth ſacrifice <hi>Deo, &amp; lari:</hi> while he ſerves God, he ſeeks himſelf; like the waſp that comes to the gally-pot for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; or the Fox which follows the Lion for the prey he lets fall. The hypocrite makes uſe of Religion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115986:13"/>
only as the fiſherman doth of his net to catch preferment.</p>
            <p>2. He ſerves God for <hi>applauſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2</note> hypocrites look not at Gods glory, but vain-glory <note n="*" place="margin">Animalia gloriae &amp; vilia, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris aurae mancipia. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
               </note>. They ſerve God rather to ſave their credit, then to ſave their ſouls: hypocrites pray <hi>to be ſeen of men,</hi> Matth. 6. 5. The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they may be ſet upon a Theatre, and have Spectators; when they give almes <hi>they blow a trumpet,</hi> Mat. 6. 2. and their hearts were as hollow as their trumpet; they did it <hi>that they might have glory of men,</hi> verſe 2. It was not <hi>giving</hi> almes, but <hi>ſelling</hi> them; they ſold them for praiſe and applauſe: <hi>Verily I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>they have their reward.</hi> The hypocrite may make his acquittance, and write, <hi>received in full payment,</hi> he hath all he muſt look for; an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart makes the glory of God his center.</p>

that a Chriſtian is pure from ſinne in this life. If there were no Bible to confute that opinion, a Chriſtians own experience might do it. We finde the continual ebullitions, and motions of ſinne working in our members. <hi>Paul</hi> cries out of <hi>a body of death,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. The Saints, though they are <hi>comely,</hi> yet <hi>black</hi> *;<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 5</note>—Grace in this life is like gold in the oare, full of mixture; but yet in an evangelical ſenſe, the upright man is ſaid to be <hi>perfect,</hi> and that five manner of wayes.</p>
            <p>1. An upright man is perfect with<note place="margin">1.</note> a perfection of parts, though not of degrees. There is no part of him but is embroidered, and beſpangled with grace; though he be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in part, yet in every part; therefore grace in a beleever is call'd the <hi>new man,</hi> Col. 3. 10.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115986:27"/>
heart is like aire in the twilight, there is no part of the aire but hath ſome light in it, and in this ſenſe the upright man is perfect.</p>
            <p>2. The upright man is perfect<note place="margin">2.</note> comparatively in regard of others. Thus <hi>Noah was perfect in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. <hi>Noah</hi> compared with the prophane world, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man; gold in the oare compared with lead or braſſe is perfect; a field of wheat, though it may have ſome thiſtles growing in it, yet compar'd with a field of tares, is perfect.</p>
            <p>3. The upright man is perfect in<note place="margin">3.</note> regard of his aimes; he doth <hi>colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare,</hi> level at the mark of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The upright man breaths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection; and therefore he is ſaid <hi>not to ſinne,</hi> 1 John 3. 9. becauſe though he be not without ſinne, yet his will is againſt ſinne <note n="*" place="margin">Non facit peccatum quiapatitur potius, <hi>Ber.</hi>
               </note>; he hath voted ſinne down, though this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome traitour rebels. When he failes, he weeps; and this is a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115986:28"/>4. The upright man is perfect<note place="margin">4.</note> through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; he is perfectly juſtified, <hi>Col. 2. 10. ye are compleat in him;</hi> through the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe every thing appears red; ſo through the glaſs of Chriſts blood, the ſoule is look'd upon as beautiful and glorious: He that hath on Chriſts ſeamleſſe coat is perfect: He that hath <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God</hi> is perfect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
            <p>5. God calls the upright man<note place="margin">5.</note> perfect, becauſe he intends to make him ſo. Chriſt calls his Spouſe his <hi>undeſiled, Cant.</hi> 5. 2. Open to me my <hi>dove, my undefiled,</hi> or as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal word is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, her ſpots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, but yet <hi>undefiled,</hi> becauſe Chriſt intends to make her ſo. God hath choſen us to perfection <note n="*" place="margin">Elegit nos ad perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem.</note>, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. a limner that hath begun the rude draught of a picture, he looks upon it what he intends to make it;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115986:28"/>
he intends to lay it in its own orient colours; in this life there is but the firſt draught, the imperfect linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of grace drawn in our ſoules, yet God calls us perfect, becauſe he intends by the penſil of the holy Ghoſt to draw us out in our orient beauty, and lay the <hi>Virmillion</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of glory upon us. Thus the upright man is perfect, it is as ſure to be done as if it were done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>

               <hi>end of that man is peace;</hi> a wiſe man looks to the end of a thing, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 8. better is the end of a thing then the beginning.</hi> So peaceable is the end of an upright man, that <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired it, <hi>Numb. 23. 10. Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the upright man goes off the ſtage of this world wearing a tripple Crown of peace. 1. He hath peace<note place="margin">1.</note> with God; <note n="*" place="margin">Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Deus tranquillat omnia.</note> God ſaith to him, <hi>be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> I have nothing againſt thee; thou haſt laid thy ſins to heart, and I will not lay them to they charge. The Jewiſh Rabbins ſay, that <hi>Moſes</hi> died with a kiſſe from Gods mouth; the upright man dies embracing Chriſt and kiſſing the promiſes.</p>
