            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Your Servant Sirs,</l>
            <l>COnscious of many favours from the Town,</l>
            <l>And that he poorly pays who does but own,</l>
            <l>I'm come to save each of you half a Crown.</l>
            <l>(Our Author truly would invite your stay,</l>
            <l>And if you will be all such Fools you may,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>To the side Boxes.</hi>
               </note>
            </l>
            <l>There's some are wiser, and will walk away.</l>
            <l>For I who have heard the tale within can tell yee</l>
            <l>A worse disaster never yet befel yee;</l>
            <l>A Critick yonder has been stating Rules,</l>
            <l>To gain the Wise, and scorn the Herd of Fools;</l>
            <l>To which 'twas said, one Friend wou'd raise ten Foes,</l>
            <l>And that's too dear as common Friendship goes;</l>
            <l>Success with both is found no human task;</l>
            <l>Who please the Boxes will affront the Mask;</l>
            <l>To Charm, and to instruct's too great a trouble,</l>
            <l>'Tis hard for <hi>Pegasus</hi> to carry double.</l>
            <l>I argu'd much to entertain the Fools,</l>
            <l>They are the Poets and the Players Tools.</l>
            <l>Are sown so thick o'er Gallery, Box, and Pit,</l>
            <l>Can give success without the help of Wit;</l>
            <l>For one Grimace more favour will dispence,</l>
            <l>Than for whole Scenes that boast of stricter sence;</l>
            <l>Ev'n I by help of Band and cropt disguise,</l>
            <l>Can reach your hearts as Love does through your Eyes;</l>
            <l>Well the Fools Coat, the Fools defect supplies.</l>
            <l>But still Poetick Fate attends the Muse,</l>
            <l>This thriving Councel did our Fool refuse,</l>
            <l>She'd please no Crambo Critick, with dull Chime,</l>
            <l>Preferring sense, ev'n to engaging Rhime;</l>
            <l>Nor little Lord who still affects to be</l>
            <l>Learn'd in the knacks of visiting Gallantry.</l>
            <l>With scraps of Scandal, and Pert Repartee.</l>
            <l>On ruin bent I left her to her Fate,</l>
            <l>And stole to warn you for what treat you sat.</l>
            <l>If to the Wits alone our Plays are Writ,</l>
            <l>And Authors will allow so few have Wit,</l>
            <l>Why should they grumble at an Empty Pit.</l>
            <l>Since I have been thus frankly dealing now,</l>
            <l>But one request for my dear sake allow.</l>
            <l>With Crowded Benches we shall grace our Play,</l>
            <l>If each who thinks himself a Wit will stay.</l>

            <l>You've seen reveng'd an injurd Woman's Cause,</l>

            <l>The Bright Originals from which 'twas wrought.</l>
            <l>Next to the Men I come, but cannot plead</l>
            <l>Your likeness as a motive to succeed,</l>
            <l>We rather hope none here will be offended</l>
            <l>Because none here cou'd think himself himself intended;</l>
            <l>Not one of you so sullenly wou'd slight</l>
            <l>A yielding Fair, at least not the first night,</l>
            <l>You cou'd not have the hearts, nor I believe</l>

            <l>'Twou'd startle you no doubt, for not to wrong yee,</l>
            <l>One Wife is thought too much by most among yee.</l>
            <l>Since I have done you justice, be this Day</l>
            <l>As just to us in censuring our Play,</l>
            <l>Not with Grimace, and words all noise, and Huff,</l>
