            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

An Account of ſome of the Travels and Sufferings of that Faithful Servant of the Lord, <hi>Thomas Briggs.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN my Youth, and tender Years, I ſought after the Lord God of my Life; with Weeping, and Crying after him: that I might know the way to everlaſting Peace and Salvation; and run up and down among thoſe People called Miniſters, twenty years together in a Profeſſion that was called <hi>Puritans,</hi> who were the Miniſters that were then called <hi>Puritans.</hi> But they never could direct me to my teacher within, which was the cauſe of my wanting Peace and Satisfaction to my immortal Soul; and I went under many heavy Burdens, becauſe of my ſin and iniquity, that ſeparated me from the God of my Life. And in an acceptable time, it pleaſed the Lord God to ſend his dear Servant <hi>George Fox</hi> into the <hi>North</hi> Country; who was a Meſſenger of the everlaſting Goſpel of Peace: and did direct me and others to the true light of Jeſus Chriſt, that doth ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten every Man that cometh into the World. And I with many more did believe his Meſſage, and received, and joined to the Light; and in that which ſhined in a dark place, I believed and waited: And the mighty power of the Lord God did appear, and was manifeſted in me, and did ſhake terribly the Earthly part that was above the Seed, in which I held the profeſſion of God and Chriſt, but did not know him; and in that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God that did ſhake the Earthly part, the Lord God did give me faith to believe: And ſo the judgments of the Lord God I felt to be come in me. And I waited in the way of his Judgments in Patience on the Lord God; and his power had brought down that which was for Judgement, and the door of Mercy was opened, and my underſtanding by the Light of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94939:3"/>
Chriſt was opened; and I ſaw all the Teachers of the World that were not ſent of God, that they were in the Scribes and Phariſees way. And I was moved to bear a Teſtimony againſt them all, and to go to Steeple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Houſes, and to cry againſt them, and to exhort People to turn from them, to the true Light of Chriſt Jeſus; and to hearken to the Light of Chriſt within them: that they might know the Lord to be their Teacher. And I was commanded of the Lord to go from my Houſe and dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Place, to <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> to Preach repentance to that Town that was high in Profeſſion: The Lords power and preſence did wonderfully accompany me, and theſe were the ſum of the Words that I was moved to ſpeak through the Town, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Repent, for the mighty terrible day of the Lord God of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is appearing, wherein no worker of iniquity ſhall ſtand before him; who is of a purer eye than to behold iniquity; for he wills not the death of a Sinner, and if ye repent and turn to him, he will abundantly Pardon.</hi> And this Meſſage the Lord God did lay upon me, to go through many Towns, and Cities, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> through <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Gaerſtang,</hi> and through many Villages and Places up and down thereaway; the Lord God required me to go through <hi>Cambridge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtreets</hi> with the ſame Meſſage among the Scholars, that they might repent, and turn to the Lord; and alſo this was my meſſage to them. The Lord God was never known by all the Learning, that is got at <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Mancheſter</hi> I was moved to go to the Steeple-houſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the Prieſt; and they haled me out, and put me in a Dungeon on the top of their Bridge; and when I was put into that hole, the Lords power and preſence did ſo fill my heart, that I Sung for joy, to the admiration of thoſe that put me in: And on the Morrow they brought me out before a Man called a Juſtice, and he ſaid, I muſt go out of the Town; I told him, I had been without Victuals all that Night, and a Piece of the other day; and I had done nothing worthy of being thruſt out of the Town, and I told him that I was one that believed in the name of Jeſus Chriſt; and it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him that a Milſtone were hanged about his Neck, and that he were caſt into the Sea, then that he ſhould offend one of the Little ones that believed in his Name. He ſaid, if he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94939:3"/>
knew that I were ſuch a one, he would not offend me for all the World; the Lords bleſſed power and preſence was with me, and ſome of his Servants were convinced: But to pleaſe the People, he ſent a Man with me, and put me out of the Town over the Bridge, and ſo left me, and I followed him into the Town again, and got a deal of Friends that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced to ſettle a Meeting in that Town. And in <hi>Warrington</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> I was moved to go to the Steeple-houſe with another Friend, and the Friend ſpoke a few words after the Prieſt had done, and his People fell upon us violently, and many blows they laid upon us with all their ſtrength; but that the Lords power did ſupport us, we had been deſtroyed by them, for many weighty blows they laid upon my head, and I loſt my hat, and went above a mile bare headed to a meeting of Friends; and this was the fruits of a Prieſt that was called an Independant: who ſince the King came in is turned out of that Place. And as I was going in my journey in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> I was moved to ſpeak to a Prieſt: and he was full of Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt me; and one of his Hearers came behind me, and with a mighty blow upon my Head, he fell'd me down to the Ground: and I got up again, and I turned unto him my Face, and gave it to the Smiter; and he Smote me upon the Teeth: that I guſht out and Bled exceedingly. Then ſome People ſtanding by, cryed exceedingly againſt him, and they were aſhamed, and fled away: After ſome little time, the Man that Smote me <hi>fell Sick, and Dyed;</hi> and upon his Death-Bed, ſaid, Oh that I had not Smiten the Quaker. And in <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> I was moved to declare the terrible Day, the mighty Day of the Lord God of Power; and was carried on by his mighty Power, to clear that which was upon me, that they might Repent, and turn to the Lord. And when I was got through moſt part of the Town, an Officer came and took hold upon me; and brought me before many, called Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices: who profered me the Oath, and accuſed me to be a Jeſuit; and I ſaid, I could not Swear, becauſe, Chriſt had commanded not to Swear at all; ſo they made a Mittimus to ſend me to Priſon, and in that time, my Companion, and Brother, <hi>John Braythwait,</hi> which was with me, was ſpeaking without upon the ſtaires: So they brought him alſo, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94939:4"/>
committed us both together to Priſon, where we were a Month; and they would have had us to promiſe to have gone out of the Town, and not to have come again; our anſwer to them was, we could not yield to any ſuch thing: and they were vexed, and grieved, and wiſhed they had Whipped us, and let us go at the firſt; and ſo they releaſed us, and let us go. In that time, there were many People convinced up and down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away; ſo the Lords work hath proſpered, Bleſſed and Praiſed be his Name for evermore.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> I was moved of the Lord to go through the Town, up and down in the ſtreets, to proclaim the mighty terrible Day of the Lord God, that all might repent and fear him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Fountain of the great Deep; and a great Multitude of rude People did follow after me, and the mighty power of the Lord God was ſtrong upon me, and the word of the Lord was ſharper than a two edged Sword; and I turned my Face about to them, and fear ſmote them, that they ran away: And after a little time, one called an Officer, came and took hold upon me, and did lead me very gently; and I did declare to the People while he did lead me on, that I had a very good time to clear my ſelf, and he brought me before the Magiſtrate, who ordered him to put me out of the Town; and when he had ſo done, I went by the Water ſide, and got a Boat, and came into the Town another way, and had a Meeting among Friends, and went away in Peace: And in ſeveral Towns, and Markets, I was moved to declare to People, of the mighty and terrible day of the Lord, that was appearing; and the Lords everlaſting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that did move in me, to go to declare the Meſſage of the Lord did preſerve me and uphold me, and many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me out of the hands of them that had an intent to have deſtroyed me. For in a Town that is called <hi>Lin,</hi> I was moved of the Lord to go through the Streets, to warn People to Repent and Turn to the Lord, and as I was going in the ſtreets and declaring, they ſet a mighty Dog upon me, one of the greateſt that ever I ſaw. And when the Dog came to me, he did fawn upon me: as he would do to his Maſter; and I laid my hand upon his back, ſo the power that Created all things bound the Dogs nature; and I received no harm by him.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94939:4"/>
And as I was declaring, and going over a Bridge, a Company of wicked People combined themſelves together, to throw me down into the Water; but the Lord God of my life, who ſent me, and was with me, put it into the heart of an Officer that was there preſent, and prevented them; that I went on in the ſervice that the Lord required of me, and cleared my ſelf: and ſo came away in much peace. And thus it was with me in <hi>Olivers</hi> days, that I have gone through four or five Towns in a day, to warn People to Repent and turn to the Lord, that the Lord might be clear, and I might be clear of the Blood of all Men; So bleſſed be the Lord God who preſerved me from the Mouth of the Dog. And ſometimes Swords have been drawn againſt me, and Axes, that they cut wood withal, have been taken up to hew me in pieces, and that which they intended to do, they could not do; and thus by the mighty power of the Lord, I was preſerved: Bleſſed and praiſed be his Name for evermore; and ſeveral who have heard my Voice, who have not ſeen my Face, have confeſſed ſince that a power did reach them, and they were convinced by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and brought into the Truth, by which I know my labour in the Lord hath not been in vain. And it was upon me to go through moſt part of <hi>Wales</hi> to declare the mighty, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day of the Lord God of power; and in a Town called <hi>Clanzous,</hi> as I was ſo declaring, many People were attentive a pretty time, till the Conſtable came forth and ſtirred up the People, and Cryed out, Kill him, Kill him; and they did throw ſtones upon me that were ſo great, that I did admire they did not kill us; but ſo mighty was the power of the Lord, that they were as a Nut or a Bean to my thinking. The Conſtable himſelf took hold upon my Coat, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have pulled me down under his Feet; and my Coat did Rent: and he got the one half, and the other did hang about my Neck, and one that was with me, ſaid, let us flee for our Lives; and it roſe up in me, that I might fight the Lords Battle and not flee. And I turned again upon him in the dread of the Lord, you muſt give an account for this daies work; and one Man came with the half of my Coat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to take it again, for he was ſmitten inwardly, for that which they had done; and I put off the other part that was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94939:5"/>
about my Neck, and left it with them, to be a Witneſs againſt them, and afterward they ſowed it together, and ſent it to a Friends Houſe. I was moved of the Lord to go through <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diff</hi> for a ſign, I got up in the Morning, and went out of a Friends Houſe, with my Coat upon me till I came into the Street, and when I came there, I let my Coat fall down, and ſo went naked up and down through the Streets; and this was the Meſſage that the Lord put into my Mouth, to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which was a Town of great Profeſſion; <hi>Thus muſt you be ſtripped of all your Profeſſion, that are not found in the Life of Righteouſneſs:</hi> and I went through a Steeple-Houſe where People were gathered to Worſhip, and the power and dread of the Lord God that was upon me, did ſo ſmite them, that I did not hear them ſay a word againſt me; and truly when I was Naked in the ſtreets, the Burden was taken off me: that I ſaid in my ſelf, Oh, how eaſy am I now! it is good to obey the voice of the Lord; ſo in ſeveral places in <hi>Wales,</hi> did I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Meſſage of the Lord, as formerly Mentioned. And in <hi>Windſor</hi> was I moved of the Lord God, to declare of the mighty and terrible day of the Lord God of Power; that is appearing againſt all the workers of iniquity, that they might turn and repent while they have ſpace and time; and they were very wicked, and many ſtones with mire and dirt were thrown at us; and <hi>Iſaac Peningtons</hi> Coat was much dirted with the throwing, but I paſſed to and fro in the ſtreets twice, and received no harm: Bleſſed be the Lord God for evermore. In the time of the Committee of Safety after <hi>Olivers</hi> days, I was moved of the Lord to go to the Committee of Safety, to tell them the mind and will of the Lord, what he would have them to do: and when I came to the Door, the Door-keeper ſaid, I ſhould not come in there; and there was an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor come from a far Country, and he was admitted to come in, but the Lords Meſſenger they would not let come in, but ſhut the Door againſt me; and ſo it was in me from the Lord. You ſhut the Lords Meſſenger out of Door, and we will ſhut you out alſo: And ſo to clear my ſelf, I was glad to go to them one by one as I could find them, to declare the Lords Meſſage unto them, whether they would hear, or forbear; that is, if they would take away the Law by which Tythes was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94939:5"/>
upheld, by which Law the People of God had ſuffered greatly, and make good their promiſe; the Lord would let them ſee a way by which they might go on and proſper, and if they did not, they ſhould all be turned out, which came to paſs in a little time afterwards. And the word of the Lord came to me, that I muſt go through the ſtreets of <hi>London,</hi> and preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and that the Lord God of power would overturn, and overturn, till it come to him whoſe right it is; and through that great City, the moſt part of it the Lord did carry me with his mighty power that I received no hurt; and as I came back again in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> the word of the Lord came unto me, that <hi>Nineve</hi> repented at the preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> and the Lord ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Nineve;</hi> and except <hi>London</hi> repent, God would deſtroy it. All theſe my Travels and Exerciſes with many more were in <hi>Olivers</hi> daies, and ſoon after: Alſo in thoſe daies, as I was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the <hi>South</hi> Parts, it was upon me to ſet a Paper upon the Door of the Steeple-houſe to bear a Teſtimony againſt the Prieſt, and I did ſo. And as I was going by a Houſe, it was in me the Prieſt was in that Houſe; and as I was gone a little paſt it, I ſaid to my Brother <hi>John Braythwait,</hi> there is a Prieſt in that Houſe, and I muſt return back again to ſpeak to him; and I went to the Door and knocked, and the Man of the Houſe came to the Door, and I ſaid, Friend, wilt thou let me come into thy Houſe, and he was willing to let me in; and I went up to the Chimney Corner, where I found the Prieſt ſitting: and charged him in the Name of the Lord to give over deceiving the People for diſhoneſt gain; the Man of the Houſe was grieved and took me by the Shoulder and put me out, and I ſaid, Friend, thou gaveſt me leave to come in; when I was in the Street, the power of the Lord was upon me, and I left my voice, and rung the Goſpel Bell among them, and many People came; and ſo I bear my Teſtimony againſt the Prieſt, and directed People to their Teacher with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. So in much peace and eaſe, I went on my journey; ſo to the Lord God, and to his power be the Glory, and Honour, and Praiſe, for ever whoſe right hand and power is known that brings mighty things to paſs.</p>

               <hi>Jonathan Chapham</hi> a Prieſt in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> I was moved to go to bear Teſtimony againſt at his Houſe, he came out of his Door

and would not ſpeak to me; and ſer his Dog upon me: and his Dog would not bite me, and he turned in again as a Man grieved; and thus the Hireling fled like an Hireling.</p>
            <p>As I was coming out of <hi>Wales</hi> in <hi>Shrowsbury,</hi> at the time the Monarchy Men roſe at <hi>London,</hi> I was taken by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and brought before Juſtices, who proferred me the Oath, and becauſe I could not Swear contrary to the Command of Chriſt, they made a Mittimus and ſent me and another Friend to Priſon; and the Jayler being very wicked, put me and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friend into a Dungeon, where they put Perſons Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die; and we could get nothing to lie on but a little Peaſe Straw; and there I remained ten weeks: But the Lord was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good to me, and other Friends that were in Priſon at that time; for his preſence did ſo fill our hearts, though it was a Noiſome place, that I could truly ſay it is good being here: for the Lord is with us. And though they kept us very cloſe, and would hardly let any come to ſee us, the word of the Lord came to me, thou ſhalt be delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of this place, and go and declare my Name among the People, but thou muſt go into Priſon again: and at the ten weeks end, before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement came for all Friends from the King, the Juſtice that did commit us, asked me, if I would promiſe never to take Arms up againſt the King? I ſaid, I am a Witneſs of the Day that the Prophet ſpoke of; ſaying, <hi>They ſhall beat their Swords into Plow ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning hooks, and they ſhall learn War no more; for I have learned of Chriſt Jeſus to do to all Men, as I would have them do to me.</hi> And he ſaid, get as many into that mind as you can: And He, and his Wife, had a good Eſteem for Friends, for ſhe was there that time; and he had a deſire to have a Quaker to be his Miller, and he got one: And when the Turn-Coat Juſtice would have ſent Friends to Priſon, he was very favourable to them, and would take their word to appear when they were ſent for; He was one of them they call the Royaliſts, and one of the Deputy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> his name was <hi>Thornes:</hi> And I travelled up and down in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> among Friends, as I was moved of the Lord, and then returned again towards <hi>Wales;</hi> and in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> I had a Meeting at one <hi>Nicholas Dyers,</hi> where we had a Pretious Meeting; and the Power of the Lord and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94939:6"/>
his Preſence was much manifeſt with us; and a Prieſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling near thereby, heard of our Meeting: and got a Lieutenant with his Souldiers to come and break up our Meeting; and they came in when I was at Prayer on my Knees to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, and commanded me to give over, and ſet a Piſtol to my Breaſt: The Lord prevented them that it would not do that which they intended, and I continued in Prayer till they ſtopped my Mouth with a Pair of Gloves. So they haled us out, and carryed us to <hi>Hereford</hi> City before a Juſtice there; who made a Mittimus and ſent twelve of us to Priſon, where we remained twelve weeks till the Aſſizes; and the Goaler was very wicked at the firſt, and would not let us have the Priviledge of the Houſe of Eaſement, and kept us cloſe in a Cock-loft for a time: but he was exceedingly tormented and confeſſed he could have no Peace; and then he let us have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to walk in the Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then his Son and Daughter were convinced, and he became very loving to me: For he found caſe in being ſo to me, and ſaid, when I was releaſed he would ask no fees. And at the Aſſizes we were called before the Judge, and the Power and Preſence of the Lord was ſo with us, that when the Judge examined us, many times he would turn his Face another way; and he ſet all Friends at Liberty but me, and there I remained three weeks, and I wrote to the Juſtice that did commit me to Priſon, for by him I was comm<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When the Aſſizes came I did appear, and ſent to him that I was come to anſwer what was laid againſt me; he ſent me word again, there was nothing laid againſt me, <hi>I</hi> might go which way <hi>I</hi> would; ſo <hi>I</hi> went to the Goaler, and he deſired me that if <hi>I</hi> came into that Town, <hi>I</hi> would call upon him and ſee him, for he had a love for me; and after that time the Goaler was very loving to Friends, who had been very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. Bleſſed be the Lord God of Heaven and Earth for

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> with <hi>John Moon</hi> appointed a Meeting in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> near to the <hi>Vizes</hi> where many Friends and People of the World came to our Meeting, and two Juſtices of Peace hearing of it, came to our Meeting and broke it up, and took the names of moſt part of Friends that were there, and let them all go but <hi>John Moon</hi> and me and three other Friends; and they took us to a Houſe by our ſelves and examined us: The one of the Juſtices was a Royaliſt, and the other a Turn-Coat, a deceitful Man; they made a Mittimus to ſend us to the Houſe of Correction for three Months; and when they had done, we who were Committed were filled with the Power, and Preſence of the Lord exceedingly; and <hi>I</hi> ſaid to the Juſtices, Friends, <hi>I</hi> am one that believes in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and better it were for you that a Milſtone were hanged about your Neck; and you be caſt into the Sea, than to offend one of the little ones that believe in his Name.</hi> And ſo we went to the Houſe of Correction, and the Man that was the Maſter of it in a little time became exceeding loving, and we had very many preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meetings while we were there; and many Friends came to viſit us: And in that time the Juſtice that had been a Turn-Coat being a Parliament Man, went up to <hi>London,</hi> and as he returned home again he Dyed; <hi>I</hi> never ſaw his Face more. We did underſtand by their Speeches when they examined us, that they did intend to profer us the Oath at the three Months end, and ſo to continue us Priſoners, but the Lord prevented them; and ſo the keeper of the Priſon, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Juſtices, when the three Months were up, ſent to know what he ſhould do with us; the Man that was a Steward to that great Man, who was a Royaliſt, perſwaded him to let us go, for we were honeſt Men; and through the mercy and goodneſs of the Lord their ſnare was broken, and we were delivered: Bleſſed be the Name the Lord God for evermore.</p>
            <p>And ſince that time I have travelled and laboured in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt in many parts of <hi>England,</hi> and thrice through the moſt part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where <hi>I</hi> have found the bleſſed preſence of the Lord to go along with me, and have had a good ſervice for the Lord.</p>

And alſo I went to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> to <hi>Barbados,</hi> with <hi>George Fox</hi> and other Friends, and the power and preſence of the Lord was largely manifeſt with us, and over us; and many were wonderfully refreſhed and comforted, and many turned from the Darkneſs to the Light; and from the power of Satan to Chriſt. And <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>William Edmundſon</hi> went down to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lego,</hi> where we had ſeveral pretious Meetings, and many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and received our Teſtimony with gladneſs of heart; we alſo went down to <hi>Mevis,</hi> to viſit Friends in that Iſland: and when we came there, an Old Perſecutor called <hi>Wheeler,</hi> ſent eight Souldiers aboard the Veſſel to ſtop us from coming on Shore, for many Friends of that place came to viſit us, and were refreſhed abundantly; though he was wicked to hinder us to come a ſhore to ſee Friends. So we returned again to <hi>Anlego,</hi> and had ſome Meetings there; and then returned again to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bades:</hi> And <hi>I</hi> being long upon the Sea, was very weak, and few Friends did expect that <hi>I</hi> ſhould live; <hi>I</hi> was giving up freely to ſtand in the will of God, for Life, or Death: and as <hi>I</hi> was waiting on the Lord one Morning in my Bed to know his Mind, and Will, the word of the Lord came to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and broke my heart in great tenderneſs; and ſaid to me, lie low before me, thou ſhalt not die in this Iſland, but return to thine own Nation, and there thou ſhalt lay down thy Head in Peace.</p>
            <p>And thus the Lord hath dealt Mercifully, and Bountifully, with me in all my Travels, and Labours, in the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus; his power and preſence hath attended and been with me: Bleſſed, and Praiſed, and Magnified be his holy Name for evermore. Amen,</p>

            <p>UPon the 18th of the third Month, 1685. A deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration being upon my mind, Concerning my late Father <hi>Thomas Briggs;</hi> it ſprung up in my heart on this wiſe, Bleſſed be that Inſtrument of life by which my Father was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, let his name ſhine for ever. It was dear <hi>G. F.</hi> whom the Lord made inſtrumental in that bleſſed work, of whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Apoſtleſhip my deceaſed Father was a ſeal; of whom it lives in my heart thus to ſay. <hi>He was a Man of great Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in his days, which he patiently went thorow, he was brought forth in a time when much roughneſs and cruelty by the men of this World uſed againſt the Lords People; a great ſhare of it he met withal, of which I am a witneſs; for his ſervant in the beginning lying pretty much to the Steeple-houſe, and Market-place, the abuſes he ſuffered were very great and too many to inſtance;</hi> yet two particular things, of which I was an eye witneſs, are freſh in me to utter forth, <hi>viz.</hi> One time being at a Steeple-houſe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great abuſes; after which a Man took hold of a handful of the hair of his Head, and having bound him, did ſmite his head againſt a ſtone, till the hair came off in his hand, which my Father bore patiently; and when the Man threw the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of hair upon the ground, my Father took it up in his hand: and mildly ſaid, <hi>One hairs of my head ſhall not fall without my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers providence;</hi> another time, ſtanding upon the uppermoſt ſtep of <hi>Lancaſter Croſs,</hi> publiſhing the truth to the People, he was violently thrown down to the bottom, and many exerciſes of the like nature he met withall; in all which he was as one that gave his back to the Smiter, and turned not his Face away from ſuch as pulled off the hair. He was a tender Father to me, and the worſt of his Children, an inſtrument in Gods hand by whom we were convinced; his wiſe circumſpect walking was that which firſt reached me, and with much tenderneſs and care, watchings and many ſeveral breathings to the Lord for us; he brought us up in the fear of God, and we are ſealers of his Miniſtry, both as to Doctrin, and God: and he hath many ſealers of his Apoſtleſhip and Miniſtry, and this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lives in my heart for him, he was Father in all his Houſe

and Family, he kept his integrity to the end; and was frequent in exhortation to us his Children, to love truth, and live up to it: the benefit of which exhortation we now receive. Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The ſence of this Godly care reſts upon me, to whom in a day of great exerciſes he was a true Prophet; ſurely although he be removed and taken out of the World, being gone to the Father to partake of endleſs Glory and everlaſting joy; all Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows being ended, and tears wiped away, and we have the want of him here, and ſuffer the loſs of ſuch benefits as we had whilſt converſant here together, received by him, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in Gods hand; yet his life is with us, and among us: his memorial lives, and ſhall never dye; and ſince it hath pleaſed God to take him to himſelf in his good pleaſure, I do acquieſce in God being comforted, believing, and being ſatisfied that if I keep my integrity, and be faithful to the end as he was, I ſhall in the Lords time go to him; and receive a crown of life with him: which God of his infinite love grant to me, and to his whole <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>NOw as in Relation to <hi>Thomas Briggs</hi> deceaſed, before he was convinced of Gods bleſſed Truth, he was in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of outward Profeſſion amongſt the Presbiterians and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants without life and power; but after the Lord opened his underſtanding, he came to ſee the emptineſs of it; and the Lord brought him very low, and bowed him by his power, and made him ſubject unto his will and mind: and he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the Lord as a Child unto a Father, and the Lord gave unto him his good Spirit to inable him in his ſervice, and to clear his Conſcience at Steeple-houſes, and Market Places to them and all People: and then they roſe up in great Rage againſt him, as the Jews did againſt <hi>Paul;</hi> he was a Man of
