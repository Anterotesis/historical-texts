            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To come then to the matter; The ſeat or raiſed fabrick, appointed for the ſetting and celebration of this holy myſterie, was The HOLY TABLE or ALTAR: for by both theſe names hath that ſacred <hi>Biere</hi> (as I may call it) of the body and bloud of Chriſt bin ever promiſcuouſly and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently called in the Church.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>UT will ſome ſay, Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that from 200. years after Chriſt, and forward, the name of ALTAR was much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but before that time it cannot be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have bin uſed by the teſtimony of any Authentique writer; and therefore nothing ſo ancient as that of TABLE. So ſome of ours affirme indeed; but they will be tryed by no other Authors, and records of thoſe times, than ſuch onely as themſelves hold for genuine, as <hi>Iuſtin Martyr, Theophilus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochenus, Irenaeus,</hi> or it may be another ſmall Tractator or two (with whom this name is not found.) Of whom the works of the two principall, <hi>Iuſtin</hi> and <hi>Iren.</hi> the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have enformed us, are neer the one half periſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:3243:10"/>But before I make further anſwer to this exception, I would know, to what end it is made, and what advantage the Authors thereof doe hope to gaine by it. For the reaſon, I think why the name ALTAR is ſo much ſcrupled at, is, becauſe it is thought to imply <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> But <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> are well enough knowne, to call the Euchariſt both an <hi>oblation</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice</hi>: yea the latter to dwell upon that theme. What gaine is there then, that the name AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAR is not to be found in thoſe works of theirs, which remaine, if that of <hi>oblation</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> (for which the name of ALTAR is diſliked) be? Beſides, what likelihood, that thoſe who conceived of the Euchariſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a Sacrifice, ſhould not call the place thereof, as well as their Succeſſors did, ΘΥΣΙΑΣΤΗ'ΡΙΟΝ?</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would know of the Authors &amp; uſers of this exception, whether in thoſe Writers and Fathers before the 200. yeare after Chriſt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they acknowledged for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, the name of TABLE be to be found, or not, given to that, whereon the holy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3243:11"/>
               <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was celebrated. If it be not, then this exception of 200. yeares after Chriſt, (which yet is but 100. after the Apoſtles) makes no more againſt the one, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if neither be to be found in the works extant of the Fathers, which then lived For by this it will appear, they had no occaſion to mention this ſacred BOARD either by one name or other in thoſe works of theirs which are left unto us. Now for my part, though I have with diligence ſought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my ſelfe herein, yet hitherto it hath never been my hap to finde the Name of TABLE in any of them more then of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAR. I have enquired of others, and yet they have not ſhewed it mee. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till I ſee it, I will beleeve it cannot be ſhewne.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you will ſay, What matters it, whether the Fathers, we ſpeake of, have it, or not, if the Scripture hath?
For doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <q>You cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and of the Table of Devils?</q>
Tis true. There is this only place to be alledged to that purpoſe: I know no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3243:11"/>
other. And yet this too, if the judgement of ſome of our owne Expoſitors be taken, is not ſufficient to prove it neither. For <hi>Table</hi> here might ſignifie, not the inſtrument or ſeat, but the <hi>Epulum,</hi> or meat it ſelf; it being the uſe of all Languages (I am ſure of thoſe learned ones) to expreſſe dyet by <hi>Table</hi>; yea whether it be ſet thereon, or not. And the matter of the Apoſtles diſcourſe ſeemes to require this ſenſe: For he ſpeaks of <hi>Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyta,</hi> or <hi>meats ſacrificed to Idols.</hi> And not to be out-vyed with Antiquity, I could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as ſome doe) parallel this place for TABLE, with another, of a much like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the name ALTAR; namely, that <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Wee</hi> (i. e. wee Chriſtians) <hi>have an</hi> ALTAR, <hi>whereof they have no right to eate which ſerve at the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> I know what you would be ready to except; namely, That by the ALTAR here named, is meant Chriſt, which I for my owne part ſhould willingly admit, ſo it be underſtood with this caution; Chriſt as he is to be eaten in the Euchariſt. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes here of an ALTAR to be eaten
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3243:12"/>
of; which is not the materiall inſtrument, or ſeat, but the ſacrifice uſed thereon. Thus if theſe two places capable of, if not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the like interpretation, be ſet the one againſt the other, we have not all this while found one jott more for the Antiquity of the name TABLE than of ALTAR.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Canones Apoſt.</hi>
               </note>But now to anſwer more directly to the Queſtion, Whether the name of ALTAR were uſed in the Church before 200. years after Chriſt or not? I anſwer, It was. For proofe whereof, why may I not alledge the <hi>Canons</hi> called the Apoſtles? Which though the Apoſtles compiled not, yet are more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſure (at leaſt many of them) than 200. years after Chriſt, being not improbably to be thought to have been the <hi>Codex Canonum,</hi> whereby the Church in thoſe firſt ages (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the Orient) was ordered and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. And in Queſtions of uſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome (ſuch as this is) not genuineneſs of Titles onely, but whatſoever Antiquity, though masked under a wrong and untrue name, may be admitted, I think, to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence according to the age thereof. Beſides,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3243:12"/>
If it be credible, that the Apoſtles, or thoſe to whom they committed the Churches, Apoſtolicall men, might leave unto the Church ſome rules of Order &amp; Diſcipline, beſides thoſe mentioned in Scripture, (and whence otherwiſe ſhould thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and generally received traditions of the Church be derived?) why may not ſome of theſe, which beare that name, be of that number? And if any be, then none more likely then thoſe which are firſt in order: namely, becauſe collections of this nature are wont in proceſſe of time like ſnow-balls to receive increaſe by new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions ever and anon put unto them, and yet notwithſtanding continue ſtill the name &amp; Title of their firſt Authors; though ſometimes not the one halfe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents wil be owned by them. Upon which ſuppoſition we have, for the reſolving of the preſent queſtion, as much advantage as can be; conſidering, that the Canon wee are to alledge, is the ſecond, or at the moſt (according as ſome others divide them) but the third in order from the beginning; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3243:13"/>
ſo (howſoever the collection hath in time beene encreaſed) one of the firſt and moſt ancient of them. Let us therefore hear how it ſpeaks.</p>

            <p>Now, by warrant of theſe teſtimonies, I think I may ſafely conclude, that the uſe of the name ΘΥΣΙΑΣΤΗ'ΡΙΟΝ or ALTAR (for ought that any hitherto hath ſhewed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3243:16"/>
to the contrary) is no leſſe ancient in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, then that of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly TABLE or TABLE of the Lord. And that both have beene promiſcuouſly uſed from the Apoſtles times.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any marvaile it ſhould be ſo; for theſe names are of an equivalent notion, and ſignifie one and the ſelf ſame thing. For what is an <hi>Altar,</hi> but of thoſe kind of things we call <hi>Tables?</hi> what <hi>Genus</hi> elſe can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to? The difference is, That an <hi>Altar</hi> notes not a common, but an <hi>Holy Table,</hi> a <hi>Table</hi> for an <hi>Holy Feaſt,</hi> ſuch as I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed a Sacrifice to be, <hi>Epulum ex ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis,</hi> or a Feaſt of an Oblation made unto God. That is, there is no more difference between a <hi>Table</hi> &amp; an <hi>Altar,</hi> then between another cup and a Chalice. An <hi>Altar</hi> is not every <hi>Table,</hi> or a <hi>Table</hi> for a common feaſt, but an <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and an <hi>Holy Table</hi> is an <hi>Altar.</hi> The difference is not (as many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) either in the matter, as of wood or ſtone: For an <hi>Altar</hi> may be of wood (as both the golden <hi>Altar,</hi> and that of burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering were in the Tabernacle, namely of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3243:16"/>
Shittim wood) and a <hi>Table</hi> may bee of ſtone:
nor in the poſture or manner of ſtanding, whether in the middle, or againſt a wall; (for the <hi>Altar</hi> of burnt offering ſtood in the midſt of the Prieſts court, and the <hi>Altar</hi> of Incenſe up againſt the vail) but this is the true difference, that a <hi>Table</hi> is a common Name, and an <hi>Altar</hi> is an <hi>Holy</hi> Table. <q>This Holy Altar (<hi>ſaith</hi> Gregory Nyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene, Sermone de Baptiſmo) whereat we ſtand, is by nature a common ſtone, nothing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from other ſlates—but being conſecrated to the ſervice of God, and having received the benediction, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </q>
See hee makes one to be the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſis</hi> of the other. For in times paſt (when men perhaps were as wiſe, as we are now) it was thought fit and decent, that things ſet apart unto God, and ſacred, ſhould be diſtinguiſhed, not onely in uſe, but in <note n="*" place="margin">Yea and in form and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too.

yet diſtinguiſhed in name from other Feaſts. So what is an <hi>Altar,</hi> but a <hi>Table</hi>? yet diſtinguiſhed in name from other Tables.</p>
            <p>Well; let all this be granted, may ſome man ſay, that there is no greater difference betweene theſe two names, than as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; yet ought the language of the Church to be conformed to the ſtyle of the New Teſtament. But where in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould thoſe Ancients find any Text, whereon to ground the application of this name to the <hi>Holy Table?</hi> I anſwer, There, I am prone to beleeve, whence they derived the <hi>Oblation</hi> of the Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt, and that Rite of Reconciliation at their entrance therunto; (where the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con was wont to proclaime <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Ne quis contra aliquem,</hi> or in ſome other words to like effect; and then every one to ſalute his brother in token of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and peace) and that was from that Ordinance of our bleſſed Saviour in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon the Mount, viz. <q>If thou bringeſt thy <hi>GIFT</hi> unto the <hi>ALTAR,</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3243:17"/>
thee, leave thy <hi>GIFT</hi> before the <hi>ALTAR,</hi> and goe firſt, be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy <hi>GIFT.</hi>
               </q>
Which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they tooke to be an Evangelicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, wherein our Saviour implied, by way of Anticipation, that hee would leave ſome Rite to his Church, in ſtead, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of the Sacrifices of the Law, which ſhould begin with an Oblation, as they did; and that to require this proper and peculiar qualification in the Offerer, to be at peace, and without enmity with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in ſo much as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſeemes to place that purity of the Evangelicall oblation, propheſied of by <hi>Malachy,</hi> even in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. <hi>Vide l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 34.<note place="margin">c. 1.11.</note> Hence alſo they may ſeeme to have learned to call the Bread and Wine (in reſpect of this oblation) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the holy Gifts, from the word our Saviour here uſeth.</p>
            <p>For that they derived from this text that Rite of Peace and reconciliation before the Offertorie, appeares expreſly out of <hi>Conſtit. Apoſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 57. <hi>Iren. lib.</hi> 4.34. <hi>Edit. Fevar. Tertull. De Oratione c.</hi> 10. <hi>Euſebius De vita

Why then may I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve as well, that they might derive from the ſame text the <hi>Offertory</hi> it ſelfe, and the application of the name <hi>Altar</hi> to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> ſeeing all three in the Text depend one upon another; and that there is not in the N. Teſtament any other paſſage of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whereon ſo ancient and univerſall a practice of the Church, as was in all theſe three particulars, could expreſly be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And, beſides that the primitive practice of the Catholique Church is a good rule to interpret Scripture by; there may be good reaſons found, from the circumſtances of the text, and Sermon it ſelfe, to perſwade it to be an Evangelicall Conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there was no ſuch thing commanded in the Law to ſuch as came to offer ſacrifice; nor any ſuch <hi>deuteroſis</hi> to be found amongſt the traditions of the Elders. Now it is altogether improbable, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our would then annexe a new Rite to the Legall ſacrifices, when he was, ſo ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to aboliſh them by his ſacrifice upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3243:18"/>
the Croſſe; yea (if the Harmoniſts of the Goſpell are not deceived) within leſſe than two years after. For they place this Sermon between his ſecond and third Paſſeover. <hi>Ergo</hi> he intended it for an Ordinance of the Kingdome of God (as the Scripture ſpeaks) that is, for the Church of his Goſpell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Sermon, whereof this was part, is that famous Sermon of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour upon the Mount; which he read as a Lecture to his Diſciples, to inſtruct them in the Myſteries of the Kingdome of God, a little before he ſent them out to preach; and ſo, in all likelyhood, contained the ſumme of that they were to preach; which no doubt was Doctrine Evangelicall. In all other parts of the Sermon we finde it ſo: wherfore then ſhould we not ſo eſteem it, even in this alſo?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is brought in (and that in the firſt place) as an exemplification of that righteouſneſſe, wherein the Citizens of the Kingdome of Chriſt were to outgoe the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees:
<q>I ſay unto you <hi>(ſaith our Saviour)</hi> except your
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3243:19"/>
righteouſneſſe ſhall exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes &amp; Phariſees, ye ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of Heaven.</q>
Then followes this text, ſhewing how farre we are to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip the Scribes and Phariſees, in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This paſſage ſhould be Evangelicall, foraſmuch as it ſeemes, together with the reſt that follow it, to be a part of that <gap reason="foreign">
