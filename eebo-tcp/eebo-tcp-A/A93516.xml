            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME REASONS Humbly offered to the MEMBERS of the Houſe of Commons, WHY <hi>The Bill that is before them, for making the People called Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AKERS ſolemn Affirmations in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, to be as valid and effectual in all Courts and legal Proceedings as Swearing, they being ſubject to the pains of Perjury, in caſe any of them affirms falſly.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Iſt. BEcauſe it will be a Means for the equal diſtribution of Juſtice, to and among all their Majeſties Subjects of what Perſwaſion ſoever, in that none will have advantage over their Fellow Subjects outward Eſtates, for their differences in matters of Conſcience. Secondly, It will be a Means for the Impartial Diſcovery of the Truth in all Caſes of Controverſie, becauſe thereby Men of tender Conſciences, will be made capable of evidencing their Knowledge in the matter depending.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Government will have the ſame ſecurity, and all Parties concerned in Suites at Law, will have the ſame Remedy upon them that Evidence without Swearing, as upon them that Swear.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It will be a Means to facilitate the Work of their Majeſties Judges, Juſtices and Commiſſioners, and of bringing Controverſies and Suits to a ſpeedy Iſſue.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It will moſt effectually anſwer and agree with the Act, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts diſſenting Proteſtant Subjects from the Penalties of certain Laws, and with the King's Declaration of eaſe to tender Conſciences</p>
            <p>Alſo it is to be conſidered that this moderation to Perſons ſcrupling to, Swear, hath had good effect in our Neighbouring Countries, as above one hundred years experience hath manifeſted.</p>
            <p>On the 26th day of <hi>January,</hi> 1577. <hi>Guilliaume de Naſſou</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and <note place="margin">G. Brant's <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation in the</hi> Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 587, 588.</note> Statholder of <hi>Holland, Zealand, &amp;c.</hi> with the Conſent of the Governour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſent his Mandate to the Magiſtrates, commanding (on behalf of the Miniſts who refuſed to Swear in any Caſe) That their Yea ſhould be accepted and taken inſtead of an Oath, they being ſubject in caſe of falſifying the Truth to the Pains of Perjury.</p>
            <p>In the year 1593, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> Son of the former Prince, with the conſent of the States gave forth a Placate or Mandate in behalf of the ſaid Miniſts to the ſame effect, which is obſerved by all Magiſtrates through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole Government to this day; as appears by the Act of State made this preſent year, 1690. for the raiſing the hundreth Penny in which, in that Paragraph relating to the diſcovery of Eſtates, next unto, the words <hi>Solemn Oath,</hi> are theſe words Printed <q>[as concerning the Miniſts, they ſhall declare with true Words inſtead of an Oath, which ſhall be holden of the ſame effect and value as a corporal Oath.]</q> And further it appears by the Warrants of Aſſeſment made by vertue of the ſaid Act, in which the ſame Words in behalf of the Miniſts are again Rehearſed.—So that both in reſpect of raiſing Taxes, carrying on Suits, or determining Controverſies, no difficulties nor obſtructions do appear by their not Swearing.</p>
            <p>And we doubt not but if you pleaſe upon the Conſideration of the Premiſes, to conſent to the ſaid Bill, you will live to ſee the good effects it will have in this Kingdom, and that it will tend to the Service of the Government, the increaſe of Trade, furtherance of Juſtice and Tranquility of the Subject.</p>
