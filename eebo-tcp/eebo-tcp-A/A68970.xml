            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOdly learned men doo wryte and publiſh bookes to profit the age in which they do liue, and the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This deſire was in the Authour of this treatiſe Maiſter <hi>Iohn Bradford,</hi> who was the Preacher and publiſher of this Sermon of repentaunce. And now, to the ende that we which do liue in earth after him, and are the poſteritie, may take as much or more profit by it then they dyd, to and for whom in his lyfe tyme he did both preach and publiſh it, the ſame hys labour is by new emprintyng publiſhed againe. Nothing is added to toys Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or altered in it: onely to the ſermon of repentaunce before printed, is added an other Sermon of the Lords ſupper, which he alſo made, and was neuer printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And aptly ſhalt thou ſée, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, theſe two Sermons ioyned together. For in diligent peruſing of the laſt, thou ſhalt ſée how neceſſarely he draweth the doctrine of repentaunce to them al, which
<pb facs="tcp:6725:3"/>
do with due preparation receiue the holy Sacrament of Chriſt. I doo not knowe which of the Sermons I ſhoulde moſt prayſe. I wiſh that by reading both, thou mayeſt make thy great profite. In both theſe Sermons thou ſhalt reade <hi>Bradford</hi> preaching repentance with his own pen.</p>
            <p>They are counted the moſt profitable Teachers, which haue themſelues good experiance by practiſe in themſelues, of that which they doe teach to others: ſuch as may ſafely ſay, <hi>Brethren be ye folowers of me, and looke on them which walke ſo</hi>

               <hi>as ye haue vs for an example.</hi> And ſurely ſuch a paterne was Maiſter <hi>Bradford</hi> in his lyfe tyme, of thys doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce which in both theſe Sermons he teacheth, that I which did know him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliartye, muſt needes geue to God thys praiſe for hym, that among men I haue ſcarcely knowen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oue lyke vnto hym. I dyd knowe when, and partlye howe it pleaſed God by effectuall callyng to turne his hart vnto the true knowledge and obedience of the moſt holy Goſpell of Chriſt our Sauiour. Of which God dyd geue him ſuch an heauenly hold and liuely
<pb facs="tcp:6725:3"/>
ſéeling, that as he did then know that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Luke. 7.</note> ſynnes were forgeuen him: ſo ſurely he declared by déedes that he loued much. For where he had both giftes and calling to haue employed himſelfe in ciuill and wordly affaires profitably, ſuch was his loue of Chriſt, and zeale to the promoting of his glorious Goſpell, that he chaunged not onely the courſe of his former, lyfe, as the woman dyd. <hi>Luke.</hi> 7. but euen his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtudy, as Paule dyd chaunge his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profeſſion and ſtudy.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, after that God tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his hart with that holy and effectual calling, he ſold his chaines, rynges, broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and iuels of gold which before he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to weare, and did beſtow the price of this his former vanitie in the neceſſarye releife of Chriſtes poore members, which he could heare of or fynde lying ſicke or pining in pouertie. Touching the ſecond, he ſo declared his great zeale and loue to promote the glory of the lord Ieſus, whoſe goodnes and ſauing health he had taſted, that to do the ſame more pithely, he chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his ſtudye, and being in the inner Temple in London at the ſtudye of the
<pb facs="tcp:6725:4"/>
common lawes, he went to Cambridge to ſtudy Diuinitie, where he heard <hi>D. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Bucer</hi> diligently, and was right fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milyar and deare vnto hym. In thys godly courſe he dyd by Gods bleſſyng ſo profit, that that bleſſed Martyr <hi>D. Ridley</hi> then Biſhop of London dyd as it were inuite hym and hys godlye Companion Maiſter <hi>Thomas Horton</hi> to become fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of Penbrake hall in Cambrydge: And afterwardes the ſayd <hi>D.

And beſides often preachyng in London, and at Paules croſſe, and ſundry places in the countrey, and ſpeacially in Lankeſhire, he preached before King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, in the Lent the laſt yeare of his raygne, vpon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pſalme, and there in one Sermon, ſhewing the tokens of Gods iudgement at hand for the contempt of the Goſpell, as that certayne Gentlemen vpon the Sabboth day, going in a whirry to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris garden to the Barebayting, were drowned: and that a Dog was met at

<pb facs="tcp:6725:5"/>
ſelfe a Cataloge of all the groſſeſt &amp; moſt enorme ſynnes which in his lyfe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he had committed, and to lay the ſame before hys eyes when hes went to priuate praier, that by the ſight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of them, he might be ſtirred vp to offer to God the ſacrifice of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite hart, ſéeke aſſurance of ſaluation in Chriſt by faith, thanke God for his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the waies of wickednes, and praye for encreaſe of grace to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in holy lyfe acceptable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God. Such a continuall exerciſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience he had in priuate praier, that he did not count himſelfe to haue prayed to his contentacion, vnleſſe in it hee had felt inwardly ſome ſmyting of hart for ſynne, and ſome healing of that wound by faith, féeling y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſauing health of Chriſt, with ſome chaunge of mynde into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſynne and loue of obeying the good wyll of God.

Let vs learne by <hi>Bradfordes</hi> example to pray better, that is, with the hart, and not with ihe lyps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue: <hi>Quia Deus uon vocis ſed cardis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor eſt,</hi> as <hi>Cyprin</hi> ſaith, that is, becauſe God is the hearer of the hart, and not of the voyce, that is to ſay, not of the voyce alone without the hart, for that is but lyb labour.

            <p>An other of his exerciſes was this: He vſed to make vnto him ſelfe an <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meris</hi> or a <hi>Iournal,</hi> in which hee vſed to write all ſuch notable thinges as either hee did ſée or heare eche day that paſſed. But what ſo euer he did heare or ſée, he did ſo pen it, that a man might ſée, in that booke the ſignes of his ſmitten hart. For if he did ſée or heare any good in any man, by that ſight he found &amp; noted the want thereof in hym ſelfe, and added a ſhort prayer, crauing mercye and grace to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende. If he dyd heara or ſée any plague

            <p>Beſydes this, they which were fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with him, might ſee how he being in their company, vſed to fall often into a ſodaine and deepe meditation, in which he would ſyt with fixed countenaunce and ſpirite moued, yet ſpeaking nothing a good ſpace. And ſome times in thys ſilent ſytting, plentye of teares ſhould trickle downe his cheekes. Sometime he would ſytinit, and come out of it with a ſmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling countenaunce.

Neither was he onelye ſuch a practiſer of repentance in himſelfe, but a continuall prouoker of others thereunto, not onely in publike preaching, but alſo in priuate conference and company. For in all companies where he dyd come, he would fréely reproue any ſynne and myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behauiour which appeared in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eſpecially ſwearers, filthy talkers, and popiſh praters. Such neuer depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of his company vnreproued. And this he did with ſuch a diuine grace and Chriſtian maieſtie, that euer he ſtopped the mouthes of the gaynſayers: For he ſpake with power, and yet ſo ſweetely, that they might ſée their euyll to be euyll and hurtfull vnto them, and vnderſtand that it was good in déede to the which he laboured to draw them in God.</p>

But oh ye mourners and cryers out, ye renters of clothes, why mourne ye? What is the cauſe of your miſery?

Therfore to repentaunce for our ſelues priuately, and for the Realme &amp; Church publikely, euery one ſhuld labour to ſtyrre vp both our ſelues and others. This, to the end that for my part I might help, I haue preſently put forth a ſermon of Repentance, which hath lien by me halfe a yeare at the leaſt for the moſt part of it. For the laſt ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as I was abroade preaching in the countrey, my chaunce was to make a Sermon of repentance, the which was earneſtly of diuers deſired of me, that I ſhould geue it them written, or els put it forth in print. The which thing to graunt, as I could not (for I had not written it) ſo I told them that had ſo earneſtly deſired it. But when no nay would ſerue, but I muſt promiſe them to write it as I could: I conſented to ther requeſt, that they ſhould haue it at my leaſure. This leaſure I prolonged ſo long, that as (I weene) &amp; offended them: ſo did I pleaſe my ſelfe, as one more glad to reade other mens wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, then in ſuch ſort to publiſh mine

But when I conſidered this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, to occaſion men now to looke vpon althinges in ſuch ſorte as might moue them to godlines, rather then to any curious queſtioning, I for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying of my promiſe, and profyting of the ſimple ignoraunt and rude, haue now cauſed this Sermon to be printed: the which I beſech God for his Chriſtes ſake, to vſe as a meane whereby of his mercy it may pleaſe him to worke in me and many others true hartye repentaunce for our ſinnes, to the glory of his name.</p>

drawech more and more neare hys ende, that is the earth: euen ſo our ſoule draweth dayly more and more neare vnto death, that is, ſaluation or damnation, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or hell.</p>

of our nature. God vnto all his commaundements commonly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrr addeth ſome promiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to obedience, or els ſome ſuch ſufficient cauſe as cannot but tickle vs vp to harty inbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng for the doing of the ſame: as here to the commaundement of doing penance he addeth this <hi>aetiologe</hi> or cauſe, ſaying: <hi>For the kingdome of heanen is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, in that he ioyneth to the commaundement the cauſe, ſaying: <hi>For the kingdome of heauen is at haud,</hi> we may learne that of the kiugdome of heauen, none (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miniſtery. of preaching doth appertain) can be partaker, but ſuch as repent &amp; do penance. Therfore dearely beloued, if you regard the kingdome of heauen, in that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not enter therin ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept you repent, I beſech you all
<pb facs="tcp:6725:16"/>
of euery eſtate, as you wold your own weale, to repent and do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The which thing that ye may do, I wyll do my beſt now to helpe you by Gods grace.</p>
            <p>But firſt, becauſe we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not wel tell what repentance is, through ignorance and for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and falſe teaching: I wyll (to begin withal) ſhew you what repentance is. Repentance or pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nante is no Engliſh woord, but we borow it of the Latiniſtes, to whom penance is a forethinking in Englyſh, in Greeke a beyng wyſe afterwardes, in Hebrew a conuerſion or turning, the which conuerſion or turning, in that it cannot be true &amp; harty, vnto God eſpecially, without ſome good hope or truſt of pardon for that which is already done and paſt, I may well in thys ſort define it
<pb facs="tcp:6725:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
namely, that penance is a ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or forethinking of our ſinnes paſt, an earneſt purpoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or turning to God with a truſt of pardon.</p>
            <p>This definition may be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three partes: Firſt a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for our ſyns: Secondly a truſt of pardon, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may be called a perſwaſion of Gods mercy by the merites of Chriſt for the forgeuenes of our ſyns: And thirdly, a purpoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mend, or conuerſion to a new life The which third or laſt part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called properly a part, for it is but an effect of penance, as towardes the end ye ſhall ſee by Gods grace. But leaſt ſuche as ſeeke for occaſion to ſpeake euyll, ſhould haue any occaſion, though they tary not out the end of thys Sermon: I therefore diuide pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauce
<pb facs="tcp:6725:17"/>
into the three foreſayde partes: of ſorrowing for our ſyn of good hope or truſt of pardon, and of a new life. Thus you now ſee what penance is: a ſorowing for ſyn, a purpoſe to amend, with a good hope or truſt of pardon.</p>
            <p>This penance not onely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from that which men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly haue taken to be penance, in ſaying &amp; doing our enioyned Lady Pſalters, ſeuen Pſalmes, faſtynges, pylgrimages, almes deedes, and ſuch like things but alſo from that which the more learned haue declared to conſiſt of three partes, namely Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Confeſſion, &amp; Satiſfaction.</p>
            <p>Contrition they cal a iuſt &amp; a ful ſorow for their ſin. For this word iuſt &amp; ful, in one of the differences betwene contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and attrition.</p>
            <p>Confeſſion they cal a numbring
<pb facs="tcp:6725:17"/>
of al their ſins in the eare of their ghoſtly father; for as (ſay they) a Iudge cannot abſolue without knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe or matter, ſo cannot the Prieſt or ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolue from other ſynnes, then thoſe which he doth heare.</p>
            <p>Satiſfaction they calamendes making vnto God for their ſyns by their vndue workes, <hi>opera in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debita,</hi> woorkes more then they neede to do, as they terme them. This is their pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which they preach, write, &amp; alow. But how true this geare is, how it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Gods woord, how it is to be alowed, taught, preached, and writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs a litle conſider. If a man repent not vntil he haue a iuſt and full ſorrowing for his ſyns (dearely beloued) when ſhal he repent? For in aſmuch as hell fire, &amp; the puniſhment of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
<pb facs="tcp:6725:18"/>
is a iuſt puniſhment for ſyn: In as much as in all ſyn there is a contempt of God, which is all goodnes, and therefore there is acontempt deſerte or all ylnes: alas who can beare or feele this iuſt ſorowe, this full ſorow for our ſyns, this their contricion, which they do ſo diſcern fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their attrition? Shal not man by this doctrine rather diſpaire, then come by repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repent not vntil he haue made confeſſion of all his ſyns in the eare of his ghoſtly father: if a man cannot haue abſolution of his ſyns vntil his ſins be told by tale and number in the Prieſtes eare (in that, as Dauid ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

muſt hand in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mering &amp; dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whether our ſyns be forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

            <p>Mercifull father of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, bicauſe I haue ſynned and done wickedly, &amp; tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thy goodnes haue receiued a deſire of repentance, wherto this thy long ſufferaunce doth draw my hard hart. I beſeche thee for thy mercies ſake in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> to worke the ſame repentance in me and by thy ſpirit, power, &amp; grace ſo to humble, mortify, and teare my concſience for my ſyns to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in thy good time thou mayeſt comfort and quicken me again through Ieſus Chriſt thy dearely beloued Sonne. Amen.</p>
            <p>After this ſort I ſay, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, as thou thinckeſt good, if
<pb facs="tcp:6725:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou wilt haue this firſt part con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trition or ſorow for thy ſins, do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beg it of God thorow Chriſt. And when thou haſt aſked it, as I haue laboured to driue thee from truſting in thy ſelfe, ſo now I go about to moue thee from flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thy ſelf, from ſluggiſhnes and negligence, to be diligent to vſe theſe meanes folowing.</p>
            <p>Unto prayer, which I would thou ſhouldeſt fyrſt vſe as thou canſt, ſecondly get thee Gods law as a glas to toote in, for in it and by it commeth the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſynne, without whych knowledge there can bee no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. For how can a man ſorow for his ſynnes, which knoweth not hys ſynnes? As when a man is ſycke, the fyrſt ſtep to health, is to know his ſycknes: euen ſo to ſaluation, the firſt ſtep is to
<pb facs="tcp:6725:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
know thy damnation due for thy ſynnes.</p>
            <p>The law of God therfore muſt be gotten and wel tooted in, that is, we muſt looke in it ſpiritually, &amp; not corporally or carnally, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward word or letter doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and vtter: and ſo our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our teacheth vs in Mathew, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the ſixt &amp; ſeuenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements, not onely after the outward deede, but alſo after the hart, making there the anger of the hart, a kynde of murther, luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after an other mans wyfe, a kinde of adultery,</p>
            <p>And this is one of the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwene Gods law and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lawe, that of this (mans law I meane I am not contemnable, ſo long as I obſerue outwardli the ſame. But gods law goeth to the roote &amp; to the hart, condemning
<pb facs="tcp:6725:28"/>
me for the inwarde motion, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though outwardlye I lyue moſt holyly. As for example: If I kil no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though in my hart I hate mans law condemneth me not: but otherwyſe doth Gods lawe. And why? for it ſeeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence the euil doth ſpring. If hatred were taken out of the hart, then loftynes in lookes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and murther by hand could neuer enſue. If luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wer out of the hart, curioſity in countenaunce, wantonnes in wordes, baudy boldnes in body would not appeare,</p>
            <p>In that therfore this outward euyll ſpringes out of the inward corruption: ſeyng Gods law alſo is a law of liberty, as ſayth ſaynt <note place="margin">Iame. 2.</note> Iames: and ſpirituall, as ſaith ſ. Paule: perfectly &amp; ſpiritually it <note place="margin">Roma. 7.</note> is to be vnderſtand, if we wyll
<pb facs="tcp:6725:28"/>
truly come to the knowledge of our ſyns. For of this inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, reaſon knoweth but litle or nothing. I had not knowen <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> (ſayth Paul) that luſting (which to reaſon, and to them which are guided only by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is thought but a triſte) I had not knowen ſayth he, this luſting to haue ben ſyn, if the lawe had not ſayd, <hi>Non concupiſces, Thou shalt not luſt.</hi>

            <p>Synne in Gods law it is we may ſee and a foule ſpot, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſent to euil luſt, or carnal deſires, but euen the very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or carnall luſtes and deſyres themſelues for ſo I may cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nature it ſelfe being now ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted are ſin, and ſelfe loue, and

            </head>
            <p>THere are two Sacramentes <note place="margin">Two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes in chriſtes church.</note> in Chriſtes Church: the one of initiation, that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we be enraled as it were, in to the houſhold &amp; family of God, which Sacrament we call Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: the other wherwith we be conſerued, fed, kept &amp; nouriſhed, to continue in the ſame Familye, which is called the Lords ſupper or the body and bloud of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, broken for our ſyns, and ſhed for our trauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
            <p>Of the former Sacrament, that is, of Baptiſme, to ſpeake now I am not purpoſed, becauſe occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and tyme ſerue not ſo therto. Of the ſecond therfore wyl I ſpeake

preſently to ſpeake, through the helpe of God, becauſe we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Chriſt (I hope) to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the ſame. Now that the things which I ſhall ſpeake may be better obſerued and caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of you, I wyl tell you how &amp; in what ſort I wyll ſpeake of it. Three thynges would I haue marked, as the principals and ſcopes wherto I wyl referre al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhal at this time ſpeake therof. They be theſe: Who, what, and wherefore. That is, (to make it more plaine) who dyd inſtitute this thing which we are about to celebrate, this is the firſt. The ſecond is, what y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing is which is inſtituted. And the laſt is, wherfore and to what end it was inſtituted: whereby we ſhall be taught how to vſe it.</p>
            <p>For the fyrſt, who did inſtitute
<pb facs="tcp:6725:67"/>
thys Sacrament and Supper: <note place="margin">who dyd inſtitute this Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament,</note> you all do know that things are more eſteemed ſometyme for the dignity and authority of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: ſometime for the wiſedom of the perſon, ſometyme for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and magnificence of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſou, and ſometime for the tender loue and kyndnes of the perſon. If neede were I could by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſet forth euery one of theſe, but I hope it is not neceſſarye. Now then, how can the thyng which we be about to celebrate, but be eſtemed of euery one high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, in that the Auth or of it doth want no dignity, no authority, no wyſedome, no power, no magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, no holmes, no tender loue and kindnes, but hath al dignity authority, wiſdome, power mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, holynes, tender lone, mercy, glory, and all that can be
<pb facs="tcp:6725:67"/>
wiſhed abſolutely? He is God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruall, coequall, and ſubſtantiall wyth the Father &amp; with the holy Ghoſt, the image of the ſubſtance of God, the wyſedome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the brightnes of hys glory, by whom all things were made, are ruled and gouerned. He is the Kyng of all Kyngs, and the Lord of all Lords, He is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the world, our moſt deare and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brother, Sauiour, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, Aduocate, Interceſſor, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baud, Prieſt. So that the thyng which commeth from hym, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be eſtemed, loued, and embra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced, if dignity, authority, wiſdom power, glory, goodnes, &amp; mercy lyke vs. Yea, if auy thing that can be wyſhed lyke vs, theu cannot thys whych our Lord dyd inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but like vs, and that ſo much the more, by how much it is oue
<pb facs="tcp:6725:68"/>
of the laſt things which he did in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitute &amp; commaunde. God open our eyes to ſee theſe thynges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: ſo ſhall we come with more reuerence to thys Table of the Lord, which thing he graunt for hys mercies ſake, Amen. And thus much for the fyrſt, who dyd inſtitute thys Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now to the ſecond, what the <note place="margin">2 what the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is.</note> Sacrament is. If we ſhall aſke our eies, our noſe, our mouth, our taſte, our handes, and the reaſon of man, they wyll all make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant anſwer, that it is bread &amp; wyne. And verelye herein they ſpeake the truth and lye not, as by many thyngs may be proued, although the Papiſts prate their pleaſure to the coutrary.</p>
            <p>And here, my dearely beloued, I thynke I ſhal not be either te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious or vnprofitable vnto you, if
<pb facs="tcp:6725:68"/>

Wherby we may learne how ſhameles beaſtes they be, whych <note place="margin">Upon tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation, which is an errour wherupon in a maner dependeth all popery. For it is the ſtay of theyr Prieſthood, whych is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> but after the order of <hi>Baal,</hi> whych thing is ſomthyng ſeene by theyr number. For the falſe prophets &amp; Prieſtes of <hi>Baal</hi> were alwayes many moe in number, when the wycked were in authority, then the true Prieſtes and Prophetes of the Lord, as the holy hiſtories of the Bible do teach. Reade the
<pb facs="tcp:6725:69"/>
third of the Kings the. 18, chap.</p>
            <p>That in the ſupper of the Lord <note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the popyſh Maſſe is not the crament of chriſtes body.</note> or in the Sacrament of Chriſtes body (which the Papiſts call the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Aulter, as though that were Chriſtes Sacrament, which thing they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer proue: For it being peruerted &amp; vſed to a contrary ende, as of ſacrifieyng propitiatorily for the ſyns of the quicke and of the dead, of idolatry by adorning or worſhipping it by godly honor. &amp;c. is no more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes Sacrament, but an horrible prophanation of it, and therefore as Chriſt called Gods Temple, which was, called au houſe of prayer, for the abuſing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanyng of it by the Prieſtes, a den of the eues: ſo this which the Papiſts call the ſacrament of the Aultar, full truly may we call au abominable Idol: And therfore
<pb facs="tcp:6725:69"/>
I would all men ſhoulde knowe that the ſacrament of the Aultar as the Papiſtes now do abuſe it, omittyng certayne ſubſtantiall poyntes of the Lords iuſtitution and putting in the ſteede thereof their own dregs and dreaues, is not the ſacrament of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor the Lords ſupper: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when we ſpeake reuerently as our duty is, we would not that men ſhould thinke we ſpeake it of the popiſh Maſſe: (that I ſay in the Supper of the Lord, or in the ſacrament of Chriſts body there remaineth the ſubſtance of bread and wine, as our ſenſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to teach, theſe many thinges alſo do teach the ſame.</p>
            <p>Firſt the holy Chriſt doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell vs, by calling it often bread <note place="margin">The firſt reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> aftrr the wordes of conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as 1. <hi>Cornith. 10. Is not the bread
<pb facs="tcp:6725:70"/>
which we breake a partakyng of the body of Chriſt,</hi> ſayth Paule? Loe, plainly he ſaith: <hi>the bread which we breake,</hi> not onely calling it bread, but addyng thereto breakyng, which cannot be attributed ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Chriſtes body, whereof no bone was broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either to any accident, but muſt needes be of a ſubſtance, which ſubſtance if it be not Chriſtes body, cannot be but bread. As in the .xi. chapter foure times he plainly calleth it: <hi>He that eateth of this bread: He that receiueth this bread. &amp;c,</hi> And in the Actes of the Apoſtels we reade, how that (in ſpeaking of the Communion) <hi>they met together to breake bread. &amp;c</hi> So that it is playne that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauce of bread and wyne doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in the Supper after the wordes of conſecration: as alſo may appeare playnly by Chriſts
<pb facs="tcp:6725:70"/>
own wordes, which calleth that which he gaue them in the Cup, wyne or the fruit of the vyne, as both Mathew and Matke doo write. Wherby we ſet that there is no tranſubſtantiation of the wyne, and therfore may we alſo ſee, that there is no tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of the bread.</p>
            <p>As for the Paniſtes cauillyng, <note place="margin">An aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Papiſtes cauill for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foreſayd reaſon. <hi>Math. 26 Exod. 7.</hi>
               </note> how that it hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of bread becauſe it was bread, as Symon the leper was called ſtylle prous, though hee was healed: or as Moſes rod, beyng turned into a ſerpent, was called a Rod ſtyll, it proueth nothing. For there was in the one a playne ſight, and the ſenſes certified that Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was no leper: and in the other playne mention that the rod was turned into a Serpent. But concernyng the Sacrament, neyther the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

               </note> bread remaineth ſtil, the very text doth teach. For the Euangeliſts and the Apoſtle Saint Paule do wytnes, that Chriſt gaue that to his Diſciples, and called it hys body whych hee tooke, on which he gaue thankes, and whych he brake: but he tooke bread, gaue thankes on bread, &amp; broke bread <hi>Ergo</hi> he gane bread, &amp; called bred hys body, as he called the cup the new teſtament. So that it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by this, that there is no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. And thys reaſon I my ſelfe haue promiſed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:6725:71"/>
to proue by the authority of the Fathers, namely <hi>Ireneus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Orgine, Ciprin, Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Hierommus, Auguſtinus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorete, Cirill, Bede,</hi> it ſo be I may haue the vſe of my bookes, <note place="margin">The third reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that in the Sacrament there is no tranſub ſtantiation of the bread, by this reaſon I doo proue: Lyke as by our Sauiour Chriſt the ſpirit of truth ſpake of the bread, <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſo ſaith the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and one bread. &amp;c.</hi> So that as it ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peareth the Sacrament not to be the Church by tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen ſo is it not Chriſtes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body by trauſubſtanciation</p>

 to tranſubſtantiate the cup, then their wordes ſpoken of the bread are operatorius &amp; myghty to tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiate the bread. For as they ſay of the bread, <hi>Thys is my body,</hi> ſo ſay they of the Cup, <hi>This cup is the new teſtament:</hi> which thing is abſurde to be ſpoken or thought, either of the cup or of the thing in the cup by tranſubſtanti ation.

            <p>Fiftly, that the ſubſtaunce of bread remaineth in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <note place="margin">The fyft reaſon.</note> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſons before brought forth do proue, ſo doth the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Sacrament.

            <p>To the thinges which I haue brought herefoorth to improue tranſubſtantiation, I could bring in the fathers to confyrme the ſame, which ſucceded continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye many hundreth yeares after Chriſt.

doctrine the church was nothing ſo endowed with goodes, lands, and poſſeſſions, as it hath beene ſynce. It hath brought no ſmall gayne, no ſmall honour, no ſmall eaſe t the Cleargy, and therefore no maruel though they ſtriue and fyght for it.

            <p>Now to returne to the ſecond matter what the Sacrament is, you ſee that to the ſenſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of man it is bread and wyne. which is moſt true, as by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures and other wyſe I haue all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readye proued, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with tranſubſtantiation,</p>

bare bread and a naked ſigne, and ſo rayle at their pleaſure on vs, ſaying: How can a man be giltre of the body and bloud of Chriſt by vnworthy receiuing of it, if it bee but bare bread, and ſo forth? For thys purpoſe I wyll nowe ſpeake a little more hereabout, by gods grace, to ſtop their mouthes and to ſtyre vp your good harts more to the worthy eſtimation &amp; perception of this holy myſterye. When a louing friend geueth to thee a thing, or ſendeth to thee a token (as for an example a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyn, or ſuch like) I thinke thou doeſt not as thou ſhouldeſt doo, if that with the thyng thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt not the mynde of thy friend that ſendeth or geueth the thing, and according the runto, eſtemeſt and receyueſt it: And ſo of thys bread thinke I, that if thou doo
<pb facs="tcp:6725:79"/>
not rather conſider the mynde of thy louer Chriſt, then the thyng which thou ſeeſt: yea if thou doo not altogether conſider Chriſtes mynde, thon dealeſt vnhoneſtly &amp; ſtrumpetlike with hym. For it is the propertye of ſtrumpets to conſider the thynges geuen and ſent them, rather then the loue &amp; mynde of the geuer and ſender: whereas the true louers do not conſider in any poynt the thinges geuen or ſent, but the mind of the party. So wee, if we bee true lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of Chriſt, muſt not conſider barely the outward thyng which we ſee, and our ſenſes perceyue, but rather altogether we muſt &amp; ſhould ſee and conſider the minde of Chriſt, and therafter and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, to eſteme the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we knowe the mynde of Chryſt? For ſooth as a
<pb facs="tcp:6725:79"/>
mans mynde is beſt knowen by his word: ſo by Chriſtes woord ſhall we know his mynde. How his wordes be manifeſt and moſt playne: <hi>This</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is my dody:</hi> therefore accordingly ſhould we eſteeme, take, and receiue it. If he had ſpoken nothing, or if he had ſpoken doubtfully, then might we haue bene in ſome doubt. But in that he ſpeaketh ſo plainly, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is my body;</hi> who can, maye, or dare bee ſo bold as to doubt of it? He is the truth and cannot lye, he is omnipotent and can do all thinges: therefore it is his body. This I beleue, this I confeſſe, and pray you all hartely to beware of theſe and ſuch lyke wordes, that it is but a ſygne or a figure of his body: Except you wil diſcern betwixt ſignes which fignify ouely, and ſygnes whych
<pb facs="tcp:6725:80"/>
alſo doo repreſent, confirme and ſeale vp (or as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſay) geue wyth their ſignification. As for an example: An Iuye buſh is a ſygne of wine to be ſold: the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of <hi>Aarous</hi> rod dyd ſygnifye <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſthood alowed of the Lord: the reſeruation of <hi>Moſes</hi> rod dyd ſignifye the rebellion of the children of Iſrael: the ſtones take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Iordane, Gedeons</hi> fleeſe of wool. &amp;c. ſuch as theſe, be ſigne ſignificatiue, and ſhewe no gyft, But in the other ſygnes, whych ſome call exhibitiue, is there not onely a ſignification of the thyng but alſo a declaration of a gyft, yea in a certayne maner a geuing alſo. As Baptiſme ſignifieth not onely the clenſing of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience from ſyn by the merites of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes bloud, but alſo is a very clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng from ſynne. And therfore it
<pb facs="tcp:6725:80"/>
was ſayd to Paule that he ſhould aryſe and waſh away hys ſyns, &amp; not that he ſhould aryſe and take onely a ſygne of waſhyng away hys ſyns. In the Lordes ſupper the bread is called a partaking of the Lordes body, and not onely a bare ſigne of the Lordes body.</p>
            <p>This I ſpeake not as though the elements of theſe ſacraments were trauſubſtantiate) whych I haue already impugned either as though Chriſtes body wér in the bread or wyne, eyther were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yed to the elementes, otherwyſe then ſacramentally and ſpiritually, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the bread and wine may not and muſt not be called ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and externall ſignes: but that they myght be diſcerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſignificatiue and bare ſignes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and be taken for ſignes exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and repreſentatiue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6725:81"/>
By thys meanes a Chriſtian comcience wil call and eſteme the bread of the Lord as the body of Chriſt. For it wyll neuer eſteeme the Sacraments of Chriſt after their exteriour appearance, but after the words of Chriſt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it commeth that the Fathers, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and others doo ſpeake with ſo ful a mouth when they ſpeake of the Sacrament, for their reſpect was to Chriſtes woordes, If the Schoolemen which folowed them, had had the ſame ſpirit whych they had, then would they neuer haue conſented to tranſubſtantiation. For wyth great admiration ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doo ſay, that the bread is chaunged or turned into the body of Chriſt and the wyne into hys bloud: meaning it of amutation or chaunge not corporal, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
<pb facs="tcp:6725:81"/>
figuratiue, ſacramental, or myſticall. For now it is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread nor common wyne, beyng ordayned to ſerue for the foods of the ſoule. The ſcolemen haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it as the Papiſtes nowe preach of a ſubſtautial chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, as though it were no great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that common bread ſhould now be aſſumed into that dignity that it ſhould bee called Chriſtes body, and ſerue for a celeſtial food and be made a Sacrament of hys body and bloud.</p>
            <p>As before therfore I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <note place="margin">Chriſtes preſence in the ſupper,</note> I would with that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſhould be eſteemed &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of vs Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, after Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes wordes, namely Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the wyne Chriſtes bloud, rather then otherwy e. Not that I meane any other preſence of Chriſtes body. then a preſence of
<pb facs="tcp:6725:82"/>
grace, a preſence to fayth, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſpiritually, &amp; not corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, really, naturally, and carnally, as the Papiſtes do meane. For in ſuch ſort Chriſtes body is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heauen on the right hand of God the father almightye, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our faith in the vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament aſceudeth and receyueth whole Chriſt accordingly.</p>
            <p>Yea, but one wyl ſay, that to cal <note place="margin">An obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</note> the Sacrament on that ſort, is to geue an occaſion of idolatry to the people, which wyll take the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which thei ſee, ſimply for Chriſtes body, as by experience we are well taught, and therfore it were better to call it bread, and ſo leſſe harme ſhould be, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this age.</p>
            <p>In this obiection I aunſwer, that in dede great idolatry is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </gap>n anſwer</note> to and about this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:6725:82"/>
and therfore men ought, as much as they can, to auoyd from occaſioning or contirming it. But in as much as the holy Ghoſt is wyſer then man, &amp; had foreſight of the euils that might be, and yet notwithſtanding doth cal it Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes body: I thinke we ſhould do euyl, if we ſhould take vpon vs to reforme his ſpeech. If Miniſters did their duties in Catechiſyng &amp; preaching, then doubtles to call the Sacrament Chriſtes body, &amp; to eſteme it accordingly, cold not geue occaſion to idolatry, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirme it: Therfore wo vnto them that preach not.</p>
            <p>There be two euyls about the Sacraments, which to auoid the holy Ghoſt hath taught vs. For leſt we ſhould wyth the Papiſts thinke Chriſtes bodye preſent in or with the bread really, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:6725:83"/>
and corporally to bee receyued with out bodelye mouth (where ther is no other preſence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body then ſpirituall, and to the fayth) in many places he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth ſtyll the name of bread, as in the epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the tenth and eleuenth chapters. And leſt we ſhould make to lyght of it, making it but a bare ſygne, &amp; no better then common bread, the holy Ghoſt calleth it Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whoſe ſpeech I wiſh we wold follow, and that not onely as wel to auoyd the euyl which is now a daies moſt to be feared co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Sacrament, I meane of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnyng it, as alſo for that no faythfull man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to receyue bread ſimply, but rather, yea altogether to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with Chriſts body and bloud. For els to eate and drinke
<pb facs="tcp:6725:83"/>
(as Paule ſayth) they haue hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their own. The contempt of the Sacrament in the dayes of Kyng <hi>Edward</hi> hath cauſed theſe plagues vpon vs preſentlye, the Lord be mercyful vnto vs, Amen. And thus much for the obiection of eaſlyng the Sacrament by the name of Chriſtes body.</p>
            <p>Why (ſayth one) to call the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <note place="margin">An other obiection of Chriſts preſence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> Chriſtes bodye, and to make none other preſence then by grace or ſpiritualy to faith, which is of things hoped for, &amp; of things which to the bodely ſenſes do not appeare, is to make no preſence at all, or to make hym none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe preſent, then he is in hys woord when it is preached, and therefore what neede wee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament, in as much as by thys doctrine, a man may receiue hym dayly in the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

wel &amp; as much as in the church, in the celebration and vſe of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>To this obiection I firſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that in deede neyther the ſcripture nor Chriſtian faith wyl geue vs leaue to make any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, reall, naturall, corporall, or any ſuch groſſe preſence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes naturall body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment For it is in heauen, and the heauens muſt haue it (as ſayth Peter) tyll Chriſtes commyng to iudgement, except we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the humanity of Chriſt, &amp; the veritye of mans nature in hym. The preſence therfore which we beleue and confeſſe, is ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as reaſon knoweth not, &amp; the world cannot learne, nor any that looketh in this matter with our eyes, or heareth with other eares, then wyththe eares and

Therfore to graunt a preſence to fayth, is not to make no preſence at all but to ſuch as knowe not fayth. And thys the Fathers taught, affirmyng Chryſt to bee preſent by grace, and therefore not onely a ſignification, but alſo an exhibition and geuyng of the grace of Chriſtes body, that is, of lyfe and of the ſeede of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as <hi>Cypriane</hi> wryteth.

but a bare ſigne. Theſe lying lips the Lord wyll deſtroy if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, and with vs beleue and teach the truth, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a food of the ſoule a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fayth, and therfore ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and by ſayth to bee talked of and vederſtanded, whych fayth they want, and therfore they erre ſo groſſely in that they woulde haue ſuch a preſence of Chriſt as is contrary to all the ſcriptures, &amp; to our Chriſtian religion: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by commeth no ſuch commoditie to the receiuer, as by the ſpiritual preſence which we teach, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word do affirm.</p>
            <p>For we teach theſe benefites to be had by the worthy receiuing of this Sacrament, namely that we abyde in Chriſt and Chriſt in vs. Agayne, that we attayne by it a celeſtiall lyfe, or a lyfe wyth
<pb facs="tcp:6725:86"/>
God: more ouer that by fayth and in ſpirite wee receiue not onelye Chriſtes body and vioud, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo whole Chriſt God and man. Beſydes theſe we graunt that by the worthy receiuing of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament, we receiue remiſſion of our ſyns, and confirmation of the newe Teſtament. Laſt of all by worthy receiuing, we get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of incorporation w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt and amongeſt our ſelues whych bee hys members: then whych thinges what more can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Alas, that men conſider no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all how that the coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of Chriſtes body and bloud to the Sacrament, is a ſpirituall thing, and therfore there needes no ſuch carnall preſence as the Papiſtes imagine. Who wyll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye a mans wyfe to bee with her huſband one body and fleſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:6725:87"/>
he be at London, and ſhe at Yorke? But the Papiſtes are carnall men, guided by carnall reaſon onely, or els would they know how that the holye Ghoſt becauſe of our infirmitye vſeth metaphorically the wordes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding, dwelling, eating &amp; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, that the vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able coniunction of Chriſt wyth vs might ſomthing be knowen. God open their eyes to ſee it. And thus much for this.</p>
            <p>Now to that part of the obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſayth, that we teache Chriſt to be none otherwyſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament then in his word, I would that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectors would wel conſider what a preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt is in his word. I remember that ſayut <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth how that Chriſtes body is receiued ſometime viſibly, and
<pb facs="tcp:6725:87"/>
ſometime inuiſibly. The viſible receypt hee calleth that whych is by the Sacrament: the inuiſible receypt hee calleth that which by the exerciſe of our fayth with our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues we receiue. And <hi>S. Hierom</hi> in the third booke vpon <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi> affirmeth that we are fed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body of Chriſt, and we drinke his bloud not onely in myſterye, but alſo in knowledge of bolye ſcripture. Wherein he playnlye ſheweth that the ſame meate is offered in the words of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is offered in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſo that no leſſe is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes bodye and bloud offered by the ſcriptures, then by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes. Upon the 147. <hi>Pſalme</hi> he writeth alſo, that though theſe wordes, <hi>He that careth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud,</hi> may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in miſtery, yet he ſaith it
<pb facs="tcp:6725:88"/>
is more true to take Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and his bloud for the word of the ſcriptures, and the doctrine of God. Yea vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Pſalme he ſayth playnly, that Chriſtes fleſh &amp; bloud is poured into our eares by hearing the word, and therefore great is the perill if we yeld to other cogitations whileſt we hear it. And therfore, I trow, <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that it is no les peryll to heare Gods word neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, then ſo to vſe the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But hereof may no man gather, that therefore it needeth not to receiue the Sacrament, or to affirme that a man maye as much by himſelfe, mediating the word in the field, receiue Chriſts body, as in the Church in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right vſe of the Sacrament. For Chriſt ordayneth nothing in vayne or ſuperfluouſly, he ordayneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:6725:88"/>
wherof we haue not nede. Although his authoritye is ſuch that without anye queſtonyng hys ordinances are to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>Agayne, though in the fielde a man may receiue Chriſtes body by faith in the meditation of the word, yet deny I that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth ordinarely receyue Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely meditation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes death, or hearing of hys word, with ſo much ſight and by ſuch ſenſible aſſurance) whereof God knoweth our infirmity hath no ſmall neede) as by the receipt of the ſacrament, not that Chriſt is not ſo muche preſent in hys woord preached, as he is in or with his ſacrament: but becauſe there are in the perception of the Sacrament more wyndowes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for Chriſt to enter into vs, then by hys woord preached or
<pb facs="tcp:6725:89"/>
heard. For there, I meane in the word, he har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an entraunce into out harts but onely by the eares, through the voyce and ſound of the wordes: but here in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament he hath an enterance by all our ſenſes, by our eyes, by our noſe, by our taſte, &amp; by our hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling alſo. And therefore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament full well may be called, ſeeable, ſenſible, taſtable, &amp; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wordes. As therfore when many windowes be opened in an houſe the more lyght may come in, then when ther is but one ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned: euen ſo by the perception of the Sacraments a chryſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s conſcience hath more helpe to receiue Chriſt, then ſimply by the word preached, heard or medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therfore he thinketh the Apoſtle ful wel calleth the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes obſignations or ſealings

of Gods promiſe. Reade <hi>Roma.</hi> the. 4. of Circumciſion. And thus much for the aunſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n aforeſayd.</p>
            <p>Now to returne from whence we came, namely to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſecond thing what the Sacrament is: I haue told you that it is not ſimply bread &amp; wyne, but rather Chriſtes body, ſo called of Chriſt, and ſo to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eſtemed of vs. But here let vs marke what body &amp; what bloud Chriſt called it.

The Supper of the Lord then is not ſimply Chriſtes body and bloud, but Chriſtes body broken and hys bloud ſhed. Wherefore broken? Wherfore ſhed? Forſeth that tencheth Chriſt himſelfe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Broken for you, Shed for your ſyns, and for the ſyns of many.</hi> Here now then we haue occaſion in the vſe of the Sacrament to call to mynd the greatnes and greuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſyn, which could not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by any other meanes then by the ſheding of the moſt precious bloud, and breaking of the moſt pure bodye of the onely begotten Sonne of God Ieſus Chriſt, by whom all things were made, all thinges are ruled &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned. &amp;c. Who conſidering this geare ſhall not be touched to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? Who in receipt of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, thinking that Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:6725:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſayth to him: <hi>Take, eate, this is my body wyich is broken for thee: This is my bloud which is ſhed for thy ſyns,</hi> can but tremble at the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſnes of his ſins, for the which ſuch a price was payd? If there were no plague at al els to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh man of ſyn, how greuous a thing it is in Gods ſight, ſurely that one were enough. But, alas, how are our hartes bewitched through Sathans ſubtilties &amp; the cuſtome of ſyn, that we make ſyn a thing of nothing. God open our eyes in tyme, and geue vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which we ſee this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth, as it were, enforce vs vnto in the reuerence and true vſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Againe, in hearing that thys which we take and eate is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body broken for our ſyns, &amp; his bloud ſhed for our iniquities,
<pb facs="tcp:6725:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me are occaſioned to call to mynd the infinite greatnes of Gods mercy and truth, and of Chriſtes loue towardes vs. For what a mercy is this, that God would for man, beyng loſt through hys wylfull ſinnes, be content, yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to geue hys owne onelye ſonne, <hi>The image of his ſubſtaunce, the brightnes of his glory,</hi> being in his own boſome, to be made man for vs, that we me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by him might be, as it were, made Gods? What a mercy is this, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould ſo tender vs, that hee would make this hys ſonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coequal with him in diuinity, a mortall man for vs, that we might be made immortal by him What a kindnes is thys, that the almighty Lord ſhould ſend to vs his enemies, hys deare darlyng to be made poore, that we by him

might be made ritch? What bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was this, that the omnipotent Creator of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth would delyuer his own onely beloued ſonne for vs creatures, to be not onely fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones, that we myght by hym through the holy Ghoſt be made one with him, and ſo wyth the Father by communicatyng the merites of his fleſh, that is righteouſnes, holynes, innocency, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: but alſo to be a ſtayne ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our ſyns, to ſatiſfy his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to conuert or turue death in to lyfe, our ſyn into righteouſnes, hell into heauen, miſery into fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitye for vs?

vs our ſtate which we ſhall haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in hys comming we ſhall be lyke vnto hym. Oh wonderfull mercy of God, whych would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this his Chriſt, euen in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body into the heauens, to take and keepe ther poſſeſſion for vs, to leade our captiuity captiue, to appeare before hym alwayes praying for vs, to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne of Iuſtice a throne of mercy, the ſeate of glory a ſeate of grace, ſo that with boldnes we may come and appeare before God to aſke and finde grace in tyme conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.

Who would doubt hereafter of any thing that
<pb facs="tcp:6725:93"/>
he hath promiſed? And as for Chriſtes loue, oh whoſe hart can be able to thinke of it any thing as it deſerueth? He beyng God wold become ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he beyng ritch would become poore: he beyng Lord of all the world, became a ſeruaunt to vs all: he being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, would become mortall, myſerable, and faſt of all Gods curſes, yea euen of hell it ſeife for vs. His bloud was nothyng to deare, hys lyfe he nothing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to bryng vs from death to lyfe. But thys hys loue needeth more harty waying, then many wordes ſpeaking, and therefore I omit and leaue it to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. So that in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this ſupper, as I would you wold tremble at Gods wrath for ſyn, ſo would I haue you to couple to that terrour and feare,
<pb facs="tcp:6725:93"/>
true fayth, by which ye myght be aſſured lye perſwaded of Gods mercy towardes you, &amp; Chriſtes loue, though al thinges els prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the contrary.</p>
            <p>Do euery of you ſurely thinke when you heare theſe wordes. <hi>Take, eate, this is my body broken for your ſynnes: Drinke, this is my bloud ſhed for your ſyns,</hi> that God the eternal father embracing you, Chriſt calleth and cleppeth you moſt louingly, makyng himſelfe one with you, and you one wyth hym, and one wyth another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt your ſelues: You ought no leſſe to be certayne now that God loueth you, pardoneth your ſyns, and that Chriſt is all yours, then if you dyd heare an Angell out of heauen ſpeakyng ſo vnto you. And therefore reioyce and be glad, and make thys Supper
<pb facs="tcp:6725:94"/>
               <hi>Eutharichiam,</hi> a thankeſ geuing, as the Fathers named it. Be no leſſe certaine that Chriſt and you now are all one, then you are certayne the bread and wyne is one wyth your nature and ſubſtaunce, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue eaten and dronken it. Howbeit in thys it differeth, that you by fayth are, as it were, chaunged into Chriſt, and not Chriſt into you, as the bread is: for by fayth he dwelleth in vs &amp; we in hym. God geue vs fayth in the vſe of this Sacrament to receyue Chriſt, as he geueth vs handes to receiue the element, ſymbole, and viſible Sacrament, God graunt vs not to prepare our teeth and belly (as <hi>S, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſayth) but rather of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he prepare and geue vs true and lyuely fayth to vſe thys and all other his ordinances to his

            </p>
            <p>Now let vs come and looke on <note place="margin">wherfore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment was inſtituted.</note> the third and laſt thing, namely wherefore the Lord did inſtitute this Sacrament. Our nature is very obliuious of God and of all his benefites. And agayne, it is very full of dubitation and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Gods loue &amp; of his kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Therefore to the end theſe two thinges might be ſomething reformed and holpen in vs, the Lord hath inſtitute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I meane that wee myght haue in memory the principal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of all benefites, that is, Chriſtes death, &amp; that we might be on all partes aſſured of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, of all kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:6725:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the greateſt that euer God dyd geue vnto man. The former to be the end wherfore Chriſt did inſtitute this Sacrament, he him ſelfe doth teache vs, ſaying: <hi>Do ye this in remembraunce of me.</hi> The latter the Apoſtle doth uo ieſſe ſet forth in ſaying: <hi>The bread whih we brake, is it not the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or communion of the body of Chriſt? Is not the cup of bleſſyng which we bleſſe, the partaking or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the bloud of Chriſt?</hi> So that it appeareth the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Sacrament was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, was and is for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion and helpe of our obliuion of that which wee ſhould neuer forget, and of our dubitation of that wherof we ought to be moſt certayne.</p>
            <p>Concerning the former, namely of the memory of Chriſtes deare
<pb facs="tcp:6725:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity it bringeth with it, I wyl purpoſely for times ſake omit. Onely a lirle wyll I ſpeake of the commodities co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto vs by the partaking and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we haue with Chriſt, Firſt it teacheth vs that no man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municate wyth Chryſt, but the ſame muſt needes communicate with Gods grace &amp; fauour, wher thorow ſyns are forgeuen. Ther fore this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorow, namely that we ſhould ve certaine of the remiſſion &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſynnes. The which thing we may alſo perceue by the cup, in that it is called the cup of the new Teſtament: to whych Teſtament is properly attributed on Gods behalfe obliuion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſyns. Firſt I ſay therefore the ſupper is inſtituted to this ende, that he which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely
<pb facs="tcp:6725:96"/>
receiueth, ſhould be certaine of the remiſſion &amp; pardon of hys ſyns and iniquities, how many and great ſoeuer they be. Now great a benefit this is, onely they know which haue felt the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſyn, which of all heauy thinges is the moſt heauye. Agayne, no man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body and bloud, but the ſame muſt communicate with his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite for Chriſtes body is no dead carcaſe.
