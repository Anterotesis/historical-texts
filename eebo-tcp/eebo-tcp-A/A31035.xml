            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have here presented you with the Works
of Mr. <hi>James Barozzio</hi> of <hi>Vignola</hi>
in English, who for his great Skill and
knowledge in the Art of <hi>Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
is much respected, and highly
applauded among all Artificers throughout
<hi>Christendome,</hi> there being few Nations of any note,
that have not his works translated into their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
onely we here in <hi>England</hi> (I know not whether it
be through carelesness in Artists, or else covetousness)
mind not those things which make other Countries (that
have nothing else to boast of) so famous among their
Neighbours: Certain I am that <hi>England</hi> breeds as good
wits as other Lands do, and would they but shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more forward in commendable Studies, would
doubtless share with them in their Praises.</p>
            <p>Our Author first collected these things together for his
own private use: and by the solicitations of many Persons
of Worth and Honour, did at last (though unwillingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to make the World for a small price partakers of
that which cost him so much labour, study and travel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105060:3"/>
And whereas former Authors left their Works
uncertain, or at least doubtfull to all but their own
Nations, in respect of the several measures they
used; as some the Fathom, some the Foot, some the
Span, some the Inch of their own particular Country,
which seldome agrees with the Fathom, Foot or Inch of
any other Land; our Author to avoid that great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence,
and certain uncertainty hath reduced all his
measures to a convenient and universal measure, which
is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alled by the name of a <hi>Model:</hi> the invention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hath made the whole Art of <hi>Architecture</hi> very easie
to all Students therein: for it is nothing else but the
half Diamter of the Column at the lower end thereof;
as if the whole Diameter should be 10, 12, 14 or 16
inches, then will the half Diameter be 5, 6, 7, or 8 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and that is called the <hi>Model:</hi> which <hi>Model</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
into 12 equal parts, when he frames the <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Dorick</hi> Order: and into 18 for the <hi>Ionick, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi>
and <hi>Composite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Translation of this Book, I have followed (so
neer as I could) the words of our Author, unless here
and there I have been a little more large, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
the better to express his meaning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the young Practitioner. I confess the Book was
formerly translated by another hand, but it was so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
disliked (indeed not without cause) that I chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to take the pains to translate it a new, than run the
hazzard of discouraging young Artists with those dark
and unproper directions.</p>
            <p>Now for the better instructions of such as desire to
<pb facs="tcp:105060:3"/>
study this pleasant, profitable and commendable Art,
and yet are disheartned by the strange words used there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
I have collected all the hard words together, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you the meaning of them: that so when you find your
self puzzeled with any word of Art, you need but have
recourse to this Alphabetical Table, and find the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

think the sleighter of this Book, meerly because I have
made it plain to common Capacities: But if such will
but look back upon their own younger endeavours, they
may perhaps remember the time when themselves would
have been glad of any help that might have furthered
them in their then-thought tedious and difficult Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Besides, they may also know, that it is easier for
themselves to know the meaning of plain and easie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
than for young Students to understand the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of hard and difficult Instructions.</p>

            <p>BEcause I have not found among the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities

from whence I might frame a Rule, as I
have done in the other Orders, <hi>viz. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
Ionick, Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Composite,</hi> I have made
use of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> his Authority, in his 4th Book
and 7th Chapter: where he saith, The <hi>Tuscan</hi>
Order with <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital</hi> must be 7 times its
thickness: In the rest of the Ornaments, namely,
the <hi>Achitrave Friese</hi> and <hi>Cornice,</hi> I believe that
Rule ought to be followed which I found in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
four Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Architrave Friese</hi>
and <hi>Cornice</hi> must be one fourth part of the <hi>Column</hi>
with <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital,</hi> which is 14 <hi>Models,</hi> as may
be seen in the figure; And therefore the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trave
Friese</hi> and <hi>Cornice</hi> ought to be 3 <hi>Models</hi> and an
half, that being one fourth part of the 14 <hi>Models</hi>

even as in the Ornaments above, the <hi>Architrave,

prove very profitable and delightfull unto your
labour; for being to make any of the five Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
you must divide the height of the Column
with its Ornaments into 19 parts, then take the
height of the Column with its <hi>Basis</hi> and <hi>Capital,</hi>
and make the divisions of the <hi>Models</hi> according
to its Order, <hi>Dorick, Ionick,</hi> &amp;c. then you must

            <p>TO make the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order without a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destal,</hi>
you must divide the whole height
into 20 parts, and one of those parts shall
be the <hi>Model;</hi> which <hi>Model</hi> you must divide
into 12 parts, as in the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Order; The Foot
or Basis, with the nethermost Swathe or Band,
shall be of one <hi>Model;</hi> the height of the Column
between the Base and Capital, shall be 14 <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;</hi>
the Capital 1 <hi>Model,</hi> which added together,
make 16 <hi>Models,</hi> for the height of the Column,
with Base and Capital: Then (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Order) the <hi>Architrave, Friese</hi>
and <hi>Cornice,</hi> must be one fourth part of the
Column with its Base and Capital, as you may
see in the Figure: where the <hi>Architrave</hi> is 1
<hi>Model,</hi> the <hi>Friese</hi> 1 and a half, and the <hi>Cornice</hi>
1 and an half, which added together, make 4
<hi>Models,</hi> for the height of the <hi>Architrave, Friese</hi>
and <hi>Cornice,</hi> which is one quarter of 16. the
height of the Column with its Base and Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
And if you adde the 4 <hi>Models</hi> for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitrave,

upon the 7th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part upwards, make the Center of the eye of the Scroll,

part, and that Circle shall be the eye of the Scroll, then through the Center
of the Eye draw a straight line, that shall both cut the Cathetus at right
Angles, and divide the Circle into 4 equall parts; then from the points of
Intersection of the straight lines with the Circle, describe a Square within
the Eye, and every side of this square divide into two equall parts, and from
each Division to its Opposite, draw straight lines; then divide each of these
lines from the Center into 3 equal parts, and with figures mark every point
of Division (as in the Draft) with 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. and from this ground-worke
you may with great ease describe the whole Scroll, as followeth.</p>
               <p>First place one foot of your Compasses upon the side of the Square, at the
point 1, and extend the other to the top of the Cathetus, and from thence
describe a Quadrant, which will reach from the top of the Cathetus afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
to the streight line that is perpendicular to the Cathetus: then remove
the one foot of your Compasses to figure 2, and bring the other foot to the
ending of the former Quadrant, and from thence describe another Quadrant,
which shall end at the bottom of the Cathetus: then move your Compasses
again, and place one foot at figure 3, and the other foot where the second
Quadrant ended, and from thence describe another Quadrant: then move
your Compasses to figure 4, and where your last Quadrant ended, describe
another; then move one foot of your Compasses into the point of Division
marked with Figure 5, and fit the other foot to the place where your
last Quadrant ended, and from thence describe another Quadrant; from
thence move to 6, and describe another Quadrant; then to 7; then to 8, &amp;c.</p>

you draw a List about it, you must divide the space between every one of

upon the division that fals next to the Centre of that Arch whose List you
mean to draw, and with the other foot you may describe the Arch that

            <head>XVIII. A Second way to make the Voluta.</head>
            <p>DEscribe the Triangle BCD after this manner. Let the side CD be 7
parts of a Model, then let fall the perpendicular BC upon the point
C, whose length must be 9 parts of a Model, and from the points BD, draw
the other line in the Triangle. Then upon the point C, describe a Circle,
whose half Diameter shall be 1 part of a Model, and this Circle shall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Eye of the Scroll: Then set one foot of your Compasses upon the
point D, and extend the other to the point C, and so describe the Arch EF:
Then divide that Arch EF into 24 equall parts, and from the Centre D,
draw a streight line through every Division of the Arch, and let those
streight lines be prolonged to the perpendicular BC, and where those
streight lines divide the perpendicular BC, there mark every division with
Arithmetical figures, beginning at the top with 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. and so proceed
downwards to 25, and so shall you have a Scale of the perpendicular that
will give you the Center of every arch in the Scroll, as you shall see
hereafter.</p>
            <p>Therefore draw your Cathetus of 16 parts of a Model (as was said before)
and place your Center of the eye of the Scroll upon 7 parts upwards, and
upon that Center describe a Circle, whose half Diameter shall be 1 part of a
Model, and this Circle shall be the Eye of the Scroll: Then draw a streight
line through the Center that shall cut the Cathetus at right Angles; so have
you the Eye divided into 4 equall parts or Quadrants; then divide every
Quadrant into 2 equall parts, and through the two opposite divisions draw
streight lines (which must be continued out to a convenient length, that will
comprehend the bredth of the Scroll in that place) so shall you have the Eye
divided into 8 equall parts; then set the one foot of your Compasses in the
point C of the Triangle, and extend the other to the Division marked 1, and
so transfer that distance to the Scroll, placing one foot at the Center of the
Eye, and the other foot to the top of the Cathetus, and mark that with figure
1; having so done, remove your Compasses to the Scale again, and placing
the one foot in the Center of the Eye, as afore, extend the other to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
marked 2, then remove your Compasses again to the Scroll, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
one foot upon the Center of the Eye, mark where the other foot falls
upon the second line, and there mark: Then remove your Compasses again
to the Scale, as before, and take the distance of number 3 from the Center of
the Eye, and transfer that to the third line of the Scroll, as before, and mark
that with 3. Then remove to the fourth in the Scale, and do as before,
then to the fifth, and so to all the rest till you come to 25, as you may see in
the figure.</p>
            <p>Then to describe the Arches of the Scroll, do thus: Place one foot of your
Compasses upon the point marked 1, and extend the other to the Center of
the Eye; then keeping your first foot of your Compasses at the figure, with
the other foot describe a small occult Arch; then remove the first point of
your Compasses to figure 1, and with the other foot describe another small
Arch, that may intersect the former, and the very point of the Intersection
shall be the Center of the Arch 1, 2. Then setting the one foot of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
to figure 2, upon the second line of the Scroll, extend the other to the
Center of the Eye, and your Compasses being at that distance, describe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
small Arch through the Center of the Eye of the Scroll: Then remove
the first foot of your Compasses to the point 3, upon the third line, and with
the second foot describe another small Arch, that shall cut the former
Arch, and the very point of Intersection shall be the Center of the Arch
2, 3, as you may see in the Figure. Do the like with all the other Figures,
till the whole Scroll is finished.</p>

            <p>THere are divers wayes to lessen Collumns, whereof I have here and in
the following page set down those two which are most esteemed of.
The first and best is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After you know the height and thickness of the
Column, you must divide the Cathetus thereo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into 3 equal parts, and in the
point of the first division upwards, draw a thwart line through the Column,
that shall cut the Cathetus at right Angles, then in the point of Intersection,
set one foot of your Compasses, and extend the other foot to one of the sides
of the Column, or to half the bredth, which is all one, and so describe a
Semi-circle upon the thwart line, then divide half that Semicircle into so
many parts as you please, as into 6, 9, 12, 15, or more, and no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that into
so many parts as you divide the Semi-circle, so many equall parts you must
divide the two upper thirds of the Cathetus into, and upon every Division
draw straight Lines through the Column, that shall cut the Cathetus at right
Angles; then from every point of Division in the Semicircle, draw straight
Lines parallel to the Cathetus, and where these straight lin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s intersect the
Lines drawn athwart the Column, there shall be the severall points that you
must lessen the Column into in every particular place. But you must take
notice, that the Line drawn from the first point of Division in the Sem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>circle,
must intersect the line drawn from the first Division in the Cathetus; and
the second in the Semicircle, the line drawn from the second in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;
the third in the Semi-circle, from the third in the Cathetus, and so
forth; every line drawn from the severall points of Division in the Semi-circle,
must intersect the line drawn from the same number of Divisions in
the Cathetus.</p>
            <p>Having thus drawn one side of the Column, you may by the same Rules
draw the other side also, or else measuring with your Compasses the distance
of every point of lessening from the Cathetus, you need but turn your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sses
about upon the point that stands in the Cathetus, and so transfer the
distance to the other side of the Column.</p>
            <p>This kind of lessening may be used in the Tuscan and Dorick Order,
which Orders are not to be lessened below the nethermost third part of the
Column.</p>

            <head type="sub">Another way to lessen Collumns.</head>
            <p>THis second way of lessening Collumns, our Authour found out by his own study and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and though it be not very common, yet it is easie enough to be understood by the
Figure: Wherefore in the first place, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou must divide the whole Cathetus into 3 equall parts,
and through the first point of Division (counting upwards) you must draw a thwart line, as
CD that shall cut the Cathetus at right Angles, which line must be continued to a convenient
length, as to E, that so it may be intersected by the lines drawn from the divisions in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetus,
as you shall learn hereafter: then divide each of them three equall parts into four equal
parts more, and if you intend to have your Collumn wreathed, divide every one of those four
parts, into four equall parts more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so shall your Cathetus be divided into 48 equal parts:
Then with your Compasses meas<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure the length of the line CD, and carry that length to the top
of the Collumn, placing one foot of your Compasse; in the point A, and noting where the
other foot falls upon the Cathetus, as in the point B, and through these two points draw a
straight line, and continue it till it interlect the line CDE, as here it doth in the point E:
Then from the point E, draw straight lines through every fou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th Di<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ision in the Cathetus, as in
the Figure, or if you lease (for more exactness) through every single division in the Cathetus,
and continue them to the outside of the Collumn: Then keeping your Compasses to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
distance, place one foot upon the point of Intersection of every one of the slope lines with
the Cathetus, and extend the other towards the outside of the Collumn upon the same slope
line; and where the other fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of you<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Compasses falls, there shall be the point of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
lessening in that place. And note that though the former Collumn was lessened but
from one third part upwards, yet this which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for other Orders viz. for the Jonick, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian
and Composite orders, must be lessened from the first third part both upwards and
downwards, as you may see in the Figure; and therefore you must as well draw slope lines
through the Divisions in the nether part of the Cathetus, as through the upper.</p>
            <p>Having thus divided and wrought upr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to the line CDE; then on the Plot or Ground-work, upon the Cathetus, describe a smal
Circle, and divide it into 8 equall parts, and draw lines through the opposite points of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and upon the same Center that you drew this Circle, describe another smaller Circle
within the former, which by the Lines drawn through the Center, will also be divided
into the same parts that the greater Circle is: Then from the points of Division in the small
Circle, draw 4 lines through the Collumn parallel to the Cathetus, and where those lines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect
the thwart line; drawn before, there shall be the several points, through which you must

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng by the Cathetus, as in the figure. But you must note, that at the
four first lines at the bottom and top of the Collumn, the Spiral line must not touch the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Parallel line, but must run as you see in the Figure. Then on the Cathetus most you
measure the thickness of the straight Collumn in every Division, and transfer that thickness
to the same Division in he wreathed Collumn, placing one foot of your Compasses at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section
of the spiral line with the divisions of the Cathetus, and the lines parallel to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
us, and extending the other to the sides of the wreathed Collumn; and where the other

               </gap>ot of your Compasses falls, there shall be the bounds of the sides of the wreathed Collumn
in that place.</p>
            <p>Note, that if you make the little inmost Circle bigger, then will the Collumn be more
wreathed; if less, then will the Collumn be less wreathed.</p>
