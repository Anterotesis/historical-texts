            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſome in reſpect of pittie, and ſome in reſpect of pietie.</p>
            <p>The lines I ſend, are like flowers that be of ſundry ſmells pleaſing and diſpleaſing, according to the diuerſity of mens complexions: if they offend any, I am ſure they bee ſuch as doe know themſelues to bee faultie: perhaps they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe ſome that are accounted to bee worldly wiſe, but not any one at all that is truly reputed to be godly wiſe: and in this cauſe I would not ſticke with <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi> to ſtand to the cenſure of my moſt deprauer <hi>Titus Gracchus.</hi> I haue graſped at abuſe, yet vnder generalities, and haue aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at many matters, whereof ſome not altogether vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: Amongſt ſome others that be more ſerious, I haue mixed meaſurable mirth.

And therfore if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that I write of, fall out to be but of a drowſie diſpoſition, the wonder is not great.

If theſe lines therefore proue to bee any thing, they are better then either ſleep or idleneſſe.</p>
            <p>I haue meant them well; and I hope I ſhall not need with the Painter, that taking vpon him to picture forth the formes of ſundry beaſts, ſo vnperfectly performed them, that he was driuen to write ouer their heads, <hi>This is a Lyon, this is an Elephant, this is an Vnicorne:</hi> but what I haue aimed at, I haue gone ſo neere the marke, that although not leuelling at any mans priuate perſon, yet ſo directly expreſſing the condition of the time, that there is none (I thinke) to contradict it.</p>
            <p>But we are growne ſo wiſe and ſharp-ſighted in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding other mens writings; that thoſe paſſages that are but meant and ſet downe in a generall manner, they will draw to ſuch particular conſtructions, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT which in <hi>England</hi> we doe call the Hue and Crie, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they doe call the <hi>Hubbub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The intent of it was at the firſt, that when any Rebels or Theeues came to doe any robbery in the Countrey, they ſhould then raiſe the Crie (which they call the <hi>Hubbub)</hi> therby to giue notice to the Inhabitants round about, that they might combine and gather themſelues together in a maine ſtrength, either to rerouer any prey that the theeues or Rebells had taken,<note place="margin">The reaſon of the Hubbub.</note> or at the leaſt to make reſiſtance in their owne defence, and as much as in them did lie, to ſaue the Countrey from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoile.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt inſtitution of it, but they will now raiſe the <hi>Hubbub</hi> vpon other ſleight occaſions. If a couple of drunkards doe chance to fall together by the eares. If a man being drunk, or howſoeuer otherwiſe diſtempered, doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſtrike his wife. If a Maſter or Miſtreſſe do but beat a ſeruant that hath well deſerued it, they will raiſe the <hi>Hubbub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe Alarmes and Outcries, we haue ſometimes three or foure in a weeke, and that in <hi>Dublin</hi> it ſelfe, among the baſe and raſcall ſort of people, and as theſe <hi>Hubbubs</hi> are thus raiſed in caſes of anger and diſcontent, ſo they vſe to giue the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29069:5"/>
               <hi>Hubbubs</hi> againe in matters of ſport and merriment. And there is not a people vnder the face of heauen, that will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deride and mocke at any thing that is not in vſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among themſelues, then the Iriſh will doe.</p>
            <p>And as the Iriſh are thus pleaſantly conceited, to ieſt and to ſcoffe when they finde occaſion, ſo they haue as great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie in weeping, as <hi>Stanhurſt</hi> a famous man amongſt them, for his excellent learning; for firſt he was a Chonicler, then a Poet, and after that he profeſſed Alchymie, and now he is become a maſſing Prieſt. This <hi>Stanhurſt</hi> in his hiſtorie of <hi>Ireland,</hi> maketh this report of his Countrey-men: They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the dead corps to the ground, with howling and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous out-cries,<note place="margin">The prouerb of weeping Iriſh.</note> pittifull in appearance, whereof (as he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) grew this Prouerb, <hi>To weep Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ſelfe am partly of his opinion, that (indeed) to weepe Iriſh, is to weepe at pleaſure, without either cauſe or greefe, when it is an vſuall matter amongſt them, vpon the buriall of their dead, to hire a company of women, that for ſome ſmall recompence giuen them, they will follow the corps, and furniſh out the cry (as Maſter <hi>Stanhurſt</hi> hath ſaid) with ſuch howling and barbarous outcries, that hee that ſhould but heare them, and did not know the ceremony, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke they did ſing then weep. Such a brutiſh kinde of lamentation, as in the iudgement of any man that ſhould but heare, and did not know their cuſtome, would thinke it to bee ſome prodigious preſagement, prognoſticating ſome vnluckie or ill ſucceſſe, as they vſe to attribute to the howling of doggs, to the croaking of Rauens, and the ſhrieking of Owles, fitter for Infidels and Barbarians, then to bee in vſe and cuſtome among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And yet in <hi>Dublin</hi> it ſelfe, there is not a corps carried to the buriall, which is not followed with this kinde of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which you ſhall heare by their howling and their hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, but neuer ſee them to ſhed any teares. And from hence I thinke indeed ariſeth the prouerb, <hi>to weep Iriſh.</hi> So that it appeares, how the <hi>Iriſh</hi> haue wit and diſcretion, both to weep when they liſt, and to laugh at their pleaſure.

of their agilitie; yet not to weepe without a cauſe, for that were right to weepe <hi>Iriſh</hi>; but to laugh, and to giue the <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi> when I ſee a cauſe, and neither to forbeare <hi>Iriſh</hi> nor <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</hi> For we daily ſee the pride, the drunkenneſſe, the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the bawdery, the bribery, the popery, all the moſt lewd and idle vices: the beaſtly and diuelliſh faſhions the one doth vſe, the other doth imitate; wherefore then ſhould I not let them ſee themſelues, and their abominations, that ſo they may amend. If not, yet to let the honeſt plaine men view their follies, that ſo he may laugh at their fooleries. Doth not this deſerue the <hi>Hubbub</hi> to ſee vgly vice doth beare the name of ſeemely vertue, and drunkenneſſe reputed good fellowſhip, murther called manhood, lechery named honeſt loue, impudency good audacitie, pride they call de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and wretched miſery they call good husbandry, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie they call ſinceritie, and flattery doth beare the name of eloquence, truth and veritie, and that which in former ages was called flat knauery, paſſeth by the name of wit and policie. If I ſhould weepe for any thing, it ſhould bee for ſome madde conceited greefe: Like the woman, that when her Husband was hanged on the fore-noone, ſhee fell a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the after-noone, and did lament with ſuch vehement ſhewes of ſorrow, that her neighbours comming about her, began to exhort her to patience, telling her that ſhee was not the firſt woman that had had Husband hanged, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the manner of his death was ſomewhat diſgracefull to the world, yet they wiſht her to play a wiſe womans part, and not to take ſuch greefe whereby to hurt her ſelfe for that which could not now be holpen: True, true indeed, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this ſorrowfull woman, it cannot now be holpen, and I would be loath to hurt my ſelfe by playing too much the foole; neither doe I take this greefe <note n="*" place="margin">The old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe.

            <p>But me thinks if our women in this age were but halfe ſo kinde to their husbands as this poore woman ſhewed her ſelfe to be, that woman might weepe with great greefe and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29069:6"/>
anguiſh, that had not her husband hanged, and not onely in a cleane ſhirt on his backe, but likewiſe with a yellow ſtarcht band about his necke. For yellow bands are become ſo common, to euery young giddy-headed Gallant, and light heeld Miſtreſſe, that me thinks a man ſhould not hardly be hanged without a yellow band, a faſhion ſo much in vſe with the vaine fantaſticke fooles of this age, for I neuer ſee, or heard a wiſe man that did vſe this baſe and lewd faſhion.</p>
            <p>The lamentable teares of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> bemoaning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his time, were now out of ſeaſon, who would regard them? I thinke it therefore better to laugh with <hi>Democritus</hi>; for a litle mirth (they ſay) is worth a great deale of ſorrow. But I thinke there be ſome will be angry if they be laughed at; and howſoeuer they incline themſelues to follow the fooles faſhion, yet they will not be mockt. But I will come ouer theſe fellowes with a prouerbe that many yeeres agoe I brought out of <hi>France,</hi> and thus followes the text: <hi>He that will make himſelfe a ſheepe, it is no matter though the Wolues doe eat him:</hi> and why ſhould it not likewiſe follow, <hi>He that will make himſelfe a foole, it is no matter who laughs at him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot thinke that ſince the firſt creation the world euer afforded ſo many monſters of men, nor ſo few modeſt women, as at this preſent age. And he that writes with an vpright conſcience, muſt not flatter: and hee that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the deformed vanities that are euery day hatched vp, and brought to be in faſhion, both in the Court, Citie, and Countrey, as well in England as Ireland, cannot chuſe but laugh. Now if any one be angry at my plaine ſpeeches, I know he wants either wit or honeſtie, and then it ſhall but augment my ſport, and make mee to laugh the faſter: for I am ſure there is no man that is not an enemy to his owne diſcretion, but will thinke I haue ſpoken truth; and there is no good man but will approue what is luſt: for fooles I care not.</p>
            <p>Now for women, I know there be a number as well of old as young, that are both wiſe and vertuous, that knowing themſelues to be free from all detection, will neuer be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with my honeſt meaning: and as I loue and honour

            <p>It is our ſinnes then that haue raiſed the <hi>Hubbub:</hi> the cry is vp, and it is become ſo loud and ſhrill, that it hath pierced the clouds, it hath aſpired the heauens, and it hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the preſence chamber of God.</p>
            <p>What is man that he ſhould be thus prone?

that I am able to terrifie thoſe with my words, that the threatnings pronounced by Gods own mouth cannot make afraid; when our Preachers may cry out till their throats be ſore, denouncing Gods vengeance againſt ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are rather derided than beleeued.</p>

            <p>The world is now too farre ſpent, to looke for either grace or goodneſſe vpon the earth; and the ſinnes of this age are growne ſo proud, that they are paſt all reformation.</p>

            <p>What is become of our ancient bounty in houſe-keeping?

            <p>I will not meddle with the Nobilitie of this age, that are well knowne to be nobly deſcended, as well from ancient as from honourable families, yet there haue been ſome others, that would faine haue runne currant for ſix ſhillings eight pence ſterling, that if they had beene brought to the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, would haue beene found too light by a great deale more then the common allowance of two graines; but if they had beene tried by the Touch, or brought to the Teſt, we might haue ſworne, that all was not gold that did gliſter.</p>
            <p>To be vertuous in this madd age were vaine, when vice is altogether graced; I will raiſe the cry againſt the Courtiers, but if I ſpeake all that is true againſt the Courts of Princes, I ſhall be too tedious in my ſhort ſuruay of abuſes.

And then the Lyons being ſo neere, they roar'd. And then the Beares of Pariſh garden hearing the Lyons, they began to roare. And the Boyes comming to ſee the Beares, they learned. And euer ſince their hath beene a company of Roaring-boyes.</p>

            <p>She that hath born a baſtard to a man of note,<note n="*" place="margin">It is holden a credit, to be a baſtard to a great man of fame and note, as this example ſheweth.</note> ſhe thinks it to bee no blemiſh at all to her reputation; nay, ſhe thinkes the better of her ſelfe. I remember I haue read in a French hiſtory of a Duke of Guyſe, that was well knowen to keepe Monſieur <hi>Granduyles</hi> wife, who was a Gentleman of great eſtate, and likewiſe deſcended from an honourable Family, who after hee was dead, there grew ſome queſtion of his wiues children, whether they were legitimate and begotten by her husband, or baſtards to the Duke of Guiſe, for ſo the moſt of them were ſuppoſed; the eldeſt ſonne proteſted with a vehement oath, that he had rather be accounted the noble Duke of Guyſes baſtard, then to be reputed cuckold <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyles</hi> ſonne, and in this humor hee forſooke his inheritance, and left it to his younger brother.</p>
            <p>Now (of my conſcience) a number of our gallant girles in theſe daies be of the ſame diſpoſition, they had rather be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an harlot to ſome great perſonage, then an honeſt mans wife. And all things conſidered, they are partly to bee excuſed, when ſuch harlots ſhall bee better graced, then the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29069:11"/>
woman that is honeſt, and my Laydy will take her into her owne coach, when Chaſtitie ſhall trudge on foot, and bee ſcoffed at.</p>
            <p>Beauty that is ioyned with honeſty is out of requeſt, who doth regard it? and a man were better to ſlander an honeſt woman, then to ſpeake truth of an harlot.</p>
            <p>We may call a ſcold, a ſcold, and it may paſſe without any great perill: but we cannot call a whore, a whore, but with danger; for if ſhee bee able to put on a ſilken outſide, and to fee a Proctor in the Commiſſaries Court, though ſhee bee a knowne ſtrumpet by the report of all her neighbours, yet we muſt not call her whore, vnleſſe we bee able to bring two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye-witneſſes: and ſhe that is ſo open in her buſineſſe, that ſhee will haue two or three paire of eyes to looke vpon her, is fitter for a cart, then ſhe is for a coach.</p>
            <p>Well, bleſſing of his heart yet, that would ſay, <hi>Thought was free:</hi> and when I ſee a woman haue a painted face, with a powdred periwig, her breaſts laid open, her ſtomacke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, almoſt downe to her nauell, to ſpeake truly, I know not what to thinke; but let her be as honeſt as ſhee liſt, theſe are but like Tauerne ſignes, that are hanged out but to call in cuſtomers, and they are indeede the <hi>Fore-runners of adultery, vice, and villanie.</hi> And if ſhee be honeſt that thus ſetteth her ſelfe to the ſhew, yet it hath beene queſtioned, whether cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie ioyned with vanitie, doth merit anie commendations or nay: but this is without all queſtion, that this ouer-much affected follie doth liue with no leſſe ſuſpected honeſtie: ſhe is but an ill huſwiſe therefore of her owne credit, that will bring it into a vulgar conſtruction: but as the mouth of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath auowed, that <hi>A wiſe married wife is her husbands glory,</hi> ſo it were much better for a mans owne credit, to marry a wiſe harlot, then a fooliſh honeſt woman: A wiſe harlot, that can ſhelter her eſcapes with ſuch discretion, that the world ſhall neither ſee nor wonder at it; then a fooliſh honeſt woman, who although ſhe bee honeſt of her body, yet in her attire and outward ſhew, euery man doth thinke her to be an harlot. Nature hath not ordained all women to bee wiſe, there muſt bee ſome vaine, if it bee but to fit the humors of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29069:11"/>
thoſe men that are no leſſe fond then fooliſh. And as there be in women ſundry kindes of allurements, ſo there be in men as many ſeuerall deſires: for as ſome doe fancie thoſe women that be gawdy and gariſh in their apparell, and therewithall ſo lauiſh of their eyes, words, and geſtures, that they doe promiſe eaſily to be wonne, and doe giue a luſtfull hope to the beholders: ſo another luſteth after her that can ſeaſon her beauty with a ſharpneſſe of wit, and hath Art and skill to hide a thouſand crafts and ſubtleties, vnder a ſmooth tongue.</p>
            <p>Some are ſeene to dote vpon thoſe women, that can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their beauties with coy countenances, and ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words, that hideth not her thoughts, but careleſly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what ſhee thinks.</p>
            <p>But the man that is wiſe, intirely loueth her that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ſober, modeſt, that ſo tempereth her ſelfe in all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, that vertue hath ſeemed to ſettle her ſelfe in her lookes and countenances, and that the graces are there hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together like a pleaſant poſie, compact and made of many flowers, and that of the moſt faire and excellent in the garden: but where in Gods name ſhould a man go ſeeke for ſuch a wife? I thinke in <hi>Moores Eutopia</hi> or in <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> an Iland neuer found.</p>
            <p>Or what is become of that age, when ſimple beauty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any helpe of Painters Art, was beſt beſeeming an honeſt woman? when baſhfull modeſtie incloſed in a womans breſt, was the beſt lure whereby to induce honorable reputation? The Diuell hath here ſet another ſnare to catch Ladies and Gentlewomen, which beſides their coſtly clothes, they muſt not content themſelues with good faces of Gods making, but dainty painted faces, fit for painted Apes: now they do paint with <hi>Indian</hi> excrements, and beſmeare themſelues with <hi>Iewiſh</hi> ſpittle, too baſe and vile to chaſte honeſtie, that I do admire how Ladies and Gentlewomen can affect ſuch loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtuffe. I thinke one were better ſalute the backſide of an honeſt woman, then the artificiall face of one of theſe painted <hi>Iezabels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were then beloued of the wiſe, of the vertuous, of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29069:12"/>
the learned; but now by the vaine, by the lewd, and by thoſe Hermaphrodites that are not worthy the name of men, and therefore to ſpeake truely, not worthy of honeſt wiues.</p>
            <p>Would you know who was the firſt inventers of this pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the face, and breſts? It is ſaid, an old Bawd, whoſe beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly youth procured her a hatefull age, and ſhee reſembling dame vgly, my Lady <hi>Hard-fauors</hi> chamber-maide, ſhee was ouer-ridden and ſurfeted, all the haire of her head fell off, her eyes were ſunke into her head, her noſe dependant long and ſlender downe to her chin, ſhee was mouthed like a Plaice from the one eare to the other, her teeth rotten with ſweet meats, and ſtinking yellow, her face and skin like the outſide of ruſtie old bacon, and ſhee ſpits in her hands to make her moyſt, her body, and leggs ſwelld with the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie as bigg as a mill-poſte: this neat and curious peece of bawdry would needs be made new and freſh againe, like the bloſſomes of May; hir doings and cuſtomers decayed fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhee call'd to counſell three maine pillars of hir houſe, which was Miſtris Whore the younger, Miſtris Fructifier, and Miſtris Tweake the elder, and when they had drunke each one a quart of burnt ſacke, their wits were full ripe; and then ſhee queſtioned with them how hir ſelfe the old May-pole of miſcheife might be repaired, and they invented the Art of woman painting for the face and breſts, which to this day the women of that Trade doe continually vſe, and I am perſwaded not any other, which how beaſtly, odious, and vgly it is, I leaue to all honeſt women to iudge.</p>
            <p>What ſhould a vaine Fantaſticke do with a wiſe woman? No, ſhee that hath her face painted with white and red, ſhee that hath her bands ſtarched with blew and yellow, ſhee that in ſtead of a plume of feathers, can decke his Coxcombe with a paire of hornes, ſhee that can ſympathize with him in his owne folly, ſhee is fit for him, there is neither pot broken, nor water ſpilt betweene them, there will be a good accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, it were pitty the banes ſhould be forbidden.</p>
            <p>We were wont to ſay, it was a wiſe childe that did know the owne father, but now we may ſay, it is a wiſe father that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29069:12"/>
doth know his owne childe. I proteſt, I do not know a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt woman in <hi>England,</hi> nor in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of mine owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, but if we may giue credit to reports, or beleeue what they themſelues doe make ſhew to be by their outward appearance, there were neuer ſo many, and the trade is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be ſo vniuerſall, that they cannot thriue the one by the other; their gettings doe but ſerue to ſhift off the time, till they become to be ſome foure or fiue and thirty yeeres of age, &amp; then if they do not turne Bawd, they muſt either be turned into ſome Hoſpitall, or end the reſt of their life in a Spittle.</p>
            <p>But this plenty of Harlots hath done ſome good in the Common-wealth, it hath much abated the price of Bawdry; for now a whoremonger may haue his pot of Ale, his pipe of Tobacco, and his pocky whore, and all for his three pence, and that almoſt in euery by-Lane. A happy thing for poore Knights, that the market is thus beaten downe; for one of theſe high prizde Harlots, that muſt haue her ſilken gownes, hir guarded petticoates, her embroydered ſmocks, her needle-worke edgings, hir powldred perywigs, and hir coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cates, ſhe is able to vndoe a whole halfe dozen of Knights, one after another.</p>
            <p>She will make him to ſpend his Reuenues, to ſell his land, to diſinherit his poſteritie, and his whole eſtate to be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more doubtfull, and ſtill in danger of burning.</p>
            <p>She will leaue him ſo weake in his purſe, ſo feeble of his body, and ſo rotten in his bones, that the ſoueraignty of his Tobacco will neuer be able to cure him.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell how I ſhould paſſe ouer theſe matters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giuing the <hi>Hubbub:</hi> but let vs now looke into the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell that is vſed, and that as well by men, as by women.</p>
            <p>There is nothing whereby a man may more readily iudge of the inward diſpoſition of the minde, then by the outward ſhew of apparell. Our words, our behauiours, and our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward attires, they are all tongues to proclaime the inward diſpoſition, either of men or women: for there is no doubt but that a phantaſticall attire is a plaine confirmation of a phantaſticke minde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:29069:13"/>But if I had as many mouthes, as <hi>Argus</hi> had eyes, I ſhould yet want words to expreſſe the foolerie of new faſhions, the onely cloke whereby to patronize the franticke humors of this madding age, is the multitude of madde men that doth vſe them, which now by cuſtome are growne ſo familiar, being practiſed by the multitude, that if they were acted but by a few in number, I thinke that if they themſelues did but ſtand by to behold them, they would account them to bee worſe then madde, that did ſo much affect them: but yet in this deformitie of faſhions, it is commonly ſeene, that wiſe-men doe ſometimes follow fooles.</p>
            <p>But of all occupations, I will bleſſe my ſelfe from being a Taylor, eſpecially to any of thoſe of the decayed Order: for when the Taylor hath ſpent his wits to fit him in the new faſhion, which he muſt fetch from France, Flanders, Italy, Spaine, and that he hath ſhewne his skill in cutting, preſſing, printing, racing, garding, and ſtitching, yet he ſweares he hath ſpoild his garment: And I cannot chuſe but laugh, to thinke how the poore Taylor muſt indure to bee call'd Rogue, Raſcall, Foole, Aſſe, Prick-louſe, Botcher, Bungler, and to ſuffer the worſhipfull Knight <hi>Sir Giles Gooſecap,</hi> to rage, to raile, and to ſweare that his garment is marred, hee hath cut it too long, too ſhort, too wide, too ſtreight, and he muſt be contented to indure all, and glad to get him home with his bill in his pocket, not daring to aske his money for a twelue-moneth after. For a womans Taylor, the beſt way to pleaſe my Lady, is to haue ſome intereſt in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maide.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious to ſet downe what meanes hath bin vſed to draw in money for the ſupply of wares, what great ſummes of money haue bin raiſed from the pride and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe that hath bin vſed as well by men, as by women, in their garded garments, their coloured ſilkes, their gold and ſiluer lace, and their ſuch other ſuperfluities: If theſe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were now looked after, I thinke it would draw deepe, when Cloth of Gold is thought too ſimple, vnleſſe it be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with ſome rich imbroydery, either of Gold or Pearle, for otherwiſe, he that his fathers beſt coat was but of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpunne

            <p>Pride is now become the mother of deuotion, for it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a number to Church, that goe thither more to ſhew their brauery, and to ſeeke precedence, then they do to ſerue God. The Sabboth day, which the Almighty himſelf hath commanded eſpecially to be kept holy, that day aboue all the reſt is moſt prophaned, and God is more diſhonoured with this monſtrous ſinne of pride vpon the Sabboth day, then he was when <hi>Lucifer</hi> was firſt depriued from the ioyes of heauen.</p>
            <p>If we keepe our dores ſhut vp during the time of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, we thinke we haue done enough. And there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident care had, (if it were as carefully obſerued) that no Victualler in the time of Diuine Seruice ſhould retaine in his houſe any drinking or diſordred company.</p>
            <p>Doe but now finde me out the Tauerne, the Inne, or the Alehouſe, where God is more diſhonoured on the Sabboth day, then he is in the Church it ſelfe, and then at that very time whileſt the Preacher is in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Looke but vpon the abhominable pride that is there to be ſeene, and thou wilt ſay,<note place="margin">O damned pride a maine ſtep to hell.</note> it is fitter to prophane the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then to doe God honour. The pride of this Age is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then euer it was, both in Nobles, Knights, and Gentlemen, and as well in thoſe that ſhould giue good example, as teach precepts, in high and low, rich and poore, all ſorts, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, are exceſſiuely proud: and as it were in deſpight of Religion, to attire and pranke vp our ſelues in that pompe and exceſſiue pride, as were fitter for a Brothell-houſe, then for the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>I would not be thought to be too generall in my words, for God defend but there ſhould be many good and godly diſpoſed perſons that doe frequent the Church, that are no leſſe zealouſly inclined then godly deuoted: yet hee that ſhould duely conſider of the exceſſe that is vſed in ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vanities, would rather iudge them to be the marks and monuments of a people that neuer heard of God, then to be in vſe and cuſtom amongſt Chriſtians when they be ſeruing of their God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:29069:14"/>We goe to Church indeed vpon the Sabboth, and we ſay it is to ſeeke Chriſt, but it is to ſeeke precedence, to diſpute of dignities, to ſtriue for places, to contend who ſhall goe before, and who ſhall follow after, and therefore to mocke Chriſt rather then to ſeeke him.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is to be ſought in lowlineſſe of heart and humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde: we muſt ſeeke him in feare and trembling, in mourning garments, lamenting and bewayling our ſins: and therefore let thoſe counterfet hypocrites chuſe whether they will be angry or pleaſed, for I will laugh at them, and giue them the <hi>Hubbub</hi> too, that will ſay they goe to ſeeke Chriſt in pride and preſumption.</p>
            <p>We read in the holy Scriptures of three wiſe-men that came to ſeeke Chriſt, (the Papiſts would haue them to bee three Kings) but did they come in my pompe or pride to ſeeke him? It is written, they gaue him gifts, Gold, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, and Myrrh: and this (in the opinion of moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuines) was preordained by God himſelfe to releeue the neceſſitie of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> who were then preſently to flie into Aegypt for the ſafetie of the childe IESVS, whom <hi>Herod</hi> did ſeeke to murder.</p>
            <p>We doe read of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> that came to ſeeke Chriſt, and he was driuen to climbe a Figge tree, but to get a ſight of him: the text ſaith he was rich, but his apparell could not be ſumptuous, that was fit to climbe a tree.</p>
            <p>Wee read againe of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelfe, that for three dayes together had ſought Chriſt, whom in the end ſhee found amongſt the Doctors in the Temple: but doe you thinke ſhe rode all this while in a Coach, that ſhee went thus to ſeeke him?</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelfe came to ſeeke vs when we were loſt, nay when we had loſt ourſelues, and were ſold vnder ſinne: but when he came to ſeeke vs, and to ſaue the world, did he ſhine in ſilke, or gliſter in gold?</p>
            <p>How is this world changed? We cannot now goe to ſeek Chriſt, but we muſt be clad in ſilke, in ſattin, in veluet, in cloth of ſiluer, in cloth of gold. Euery vnworthy Madam, that her mother hath trudged many a mile on foote to goe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29069:14"/>
to market, ſhee cannot now goe to Church but in a Coach, if it be but the length of a Bowling Alley.</p>
            <p>The ſix dayes that God hath left vnto vs to follow our worldly buſineſſes, wee miſ-ſpend them with many foule abuſes; but the Sabboth day, that we reſerue onely to ſhew our pride.</p>
            <p>Thus vnder pretence of going to Church to ſerue God, we goe to Church to mocke God, and our comming home from the Sermon, doth rather ſhew vs to be returned from the celebration of thoſe filthy ceremonies which in the old time were ſolemnized in Rome to the honour of <hi>Flora,</hi> then to come like Chriſtians with any ſigne of repentance, or ſhew in amendment of life. We go to Church as we vſe to take Tobacco, more for cuſtome and good companies ſake, then for any good it doth vs.</p>
            <p>Could we but now marke what paſſe this age of ours is growne vnto: this age of ours, I ſay, that doth make ſo great ſhew to profeſſe Chriſtianitie: we are all now for pride and pleaſure; but let vs take heede, for pleaſure is but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of miſery and paine, and pride that hath depriued the Angels from the ioyes of heauen, is now growne ſo ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſhe muſt haue her ſwindge, ſhe will not be reproued.</p>
            <p>Vertue cannot indure to be pent vp in the mindes either of men or women, that doe ſo far exceed and ſuper abound in vanities.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe things that our Anceſtors did euer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue as notes whereby to know a harlot, there was none more ſpeciall then the gawdy and gariſh garments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salomon</hi> againe he ſetteth downe the bold audacious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be a bird of the ſame wing; then what ſhall we ſay to her that carries all theſe marks about her, that is both light and vaine in her apparell, and that is both impudent and ſhameleſſe in her demeanor: this woman hath loſt her eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſhe hath nothing to ſhew for her honeſty.</p>
            <p>There is mention made of a Canon, whereby it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that if a woman had paſſed through the ſtreets atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a harlot, howſoeuer ſhee had bin wronged by any man, or violently aſſailed, ſhe ſhould haue had no aduantage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29069:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt him by Law. But if that Canon were now in force, our ſtreets would neuer be without great quarrels; for their damnable new invented faſhions do ſhew themſelues to be no leſſe then monſters. Mee thinks it were good therefore, and as well for men as for women, to determine with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues how they would be accounted, and ſo to ſute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their apparell accordingly.</p>
            <p>Let men ſhew themſelues to be like men, that doe now ſhew themſelues like women, to looke like Maid-marrian in a Morris-dance, fitter for a Sempſters ſhop, then to fight for a Countrey.</p>
            <p>Our nicitie hath brought into obliuion, the examples left vnto vs by our anceſtors, they vſed none of this tricking, and this trimming vp of themſelues, this frizling of haire, this curling of lockes, this ſtarching with blew, with yellow, and with all the colours in the Rainebow, their beſt painting ſtuffe was duſt well tempered with ſweat, the true monument of Trauell, of Labour, of Induſtry, and of Action.</p>
            <p>Now for women, ſhe that powders her Periwigs, ſhe that paints hir face, ſhe that layes open hir breaſts, ſhe that beſpots her ſelfe with patches, and layes her ſelfe naked ſhamefull to thinke on, ſhe that diſguiſeth and deformeth hir ſelfe euery day with new faſhions, if this woman be honeſt, wherefore ſhould ſhe doe theſe things, vnleſſe of purpoſe, becauſe ſhee would be thought to be a harlot, but if the woman that doth thus diſguiſe her ſelfe doth not want a litle honeſty, I am ſure ſhee wants a great deale of wit.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their excuſe is, if we ſhould not follow the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none would regard vs: So they goe to hell for faſhions ſake they care not.</note>Theſe vanities of vanities, what are they elſe but the traps and traines of hell? and whilſt the body is thus pranked vp in pride, the poore ſoule goes thred bare, and being made play-fellow with the bodies wantonneſſe, ſhe neuer feeleth her owne euill, but that euill only which the body indureth.</p>
            <p>But alas how few are there now left to tell the vpright and plaine dealing of our Anceſtors, what care they had of the common good, how prouident they were to reforme theſe ouer-exceeding vanities; but how few are there now that would either harken or regard it, or would either preſident or follow their examples?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:29069:15"/>Or what ſhall become of after ages? What example of goodneſſe ſhall we leaue to our poſteritie? The younger ſort can but learne by tradition, what they receiue by example from their Elders: and what can they heare or ſee either at home or abroad, that is not altogether vaine and vnlawfull? And beſides the forwardneſſe of their owne natures which ſtill are ready to all impiety: they haue within doores the examples of their Parents to encourage them, that do think the readieſt way to preferre their children (but eſpecially their daughters) is to bring them vp in inſolency and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent boldneſſe.<note place="margin">We ſildome ſee grapes on thorns</note> And how is it poſſible that the daughter ſhould bee chaſte, that is not able to number her mothers fooleries, nor to caſt a true account of all her vanities, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps of her adulteries.</p>

            <p>But the baſe bruits that doe frequent theſe places, are not worthy the laughing at, I will therefore goe ſeeke out better company.</p>
            <p>There is no feaſtings, no banquettings, no merry mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but if it be not ſolemnized with a company of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſots, that before they be ready to ſay grace after meat, if ſome of them be not carried away drunke to their beds, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29069:16"/>
coſt is but caſt away, it is not worthy to bee called a feaſt. In former ages, they had no conceits whereby to draw on drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, their beſt was, I drinke to you, and I pledge yee; till at length ſome ſhallow witted drunkard found out the Carowſe, which ſhortly after was turned into an hearty draught: but now it is enioyned to the drinking of an health, an inuention of that worth and worthineſſe, as it is pitty, the firſt founder was not hanged, that wee might haue found out his name in the ancient record of the hangmans regiſter.</p>
            <p>The inſtitution in drinking of an Health, is full of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and obſerued by Tradition, as the Papiſts doe their praying to Saints.</p>
            <p>He that beginnes the health, hath his preſcribed orders: firſt vncouering his head, hee takes a full cup in his hand, and ſetling his countenance with a graue aſpect, hee craues for audience: ſilence being once obtained, hee beginnes to breath out the name, peraduenture of ſome Honourable Perſonage, that is worthy of a better regard, then to haue his name polluted at ſo vnfitting a time, amongſt a company of Drunkards: but his health is drunke to, and hee that pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">The Ruffingly order of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king healths, vſed by the ſpendalls of this age.</note> muſt likewiſe off with his cap, kiſſe his fingers, and bowing himſelfe in ſigne of a reuerent acceptance; when the Leader ſees his Follower thus prepared, hee ſoups vp his broath, turnes the bottome of the cup vpward, and in oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his dexteritie, giues the cup a phillip, to make it cry <hi>Twango.</hi> And thus the firſt Scene is acted.</p>
            <p>The cup being newly repleniſhed to the breadth of an haire, he that is the pledger muſt now beginne his part, and thus it goes round thoughout the whole company, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alwayes by a canon ſet downe by the Founder, there muſt be three at the leaſt ſtill vncouered, till the health hath had the full paſſage: which is no ſooner ended, but another begins againe, and hee drinkes an Health to his <hi>Lady of little worth,</hi> or peraduenture to his <hi>lighe heell'd miſtris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe drunken deuices, God is diſhonoured, and that loue which in thoſe drunken fits they pretend to any man to bee deteſted and abhorred; yea, the prayers that a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard maketh vnto God, are rather to be derided, then belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29069:16"/>
but the woman they would ſeeme to honour by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Health, is thereby diſhonoured, diſgraced and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited; for Drunkards are ſildome ſeene to reuerence any woman, either for her vertue, or for her honeſty, but are more apt to ſlander thoſe that neuer deſerued it.</p>
            <p>Let vs a little define Drunkenneſſe. Drunkenneſſe is a vice which ſtirreth vp luſt, greefe, anger and madneſſe, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth the memory, opinion and vnderſtanding, maketh a man the picture of a beaſt, and twice a childe, becauſe hee can neither ſtand nor ſpeake. Drunkenneſſe is the mother of outrages, the matter of fables, the root of crimes, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of vice, the intoxicator of the head, the quelling of the ſenſes, the tempeſt of the tongue, the ſtorme of the body, the ſhipwracke of chaſtitie, loſſe of time, voluntary madneſſe, the filthineſſe of manners, the diſgrace of life the corruption of the Soule; if there were no more to bee ſpoken againſt it, me thinkes this ſhould bee enough to deterre any Chriſtian heart from this beaſtly ſinne.</p>
            <p>I would I had now a chaire with a backe and a ſoft cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, that I might ſit mee downe to laugh at the whore-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: but eſpecially at him that they call <hi>Senex Fornicator,</hi> an old Fiſhmonger, that many yeeres ſince ingroſt the French pox, the which although he ſometimes vſed to vent in ſecret amongſt his friends; yet hee will not ſo disfurniſh himſelfe, but that he will reſerue ſufficient for his owne ſtore, and the rather to conceale his commodity in priuate, and would not haue it to be openly knowen, he ſhelters them vnder ſtrange deuiſed titles; ſometimes he calls them the Gowt, ſometimes the Sciatica, and thus diſguiſing them vnder theſe falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed names, he ſhamefully ſlandreth and belieth the pox.</p>
            <p>There be ſome others yet of a better diſpoſition,<note place="margin">He ſhall not bee accounted a Gentleman, if that he doth not carry this marke of the pox about him, and you ſhall commonly know him, for hee goeth as though he trod on egges, and he neuer rides on a trotting horſe.</note> that doe deteſt this fraudulent manner of dealing, that when they haue made ſome pretty ſhift to get the pox, they do ſet them forth to open ſhew, and finding them to be ſociable, familiar and conuerſant amongſt Knights and Gentlemen, will grace them with a wrought night cap, yet not in any deceitfull manner, whereby to couzen his Maieſties ſubiects, but will ſo lay them open to euerie mans view, that you ſhall ſee their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29069:17"/>
true pictures in diuers parts of the face, but eſpecially at the noſe: he doth not ſo hide them, but you ſhall diſcerne them by his complexion, by his ſnuffling in his ſpeech, his noſe is commonly as flat as a bowling alley, by his very gate as hee paſſeth and repaſſeth by you. If a Dogge doth chance to hit him ouer the ſhinns with his taile, he cries <hi>Oh,</hi> and perhaps, raps out an oath or two.</p>
            <p>You ſhall neuer ſee him play any match at the foot-ball, or to win any wagers at running, or leaping; he may ſomtimes dance the meaſures, but theſe Carrantoes and Scottiſh giggs are out of his element: heere is plaine dealing, and it ſhould ſeeme theſe poxes are honeſtly come by, when they are not hidden, but are thus layd open to euery mans view.</p>
            <p>But ſoft and faire, let mee now pauſe a little, for it ſtands mee vpon to take good heede how I raiſe the crie againſt the Blaſphemer, hee that will ſnarle and ſwagger, as though hee meant to kill the olde one; hee that will rumble out oathes like thunder or canon-ſhot, and will ſometimes burſt into ſuch a vaine of ſwearing, as if hee meant to make the powers of Heauen to ſhake and to tremble. They haue ſuch excuſes for their ſwearing; firſt, it graceth their ſpeech, &amp; is an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their phraſe. Secondly, it is a generall cuſtome, the moſt part vſe it, and few or none refraine it. Thirdly, they doe it from no bad minde, no wicked intent. Laſtly, if they doe ſweare, they are but ſmall oathes, and therefore to bee borne withall; but looke vnto it wicked blaſphemer, if God be not mercifull, thou wilt finde none ſo little but deepe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, none ſo light but heauy enough, none ſo ſmall but great enough to ſend thee downe into hell. Heere you may ſee what theſe damned for ſworne Diuells of hell pretend for their diuelliſh act of ſwearing.</p>
            <p>But I care not if I tell you a hiſtory, which was many yeers agoe written in a ſtrange language, but now lately tranſlated out of Eſſex into Engliſh, and thus it followeth.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29069:17"/>
could prooue himſelfe to be moſt degenerate and declining, aſwell from humanity, as from honeſtie.</p>
            <p>After the death of this well diſpoſed parent, his three ſonnes appointed a day of meeting, to determine of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bequeſt, when comming together, the eldeſt brother in a ſhort <hi>Exordium</hi> deliuered his fathers determination, how hee had diſpoſed his whole eſtate onely to him that could prooue himſelfe the moſt diſhoneſt, the which (ſayd hee) I hope I ſhall neither need to ſpend many words, nor to bring better teſtimony, then what your ſelues doe know, and of your owne conſciences will award in my behalfe.</p>
            <p>To ſpeake then to the purpoſe:<note place="margin">The firſt ſonnes ſpeech.</note> I am well knowen to you both, to be a common whore-maſter, that doe wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline my ſelfe to follow harlots, that doe ſpend, ſquander and conſume my time (day by day, and night after night) my goods, my bodie, my life and my lands, in Brothell-houſes, amongſt Bawds and Harlots, that are the very ſincks of ſinne; yea, all I haue, or euer ſhall bee wotth, ſo dearely doe I loue theſe proſtituted beaſtly queanes, that I cannot ſleep quietly in my bed for thinking of them;<note place="margin">Whores are the Diuells hacknies and let to none but his owne ſeruants.</note> that as <hi>Salomon</hi> hath ſayd, doe carrie death and damnation about them: Theſe be they that I haue ſo dedicated my ſelfe vnto, that neither the feare of God, the ſhame of the world, nor the admonition of friends is able to reſtraine me; whom neither the loue of an honeſt wife, the naturall care of dutifull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor the ſting of a guilty conſcience, can any whit at all mollifie. Tell me now, where ſhall you finde amongſt men a villaine more ſtained and polluted with loathed filthines, or more to be deteſted then is the whore-monger? If any of you two can ſhew your ſelues to be more degenerating from honeſty or humanity, I yeeld vp my right, I make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther claime.</p>
            <p>The ſecond brother being now to ſpeake for himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this manner:</p>
            <p>Brother, I acknowledge all that you haue ſaid to be true,<note place="margin">The ſecond bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeech.</note> and I confeſſe the whoremonger to be a moſt vicious villain amongſt men: but you haue yet ſhot ſhort of the mark you aimed at; for you are not ſo much enclined to follow that

filthy appetite of whoredome and adulterie, but I am as much and more addicted to baſe and beaſtly drunkenneſſe, baſe and beaſtly I may well tearme it,<note place="margin">A Drunkard is beaſt and no man.</note> for there is nothing whereby to diſtinguiſh a man from a beaſt, but the vſe of reaſon: for as man hath his being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo hath a beaſt: man hath ſenſe and feeling, beaſts haue both: man hath life, beaſts haue the like: but man hath the gift of reaſon, the only eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he hath to ſhew that he is a man and not a beaſt. Now a drunkard hath loſt his euidence, for he hath neither the vſe of reaſon, of wit, nor of honeſty; he is fit for no good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, nor godly exerciſe amongſt men; and amongſt beaſts, he is more loathſome and filthy then is a hog, that amongſt beaſts that are filthy, is yet the moſt filthy. Yea, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo pleaſing vnto me as the pot &amp; tobacco-pipe, which makes mee haue a great paunch, my face ſet with rich car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, my noſe pimpled like holly berries, there is no newes ſo welcome, ſo pleaſing, as <hi>Come ſhall we goe drinke,</hi> for a pot of old march-beere and a cup of ſacke, will make my noſe the riper: and this is my delight from day to weeke, and from weekes to yeeres, and heerein I take my whole delight.</p>
            <p>This (I hope) may then ſuffice, that although the whore-maſter be a creature that is moſt to be deteſted and abhorred amongſt men, yet the common drunkard, being a beaſt, and no man, is moſt digreſſing, as well from the bounds of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, as from the rules of honeſty: and therefore as our prouident father hath by his will determined, the inheritance muſt be mine.</p>

               <note place="margin">The third bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeech.</note>Brother whoremaſter, &amp; brother drunkard, I haue heard the allegations that you haue hitherto alledged for your ſelues, and I haue had much adoe to forbeare ſwearing: yet thus farre I concurre with you both, that the whoremonger amongſt men is the moſt vicious, and therefore the moſt to be abhorred and deteſted: and the drunkard I doe thinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be a filthy beaſt, not worthy to beare the name of a man: but if your owne poſitions be good, the inheritance is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29069:18"/>

But brother whoremaſter, you thinke to carry away the prize, becauſe you are the moſt loathed creature amongſt men: And brother drunkard, you thinke to defeat mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are the moſt filthy amongſt beaſts; but I tell you in few words, and a little thing would make mee to ſweare, the right is mine, and I will haue it, that am neither man nor beaſt, but a damned Fiend of hell, a Diuell incarnate,<note place="margin">A Blaſphemer is a limb of the Diuell.</note> accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Gods owne mouth.

            <p>It is I that doe ſet that tongue, which by the right of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be the trumpet to ſound forth the glorie of God, I doe make it the inſtrument to prophane and blaſpheme his holy name; to ſweare by his wounds, and by his bloud, by his heart, by his guts, by his ſide, by his body, by his ſoule.</p>
            <p>Can any Diuell of hell ſhew himſelfe to be more aduerſe? Giue ouer therefore your further claimes, for the inheritance belongeth to me, it is I that am a bondſlaue to the Diuell, a fire brand of hell, a wretch that is moſt accurſed, it is I that am all this, and therefore it is I that muſt inherit.</p>
            <p>Thus farre my Hiſtorie, and I thinke of my conſcience this laſt of the three brethren had the beſt right to that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had bequeſted, for amongſt the ſonnes of men, there is not a more accurſed, then is the blaſphemer.</p>
            <p>But now it is accounted a Gentleman-like humor in him that can ſweare <hi>ex tempore,</hi> for matters of no moment, and they ſay it is a ſigne of courage: but to ſpeake the truth, it is a ſigne that hee is a reprobate wretch, forſaken of God, that doth vſe it: and as his life is deteſtable, ſo his death will bee damnable.</p>
            <p>What ſwearing and forſwearing againe amongſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, amongſt Shop-keepers, and amongſt all manner of Tradeſ-men, in buying, in ſelling, in bargaining, in promiſe-making, and yet what little regard in the keeping of an oath? We ſweare by the liuing Lord, by the power of God, the eternitie of God, the maieſtie of God, the life, the death of God; then we diuide our God, to rend him in ſunder with whole volleyes of oathes, as his heart, his bloud, his fleſh, his

ſides, his wounds, his hands, his nailes, his feet, his toes, and all the parts of his precious body: a wicked impudent age, that any people vnder the face of heauen ſhould dare to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thus to ſweare and forſweare our ſelues, regarding not our oathes, hauing ſtore of Gods iuſt iudgements on ſuch wicked blaſpheming wretches daily ſet before our eyes for examples vnto vs, and wee regard them not, neither amend our ſinfull liues.</p>
            <p>The Turkes and Infidells are more reſpectiue to obſerue an oath that they doe make in the name of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> then we that be Chriſtians, when wee ſweare by the name of the liuing God.</p>
            <p>Our Gallants haue deuiſed ſtrange oathes, moſt fearefull to name, ſuch as were neuer inuented, but by ſome damned forſworne fiend of hell; and when they are at gaming, to heare them thunder forth theſe oathes, would make a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians heart to tremble. Nay, he is thought to be but an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, that will not forge, faine, flatter, ſweare and forſweare for his owne aduantage.</p>
            <p>The breaking of an oath that is made betweene party and party, is accounted to be no periurie: nay, whole millions of oathes that are vowed in the performance of promiſes, that are neuer kept, is accounted no diſhoneſty.</p>
            <p>If mens words, and deeds, and thoughts, did concurre in one, we ſhould vndoe the Lawyers, neither ſhould we need ſo many Scriueners to write obligations.</p>
            <p>I my ſelfe doe know a great number of men in the world, that are called honeſt men, yet I know but a very few (if it were vpon a payment of money) but I had rather take his bond, then his booke-oath.</p>
            <p>An vngracious age of ours this ſame, that if wee forbeare from doing euill, it is more for the feare of puniſhment, then for the loue of vertue.</p>
            <p>Mens honeſties are now meaſured by the Subſidy-book; he that is rich is honeſt, and the more a man doth abound in wealth, ſo much the more he doth exceed, and that as well in honeſty, as in wit.</p>

            <p>We doe looke aſcew at vertue, when vice ſhall be ſaluted with cap and curteſie; and Arts and Sciences muſt now dance attendance, and waite vpon ignorance: and he that cannot ſometimes greaſe a foole with praiſes, may (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture) die wiſe, but neuer wealthy.</p>
            <p>We purchaſe lands, and we build vp houſes with the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Church, with the ſinnes of the people, with the ſweat of other mens browes, with periury, with bribery, with oppreſſion, with extortion: it makes no matter how we get, nor how we liue, when at the time of our death, we may haue an Epitaph, or a Funerall Sermon, when amongſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſinnes that we haue committed, euen ſhamefull to bee ſpoken, yet if we haue done but one good deed be it neuer ſo litle, yet it ſhall be devulgated and extolde in a greater meaſure, then that of <hi>Curtius,</hi> when he offered himſelf into the deuouring gulfe for the ſafety of his Countrey: yet whilſt we liue, we doe make ſhew to haue great regard to our good names, that haue no care at all to our conſciences: We daily ſee the rich Landlord doth grinde the faces of the poore Tenants by cruell oppreſſion, extortion, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruitude: for the poore Tenant muſt be at command, vnder his moſt tyrannous Landlord. This proud deformed wormes-meat, that whores, drinks, playes, ſweares, and ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that conſumes body and ſoule, lands and life, nay hee will vndoe a whole hundred of honeſt poore men, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his deteſted and loathed appetite.

to eat no more fleſh then in his conſcience did exceede the value of three halfe-pence;<note place="margin">The wolfes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the Vſurers are much alike.</note> the Wolfe departing home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, meeting with a ſheepe and a lambe, valued the ſheepe in his conſcience to be worth a penny, and the lambe a halfe-penny, &amp; ſo with a ſafe conſcience he deuoured them both: And he that will liue in this world, and cannot learne of the Wolfe to ſquare out a large conſcience, will neuer grow fat.</p>
            <p>It is but our owne denying or miſdenying, that makes or marres the matter. A ſtrong faith helps all: the leſſon is not new, <hi>Crede quod habes &amp; habes,</hi> the Preiſt taught it long ago to a yong ſcholler that came to borrow his horſe.</p>
            <p>But it is a pretty thing this conſcience, I confeſſe, and it is good for a man to carry about him, when he goes to church; but he that doth vſe it in Faires or Markets, will die a begger, ſayes this wiſe world.</p>

Would you haue a preſident?

Alas (ſaid the Farmer) I do feele the ſmart of it, and am come in this humble manner to beſeech your good will: Why then (ſaid the Iuſtice) you ſee I can bite though I do not barke. I do ſee and feele it (quoth the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29069:20"/>
Farmer) but Sir, if I had a Dogge of that condition, I proteſt I would hang him as ſoone as I came home.</p>
            <p>There be many ſuch curs in the world now in theſe daies, that can both bite and whine, many of them more regarded for the authority they beare, then for any goodneſſe is in them: but I will now giue the <hi>Hubbub</hi> to him that will buy an office: and yet I thinke the buying of an office, and the buying of a dignity are much alike, they are both attained vnto by corruption.

            <p>The time hath bin when he that would ſeeke to buy an office, was thought vnworthy to beare an office, but the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling of offices, and the giuing &amp; taking of bribes, are two pernicious euils: and that Common-wealth may be thought moſt bleſſed, where offices are giuen to the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but not ſold to the rich, that doe ſeeke by their money but to oppreſſe vertue. There is not a more dangerous thing then to put an office into his hand that is both wiſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or to arme him with power &amp; authority that is of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous diſpoſition; the eye of wiſdom, that in former ages would looke into theſe enormities, was very vigilant and carefull to preuent them, and prouided Lawes, whereby to bridle (not onely theſe) but diuers other abuſes, which from time to time were hatched vp.</p>

            <p>There is no Law, be it neuer ſo legitimate or truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, which with wreſted glozes and ſubtle expoſitions they cannot baſtardize.</p>

            <p>There be ſome Lawyers more wiſe then honeſt, they come vp to London with an empty capcaſe, and the Clyent with a full capcaſe, but before the laſt Returne of the Terme, the money is all in the Lawyers capcaſe, and in requitall he ſtuffes the Clyents capcaſe with rotten papers:<note place="margin">HELL a Tauerne neere Weſtminſter Hall.</note> and this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is ſo conuerſant with the Diuell, that euery day he goes to Hell to breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>There be many miracles aſſigned to Saints, that (they ſay) are good for all diſeaſes, they can giue ſight to the blinde, make the deafe to heare, they can reſtore limbs that be crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and make the lame to goe vpright, they be good for Horſe, for Swine, and many other beaſts. And women are not without their ſhee Saints, to whom they doe implore when they would haue children, and for a quick deliuerance when they be in labour.</p>
            <p>They haue Saints to pray to, when they be greeued with a third day ague, when they be pained with the tooth-ach, or when they would be reuenged of their angry husbands.</p>
            <p>They haue Saints, that be good amongſt Poultry, for Chickins when they haue the pip, for Geeſe when they doe fit, to haue a happy ſucceſſe in Goſlings. And to be ſhort, there is no diſeaſe, no ſickneſſe, no greefe, either amongſt men or beaſts, that hath not his Phyſician among the Saints: And this is the cauſe (as may be ſuppoſed) why Phyſicians haue not ſo large commings in as Lawyers: for there is no controuerſie or ſute in Law, be it neuer ſo litle, neuer ſo iuſt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29069:22"/>
neuer ſo honeſt, that hath either Hee-Saint, or Shee-Saint to defend or befrend it: Some will ſay, that it is a ſigne of a licentious Common-wealth, where Lawyers and Phyſicians haue too great imployments; and I thinke indeed, they are moſt happy, that haue leaſt to do with any of them both.</p>
            <p>I will not meddle with our Miniſtery, that I thinke of my conſcience, were neuer more reuerently to be regarded then at this preſent, and that as well for their knowledge, as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet notwithſtanding the ſinceritie of <hi>Hely,</hi> his proud ſonnes deſerued the <hi>Hubbub:</hi> and there is nothing wherein ſome of our Diuines may be ſo much detected, as in giuing ſo much way to their childrens pride.</p>
            <p>I had thought here to haue ended my diſcourſe, and to haue woond vp my merriment with this old percloſe, <hi>And thus I bid you hartily farewell,</hi> the winding vp of euery ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary letter, but as I was dipping my pen to haue taken vp inke, I heard a muttering of mens voices, as they were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the ſtreets, and looking out at a window, I ſaw foure young Roaring Boyes, that (I thinke) were new come from ſome Ordinarie, the one with a coloured feather in his hat; the other I marked well, had a long lowſie locke hung dangling by his eare, like a <hi>Derry Iriſh Glybei:</hi> the third was in a yellow ſtarcht band, that made him to looke as if he had bin troubled with the yellow iaundis: the fourth had a ſhort ſword, like that which we were wont to call an <hi>Ale-houſe Dagger,</hi> and that was truſſed cloſe to his ſide with a ſcarfe; they were all foure in white bootes, and gilt ſpurres, and they were conſulting as they went along, how they might ſpend the afternoone: The one gaue his verdict to go ſee a Play: a ſecond aduiſed rather to goe to Tables or Cards, two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two for a quart or two of ſacke: the third thought it better, that they might goe recreate themſelues a litle in a bawdy houſe: but the fourth ſware a great oath, that if they would go with him, he would bring them to the beſt pipe of Tobacco, that euer came out of the Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>This was the man to whom they all aſſented, the very ſound of <hi>A pipe of Tobacco,</hi> made them all to run, as Swine to the draffe, when they heare the Maide begin to knocke

vpon the end of the Hogs trough. They ſay the Welchmen came all running out of Heauen, when they heard one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gate, crying, <hi>Gaſſe bobby, Gaſſe bobby</hi>; but I thinke our Engliſhmen would run as faſt into Hell, if they did but heare a voice crying out, <hi>A pipe of Tobacco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But away theſe Gentlemen went together, and I began to wonder how a filthy ſtinking Antidote could ſo bewitch men to forget themſelues.</p>
            <p>In former ages, Gentlemen and Knights at their merry meetings were wont to ſpend the time in honeſt recreation; ſometimes in gaming, or other pleaſant ſporting; ſometimes in manly exerciſes, and indeuours of actiuitie; ſometimes in braue diſcourſings, in matters of wit and learning; but how there is no muſick pleaſing, but the pot, and the Tobacco pipe.</p>
            <p>O baſe conditioned time, is wit ſo farre ſpent amongſt Knights and Gentlemen, that they can imploy it to no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indeuours, but to imitate that abuſe, which is ſo common with euery Oſtler, with euery Tapſter, with euery Tinker, with euery Coſtermonger, with euery Horſe-boy: and to conclude, that is in ſuch vſe and cuſtome with euery rogue and raſcall.</p>
            <p>Me thinks the very community ſhould make knowne the vanity: for vertue was neuer knowne yet to be imbraced by the multitude.</p>
            <p>But they will ſay, there are both wiſe and learned, that do vſe to take Tobacco; hey more, there are none will take it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter then ſome Phyſicians, that be accounted moſt learned.</p>
            <p>And there be as wiſe and learned, that could neuer bee brought to meddle with it, and there be many wiſe men, that of my knowledge (for the little good they haue found in it) haue giuen it ouer: And for thoſe Phyſitians that will take Tobacco ſo faſt, they haue (as other men) many faults worſe then that, vnffit for wiſe men to imitate, I will therefore make them no preſident, and Phyſicians are commonly accounted to be ſo much the more learned, that can beſt flatter fooles in their folly. But I haue heard as wiſe, as learned, and as honeſt Phyſicians as any be in <hi>England,</hi> that haue ſaid To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco

            <p>But if the example of greatnes may be a confirmation of matters to make them true or falſe, then I dare confidently prouounce Tobacco to be the moſt vaine and idle toy, that euer was brought into vſe and cuſtome amongſt men, when wee haue a preſident, of him that is not onely moſt great,<note place="margin">Sir, you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for by Tobacco comes red noſes, the onely marke of good fellowes.</note> but is likewiſe moſt wiſe, moſt learned, moſt worthy, moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned; yea, and moſt worthy thus to bee accounted, that hath euermore impugned, detested and abhorred Tobacco.</p>
            <p>Let them then giue ouer to vaunt of their wiſe and learned men, and let them take the folly to themſelues, that like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, can draw poiſon to hurt themſelues, that can bribe their owne wits to flatter their owne follies, that are carried away with the tempeſtuous whirle-windes of their own affections.</p>

            <p>Our ſooty-mouthed Tobacconiſts can candie poyſon, and they doe ſo hugge their owne follies, that they are ready to turne all accidents into arguments, to fit their purpoſe.</p>

            <p>Would you haue an inſtance, for your better confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not yet ſo long ſince this new-found-out foolery of yellow ſtarcht bands were taken vp, but that it is within the compaſſe of our owne memories.</p>

Well honeſt Countrey-women, I bring you good newes: I wiſh you now to looke vnto your ſelues; if euer you intend to bee rich, now is the time: You know Tobacco is in great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; but you ſhall be Marchants, and only for egges:<note place="margin">Marchants for egges.</note> for whereas one pipe of Tobacco will ſuffice three or foure men at once, now ten or twenty egges will hardly ſuffice to ſtarch one of theſe yellow bands: A faſhion that I thinke ſhortly will be as conuerſant amongſt Taylors, Tapſters,<note place="margin">Thoſe that doe follow ſuch idle ridiculous faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, make their Tennants Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders within one twelue-month after their lands comes into their hands.</note> and Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as now they haue brought Tobacco. But a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to diſgrace it, enioyned the Haugman of London to become one of that Fraternitie, and to follow the faſhion; and the better to enable him, he beſtowed of him ſome bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence to pay for his laundry: And who was now ſo briske with a yellow feather in his hat, and a yellow ſtarcht band about his necke, walking in the ſtreets of London, as was maſter Hangman? ſo that my young Maſters, that haue but ſithence fallen into that Trimme, they doe but imitate the Hangmans preſident, the which how ridiculous a matter it is, I will leaue to themſelues to thinke on. All that I haue endeauoured, is but to make good what I haue formerly auowed, <hi>That a Foole will not bee-brought to leaue his Bable,</hi> neither for the ſhame of the world, nor for the loue of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and of my conſcience, if there were yet ſome other Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coculus, that to ſhew his dexterity of wit, would leaue his yellow, and betake himſelfe into greene, red, tawny, or to any other coloured manner of ſtarching, he ſhould haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, that would bring it into a faſhion: this is a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb, <hi>A yellow band and a greene wit.</hi> So that as of theſe yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtarcht bands, I thinke the like of Tobacco, it was firſt brought into England by ſome man of little vertue, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards brought into cuſtome by thoſe of leſſe wit.</p>
            <p>But they ſay Tobacco is phyſicall, it is medicinable, it is precious for all manner of diſeaſes, and they doe attribute more vertue to their Tobacco, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth to his Pope. They ſay it will make a fat man leane, a leane man

Now if the ſoueraignty of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco be ſuch, as theſe men would perſwade, either Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians be Dolts, that doe preſcribe vs ſo many obſeruations, or theſe be notable Fooles that doe thus take it. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that is holden of Tobacco, how precious it is againſt the French pox, may make ſome that doe feele themſelues to be diſtempered, to be the more enclining to it.</p>
            <p>Some other againe that be old Fiſhmongers, and loue to follow the game, doe vſe to fiſh thoſe pooles where they know the pox are eaſily caught, doe therefore take To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, to preuent perills.

But let them be as free from that diſeaſe as they liſt, hee that is ſtill ſucking at the Tobacco-pipe, muſt yet take the imputation vpon him, that doth ſeeme with ſuch diligence to ſeeke out the remedy that is vſed for the cure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:29069:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>But I am not ſo madde to thinke that euery man that doth take Tobacco, doth therefore take it becauſe he feeles himſelfe to be diſeaſed; for then if his Maieſty had an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment but of a ſmall company of men that were health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſound, they would hardly bee found out either in England or in Ireland. But this I thinke, that the greateſt number doth take Tobacco more for matter of cuſtome, then for matter of maladie. Yet one thing I haue noted, (marke it he that liſt) the Tobacconiſt that is obſeruatiue, that preſcribeth himſelfe ſet times and houres to take his To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, at thoſe times and houres by himſelfe prefixed, will ſooner omit his praiers to God, then not performe his owne preſcribed ceremony in taking Tobacco: Hee that ſhould bring one of theſe to the Horſe-market in Smithfield, and there offer him to ſell, he could not warrant him to be ſound of winde and limb, but he muſt paſſe among the lades, that men doe vſe to put away for ſome hidden infirmity.</p>
            <p>Shall I craue your patience now, and but to ſpeake truly, there is not any man that maketh a cuſtome in taking To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, but he hath ſome defect either in body or in minde; for hee that doth not take it for the cure of ſome infirmitie that he feeleth in his body, he hath both a defectiue and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh mind, that is ſo ready euery day to choake himſelfe with an Indian ſmoake, ſo chargeable to his purſe, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either conſtraint, cauſe, or neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Heere I would now craue the cenſure of Diuinitie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this idle vanity, taken with ſuch exceſſe (whereby the bleſſings of God are daily abuſed) be not as hatefull a ſinne, and as much offending God, as either drunkenneſſe or glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie? I dare boldly pronounce, this exceſſiue taking of Tobacco, not only to be fooliſh, but alſo to be vngodly, and therefore to bee deſpiſed, deteſted, and abhorred by men, that be either good or godly: and he that doth vſe it, vnleſſe vpon neceſſity, as hee ſhall bee conſtrained for the curing of ſome griefe or malady, is to be laughed at, and deſerueth the <hi>Hubbub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tobacco is like a Popes Bull, that Papiſts doe thinke to be a good diſcharge of all the ſinnes they can commit, from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29069:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the meaneſt to the maineſt, from the eating of an egge, to the murdering of a King. The Tobacconiſt hath the like conceit of his Trinidado, that he thinketh to be a good <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedeas</hi> for all diſeaſes, from the aching of a tooth, to the French pox. The text that I haue taken in hand is but of ſmoake, and why ſhould I vſe any forcible battery againſt ſo vaine a vapour? but eſpecially to thoſe that haue dedicated themſelues to this idle vanity, that there is no ſequeſtration, that either wit or reaſon can afford, is able to ſeparate.</p>

               <note place="margin">Tobacco is the Heathens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching, and Englands wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vndoing, and by the ſmoake thereof hath dried vp the hand of Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtice ſhe will not doe her duty.</note>I haue formerly ſayd, that the firſt tranſportation of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco into England, was not performed by any man, that was either of worth, or of any great account: So againe, it neuer grew into credit with any wiſe or temperate ſpirits, but (as it were) by an inconſiderate and fooliſh affectation of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, drawne from a people that are Infidells and Aliens to God, truely reputed to bee the verie refuſe of the world.

and vice: to them I ſay; There is no man that doth vſe to take Tobacco, but he muſt take vpon him the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome diſeaſe, or elſe hee muſt acknowledge himſelfe to be a foole: for (beſides the chargeable expences, which drawes deep in his purſe that plies it a pace) who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the vnſauoury taſte, the loathſome ſmell, the vnſeemly ſight, whilſt they are in taking of it, but for the cure of ſome infirmity? And by the rules of Phyſicke, there is no cure to be vſed, but where there is cauſe: Now what hidden vertue a ſmoakie vapour may haue for the curing of all diſeaſes is much to be doubted, or why ſhould we not rather ſuſpect it to bee more hurtfull then helpfull. There needes no other probation but this: It is ſmoake, and I neuer heard that ſmoke was good for any thing, vnleſſe to dry red herring. It is naught in the Kitchin, it is worſe in the Chamber, but for this ſmoake of Tobacco, the hatefulneſſe of the ſmell doth argue the Antipathie it hath againſt Nature: Now if the diſeaſe be but a Cough, a Colde, a Rheume, a Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſome ſuch other like ſlight infimity (as the Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coniſt will acknowledge none that be more loathſome) the medicine then (in euerie wiſe conſideration) is much more noyſome then is the malady. I will not ſay but that Tabac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co may be medicinable for ſome diſeaſes, and men that haue infirmities (if they finde eaſe in it) may take and vſe it as an Apothecaries Drugge: but if all bee diſeaſed that doe vſe to take Tobacco, God help <hi>England,</hi> it is wonderfully infected, and his Maieſtie hath but a few ſubiects that be healthfull in his whole dominions.</p>
            <p>But this exceſſiue and immoderate taking of it without neceſſity, is not onely a ſinne before God, but a great ſhame in the ſight of all good men, and there is no ſinne that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth more bitterly to be reprehended, nor no ſhame that is more to bee mocked and ſcorned. And now to ſpeake truely what it is that maketh mee ſo bitterly to inueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tobacco. If it would pleaſe the Reader aduiſedly to conſider what a maſſe of money is yeerely blowne away in the Tobacco pipe,<note place="margin">It hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the ſum that may bie ſpent in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in one yeere in Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co is ſue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thouſand three hundred ſeuenty fiue pounds, all ſpent in ſmoake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides priuate ſpendings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Gentle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

He that giueth to the poore, putteth out for a large intereſt: God himſelfe ſtands bound as well for the vſe as for the principall. And he that thus lendeth, is ſure to be repayed, not with ten in the hundred, but with a hundred for ten. How happy is he then that is open-handed to giue to the poore? It is a ſmall ſubſtance, that cannot afford ſome pittance, if it be but a mite, and he that can finde out a penny for a pipe of Tobacco, might finde out ſome modicum to giue vnto the poore: and thrice accurſed is that outward brauery, that is not accompanied with ſome inward pitty: and he which ſpendeth all in Tobacco ſhall keepe nothing but rottenneſſe and ſmoake for his money.</p>

            <p>I might ſpeake of ſome other vices, the rather exceeding amongſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by the ill example of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> haue vices enow of their owne, they need no incouragement to ſin, yet <hi>Ireland</hi> for theſe many yeares hath bin the receptacle for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ronnagates, that for their miſ-led liues in <hi>England,</hi> do come running ouer into <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſome for murther, ſome for theft, ſome that haue ſpent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ryot &amp; exceſſe, are driuen ouer for debt, ſome come running ouer with other mens goods, ſome with other mens wines, but a great number now lately, that are more hurtfull then all the reſt, and thoſe be Recuſants.</p>
            <p>And for people that be of theſe diſpoſitions, <hi>Ireland</hi> hath little need to be ſupplied from any place, that is ſo well reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with it owne ſtore, that it is better able to lend to others, then needfull to borrow of any. But amongſt theſe graceleſſe men, there haue bin as vngracious and wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that when by their miſled liues, they haue infamed and made themſelues ſo notorious, that they were become odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all honeſt company in <hi>England,</hi> haue then tranſported themſelues into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they haue ſo inſinuated themſelues amongſt our Ladies and Gentlewomen, and not ſo much with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but moſt eſpecially with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:29069:30"/>
and that amongſt our gayeſt Ladies, by whom they were ſo entertained, graced, and countenanced, that thoſe women that had liued before in good name and fame, and finding themſelues to be but ſlightly regarded, thought it more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to forget their former modeſtie, and for companies ſake to follow the faſhion.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould now ſpeake of the periury of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would goe neere to giue me the <hi>Hubbub,</hi> and to laugh hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily at me, that would ſeeme to find a fault at that, which they doe account to be neither ſinne nor ſhame. And to ſpeake truely, what account ſhould they make of an oath, that haue ſo many Maſſing Preiſts at hand, that will diſpenſe with more oathes in one houre, then a man is able to ſweare in a whole afternoone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Periury, old Ale,</hi> and <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> are three commodities that be of great antiquitie in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but eſpecially amongſt the multitude of thoſe that they call Catholikes: for <hi>Periury</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> are ſo linked and conſorted together, that they are as kinde, and as neere allied as <hi>Drunkenneſſe</hi> and <hi>Lechery,</hi> the one cannot ſtand without the aſſiſtance of the other, they be Coadiutors, not to be ſeparated. A damnable Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion this Popery, that ſtill cryes out, Sweare, forſweare, hold no faith,<note place="margin">What filthy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne Raſcall will not be a Papist, that what euer ſinne he doth may be forgiuen?</note> keep no promiſe, play the Traitor, eat vp thy God, murder thy King, kill, ſtab, poyſon, maſſacre, burne, torture, torment, ſaw in ſunder, blow vp with Gunpowder: what act ſo villanous, ſo diueliſh, or ſo damnable, that a Papiſt will not enterpriſe in the ſeruice of his Pope? But our poore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> haue learned the Colliers Faith, that being examined of his beleefe, anſwered ſtill, <hi>That he beleeued as the Church beleeued,</hi> that could not ſay truely that the Church was, nor knew not any one Article that is beleeued. So they ſay they beleeue at their Fathers beleeued before them; now what beleefe that is I will ſpeake truely: They beleeue the whole ſtory of the Bible, they beleeue that Chriſt was the Sonne of God, that he was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> they beleeue all the miracles whilſt he was vpon earth, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he was crucified vpon the Croſſe, &amp; they beleeue the whole ſtory both of the old and new Teſtaments; but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29069:30"/>
they doe not beleeue that all Chriſt did and ſuffered, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their ſaluation, but that they muſt merit that by their owne good workes, by going on pilgrimage, by praying to Saints, and when they are dead by ſuffering in Purgatory. They doe not beleeue that Chriſt who came of purpoſe to ſaue the world, did perfect the worke he came for, but that he left it to a Maſſing Preiſt, to finiſh that which he himſelfe had but begun.</p>
            <p>So the Papiſts haue a ſtory Faith, but they haue no ſauing Faith, nor no beleefe to do them good: that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath proteſted to be the doctrine of Diuels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. that they imbrace for the doctrine of Faith; we maintaine nothing, but what the Scriptures plainely approue, the Popes thred bare aſſertion is enough for a Papiſt.</p>
            <p>If we alledge Scriptures, they quarrell aſwell with the Tranſlation, as with the Interpretation: if we alledge Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, they aske if the Pope haue allowed them: if we alledge Fathers, if they ſpeake againſt the Pope, they reiect them: but alledge the Popes determinations (though neuer ſo much repugnant to the truth) there they ſticke like reſty Iades, they will not be drawne out of that durty puddle: the ſumme of their Religion conſiſteth in the traſh of vnwritten verities, and the whole dependencie of their Faith, in this onely principle, <hi>That the Pope cannot erre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vnder the pretence of <hi>Peters</hi> keyes, the Pope brings in pick-locks, and leauing to enter by Chriſt that is the doore, he giues his Popelings ſcaling ladders, Bulls of <hi>Scala Coeli,</hi> to ſcale the walls of Heauen, and like a company of theeues, to breake in at by-corners, and not to enter by the doore. Our Popelings of <hi>Ireland</hi> will needs proteſt themſelues to be the Kings louing Scyp-iacks (Subiects I ſhould ſay) but to ſpeak the truth, they are more liker Scyp-iacks then Subiects, that do entertaine and receiue into their houſes, Preiſts, Fryers, Ieſuites, and ſuch other of the Popes vermine, that are well knowne to be the Kings vowed and proteſted enemies: do they not manifeſt themſelues to be reconciled to the Pope, that will obſtinately impugne his Maieſties Lawes? that will not ſubmit with Chriſt to giue Caeſar his due? they may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29069:31"/>
ſometimes in publique ſhew pray for the King, but they are priuily plotting and working for their Pope.</p>
            <p>Well Vertue, I would thou couldeſt now and then be a little cholerick, and not to ſuffer thy clemency to be wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged more then enough, and for theſe diſſembling hypocrites that do preſume too farre, if thou canſt not win their hearts, it were good thou wouldſt rule their tongues.</p>
            <p>Although I haue thus ſpoken of <hi>Ireland</hi> in generall, yet <hi>Ireland</hi> is as al other Countries be, good people amongſt the bad, and his Maieſty hath as louing and as good Subiects of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as any he hath in <hi>England,</hi> or elſe-where: Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe that be good, if there be a number that be hollow hearted, it is no maruell: for neuer ſhall Chriſtian Princes haue loyall Subiects, where Maſſing Preiſts are ſuffered to lurke in their Dominions: And in <hi>Ireland</hi> our Women Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes (for want of Apricocks) do preſerue Preiſts, Friers, and Ieſuites, and keep them in their Cloſets.</p>
            <p>The wiues they for the Popes Cockerels are well enough knowne to be of an excellent ſtraine for breed, where they be well cheriſhed, and much made of. A maſſing Preiſt is ſuch a medicine in a mans houſe that hath a child-bearing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his wife, that where they be retained to lye lydgers, it is ten pound to ten pence oddes, that the good Wife, or Lady, or Gentlewoman (or whatſoere ſhe be) will proue fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, her Husband ſhall want no heires. I will conclude with this caueat to my good freinds: He that will eat egges on Friday, he that will goe to Church on Sunday, he that will ſay his <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> in Engliſh, he that will ſing <hi>Dauids Pſalms</hi> at a Sermon, he that will ſweare to the Kings Supremacie, let him dwell where he will in any part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſhall be ſure to be ill neighboured.</p>
            <p>I haue hitherto ſported at the abuſes of the time, and made my ſelfe merry with the follies of this Age. I might yet ſpeake of many other vanities that deſerue the <hi>Hubbub,</hi> and to be well laughed at; but I will here ſtop and lay a ſtraw, for I know all that I can either doe or ſay is to no purpoſe: I do but make the world mine enemy; for he that ſpeaketh againſt ſinne in this age, either they mocke at him, or they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29069:31"/>
thinke him madde: Euery Drunkard, euery Whoremaſter, euery Blaſphemer, euery Tobacconiſt, euery Idolater, they are angry with him that doth reprooue them. O damnable world! we dare not reprehend ſinne, for offending of thoſe that are but the very ſlaues of ſinne. Wee doe liue as if there were no God, or at leaſt, as if wee had no ſoules to ſaue, and wee are ſo lull'd aſleepe in the cradle of ſecurity, that neither admonition or threatning will ſerue to awaken vs. Wee be like ſicke perſons that are brought ſo weake and feeble, that we can neither ſauour nor diſgeſt any thing that is good.</p>
            <p>Vice which now aboundeth in the greateſt meaſure, wee acknowledge in the leaſt; but the leſſe it is thruſt out, the more it eateth and feſtereth within. A gentle potion worketh but a weake effect in a ſtrong body; and it is with ſinne as it is with ſores, ſome cannot be cured without coraſiues. He is but an vntidy Chyrurgian therefore, that will apply a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſalue to a cankred ſore. We are grown to the very height of all kind of impiety, and ſinne is become to be ſo ſupreme, that it thinketh ſcorne to be reprehended.</p>
            <p>But take this from mee, thou that art ſo farre ſpent, that thou liueſt in voluptuous idleneſſe, and haſt no care of thy ſaluation, thou that cryeſt peace, peace, and haſt God to bee thine enemie, that is the Author of peace, who hath proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med open warre againſt thy pride, againſt thy periury, againſt thy exceſſe, againſt thy vanity, againſt thy briberie, againſt thy couetouſnes; thou that art entred into a league with theſe and many other vices, and haſt broken the truce that was betweene God and thee; thou that haſt no feeling of thy ſinne, but that thou wilt ſtill perſeuer in thine abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, thinke thy ſelfe to be depriued of grace, and take it for a ſigne that thy ſinnes are ripe, and thy confuſion is not farre off, but that Gods vengeance doth wait and attend thee with ſuch plagues and puniſhments, as ſhall make thy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heart to tremble. Hee that hath not the feeling of his ſinnes, muſt feele himſelfe to bee a reprobate ſecluded from Grace and Mercy; for amongſt the manifold mercies of God, there is not a more ſingular mercy, then when hee makes vs to feele our owne faults, whereby we are drawne to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29069:32"/>
repentance, and by repentance brought to mercy. Hee that hath not this feeling, ſhall feele the iudgements of God: for he that feeleth not his mercy, ſhall be ſure to feele his iuſtice.</p>
            <p>And doeſt not thou tremble to thinke of his vengeance? Hee that can wrap vp the heauens like a parchment ſcowle: he that can make the clowds raine downe plagues: hee that can make vs to refraine our meat, our drinke, our ſleepe: he that hath the Heauens, the Earth, the Elements, and all to fight vnder his Banner, is hee not to bee feared? hath hee not plagues in ſtore (thinkeſt thou) and not onely to afflict thee in this world, but in the world to come, to adde the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of an endleſſe and euerlaſting woe?</p>
            <p>I thinke of my conſcience, our Gallants of this age are growne into that humor, they thinke it time enough to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto God when their climactericall yeere is paſt; but if neither the admonitions that are daily giuen vs by godly Preachers, the threatnings denounced againſt ſinne by the holy Scriptures, the loue of God, the feare the Diuell, the ioyes of Heauen, the paines of Hell; if none of theſe can mooue vs to repentance, giue the Diuell his due, for he hath done his deuoure, he hath brought the world to a good paſſe, he may now ſit downe and reſt him, and hee may crie with the Angler: <hi>Hold hooke and line, and all is mine.</hi>

            <p>If <hi>Diana</hi> had not bin fained, ſhee had bin an admirable woman; <hi>and yet,</hi> if ſhee had liued to this Age, ſhee would haue bin laught at for hir niceneſſe.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Acteon</hi> be too buſie with <hi>Diana,</hi> let him looke to his dogges, <hi>for</hi> if they miſtake his head they will feede vpon his carkaſſe.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Cleopater</hi> had not kild her ſelfe for <hi>Anthony,</hi> a woman had neuer bin the wonder of loue.</p>
