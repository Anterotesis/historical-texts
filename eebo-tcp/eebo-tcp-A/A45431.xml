            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CORDIAL
FOR THE
CAVALIERS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy, and Deserving Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the Affairs and traverses of this life, it is a tru Rule (and 'tis a comfortable one) <hi>That He who dischargeth a good
Conscience, hath enough of his Own wherewith to reward Himself, though he receive no compensation from any where else:</hi> The
World knowes, and Envie it self doth acknowledge, That in the late Confusions, (which were of that length
that might have shaken the firmest Spirits in their Loyalty) you have discharg'd a <hi>Good Conscience</hi> three wayes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your <hi>Creator,</hi> towards your <hi>Country,</hi> and towards your <hi>King;</hi> your <hi>Religion</hi> bound you to the One, <hi>Nature</hi> to the
Other, and your <hi>Alleageance</hi> to to the Third; And although Many of you have not yet receiv'd what you expected
for the <hi>two last,</hi> yet touching the <hi>first</hi> (whereunto the other also conduce) you are sure to have such a <hi>Reward</hi> one day,
that will not only be above all <hi>Merit,</hi> but beyond all <hi>Imagination</hi> in the Kingdom of Eternitie.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto that I hold your Condition to be farr from being desperat, but that you may receive Rewards, at
least som Consideration from the other Two, <hi>viz</hi> from your King and Country; For the present Parliament, which
represents your whole Country, being compos'd of so many Wise, and well-weighed Gentlemen (whereof divers
have been <hi>Co-sufferers</hi> with you) will, as it is well hoped, out of a sense thereof, have such reflections upon your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and Services, both Active and Passive, that they will enable his Majestie, whom the Law stiles, <hi>The Fountain
of Honour and Bounty,</hi> and whereof indeed no other <hi>Power</hi> should partake with <hi>Him,</hi> I say it may well be hoped,
that this <hi>Parliament,</hi> before their Recesse, will put his Majestie in a Capacity, and humbly Advise <hi>Him,</hi> if not to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
you, yet to <hi>Relieve</hi> your present wants in such a measure, that the Steed may not starve while the grasse growes.</p>
            <p>You know well that the King hath been among us but a little more then the compasse of one year, And his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> was above seven years (which is an <hi>Age</hi> in our Law) before He could requite those
who stuck to Him not much above twenty months, in making Him Master of the <hi>Flowerdeluces;</hi> You know the
vast debts his Majestie hath payed both by Sea and Land, which yet were not his <hi>own,</hi> nor his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> but of that
accursed usurping <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which exhausted more of the Publick Treasure, then all the Kings of this Land, since
gold and silver were first coind in it; You know He is so shortned, that He hath not yet provided bread for All of
his own House; He is in such a condition, that He cannot give his <hi>Royal Aunt</hi> that treatment which might be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
He hath not wherewith to go his <hi>Progresse:</hi> Consider what vast Expences his <hi>Fleets</hi> at Sea, his <hi>Lifeguard,</hi> with
other Garrisons do stand Him in; As also what debts He drew upon Himself so many years beyond the Seas, for his
necessary subsistence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, whereas some object he hath rewarded <hi>Roundheads,</hi> Truly I believe if a Catalogue were made of those upon
whom he hath conferr'd Honour or Office since his Return, there will be found above twenty <hi>Cavaliers</hi> for one of
any other upon whom he hath set any marks of Favour. 'Tis true, albeit he came not in <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> yet he
could not have come in <hi>without Him</hi> so peaceably, Though some alledge that what the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> did, was not as
much out of a <hi>Love to the King,</hi> as out of a <hi>Hatred</hi> he bore to the <hi>Independent,</hi> who may be said to have us'd the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
as the <hi>Fox</hi> useth to deal with the <hi>Badger,</hi> who having found out his Chamber in the Earth, he so berayeth it, that
the <hi>Badger</hi> comes thither no more, and so the <hi>Fox</hi> makes himself master of the hole.</p>
            <p>Whereas som except against his Majesties lenity, and Indulgence, let Them know that <hi>Mercy is the inseparable Inmate
of a magnanimous breast, and that the noblest way of Revenge is to forget, and scorn injuries;</hi> I have read in Storie, that one thing
which made <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelf of <hi>France</hi> most famous was a Speech which drop'd from Him, when being advis'd by
som of his Counsell to punish such and such as were profess'd Enemies unto <hi>Him</hi> while <hi>He</hi> was <hi>Duke of Orleans, He</hi>
answer'd, <hi>That the King of France doth not use to revenge the injuries of the Duke of Orleans;</hi> No more (with most humble
submission be it spoken) doth <hi>King Charles</hi> resent much the wrongs that were done to <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, Noble Cavaliers, possess your Souls with patience, We have a most Gracious King who is in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
of his yeers, and will live to revvard all in time. In the confus'd medley of mundane affairs, the Proverb often
is verified, <hi>Some have the happ, but some stick still in the gapp,</hi> Some have the fortune of preferment, some not, and 'twill
be so to the worlds end. The <hi>Author</hi> hereof though during the many yeers that he was in prison for his loyaltie,
had 3. sworn over his head in an Office of Credit that hee shold have had <hi>de jure,</hi> yet it nothing discomposeth him,
being more then in hope of a compensation some other vvay.</p>
            <p>And as vve have a <hi>Gracious,</hi> so have vve a <hi>Glorious</hi> King, the most Glorious that ever vvore these three Crovvns, For
all the eyes of Christendom are fix'd upon Him vvith a kind of astonishment and admiration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not only of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom,
but of all the World besides, for 'tis vvritten that the Great Turk should say, <hi>If he were to change his Religion, he
would fall to Worship the God of King</hi> Charles <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>who hath done such miracles for him,</hi> such miracles that no story
can parallel: And certainly, <hi>God Almighty must needs love Him for whom he doth miracles:</hi> vvhich that his Divine Majestie
may continue to do, are the incessant Prayers of</p>
