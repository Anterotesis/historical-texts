         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>To make a perfect man, there is requiſite both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion &amp; Nature. Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we know too looſe: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion alone will ſeeme too hard; ſome for Religion haue I knowne formall, ſtrict; yet haue ſo wanted the pleaſing parts of a good nature, as they haue beene feared, but not loued: for being of a fiery ſpirit, euen ſlender occaſions haue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1966:14"/>
made way to the divulging of their own imperfections: either by too ſeuere a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or elſe by too ſoone ſodaine Contempt: both which make much for the harbouring of hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelues, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them eſteemed either raſh Cenſurers, or angry proud ones: and wee all know, that as Iudgement is neuer ſhot ſuddenly but from a fooles bow; ſo blind Choller broke into expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is the true marke of an intemperate minde; others there yet reſt, whom it tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles much to chatter of their own merits, and they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1966:15"/>
cannot lay an egge, but they muſt cackle, or like the boaſting PHARISEE, trumpet out the report of their owne praiſes: if not out of an affected ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and an ouerweening o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their owne excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; yet for lacke of an humble and diſcret nature, that ſhould cauſe their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation bee buſied at home. And this is that makes the world diſdaine, contemne them: ſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is an arrow with too many feathers: which, we leuelling at the marke, is taken with the wind, and carryed quite
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1966:15"/>
from it. Some againe for nature, I haue found rarely qualified: ennobled with ſuch a mild affability, ſuch a generous ſpirit, and ſuch ſweetneſſe of diſpoſition, and demeanour, that their humble &amp; courteous carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age haue preuailed much in the affection of thoſe with whom they haue had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: yet becauſe they haue wanted Religion (that like a good ſubiect ſhould make an elaborate worke rare) they haue, onely in a ſuperficiall applauſe, wonne the approbation of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady multitude: who loue them more for ſuffering
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1966:16"/>
their rudeneſſe, then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble worth, that's obui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their vndiſcerning Iudgements. But in all this they haue got no reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, no reſpect at all. Thus Religion without Nature (in men meerely naturall) begets a certaine forme of awfull regard: but to them 'tis like a tyrannical Prince, whom the people obey more for feare of an auſtere rebuke, then for any true affection, they beare to his perſon. Now Nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion oft wins loue: and this is like a Maſter too familiar with his ſeruant: that in the beginning gains

loue, but ſhall in the end find contempt: and his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration will be made an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of ill.

               <p>Three things are there which aggrauate a miſerie, and make an euill feeme greater then indeede it is. Inexpectation, Vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, want of Preparation. Inexpectation, when a miſ-hap comes ſuddenly, and vnlooked for: it diſtracteth the minde, and ſcares both the faculties and affections from their due conſultation of remedy: whereas an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill foreſeene is halfe cured, becauſe it giueth warning to prouide for danger. Thus the falling of a houſe is more perillous, than the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1966:18"/>
of a floud: for, while of the former, the hurt is more vnauoydable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon both of the violence, and precipitation: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, through the remiſſenes of comming, is leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, leſſe preiudiciall; there being time, either to auoyd the place, or to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure. If this ſuffice not, think but how odious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would ſhew in a deare friend, from whom we only expected the ſweet embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of loue: the conceit onely is able to kill, like a madde Dogg's biting, that not onely wounds the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but inſaniates the ſoule.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1966:19"/>
Secondly, Vnacquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Familiaritie takes away feare, when matters not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, proue inductions to terror. The firſt time the Fox ſaw the Lyon, hee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him as death: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, hee feared him, but not ſo much: the third time hee grew more bold, and paſſed by him without qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The Imbellicke pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, when hee comes firſt to the field, ſhakes at the report of a Musket: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath rang'd thorow the furie of two or three Battels, he then can feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtand a breach; and dares, vndau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, gaze death
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1966:19"/>
in the face. Thirdly, want of preparation. When the enemie beſiegeth a Citie, not prepared for Warre, there is ſmall hope of euaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none at all to conquer, none to ouercome. How much more hard is the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Graſhopper, then the Piſmire, who before, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſtor'd her Garner, is now able to withſtand a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine? Leſt then, I make my death ſeem more terrible to me, then indeed it is; I will firſt daily expect it: that when it comes, I may not be to ſeeke to entertaine it: if not with ioy, as beeing but fleſh: yet without ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1966:20"/>
as hauing a ſoule. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I will labour to be acquainted with it, often before it come, thinking it may come: ſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I know it better, I ſhal better ſuſtaine it: with leſſe feare, without terror. Thirdly, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, by caſting vp my accounts with God, that all things euen and ſtreight betwixt vs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſhall pleaſe to call for me, I may as willingly lay down my life, as leaue a priſon. Thus ſhall I make my death leſſe dreadfull, and finiſh my life before I dye. He that dyes dayly, ſeldome dyes dijectedly.</p>

A good conſequence makes the premiſes ſo eſteemed of, and a ſweete relliſh at the

Not afflictions; how many did <hi>Iob,</hi> and the Apoſtles wade through with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1966:30"/>
with Content? Theſe he knowes are heere but for a time, tranſient, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany; neither ſhall the Iſraelites liue alwayes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or the trauels of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes: He knowes alſo, the more abundant in ſorrowes heere, the more abundant in ioyes hereafter; His teares ſhall returne in ſmiles, his weepings in a ſtreame of pleaſures. God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence with a niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hand; hee ſhall finde his ioyes as an ouer-flowing Sea; and his glory beyond thought, exuberant. Not Death; for he knowes, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1966:30"/>
wil be his happieſt day; and his bridge, from woe, to glory. Though it bee the wicked mans ſhipwracke, 'tis the good mans putting into harbour: where ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſayles, and caſting Anchor, he returnes his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with aduantage, to the owner; that is, his ſoule to God; leauing the bulke ſtill mored in the Hauen; who is vnrigg'd, but onely to be new built againe, and fitted for an eternall voyage. Had not Chriſtians had this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; how ſhould the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs haue dyed ſo merrily, leaping for ioy, that they were ſo neere their home,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1966:31"/>
and their heauen? dying of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten like <hi>Samſon</hi> among his enemies, more victory at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their end, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Ah peereleſſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance! vnconquerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude! Secondly, in Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. There is no friendſhip like the friendſhip of Faith. Nature, Educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Benefits, cannot all together, tye ſo ſtrong as this. Chriſtianitie knits more ſure, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble. This makes a knot, that <hi>Alexander</hi> cannot cut. For as grace in her ſelfe, is farre aboue nature; ſo likewiſe is ſhe, in her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: and therefore vnites, in a far more durable bond.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1966:31"/>
And a Chriſtian, though he would reſolue with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to deale double; yet if he be ſincere, in ſpight of his reſolution, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will rate him, checke him, and deny him to doe it; nay, though he would, he cannot reſolue. He that is borne of God, ſinnes not; and the Spirit of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue vpon ill. This is that Fidelity that wee finde, and admire in many, that haue choſen rather to embrace the flame, &amp; dye in ſilence, then to reueale their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and Brethren in Chriſt. Tyrants ſhal ſooner

want inuention for tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then they with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be made treacherous. The League that heauen hath made, hell wants power to breake. Who can ſeparate the coniunctions of the Deitie? Againe, as well in reproofe, as in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doth his loue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. For howſoeuer hee conceales his friends faults, from the eye of the world; yet hee affectionately tels him of them, in priuate: not without ſome ſorrow on his owne part, for his brothers fall. He ſcornes to be ſo baſe as to flatter: and he hates to bee ſo curriſh as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1966:32"/>
to bite. In his reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he mingles Oyle and Vineger: hee is in them, plaine, and louing. Inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable amitie! Inualuable loue! Heere is met Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conſtancy; one to withſtand an Enemie, an other to entertaine a friend. Giue me any foe, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a reſolued Chriſtian: no friend, vnleſſe a man truely honeſt. A father is a ready treaſurie; a brother an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible comfort; but a friend is both.</p>

the cold zeale of poſteritie. Examples are the beſt and moſt laſting lectures; vertue the beſt example. Happie man that hath done theſe things in ſincerity; Time ſhall not outliue his worth: He liues truely after death, whoſe pious actions are his pillars of remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: though his fleſh moulders to droſſe in the graue, yet is his happineſſe in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall growth: no day but addes ſome graines to his heape of glory.

On the contrary, what a wofull courſe hath he runne, that hath liued lewdly, and dyes without repentance? his example infects others, and they ſpread it abroad to more; like a man that dyes on the plague, he leaues the infection to a whole Citie: So that euen the ſinnes of thouſands, hee muſt giue an account for.

I loue not that life which makes death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. I haue ſin enough of my owne, to ſigh, and ſorrow, and mourne for: I need not make others mine by my owne bad actions.

               <p>Wee ſee in the Moone a threefold condition, her Wane, her Increaſe, her Full: all which, I liuely ſee reſembled in a Chriſtian, three cauſes working them: Sinne, Repentance, Faith. Sinne; vvhich after the act, vvhen he once conſiders, it makes him like the Moone in her Wane, or ſtate of Decrement, obſcuring, and

diminiſhing that glorious light of the ſpirit, vvhich vvhilome ſhined ſo bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him: nay, ſometimes as the Moone in her lateſt ſtate of Diminution, hee ſeemes quite gone, reſting for a time like a man in a trance, like a tree in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or as fire buried in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing Embers, vvithout either ſence, or ſhew, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light, or heat. But then comes Repentance, and caſts water in his face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewes him vvith teares, rubbes vp his benummed ſoule; that there is to bee ſeene ſome tokens, both of life, and Recouery: This
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1966:53"/>

But laſtly, Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, and perfects vvhat Repentance beganne, and could not finiſh: ſhe cheeres vp his drooping hopes, brings him againe to his wonted ſolace, ſpreads out his leaues, blowes vp his fainting fire to a bright flame: makes him like the Moone in her full glory, indues him with a plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Yet in all theſe, while hee liues heere, hee is ſubiect to change: ſometime like a Beacon on a Hill, he is ſeen a farre off, and to all: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time like a Candle in a houſe, neerer hand, and only to his familiars: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a Lampe vnder a buſhel, he is obſcur'd to all; yet in all he burnes: though

               <p>I ſee, liberty makes licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and where the reines are giuen too looſely, the affections run wildely on, without a guide, to ruine: For mans will without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that ſhould adde li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, is like a blind horſe, without a bridle, that ſhould guide him aright: he may goe faſt, but runnes to his own ouerthrow, and while hee mends his pace, he haſtens to his owne miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Nothing makes vs more wretched, then our owne vncontrolled wils. A looſe will fulfilled, is the

way to worke out a woe. For beſides this folly in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning wrong, the greateſt danger is in continuance: when like a Bowle running down a hill, he is euer moſt violent, when hee growes neereſt his Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter &amp; period of his aime.

If his delights

would giue him leiſure, to meditate a little on this, he might be ſo much himſelf, as to know how his time poſteth: But letting it paſſe, as a thing vnthought of, his end ſteales on him, vnlook't for, vnwelcome, vnawares: and all thoſe voluptuous merriments, wherein in his life-time, he imbathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: now ſeeme as a day that is paſt, whoſe Sunne declin'd at noone.

Hee that takes vpon him what hee cannot doe, rides a horſe which he cannot rule; he can neither ſit in ſafety, nor alight when he would. In whatſoeuer I vndertake, I vvill firſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1966:165"/>
my ſelfe; next the thing that I goe about: being to ſeeke in the former, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceede well; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, I ſhall know the other the better; if not the particulars, I may caſt it in the general; ſomething vnſeene, we muſt leaue to a ſodaine diſcretion, either to order, or auoyde. 'Tis not for man to ſee the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, further then nature and probabilities of reaſon lead him. Though wee know not what will bee, 'tis good wee prepare for that which may be: we ſhall brooke a checke the eaſier, while wee thought on't,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1966:166"/>
though wee did not expect it. But if knowing both aright, I find my ſelfe vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe it; I vvill rather deſiſt from begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, then run vpon ſhame in the ſequell. I had better keepe my ſelfe and ſhip at home; then carry her to ſea, and not know how to guide her.</p>

               <p>Euery Vice makes the owner odious; but <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> more then any beſide. Pride hath no friend: His thoughts ſet his worth aboue himſelfe, all others vnder it. Hee thinks nothing ſo diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as want of reuerence, and familiaritie. There is a kinde of diſdaining ſcorne writ in his brow, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; wherein all may reade, I am too good for thy company. So 'tis iuſt all ſhould deſpiſe him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee contemneth all. Hee that hath firſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1966:168"/>
himſelfe, ſhall after be vnder-valued by others; which his arrogancie thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vniuſt, ſhall ſwell him to anger, ſo make him more hatefull. Pride is euer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentiue: It both occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions more then any, and makes more, then it doth occaſion. As Humilitie is the way to get loue and quietneſſe: ſo is Pride the cauſe both of Hatred, and Warre. Hee hath angred others, and others will vex him. No man ſhall heare more ill of himſelfe, then he that thinkes he deſerues moſt good. It was a iuſt quip of that wiſe <hi>King,</hi> to

that proud <hi>Phyſician,</hi> who writing thus, <hi>Menecrates Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Regi Ageſilao ſalutem;</hi> was anſwered thus, <hi>Rex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus, Menecrati ſanitatem</hi> indeed he might well wiſh his wits to him, that was ſo vnwiſe as to thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe God. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when hee ſaw a youth proudly ſurueying himſelfe, did iuſtly <hi>wiſh to be as he thought himſelfe; but to haue his enemies ſuch, as hee was.</hi> I dare boldly ſay, neuer proud perſon was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. For as nothing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites more, then a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall exchange of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo there is nothing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1966:169"/>
hinders the knot of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip more, then apparant neglect of courteſies. Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty is a Curre of the ſame litter. 'Tis natures good care of her ſelfe, that warnes vs from the denne of this Monſter. Who will euer conuerſe with him, that he hath ſeene deuoure another before him? A Tyrant may rule while hee hath power to compell; but when he hath loſt that, the hatred hee hath got, ſhall ſlay him. Who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to heare yong <hi>Cato</hi> aske his Schoolemaſter, how <hi>Silla</hi> liu'd ſo long, when hee was ſo hated for
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1966:170"/>

And ſure if any man tooke the courſe for't, hee did; when hee bade his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners <hi>ſo ſtrike, as they might feele that they were a dying.</hi> Hee that makes cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie his delight, ſhall bee ſure to haue hate his beſt recompence. Deteſtation waites vpon vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: who would not helpe to kill the Beaſt, that ſucks the bloud of the Fould? What hath made ſome

Nations ſo odious as theſe two; Pride, and Cruelty? The proud man will haue no friend; and the cruell man ſhall haue none. Who are more miſerable then they that want company? I pitie their eſtate, but loue it not. Were I Lord of the whole Globe, and muſt liue alone, I had vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe enough to make my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands my trouble. The one turn'd <hi>Angels</hi> out of Heauen; the other, <hi>Monarks</hi> from their thrones: both, I am ſure, are able to turne vs to hell: it is better being a beaſt, then a dying man, with either vnpardoned.</p>

In agreeing diſpoſitions, the firſt is certaine; in thoſe that are not, the latter is euident. The firſt is the eaſier loue; the other the more worthy.

               <p>What wee either deſire, or feare, wee are eaſily drawne to beleeue. Tell the prodigal, his Kinſman's dead ſhould leaue him an eſtate to ſwagger with, hee'le quickly giue credit to 't. The mother of a ſicke infant, if ſhee but heares death whiſper'd, ſhe is confident her childe is gone: either of them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the minde beyond her ſelfe, and leaue her open to inconueniencies. How many haue ſhortened their dayes, by ſudden falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1966:172"/>
that haue been help'd forward, by one of theſe two; or elſe ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered their mindes, as they haue made way for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to bee wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by flatterie, by ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? In the one, Nature is couetous for her owne good; ſo dilates her ſelfe, &amp; as it were ſtretcheth out the armes of her ſoule, to embrace that, which ſhee hath an opinion may plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her: and this is in all ſenſitiue creatures; though I know the deſire of onely rationall, and intelligible things, is peculiar to Man: who by vertue of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1966:173"/>
ſoule, is made deſirous of things incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall, and immortall. Thus hee that would bee vvell ſpoken of, beleeues him, that falſely tels him ſo. In the other, Nature is proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for her owne ſafety; ſo all the ſpirits ſhrinke in to guard the heart, as the moſt noble part: whereby the exteriour parts, beeing left without moiſture, the haire is ſometimes ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly turned gray: the heart thus contracted, and wrought vpon, by it ſelfe; more eaſily then, admits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, that is brought her by the outward ſenſes.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1966:173"/>
Thus if the miſerable Man heares a fire hath beene in the towne where his houſe is, he cryes vndone, though his owne were neuer in danger. In either of theſe, how might perſwaſion worke, and betray vs? What nature hath infuſed, I cannot caſt out; correct I may. If I muſt deſire, and feare, I will doe it ſo moderately, as my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reaſon may bee ſtill cleere. If vnawares I be ouertaken, I will yet be carefull to conceale my ſelfe: ſo though my owne paſſions bee ouer-ſtrong; others ſhall not ſee them,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1966:174"/>
to take mee at aduantages. As many haue been ſpoiled by being ſoothed, in their plauſible deſires: ſo haue many beene abuſed, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malleated, in their troubleſome feare.</p>
