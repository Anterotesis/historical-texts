            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Strange and Terrible Nevvs from Sea. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>'TIs generally known what exceeding rough and tempestuous Weather we have had of late; and I preſume few parts of <hi> England</hi> have eſcaped the Notice. I wiſh all may have avoided the harms of that prodigious Storm that happened on Fryday the <hi> 18th,</hi> inſtant, about three a clock in the morning: at <hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> it was very ſurpriſing and dreadful, coming with ſo ſudden and impetuous a violence like a Hurriance, that it generally affrighted people, making many leap out of their Beds in aſtoniſhment, as if Dooms-day had been at hand, to inform themſelves better of this unexpected occaſion of terror; it being followed with ſuch an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Volly of Hail, that the like has hardly been known in our Age; and ſeveral of the Watch-men have aſſur'd me, That divers of the Hail-ſtones at their firſt deſcent were very little inferiour to Pidgeons (nay, ſome ſay Pullets) Eggs in Magnitude; The Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151764:3"/>
that proceeded, was very conſiderable here, but nothing ſo extraordinary as in parts remote, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at Sea, of it's ſtrange and lamentable effects there; we have one very remarkable inſtance, faithfully Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from a Gentleman on Board, as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>ON <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt we ſail'd to <hi>Cows,</hi> the wind coming up at Weſt, we caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor there, intending to take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the firſt fair wind, but it continued not only contrary, but alſo extream high bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and outragious, and on <hi>Thurſday</hi> a prodigious mixture of ſo much Rain, Hail, Wind, Thunder, and Lightning, as if the Element had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in civil Wars, and <hi>Factious Meteors</hi> had took a ſolemn league to depoſe the Sun, and huddle the World into it's primitive Chaos of Darkneſs, Confuſion and Horror: but this was ſtill but a ſuitable Prologue to a more diſmal tragedy; for behold! about three a clock on <hi>Fryday</hi> morning, <hi>(the very time of the mighty ſtorm at</hi> London) there brake a Clap of thunder ſo dreadful into our Ship, that we all Imagin'd one of our Guns had caſually took fire, and went off, but were ſoon taken off
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151764:3"/>
from that Imagination, when we perceived the hideous flaſhes of lightning which acccompanied it: ſo dreadfully as if all the Planets deſcending from their Orbs had with United fires ſet the Hemiſphere into a general and continued Blaze; Nor was the terror of the ſight all the effect it had upon us, but in a moment it ſplit our main maſt, as eaſily as you would peal a ruſh, from the very top to the bottom in the Hold: Nor did other parts of our tackle ſpeed much better: for our main top-maſt was ſhivered into ſmall peices, and the pendent at the Main-top-maſt-head burned to Aſhes, but what was ſtill more ſad: it beat down by its violent impetuoſity Fourteen men upon the deck, and had like to have hurl'd ſeveral into the Sea, nay it caſt dovvn three that vvere betvveen the Decks: for its force was ſo great, and with all its operation ſo ſubtile, being as it were a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous body that nothing could withſtand it.</p>
                  <p>On theſe poor men that had the ill fortune to be hurt by it: Five of them for a conſiderable time after were taken for dead, having no Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of life left: for there was not the leaſt Perception of Breath or Pulſe, and both thei<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Eyes and Teeth were Immovable, and yet had no viſible wound, bruiſe, or hurt about them, but ſtunck ſo extreamly of Sulpher (or Brimſtone) that we could hardly endure to go near them. In this deſperate condition they continued half an hour or thereabouts: But at laſt by rubbing them, forſing open their mouth, and pouring down ſpirits and other reſtoritive Cordials, we recover'd them to ſome operations of Vitality, &amp; do hope to preſerve all their lives, but they are ſo ſtrangely Crazed in their ſenſes that 'tis feared they will ſcarce ever enjoy the exerciſe of their reaſon and underſtandings ſo fully as formerly.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, there are 6 more that are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly burn'd through their cloaths, <hi>I mean their fleſh</hi> ſcorch'd, and yet their garments not conſumed, nor ſo much as ſing'd as far as we can perceive; their Skin is much diſcoloured, and looks as it were burnt to a Coal, but the doctor does not doubt to cure them perfectly. By reaſon of this diſaſterous Accident, we are forc'd to return to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> for reparation, &amp;c.</p>

may perceive the wonderful ſtrange force of Lightning, how ſtrong it is, and how penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how ſudden in its Approach, how terrible in its Execution.
