         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of our Celebrating the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Day
of his Sacred Majeſty, in our
City of <hi>Bath,</hi> which was as followeth.
<hi>Viz.</hi> The firſt on-ſet was at the Houſe of God,
by the Bells.</p>
            <p>The next by Drums beating and Armed men in
three Companies; the firſt the Trained Band, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

Gibbs;</hi> the third a Volunteer Company of ſixty men
out of his Majeſties Loyal and much ſuffering Pariſh
of <hi>Weſton,</hi> commanded by their Loyal Captain,
Captain <hi>Iohn Sheppard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſtanding in order, made a Lane for theſe
Perſons following, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Firſt, the <hi>Maior,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his high Loyalty, and expreſſed himſelf with
much alacrity for the great honour which he lately
received from his Majeſtie in kiſſing his Royal hand,
and his acquitting him of ſome Aſperſions lately caſt
upon him. He with the <hi>Aldermen</hi> in Scarlet
Gowns; our Loyal, Faithfull and Learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Mr. <hi>Iames Maſters;</hi> the Common Council,
and other Officers in black Gowns, according to
Order, with many other Loyal Perſons, went to
our great Church, and entring into the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
were received by the Foot Companies with
<hi>God ſave the King,</hi> they expreſſing themſelves, with
<hi>Life and all</hi> to ſerve his Majeſtie. The <hi>Maior</hi> and
his Company taking their places in the Church, the
Trained Bands keeping their ſtations, Mrs. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreſs,</hi>
the <hi>Aldermens</hi> Wives, with many other
Gentlewomen enter the Churchyard, before whom
marched about <hi>Four hundred Virgins,</hi> moſt in white
Waſtcoats and green Petticoats, going two and
two, each two bearing aloft upon their hands
gilded Crowns, Crowns made of Flowers, and
Wreathes made of Laurel mixed with Tulips,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169383:3"/>
which I think were thoſe Lillies of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

like one of theſe.</hi> Theſe uſhered Mrs. <hi>Maioreſſe</hi> to
her ſeat in the Church, and were uſhered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by two young Champions, with Swords
drawn, all crying out, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Church till Sermon was ended, which
was preached by our Learned Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> the
Text taken out of <hi>Matthew</hi> 22. and <hi>ver.</hi> 21. The
Sermon, if not put in Print, willl be much wrong
to his Majeſty, and all his Subjects; wherefore you
may doe good ſervice, if you will deſire his Majeſty
to command Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> to put it in Print. The
Sermon ended, Maſter Mayor, his Company, with
the Foot Soldiers, marched to the Conduit, there
being preſented out of the Conduit with a Health
to the King in Wine, which they all drank; the loud
Muſick plaid before them. From thence they went
to the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and there drank another Health
to the King, at which time there were four Stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
bearing the Kings Armes, and the Royal <hi>Oak</hi>
mounted upon the four Pinacles of the Hall. All this
while Mrs. Mayoreſs was not idle; for ſhe, her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
her Amazons and their Champions, marched
to the Conduit, and from thence to the Mayors
houſe, as he himſelf had led the way with his Train,
who gave him a Volley of ſhot, as they had done
before when he came out of the Church, this laſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169383:4"/>
receiving much honour by the addition of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer
Troops of that moſt Loyal Knight Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Baſſet.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> entred his houſe, whom
Mrs. <hi>Maioreſſe</hi> followed with all her Maiden guards,
to all whom was given Cake and Wine, drinking
a Health to the King upon their Knees, which was
begun by Mr <hi>Mayor</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Mayoreſs.</hi> After which
the <hi>Mayor</hi> and his Company marched before the
Souldiers through all the City, rendring Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Ioy. In like manner did Mrs. <hi>Mayoreſſe</hi>
with her Female Royalliſts. And thus was the
whole day ſpent, and that with as much alacrity, as
I think can ſcarce be parallel'd. The night being
come, ſome houres were ſpent in Fire-works, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which each Loyal Soul betook himſelf to his
home, whom the Muſick of the Bells brought
to quiet reſt.</p>
            <p>And thus ended this joyfull day, for which I ſhall
dayly pray to the Almighty to continue us thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hearts, and that his Sacred Majeſtie may have
a long and proſperous Reign, that his Friends
may dayly increaſe, and all his Enemies may be
confounded, concluding with the words of our
Loyal Miniſter, <hi>God ſave the King, and let all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſay Amen.</hi> Theſe ſhall be the never ceaſing
