            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHy I tell thee, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> I heard

               <p>No, no; He was too <hi>Fierce,</hi> and <hi>Fiery,</hi> for a
<hi>Divine:</hi> By his laying about him so, and his <hi>Bug-Words,</hi>
a Man would rather have taken him for a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>There's a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Physick</hi> or two, that I know,

               <p>I have observ'd something of a Convulsion in

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>Did'st thou ever take notice of a <hi>Vizor,</hi> with a
a kind of <hi>Liver-colour Vernish</hi> yonder, at a <hi>Glasse Shop</hi>
by <hi>Exeter Change?</hi> The <hi>Mouth,</hi> (if you mark it) is cut
a little higher then Ordinary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>Now thou mind'st me of it, 'Tis the very Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

the <hi>Graces</hi> of his <hi>Mind;</hi> the <hi>Sweetnesse</hi> of his <hi>Motions,</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true <hi>Zekiel:</hi> for the Man is <hi>Tall,</hi> and
<hi>Slender;</hi> and every thing that he <hi>says,</hi> or <hi>does,</hi> comes
from him with so <hi>Pretty</hi> an <hi>Obliging Ayre.</hi> But let us
come now to the Point: What did he say?</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49921:3"/>
               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>He said flat and Plain, that <hi>Crack-fart</hi> was a

and that a <hi>Pillory</hi> was too good for him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>Why This is no more then the Common Talk

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>And let me tell thee as a Secret, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the
<hi>same People</hi> carry'd the <hi>same Humour</hi> about the <hi>Town,</hi> as
well as the <hi>same Words.</hi> There's a <hi>short, Trub, fat, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
in a <hi>white Perrywig,</hi> (his Father, as I take it, was
a <hi>Commitee man.</hi>) There happen'd one of <hi>L' Estrange</hi>
his Pamphlets to ly in his way, and you might see his
Indignation come up his Gullet, as plainly, as if a
<hi>Snake</hi> were fetching up a <hi>Toad</hi> again. Thou canst not
think how I dote upon this Honest man, for his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to our Interest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>There's another, that they call the <hi>Coffee Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi>
upon my credit, he lays it on to some Tune too.
I heard him speak <hi>bloody words</hi> t'other day; and he was
as well <hi>Seconded</hi> by one that is lately come over from
the <hi>Profession</hi> of an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> to the <hi>Practise</hi> of it, who
is an excellent Man too in his Generation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee <hi>Ephraim</hi> let's have no more <hi>Riddles.</hi>
Thou mean'st the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> I suppose, according to
the <hi>Letter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>But what do ye think then of the <hi>Poetical
Joyner?</hi> He that Rhim'd so plaguily upon the <hi>Judges</hi>
and the <hi>Juries,</hi> about <hi>Gascoyn,</hi> and <hi>Wakeman?</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, now you speak of a Man indeed: If you
had but heard him, how he whipp'd up two or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49921:4"/>
three Blades t'other day, of the <hi>Arbitrary way,</hi> upon
the War of <hi>Forty One,</hi> you'd have said he had been
a <hi>Teazer, indeed.</hi> He told them to their very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that the Parliament men of those days were
the bravest <hi>Patriots</hi> that ever <hi>England</hi> bred; that
they fought for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject;</hi> and in
one word exalted them to the skyes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come; Let it suffice, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
was There himself, and a great many Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
besides; And no Room for any other Discourse
then <hi>L' Estrange</hi> and <hi>Tong, Celiers</hi> and <hi>L' Estrange.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>Why Really to give him his Due, the <hi>Doctor</hi>
seem'd to be much for <hi>Moderation:</hi> One was down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
for the <hi>Gallows:</hi> Another would have brought it
down to <hi>Pebbles,</hi> and <hi>Rotten Eggs;</hi> But the Doctor
himself, being more inclin'd to <hi>Mercy,</hi> was willing
to content himself with a <hi>Touch</hi> at the <hi>Carts Arse.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee <hi>Zekiel</hi> let us keep close to the Subject,
now we are upon it: for some way or other, This
Varlet must be Confounded.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, That's a thing absolutely Resolved, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim;</hi>

be call'd in, to his Assistance, as a fit person to direct
him in This Affayr. But This poynt <hi>Ephraim</hi> was not
followed so close as it might have been. And then

               <p>To say the Truth, <hi>Zekiel,</hi> we were a little out
in our Measures, at Both Ends. <hi>First,</hi> we let it run too
long, without any sort of <hi>Personal Application</hi> to
<hi>L' Estrange. Secondly,</hi> we struck too soon at <hi>Last.</hi> For
who knows, but that with <hi>Art,</hi> and a little longer
<hi>Patience</hi> he might have been prevayl'd upon, in the

               <p>A Person <hi>(says he)</hi> having visited Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> in
<hi>Newgate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> deliver'd him a Paper, Contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a Discovery of the whole Contrivance against Dr.

concerned in it; and that upon Notice of its being likely
to be Discover'd, Mr. <hi>L' Estrange</hi> sent a Letter to Mr.
<hi>Tonge,</hi> to Remove all the Papers out of his Lodgings,
to Mr. <hi>Ely's.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now if This was not a <hi>Considerable Service,</hi> the
sending of <hi>This Person</hi> to <hi>Newgate;</hi> and the <hi>Publishing</hi> of
<hi>This Report,</hi> which was the <hi>Foundation</hi> of All the <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Aspersions</hi> upon <hi>L' Estrange:</hi> I am no <hi>Master</hi> of my

               <p>Your <hi>Will</hi> was <hi>Good</hi> no doubt on't, <hi>Zekiel;</hi>
And so was your <hi>Design:</hi> you made use of <hi>Proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi>
too, and gave <hi>Birth</hi> to a very <hi>Serviceable Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:</hi>
But what needed you have given that <hi>Blind
Intimation</hi> of a <hi>Quidam:</hi> a certain <hi>Nameless Person</hi> that
first broch'd the <hi>Story?</hi> It makes it look like a <hi>Practice;</hi>
whereas one <hi>bold Touch</hi> to have made it a <hi>discovery</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an <hi>Examination</hi> from <hi>Above,</hi> would have <hi>hit the
Bird in the Eye.</hi> And then <hi>L' Estranges Letter</hi> to <hi>Tong,</hi>
and the <hi>Removal</hi> of his <hi>Papers</hi> to <hi>Mr. Elys,</hi> (to be plain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49921:6"/>
with ye <hi>Zekiel</hi>) was e'en a <hi>Silly Invention:</hi> for any
man might foresee, that once in <hi>Eight and Forty Hours,</hi>
the <hi>Abuse</hi> would be <hi>detected;</hi> (as effectually it was.)
And if the people had not been very kind to us, the
<hi>Manifest Falsity</hi> of Those <hi>Particulars,</hi> might have <hi>haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded</hi>
the <hi>Credit</hi> of all the <hi>Rest.</hi>

               <p>This was <hi>Gays</hi> fault, and not <hi>Mine:</hi> for That

he like a <hi>Coxcomb,</hi> goes and disperses it here in the

               </p>
               <p>But what do ye think now of <hi>My device,</hi> that was
Clapt in upon the Back of <hi>Prance</hi> his <hi>Narative,</hi> by way
of <hi>Post-script?</hi> You have seen't I'm sure; 'Twas Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for <hi>Langly Curtis</hi> upon <hi>Lud-Gate Hill:</hi> and came out
<hi>October. 1st.</hi> The man you must know, is as True as

winding up his <hi>Nose,</hi> and shewing his <hi>Teeth</hi> at every

<hi>This Paper</hi> had not Stept in, to <hi>Relieve</hi> ye.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Cellier, (says he)</hi> mentioning the said Mr. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange</hi>
very familiarly; and pretending then to send her
Imps, <hi>Grange,</hi> and <hi>Sing</hi> up and down to him; tho' for
all her vain boasting, it cannot (I think) be imagin'd,
that so worthy a Gentleman and so much a Protestant as
he has shown himself by his late Learned Pamphlets; and
one that is, (as I am told) a Justice of the Peace, would
have any Correspondence with such a notorious <hi>Popish

Here's a Spark now that would passe the <hi>Ordeal,</hi>

and a <hi>Correspondence</hi> entertain'd betwixt them, even to
the <hi>naming</hi> of the very <hi>Mercuries</hi> that convey'd the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence;</hi>
you will finde in the <hi>Context,</hi> that it is all

                     </gap>dible Hearsay;</hi> and to tell you
as a Friend, the Small Officer you wot of, had a
great hand in the Advice; And then so soon as ever
he had <hi>Bespatter'd</hi> him with <hi>Calumnies,</hi> hardly ever to be
<hi>repaired,</hi> do but see how delicately the Rogue makes it

               <p>But how comes <hi>Curtis</hi> to have such an Interest

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zek.</speaker>
               <p>There's a Mystery in That, my Friend <hi>Ephraim.
First,</hi> upon an Order for a Prosecution at Law, there
is a way of either falling short in the <hi>Evidence,</hi> and
so bringing the matter <hi>off That way;</hi> or else of <hi>suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
those Articles that would have done the business,
or in some cases not bringing the question <hi>on</hi> at <hi>all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
There is one that does not stick publickly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that he will not meddle with hindring any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
against <hi>L' Estrange:</hi> and so we have as good as a
<hi>Protection</hi> in that <hi>Assurance.</hi> And then (under the Rose)
There may be now and then certain <hi>Feelings</hi> in the
Cause, and <hi>Connivings,</hi> in which Case it will be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to <hi>disoblige</hi> us, for fear of telling <hi>Tales.</hi>

               <p>Well, but you are gone from your Text.
Where's the Mighty Service, I beseech ye, that you

find the <hi>Operation</hi> of <hi>This Paper,</hi> Immediately upon the
<hi>Publishing</hi> it? and that whereas <hi>L' Estrange</hi> was only
mention'd before, as a setter on of <hi>Tong</hi> against the
<hi>Two Doctors</hi> without any <hi>other Confederate;</hi> It came now
to the <hi>Cry</hi> of the Town, that <hi>Celiers</hi> and <hi>L' Estrange</hi>
went on hand in hand with the <hi>Conspiracy:</hi> and in such
a manner too, that <hi>L' Estrange</hi> had hardly any way left
him to purge himself, but the Testimony of <hi>Celliers,</hi>
who was not to be believ'd. There's nothing sticks
closer to <hi>L' Estrange,</hi> then <hi>this Intimation:</hi> and yet it has
started another <hi>Bugg</hi> too, which is that he is a <hi>Papist,</hi>
as well as a <hi>Plotter;</hi> and That perswasion I promise you
goes a great way. Nay Ile tell ye a word more too,
but in <hi>Confidence.</hi> I heard a Gentleman undertake the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eph.</speaker>
               <p>But do you believe, <hi>Zekiel,</hi> that <hi>L' Estrange</hi>
holds any <hi>Correspondence</hi> with <hi>Celliers,</hi> or <hi>not?</hi>

               <p>I do not believe that ever he exchang'd any
message with her, or ever so much as saw the Eyes of

               <p>You must know <hi>Zekiel</hi> that I did not only
start the first <hi>General Report</hi> of <hi>L' Estranges</hi> being in
<hi>Tongs Plot,</hi> but I fixed the <hi>Particular Article;</hi> and layd
it; <hi>for Tampering with</hi> Tong, <hi>to</hi> Renounce <hi>the</hi> Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>he made to his Vnkle, of his</hi> former Enformation.</p>

               <p>That might passe well enough to serve a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Turn,</hi> but at the long Run, you could never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that it would hold water, for at the time of <hi>Tongs
Renouncing</hi> That <hi>Retractation, L' Estrange</hi> had not as yet
ever seen the face of <hi>Tong.</hi> To deale frankly with ye,
I do not approve the laying of so much stresse neither,
upon <hi>Tongs Testimony. First,</hi> he advances an <hi>Enforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and at the same time, gives <hi>us</hi> a <hi>Counterpart</hi> of it,
which according to <hi>our Principles</hi> was <hi>fairly done. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
he <hi>Retracts</hi> That <hi>Information;</hi> and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> denys,
upon his <hi>Salvation</hi> that ever he <hi>retracted</hi> it, and Swears
it to have been his own Spontaneous Act, with <hi>Three
Wittnesses</hi> to Assert That <hi>Disclamer.</hi> Now This is so
<hi>Notorious</hi> a <hi>forfeiture</hi> of his <hi>Credit,</hi> that I should be very
loth to Venture the <hi>Pinch</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi> upon his
<hi>Evidence.</hi> So that I am still blowing up the Clamour
of <hi>L' Estrange</hi> and <hi>Celiers</hi> and the Jelousy of <hi>L' Estranges</hi>
being a <hi>Papist.</hi> And I'le tell ye what, beside; I have

                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>That it does upon my word <hi>Zekiel:</hi> for I was
rounded in the ear but yesterday, that <hi>Prance</hi> had <hi>Ten
Wittnesses</hi> in Readiness, to prove that <hi>L' Estrange</hi> had
been <hi>Forty times</hi> at <hi>Mass</hi> here; &amp; Solemnly Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
according to the Profession of the <hi>Romish Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
And I was told by another at the same time, that
<hi>L' Estrange</hi> was run quite away, and a Sum of money
offer'd to any man that should bring him back again.</p>

               <p>This Play of Fast and Loose may do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
so long as the Truth is kept out of sight: But
you see, since <hi>L' Estrange</hi>'s appearing at the Councell,
that the businesse of <hi>Tonge</hi> is in a manner blown over,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49921:8"/>
and that we are put to our shifts for Other Pretenses,
to uphold the Controversy. So that if it were not for
<hi>My story</hi> of <hi>Celliers,</hi> and the Common Theme of <hi>Popery,</hi>
and <hi>Popishly-Affected,</hi> I do not know but we might
e'en shut up our shops, and let fall the Question.</p>

               <p>What dost thou mean <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to encourage
such a <hi>Flam</hi> as This? There are twice as many known
Falshoods in it as there are Lines: And they are so
Palpable too, that there is hardly any man of business,

<hi>prove</hi> him a <hi>Rogue,</hi> by the Best in the Land; and of the

<hi>Date, Octo.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Yesterday <hi>(says he)</hi> Mr. <hi>Justice Bridgman</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> appear'd at the <hi>Councell-board,</hi>
where he deliver'd the Confession of young
<hi>Tonge,</hi> which he made in <hi>Newgate,</hi> whereby
he accused Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> and one <hi>Choqueux</hi> to
be <hi>Conspirators</hi> with him in the Plot, against
his <hi>Father,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi> Very high Words

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49921:9"/>
the Latter telling the Councell that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>
took the Liberty to call him a Thousand times
<hi>Rogue,</hi> and <hi>Rascall;</hi> which the Dr. owned,
saying <hi>he would prove him to be Both,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
he might be Secur'd: Whereupon the
Councell Order'd the Dr. to prefer a <hi>Bill</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; and if it were found, promised that
he should either be <hi>Secur'd,</hi> or give sufficient
<hi>Bayle.</hi> Upon Examination, <hi>L'Estrange</hi> owned
that <hi>Young Tonge</hi> had been with him; and at the

               <p>This piece of Intelligence, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> is like

it keeps the Wheel a going. And yet the leaviug out
of <hi>Cellier</hi> (let me tell ye) is the want of a <hi>Principal
Verb.</hi> It was not well, to put in the Doctors calling
<hi>L'Estrange, Rogue,</hi> and <hi>Rascall;</hi> unlesse it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with some <hi>Intolerable Provocation;</hi> for
fear it might be look upon as an Irreverence toward
the Board. The Dr. they say, made often mention of
the Parliament; which the <hi>News-Letters</hi> do well not to
take notice of, upon matter of <hi>Discretion</hi> as well as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</hi>
Upon the whole matter, I observe This <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

               <p>Upon <hi>Wednesday</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> of this <hi>Instant Oct.</hi>
I attended the Councill; where <hi>Mr. Oates,</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
referr'd himself, (as to any Charge against me)
to <hi>Young Tongs Affidavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Affidavit</hi> being read; I spake, with Leave of
the Board, to thoe Parts of it that seem'd to affect me;
And, as I then promised, so I delivered a Just, and
punctual Account, upon the whole matter in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which was to This following effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Newcomb</hi> of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> did, at my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
desire Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> (his near Neighbour
there,) that he would appoint me some time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with him at his own House concerning several
<hi>Historical Passages</hi> of the <hi>Late War,</hi> whereof (as I was
enform'd) he had reserv'd diverse <hi>Memorials;</hi> He set
the Time, and I went to him accordingly, telling him
in Generall terms my businesse: But company being
There, and just setting down to a <hi>Collation,</hi> it was too
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49921:11"/>
late to enter upon the Discourse after Supper, and so
we referr'd it to another time.</p>
               <p>Upon my next Visit, a maid directed me into a low
Room, where there were two young men; (both
Strangers to me:) Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> coming down Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
saluted me, and made <hi>Young Tonge</hi> (who, it
seems, was <hi>One</hi> of them) and <hi>myself</hi> known to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> (said I) <hi>I have been sometimes at your
Fathers Lodgings in</hi> White-Hall: <hi>did I ever see You
There?</hi> No Sir, <hi>says he,</hi> I never saw you before in my
Life; but I have often heard my Father speak of
You. <hi>Yes</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Choqueux) for refusing to License his</hi>
Royal Martyr; <hi>which he took very Ill at your hands.</hi> There
were several dangerous Passages in it (<hi>said I</hi>) that I
durst not meddle with. <hi>As Sir,</hi> says <hi>Young Tonge, so
there were:</hi> And upon That, he took an Occasion to tell
me some <hi>Generall Stories</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oates:</hi>
That they had had <hi>many Privacies</hi> together; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
naming any Particulars of <hi>businesse.</hi> And Then he
told of one <hi>Green</hi> (a <hi>Weaver</hi>) that seeing his Father
looking about him in the <hi>Court of Requests,</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member)
askt him <hi>what News?</hi> Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> replying, that
he heard none: <hi>Green</hi> made answer that he would tell
Him some; and that there would sodainly be a <hi>Popish
Massacre. After which</hi> (says young <hi>Tonge) my</hi> Father
<hi>made an Acquaintance with him; and not long after, follow'd
the</hi> Plot. Some other wild Discourses he made; but
all of them so Extravagant, and Incoherent, that I
cut him off as fairly as with Civility I could, by <hi>Pishing</hi>
at all he had said, and telling him, in plain terms,
that <hi>it signify'd just nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon shewing this Dislike, <hi>Tonge</hi> whisper'd to
Mr. <hi>Choqueux,</hi> who told me presently, that if I had any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49921:11"/>
                  <hi>Writing-work,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> would <hi>Transcribe</hi> any thing
for me with all his heart. Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> also recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<hi>Tonge</hi> to me, as one that had a great esteem
for me. I told him that I had no businesse of That
kinde, and that I should be ready to Oblige Mr. <hi>Tong:</hi>
And so we sat together over a glasse of Wine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one syllable more of businesse, more then that I
desir'd Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> to remember me for what Notes
he had of the late Warre; the which he said
he would, but that his Papers were most of them
at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I was going to take leave, M. <hi>Tonge</hi> desir'd that he
might wait upon me at my House; and propounded
such or such a time: So that I agreed at last to
the time of his own choosing: But so little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
was I with this kinde of Entertainment, that
I slipt out of the way, and so he lost his labour. But
the next morning, Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> brought me a Letter
from him, desiring me that in regard he mist of me
last night, I would appoint him another time, for <hi>he
had something to say to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon reading of His Letter, (which I shew'd to
the Bearer of it) Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> (said I) <hi>he that has to
do with these Fellows, Must be as wary as if he were upon
the High Rope: a slip is as much as a man's Neck's worth:
If you do but misplace One word, hee'l be your Ruine. But
I'le write him an Answer however;</hi> which in effect was
This. <hi>I'm sorry that I mist you last night, but if you have
anything to say to me, I shall be at home at 7. in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
Truly <hi>(Sir)</hi> says Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> I believe <hi>young
Tonge</hi> to have no sort of <hi>Guile</hi> in him; but however,
he can do me no hurt, for I have nothing to do with
him, but in relation to his Health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49921:12"/>
About 7. in the <hi>Evening,</hi> came Mr. <hi>Choqueux,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Tonge,</hi> and <hi>two more,</hi> (who are meer Strangers to
me): Mr. <hi>Choqueux</hi> telling me, that Mr. <hi>Tonge</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
him to bring him to me, and that he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to acquaint me with. <hi>Sir</hi> (said I) <hi>This businesse
has an Ill face: I will not meddle in any thing looks so like a
Consultation.</hi> So the two strangers departed, leaving
the Other two behind; <hi>Sr.</hi> (says <hi>Mr. Choqueux) Mr
Tong has deliver'd some Enformations already: and he
has an Enformation to offer to your self, as a Justice of
Peace.</hi> Gentlemen <hi>(Sayd I)</hi> if it be an Enformation
<hi>ready Drawn,</hi> and in <hi>your own hand, Mr. Tong;</hi> so as
to need no alteration; if you please to Insert a clause
in't for <hi>my Security,</hi> wherein you shall declare, that
it is <hi>your own voluntary Act,</hi> and without any <hi>Argument,</hi>
or <hi>Inducement,</hi> from <hi>me</hi> to <hi>move</hi> you to't, let me see
the Information, and if I find it a matter fit for me
to meddle in, I'le Swear you to't; but otherwise I
can do nothing in it. <hi>Mr. Tong</hi> making Answer,
that he had nothing ready drawn; <hi>Mr. Choqueux</hi>
went his way, and <hi>Tong</hi> Stayd I think about a Quarter
of an hour after at most, after him; telling over the
same Stuff again, that I was so Sick of at the <hi>Savoy.</hi>
I was so far from Pumping him for matter to work
upon, or making any Improvement, or Collections
from what he sayd, that I quitted the Table where
he sat, and walkt about the Room; which made
him change his Discourse, to talk of some little
Foolish Things that I had written; which in good
manners I gave him, and so he departed. After
which time I never receiv'd either <hi>Note,</hi> or <hi>Message</hi>
from him.</p>

I would have stood the shook of the Issue of such
a Charge, for a single Half Crown, even admitting
that every Article of it could have been prov'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

I do not account it worth my while to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise,
or evade any one Circumstance in This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
being wholly Intent upon the discharge of

of a <hi>Setter,</hi> or a <hi>Trepanner:</hi> And it is the <hi>Last

            <sp>
               <speaker>L' Estr.</speaker>
               <p>Upon the word of a <hi>Christian,</hi> I do not so
much as know the Woman: and I do verily believe
that I never saw her Face. Nor had I ever any
thing to do with her, either directly or Indirectly
in my whole Life: Nor did I hear so much as her
<hi>Name</hi> mention'd upon my Examination.</p>

               <p>Pray let <hi>me</hi> put you a Question now. Did
you never deliver <hi>Tong</hi> a <hi>hundred Guyneys</hi> by order
from the Duke of <hi>York?</hi> Or do not you, either <hi>know,</hi>
or <hi>believe,</hi> that he had <hi>That,</hi> or <hi>some other Sum</hi> given
him, or some <hi>Reward,</hi> promis'd him, for the Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of This Affayr? and by <hi>Whom?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49921:13"/>
               <speaker>L'Estr.</speaker>
               <p>No, by all that is Sacred, I do neither <hi>Know</hi>
nor <hi>Believe</hi> that any Sum of <hi>Money,</hi> or any Reward,
was either <hi>Given,</hi> or <hi>Promised</hi> to <hi>Tonge</hi> by his <hi>Royal
Highness,</hi> or his <hi>Order;</hi> nor do I know of any <hi>Money
given</hi> him, or any <hi>Reward Promised</hi> him, in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his appearing as an <hi>Evidence,</hi> by any Person
whatsoever. Neither did I ever touch a Penny of
the Duke's Money in my Life, either for my <hi>own,</hi> or
for the Use of any <hi>other</hi> Person. But as to any <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi>
to him, or the <hi>Hopes</hi> of it, in case he could
draw me into the Snare, I can say nothing to That.
But by his Proposing of <hi>me</hi> beforehand, for his <hi>Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi>
(being, as then, wholly <hi>unknown</hi> to him) and
by the Sequel of his <hi>Addresses</hi> and <hi>Applications,</hi> it
doth manifestly appear, that the entrapping of <hi>L' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange</hi>
was one part of his Design.</p>
               <p>But you say nothing all this while of a <hi>Conspiracy</hi>
on the <hi>other side;</hi> and an endeavour to set up the
whole Nation in Evidence against <hi>me.</hi> For what is
it less, the dispersing of so many hundreds of Papers
every Week, all over the Kingdom, stuffed with
the <hi>basest</hi> and <hi>falsest Scandals</hi> against me imaginable;
<hi>belying</hi> the very <hi>Ord<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You have the Wit, I perceive, to tell us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to your Disadvantage: Pray'e were not you
taken up for being a little too Malapert, when Dr.

               <p>Not one Jot I do assure ye Gentlemen: and
I hope, I understand my Duty better than to deserve
it. True it is, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> charged me with <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Kings Witnesses in my Writings.</hi> And I did
say indeed, <hi>It were well if some of them did not abuse
themselves more in their manners; for that Oates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had within a few days call'd me at least forty Rogues
and Rascals, in a</hi> Coffee-House, <hi>in one quarter of an
hour;</hi> whereupon, (not to make the matter worse
than it was) Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> replyed, <hi>so I have; and I
will prove you to be a</hi> Rogue <hi>and a</hi> Rascal. And then
he was at it that he would find Witnesses: to which
I only observ'd that they were yet to <hi>find.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And pray'e Note, That all this Heat was about my
<hi>Writings;</hi> which he had at the same time declar'd
in precise words that <hi>he had never read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He threatn'd me indeed with a <hi>Parliament,</hi> but
that is a Course of Speech he has got. If the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
but ask a <hi>New-comer</hi> for his <hi>Garnish</hi> or <hi>Foy,</hi> the
Master of the Prison shall be told of a <hi>Parliament.</hi>
A Bishop shall not Suspend a Minister for refusing
to <hi>officiate</hi> according to the <hi>Canon,</hi> but he is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
threatn'd with a <hi>Parliament.</hi> If the <hi>University</hi>
shall not think fit to allow Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Degree; The
<hi>Lawn-Sleeves</hi> are to be Ruffled <hi>next Parliament.</hi> I
was walking a while since only cross the <hi>Outer-Court</hi>
at <hi>White Hall</hi> innocently about my business,
and because I did not <hi>Cap</hi> him, over the Square,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49921:14"/>
as the Boyes do <hi>Fellows</hi> in <hi>Cambridge; Squire
L' Estrange</hi> (says he) <hi>We shall have a</hi> Parliament,
twirling his Hat about, betwixt his Finger and
his Thumb; with a <hi>Look</hi> and <hi>Action</hi> not to be
exprest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What can be a greater Affront now to that</hi> Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Body, <hi>than to entitle it to the</hi> Protection of
insolent Reproaches <hi>and</hi> Wrongs. <hi>As if</hi> Parliaments
<hi>had nothing else to do, than to</hi> countenance <hi>the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosities,
gratifie <hi>the</hi> Passions, <hi>and</hi> weake <hi>the</hi> Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<hi>of</hi> Private <hi>and of</hi> troublesom men.</p>
               <p>To say that I have as great a <hi>Veneration</hi> for the
Constitution of an <hi>English Parliament;</hi> as any man
living, is only to say the same thing over again
which I have very often said heretofore. And I have
made my words good by my <hi>Practices</hi> in the <hi>Deference</hi>
and <hi>Obedience</hi> which I have ever paid to the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Dignity</hi> of That <hi>August Assembly,</hi> whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Legally Indicted</hi> and <hi>Conven'd.</hi> Did I suffer above
three years <hi>Imprisonment</hi> in <hi>Newgate</hi> under a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Death, from the <hi>Late Usurpers (that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd</hi>
and <hi>depos'd his Majesty)</hi> for my <hi>Loyalty</hi> to my

of a <hi>Parliament</hi> that stands up for the King's
<hi>Preservation</hi> and <hi>Support?</hi> Have I been <hi>True</hi> to the

to be a <hi>Traytor</hi> now at last to a <hi>Gracious</hi> and a

                  <hi>most.</hi> I have not behav'd my self at a Rate to fear a

Matters,</hi> I have made the <hi>Law</hi> my <hi>Rule,</hi> and I
have made my <hi>Duty</hi> the <hi>Measure</hi> of my <hi>Actions;</hi> and
he that keeps himself within <hi>these Bounds,</hi> needs no
other Security against the <hi>Justice</hi> of a <hi>Parliament;</hi>
especially a Person that has upon all occasion assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Rights of that Noble Assembly; Treating
them with the stile of <hi>Venerable Patriots [Case put

               <p>You have made a long Discourse here; just

               <p>As for the <hi>Kings Witnesses,</hi> I have had no
dealings with any of them, but with Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and
none with <hi>him</hi> neither in any sort to reflect upon his
<hi>Evidence.</hi> He gives it up and down, with open-mouth,
that I am a <hi>Conspirator,</hi> and a <hi>Papist;</hi> and I declare
on the other side, that there are not a couple of <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
Lyes</hi> in <hi>Hell. Rogue, Rascal, Villain,</hi> and other
Scurrillities of the <hi>same seasoning,</hi> are the <hi>Lard</hi> he
makes use of in his ordinary Discourses of <hi>L'Estrange.</hi>
And under all these Indignities I must not dare to say
that I am <hi>None</hi> of these fine things, for fear of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> by the <hi>Contradiction</hi> But so long as
he serves my betters with the same sauce, there's the
less hurt done. Where's the Liberty of the <hi>Subject,</hi>
if men shall be Arraign'd for their Thoughts? Where's
<hi>common Equity,</hi> if the Testimony of a Profligate,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49921:15"/>
Little Creature, that has sworn <hi>forward</hi> and <hi>backward,</hi>
and <hi>backward</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> again, in the same Cause
already, shall come to weigh against almost <hi>forty
years service</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> without so much as one
<hi>false step,</hi> which I affirm to be <hi>Literally True;</hi> and I
defie the Devil himself, (let him but subscribe <hi>Satan</hi>

What Security will there be for <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Virtue,</hi>
when it shall become <hi>dangerous</hi> to be <hi>honest;</hi> And that
there shall need no more than such a wretch as <hi>young

man living? We have no <hi>Curtius's</hi> in This Age to
spare; no <hi>Devotes,</hi> (that will run through fire and

he had seen me three or four several times at <hi>Masse,</hi>
at <hi>Somerset House,</hi> about <hi>two years since;</hi> and that I
did there as other People did; but that he could not
speak any more as to my being a <hi>Papist,</hi> or that he
ever saw me <hi>receive;</hi> neither could he name any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
else that saw me there; and he added to this, that
he had known me about the Town for several years.</p>
            <p>Now to <hi>this Information,</hi> I answer, first, That if I
had been there, it would not prove me to be a <hi>Papist;</hi>
for Thousands of People resort thither, many times
upon <hi>Curiositie,</hi> without any respect to <hi>Religion.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that having taken the Oaths and Tests requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Law, I am <hi>Rectus in Curia:</hi> so that this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
cannot operate upon me for that reason nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that is to say, any further than as to a Scandal.</p>
            <p>And yet under these safe and legal Circumstances,
without any avail to me, (more than purging my self
from the Reproache) I do here <hi>deliberately</hi> and <hi>solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
make this further <hi>Declaration</hi> to the whole world.</p>
            <p>As I do believe there is a God; and that there is a
<hi>Heaven and a Hell,</hi> (with Reverence to the <hi>Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi>
and to <hi>Truth</hi>) may I be <hi>sav'd,</hi> or <hi>damn'd,</hi> as I speak
<hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> in this matter; and without any <hi>reserve</hi>
or <hi>collusion</hi> whatsoever: and I deliver this upon cold
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49921:19"/>
and considerate thoughts, having before me the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the most <hi>dreadful Vengeance</hi> to fall upon me,
if I tell a lye, that ever befell any Mortal?</p>
            <p>☞ I never was present at <hi>Mass</hi> in any place
whatsoever, since his Majesties Return; nor
to the best of my memory, have been under the
Roof of a <hi>Romish Chappel,</hi> since that time.</p>
            <p>After this, Mr <hi>Oates</hi> exhibited an Information a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me for conveying away <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Popish Books</hi>
that had been seiz'd and lock'd up: whereupon the
Messenger of the Press discharg'd himself upon <hi>Oath,</hi>
that the Name of <hi>L' Estrange</hi> was not so much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the case. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> Expounding himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
that what he spake, was only upon Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>The next Blow at me will be (as I am inform'd)
for saying at <hi>Will's Coffee House,</hi> that there is no Plot:
which is a thing that I do averr, by all that I have
said before, was never spoken by me, either there, or
any where else.</p>
            <p>In the last place, I am to be question'd for my Books,
and that concludes the Story.</p>
            <p>Whosoever duly considers the Quality of my Case,
and the necessity of encountring so many <hi>spiteful flams,</hi>
as are already dispers'd, even since <hi>yesterday,</hi> with a
<hi>fair</hi> and a <hi>modest Narration</hi> of the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi>
will easily excuse this <hi>Appendix.</hi>
