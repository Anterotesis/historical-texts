         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur purpoſe in publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
is not to make old
ſores bleed, or foment
any ones diſcontent, or
renew any ones griefe, concerning
the much lamented death of this
godly and Reverend Author; nor
ſhall we mention what great loſſe
the Church of God had in the death
of ſo uſeful and hopeful a Miniſter:
But we ſhall in a few words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
thee why this little piece is
thus made publique.</p>
            <p>There are many imperfect copies
of Mr. <hi>Love's</hi> Sermons, which are
likely to be obtruded into the
world, by ſome who regard no other
end in publiſhing and printing
books, then their own private gain;
To prevent which, we have from
his own notes publiſhed theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and ſhall deſire the Reader to
<pb facs="tcp:30639:4"/>
take notice, that whatever Sermons
of this Author ſhall be thought fit
to be publiſhed, ſhall be atteſted
with ſome of our hands, who are
intruſted with his Papers, and hope
none will be ſo injurious to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and others, as to preſume to
print any thing of Mr. <hi>Love's</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſaid Atteſtation.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt here but the marrow
and ſubſtance of the laſt Sermons
preached by that late faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God. Pulpit-repetitions
and enlargments are here omitted,
we having endeavoured to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
thee in the <hi>price</hi> in buying,
and in thy <hi>pains</hi> in reading, that
thou mightſt have much <hi>fruit,</hi>
though there be not many <hi>leaves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Libri rerum non verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſoecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</note>
Thoſe bookes are beſt that have
much worth and weight in a little
bulk, and ſuch is this if we miſtake
not.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Author, though
he had not attained many yeers, yet
he had gotten much experience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſoul-affairs. Theſe were his
laſt Meditations, and therefore the
more deſired by, and we hope will
<pb facs="tcp:30639:4"/>
be the more acceptable to thoſe, to
whoſe ſouls his Miniſtry was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and precious. Thou wilt finde
here no new, uncouth, and unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
expreſſions, but plain practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Doctrine, old Divinity, ſound,
ſolid, and conſcience-ſearching
truths. The gracious Author prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and preſſing them on the
hearts of his hearers, from his own
experience of them. Neither wilt
thou meet with any railings or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachings
of the publick and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Governours, (the uſual, though
the moſt unjuſt, charge againſt the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters.) This whole
diſcourſe is not about <hi>State,</hi> but
<hi>Soul-affairs,</hi> which is another reaſon
why it is publiſhed, to check the
licentiouſneſſe of this Age, which
hath ſurfetted upon abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Pamphlets. The Lord
give thee to have thy ſpiritual <hi>ſenſes
exerciſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>to diſcern both good and evil.</hi>
But alas! What between <hi>State-mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
and <hi>Church-diſſenſions,</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
truths lie by neglected. It is
much to be feared the <hi>Work of Grace</hi>
goes on but ſlowly, few enquire into
<pb facs="tcp:30639:5"/>
their Soul-ſtate. But to enquire into
our ſpirituall eſtate is the beſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
in the world. If we are to be
<hi>diligent to know the ſtate of our flocks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 27. 23</note>
then ſurely we ſhould <hi>give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
to know how it is with our
precious and immortall ſouls. The
benefit and profit of this ſoul-ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
will abundantly recompence
our pains and care in performing
it.</p>
            <p>There are two great miſtakes to
which the beſt Chriſtians are very
ſubject.</p>
            <p>1. Either to deſpiſe and diſparage
the work of grace, if their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
be ſmall.</p>
            <p>2. Or elſe, if their attainments be
ſomewhat conſiderable, to ſit
down contented with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
meaſures.</p>
            <p>We beſeech you take heed of both
theſe evils, which are both alike;
unthankfulneſſe to God, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe
to your own ſoul, the one
deſpiſeth the truth, and the other
neglects the Growth of <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If thou art one of the tender
Plants in Chriſts Orchard, a weak
<pb facs="tcp:30639:5"/>
Lamb in his Flock, a Babe in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
yet Oh, deſpiſe not <hi>the day of
ſmall things in thy ſoule;</hi> though thy
gifts be few, &amp; thy comforts fewer,
yet tread not out thy ſelfe the <hi>ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
flax; ſtay thy ſelfe upon his name
who is a rock of Ages, and whoſe work is
perfect,</hi> and his grace unchangable,
<hi>who will bring forth judgement unto
victory.</hi> Sleight not the leaſt meaſure
of grace: though the firſt and ruder
draught be but drawn on thy ſoule,
yet be comforted in this, that the
image of Chriſt is begun to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
there. But be ſure thy grace
be right. Temporary faith, partial
obedience, mercenary love, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
zeale, legall ſorrow, feigned hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
may make up a lifeleſſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of a profeſſor, <hi>who hath the form
without the power of Godlineſſe:</hi> but it
is true <hi>Grace</hi> that makes a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
Common gifts and graces may
bring a man neer heaven, but they
will never bring a man into heaven.
This Treatiſe therefore will teach
thee to bring thy grace to the true
touch-ſtone. It is one of the ſaddeſt
<pb facs="tcp:30639:6"/>
conſiderations that can ſettle on the
heart of a Chriſtian, to think how
high a formall hypocrite may goe
towards Heaven with his ſeeming
grace, and how low a true child of
God may fall by ſin towards Hell,
and yet have real <hi>Grace.</hi> It is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing to think how many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
in our age reſt in duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and parts acquired, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
examine themſelves whether
they are in the faith, and have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that true <hi>Grace</hi> which Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and hypocrites can never
have. When we finde in Scripture,

ſhould we then be to examine and
prove our ſelves whether we are in
a ſtate of true grace? Oh! it is very
ſad to fall ſhort of them that fall
ſhort of Heaven. As for the moſt
part of Profeſſors of our times; it is
<pb facs="tcp:30639:6"/>
much to be feared, that their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
trading lies more for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe

<hi>Grace,</hi>

               <q>—Becauſe in him there is found ſome

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter conteins in it <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs</hi>
Propheſie, foretelling what
diſmall judgements ſhould befal
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> and his poſterity, for
his Idolatry in worſhip, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
from the Government and houſe of
<hi>David.</hi> For which ſins <hi>God did deſtroy him and
his poſterity:</hi> and not only the bad,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Kings 15. 29.</note> but the
good were puniſhed for their fathers guilt.
For ſo it is intimated in this verſe, out of
which the Text is taken. Here was a young
man, <hi>Ieroboam's</hi> ſon that ſhould die for the
fathers fault; and yet here was a mitigation
of the puniſhment, that he ſhould not die af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner that the reſt did, <hi>he ſhall
goe to his grave in peace, becauſe in him there is
found ſome good, &amp;c.</hi> Behold the goodneſſe
of God! a little good in him, and yet the
great God takes notice of the little good in
him. God found as it were one pearle in a
heap of pebbles, one good young man in
<hi>Jeroboams</hi> houſhold, that had ſome good
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30639:9"/>
in him towards the Lord God of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>In the whole verſe, three parts.</p>
            <p>I. A lamentation for the death of this ſon
of <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>all Iſrael ſhall
mourn for him,</hi> and ſo they did, <hi>v.</hi> 18.—which
argued there was goodneſs
in him; for if he had not been deſired
and prized while he lived, he would
not have been ſo lamented at his death.</p>
            <p>II. A limitation of his puniſhment, he
only of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> family ſhall come to
the grave, the reſt of his poſterity that
died in the City, dogs ſhould eat, and
him that dieth in the field, ſhould the
fowles of the ayre devoure. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>III. The commendation of his life, <hi>in him
was found ſome good, &amp;c.</hi> (of this I am
now to treat.)</p>
            <p>He is commended by the Holy Ghoſt; for
his goodneſſe is ſet forth.</p>
            <p>1. By the quality of his goodneſſe; it was
a good thing, not a good word only, or a
good purpoſe or inclination, with which
too many content themſelves, but it was a
good action.</p>
            <p>2. By the quantity of it; it was but ſome
little good thing that was found in him, and
yet that little good God did not deſpiſe or
over-look.</p>
            <p>3. By the ſincerity of his goodneſſe; there
are two notable demonſtrations of this
young mans goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>1. It was towards the Lord God of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30639:9"/>
2. It was in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> houſe.</p>
            <p>1. His goodneſſe was towards <hi>the Lord
God of Iſrael.</hi> This argued <hi>Pauls</hi> ſincerity,
that in his<note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 12 19.</note> ſpeaking, writing and actions
he could and did appeal to God.<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 20.</note> That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Jam. 2. 27</note> 
               <hi>pure and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
that is, ſo <hi>before God and the Father.</hi> Many
Hypocrites may be good towards men, who
are not ſo towards God; to be rich indeed,
is to <hi>be</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 12. 21.</note> 
               <hi>rich towards God.</hi> True repentance is
<note n="e" place="margin">As 20. 21.</note> 
               <hi>repentance towards God;</hi> and he is unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
indeed that is<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 24. 16.</note> void of offence <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God,</hi> as well as <hi>towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He was good in the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi>
A wicked man may ſeeme good in a good
place, but to be good in a bad place argues
men to be good indeed. To be good in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
houſe, this was not ſo much; but for this
young man to be <hi>good</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
his father, whom the Scripture brands
for his Idolatry, that <hi>he made all Jſrael to ſin</hi>
and yet could not make his ſon to ſin; this
argued he was ſincerely good: as it did argue
<hi>Lots</hi> ſincerity to be righteous in <hi>Sodom;</hi> for
<hi>Job</hi> to be good in <hi>Chaldea;</hi> and to be Saints
in <hi>Nero's</hi> Palace, and to feare God in <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi>
family, this is goodneſſe indeed.</p>
            <p>There is onely one difficulty in the Text,
<hi>viz.</hi> What was that good thing that was
found in <hi>Abijah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, 'tis true, the Scripture
doth not particularly expreſſe what that
good thing was which was found in him:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30639:10"/>
but <hi>Toſtatus</hi> and P. <hi>Martyr</hi> affirme from the
Hebrew Rabbins, that when the Jews of the
ten Tribes did on their appointed times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to worſhip according to the
command of God, and <hi>Jerboam</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Souldiers to intercept them: this <hi>Abijah</hi>
did hinder the ſouldiers to kill them, and
gave them paſſes to go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God, and incouraged them therein, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the rage of his father, who
had forſaken the true worſhip of God, and
ſet up Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others think the goodneſſe of this young
Prince was in this, that he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to his father in taking away the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the houſe of <hi>David;</hi> but where
the Scripture hath not a tongue to ſpeak, we
have not an eare to hear, and therefore we
ſhall not undertake to determine what the
Scripture hath not determined.</p>
            <p>There are many collaterall obſervations
which I ſhall deduce from the ſeverall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
in the text, and but name ſome
of them. From the conſideration that this
good <hi>Abijah</hi> died:</p>
            <p>Good men, and uſefull,<note place="margin">1. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> and hopefull inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may be taken away by death, when wicked
men may live long upon the earth.</p>
            <p>Bad <hi>Jeroboam</hi> lived long, his good ſonne
died ſoon; ſo true is that of <hi>Solomon, A righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man may periſh in his righteouſneſſe, when
a wicked man may prolong his dayes in his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe;</hi>
Briers and Thorns and Thiſtles wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30639:10"/>
not ſo ſoon as Lilies and Roſes, they
may be taken out of the world, of whom the
world is not worthy, and they remaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
who are not worthy to live in the
world.</p>
            <p>2. From the conſideration of the death of
godly <hi>Abijah,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Kings 16. 26.</note> when wicked <hi>Nadab</hi> the other
ſon of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> lived,—Obſerve</p>
            <p>That good children may be taken away by
death from their parents,<note place="margin">2. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> when ungodly children
may live to be a ſhame and a curſe to their parents</p>
            <p>3. From the conſideration of the cauſe
why this gracious young man died ſo ſoon,
it was for his fathers ſins, as we may gather
from <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>That good children as well as bad may be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
puniſhed,<note place="margin">3. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> for the ſins of their parents.</p>
            <p>4. From all <hi>Iſraels</hi> lamenting the death of
this hopefull young man; Obſerve</p>
            <p>That good men who have been,<note place="margin">4. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> and might be
further uſefull in their lives,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 1. 1—</note> ſhould be much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
at their death; they that have lived de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
ſhould die lamented.</p>
            <p>5. From theſe words, <hi>he ſhall go to his grave
in peace;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a great bleſſing to go to ones grave in peace
in times of war and common calamity.<note place="margin">5. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He was good towards God;</p>
            <p>He is good indeed,<note place="margin">6. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> who is ſo to God, as well as
unto men; many are good in mans ſight, that are
not ſo in the ſight of God.—<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are two other circumſtances upon
which I ſhall a little inlarge my ſelfe, before
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30639:11"/>
I come to the main point I intend to handle</p>
            <p>From the age of this ſon of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who
is here commended for his goodneſſe, it is
ſaid, <hi>he was a childe,</hi> verſ. 12. Whence it may
be obſerved,</p>
            <p>It is very commendable to ſee goodneſſe in
young people: to ſee young men good men,<note place="margin">1. Doct.</note> is a
very commendable thing.</p>
            <p>There were many good men in that time
but to be good ſo ſoon as <hi>Abijah</hi> was, when
he was a child, the Scripture records this to
his praiſe.</p>
            <p>1. I ſhall ſhew you that it is a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing to ſee young men good men. This
I prove,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Scripture makes very
honourable mention of young men, when
good men; as firſt of <hi>Obadiah,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">1 Kings 18. 12.</note> 
               <hi>that he feared
the Lord from his youth.</hi> And it is recorded to
the honour of<note n="i" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Timothy</hi> that <hi>be knew the holy
Scriptures from a child. Ierome</hi> conceives that
<hi>Iohn</hi> was the moſt<note n="k" place="margin">Joh. 13.</note> beloved diſciple, becauſe
he was the youngeſt of all<note n="l" place="margin">Jer. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>God remembers the
kindneſſe of our youth.</hi> God takes more kindly
<hi>the kindneſſe of our youth</hi> then of our age. It
was matter of joy unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he found
<note n="m" place="margin">2 Epiſt. John 4.</note> 
               <hi>children walking in the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe God commends morall
and common goodneſſe in the young man
<note n="n" place="margin">Mar. 10. 21.</note> in the Goſpell, Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to love him,</hi> for
his moral goodneſſe and naturall ingenuity</p>
            <p>2. The reaſon why it is ſo commendable
in a young man to be a good man, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30639:11"/>
their temptations are more, and their
affections are ſtronger to carry them from
God; youth hath a ſtronger aptitude and
proclivity to ſinne then any other age, their
blood is ſooner ſtirr'd up to choler, and
their ſtrength to luſt. As every relation hath
its ſpeciall ſin, ſo every age of a mans life;
old age is peeviſh and covetous; middle age
proud, malicious and revengful; young men
are uſually raſh, luſtful and voluptuous; and
therefore <hi>Paul</hi> bids<note n="o" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Timothy fly all youthfull
luſts;</hi> and therefore ſeeing youth is expoſed
to ſo many temptations, and ſubject to ſo
many corruptions,—it is rare to ſee young
men good.</p>
            <p>Oh then be exhorted you that are young,
to become religious betimes;<note place="margin">1 Vſe.</note> and to quicken
you hereunto, Conſider.</p>
            <p>1. If you be not good in your youth, you
can never uſe the Pſalmiſts arguments, <hi>Caſt
me not off O Lord in the time of my old age, for
ſake me not when my ſtrength faileth, v.</hi> 9.—and
his argument he had before,<note place="margin">Pſ. 71. 9. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>v.</hi> 5. for
<hi>thou art my hope, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt been my truſt from my
youth,</hi> and who would be without ſuch an
argument on his death-bed?</p>
            <p>2. Conſider, there are recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
many young men that were good, of al
ſorts and conditions, and of all callings; and
the Holy Ghoſt doth not only ſet down
their goodneſſe, but their age in which they
were good: <hi>Solomon</hi> a young King, <hi>Obadiah</hi>
a young Courtier, <hi>Daniel</hi> a young Prophet,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30639:12"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> a young Apoſtle, <hi>Timothy</hi> a young
preacher, and here <hi>Abijah</hi> a young Prince;
and all theſe were good men, and are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for our example and incouragement.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider, that God in the diſpenſations
of his grace beſtows it upon young men, and
paſſeth by the elder. Thus <hi>Abel</hi> the younger
was righteous, and <hi>Cain</hi> wicked: <hi>Iacob</hi> the
younger brother loved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> hated; Thus
<hi>David</hi> the youngeſt of <hi>Ieſſes</hi> ſons,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 11, 12.</note> and yet the
beſt of them, and the choſen of the Lord.</p>
            <p>God doth many times do as <hi>Iacob</hi> did
when he bleſſed the children of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> he
<hi>ſtretched out his right hand</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 48. 14.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; laid it upon the
head of</hi> Ephraim <hi>the younger,</hi>—ſo doth God
in the diſpenſation of his grace many times
pitch on the youngeſt, God ſaith, as <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
of all the reſt, <hi>bring me Benjamin,</hi> and gives
him a double portion.</p>
            <p>4. The time of your youth is the freeſt age
of your life to betake your ſelves to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of religion and duties of godlineſſe.
Young men that are ſervants, have more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and leſſe cares then when they grow
in yeers, and the<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 33.</note> cares &amp; incumbrances of a
family fill their hands and clog their hearts.</p>
            <p>5. Conſider, if thou art not gracious in
youth, the fins of thy youth may trouble
thy conſcience in thy old age. Many young
men who are active and venturous in the
heat of their youth, get thoſe bodily bruiſes
and blows, that they feel the ache thereof to
their dying day. Thou that giveſt a blow or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30639:12"/>
a bruiſe to thy conſcience in thy youth,
mayeſt feel this in thy old age.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſins which now thou feeleſt not,
may be a trouble to thy conſcience, and an
aking to thy heart, when thou lyeſt on thy
death bed. And though God do not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
the ſins of your youth to damne your ſouls;
yet he may make you remember them ſo as
to be a trouble to your conſciences.<note n="r" place="margin">Quae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

young man whilſt he ſeemed to be under the
tuition of <hi>Jehojada,</hi> but when he was dead,
how did he break out.</p>
            <p>How many are there in the world, who
have loſt their affection and deſires after
God, which they had in their youth? It was
a brand ſet upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> who, though when
young, <hi>was well taught by his mother;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 1.</note> yet when
he grew old, his wives turned away his
heart from God. So <hi>David</hi> had his firſt days
which were better then his laſt. Even ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, we have too many, who when
they were young did love Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Ordinances, and when they became
old have abated exceedingly, which may
make them to fear the ſincerity of their
goodneſs; for he that is truly good in youth
will be ſo in his old age.</p>
            <p>A ſecond remarkable circumſtance is this,
that this young <hi>Abijah was good in the houſe
of Jeroboam.</hi> Whence obſerve</p>
            <p>That it is a great commendation for men to
retein their goodneſs whileſt they live in bad pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
and families; <hi>That this is ſo, we may ſee
by that commendable mention the Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptures
make of ſuch as were good in evill
places. Thus God commends the Church
of</hi> Pergamus, I know thy works, and where
thou dwelleſt, even where Satans ſeat is,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 13.</note> and
thou holdeſt faſt my name, and haſt not denied
my faith, even in thoſe days wherein <hi>Antipas</hi> my
faithful Martyr, who was ſlain amongſt you,
where Satan dwelleth. Pergamus <hi>was a City
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30639:14"/>
more given to Idolatry then all the Cities of</hi>
Aſia, <hi>and yet</hi> there were ſome that held faſt the
name of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 22.</note> and did not deny his faith: <hi>to be
a Saint in</hi> Nero<hi>'s family is very commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the reaſon thereof is,</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe many of Gods children have
failed, and abated much of their goodneſſe
in bad places. How did <hi>Peter</hi> fall in the High
Prieſts Hall; though when in good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he was zealous, yet there he denied Chriſt.
So <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was in <hi>Gerar,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi>
alſo, denied their wives: ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi>'s
Court, and learn't the Court Oath, to
ſwear by the life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Hence God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not to mixe
themſelves with the Heathens, <hi>leſt they learn
their manners and cuſtoms.</hi> Bad places are like
bad aire for zeale to breath in; as ſheep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
brairs loſe part of their fleece, ſo
good men in bad company loſe part of their
goodneſſe.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 15</note> As one ſcabbed ſheep may infect a
whole flock: ſo one root of bitterneſs may
ſpring up and defile many.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe it is a cleer evidence of the
ſincerity of a mans goodneſs, to be good in a
bad place. This ſhews thy grace to be grace
indeed, when thou haſt diſcouragements to
be good, and then art holy; this is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
that thou art ſincerely good, and
that thy goodneſs is not counterfeit and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up upon any ſiniſter and hypocritical
end. It is good to be good with the good; but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30639:14"/>
it is moſt excellent to be good amongſt the
bad, and to be beſt amongſt the worſt.</p>
            <p>From hence learn the power and unlooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
of ſaving grace;<note place="margin">Vſe. 1.</note> grace makes a man
good in the worſt times; let a man be caſt
into priſon or bad company (which is the
worſt temptation) yet he ſhall not loſe his
grace: true grace is compared to oyle; now
caſt oyl into a veſſel of water, and the oyl
will not mix with the water, but will lie on
the top; grace will ſwim upon the water of
temptation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As all the water in the ſalt ſea
cannot make the fiſh ſalt: ſo all the wicked
in the world cannot change the nature of
grace; a good man like the fiſh retains his
goodneſs in bad places; thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> retained
his goodneſſe in the Court of wicked <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,
Nehemiah</hi> in the Court of <hi>Artaxerxes, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiah</hi>
in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Court, <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars,</hi>
the Saints in <hi>Nero</hi>'s houſhold, and
<hi>Abijah</hi> in wicked and idolatrous <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s
houſe.</p>
            <p>Though it be a commendable thing to be
good in bad places;<note place="margin">2.</note> yet you ought to bewail
your living in bad places: it is your miſery,
though not your ſin; thus did <hi>Iſaiah, Wo is

            <p>Hence we may gather,<note place="margin">3</note> that it is our duty,
the more bad the place or family is where
God hath caſt your dwelling, the better and
more blameleſs you ſhould labour to be; you

—In the Church of Chriſt, which is his

that hereby is meant the ſeveral ſorts of

               <hi>A ſecond queſtion,</hi> How may a man know
himſelf,<note place="margin">2 Queſt.</note> that be is but of a little meaſure and
ſmall beginning in grace?</p>
            <p>1. To be much in dependance on duties,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:30639:18"/>
argues thou art but weak in grace. A young
Chriſtian is like a young Carpenter, he
makes many chips, &amp; hath many blows, but
doth not make ſuch ſmooth work as an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perienced
Carpenter, who will make fewer
chips, and at fewer blows better work: ſo
young Chriſtians, they are much in the uſe
of duty, but they are ap to relie upon duty;
they think duties make them Saints, &amp; they
are apt to make Saviours of their duties.
Young Chriſtians are 1. Affectionate in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and 2. Frequent in their duties. 3. And
ſee not their failings in their duties, and ſo
are apt to reſt on their duties. As it is a ſigne
of an Apoſtate Profeſſor to caſt off duty, ſo
alſo a note of a young and weak Profeſſor
to reſt too much upon his duties.</p>
            <p>2. A weak Chriſtian is not clearly inſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the cloſe &amp; ſpirituall failings,<note place="margin">Aaſw. 2.</note> which
cleave to his performances. He doth ſee his
gifts, and takes notice of his affections, but he
doth not ſee the vanity of his minde, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs
of his ends, his carnal dependance
upon his duty, ſelf-love and vaine glory; but
in tract of time a grown Chriſtian doth take
notice of theſe things in himſelf; an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Chriſtian will take as much notice of
his failing in duty, as of his ability in it, and
though he diſcerne an inlargement of gifts
and graces in him at ſome times; yet he ſtill
diſcerns much ſpiritual pride, popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
oſtentation of gifts, too much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe
in ſetting out his parts, which a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30639:18"/>
weak Chriſtian ſeldom perceives.</p>
            <p>3. To have a ſcrupulous conſcience about<note place="margin">Anſw 3.</note>
matters of indifferency argues a weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1.</note>
for ſo the Apoſtle cals them, <hi>weak in the
faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> ſuch as did binde the conſcience when
the Scriptures left it free. One believer
thought he might eat any thing, and another
doubted of the lawfulnes of eating ſundry
things. Now thoſe that doubted, the Apoſtle
cals<note n="*" place="margin">Rom 14. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Weak; and the weak conſcience is apt to be
defiled.</hi> Not to know our liberty, &amp; to abuſe
our liberty,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 7. c. 9. 2.</note> is an argument we have but little
grace. Young Converts make more ſinners
then ever God made, they perplex and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
themſelves meerly in indifferent
things. It is true, there ought to be a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious
tenderneſſe in all Chriſtians: tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of conſcience is our duty, but a tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
intangling ſcrupuloſity is our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and yet as a weak Chriſtian is better then
no Chriſtian, a weake faith is better then a
dead faith; ſo a ſcrupulous conſcience is
better then a ſeared conſcience.</p>
            <p>4. To be ſo intently ſet on the exerciſes of
Religion as to neglect our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,<note place="margin">Anſw. 4.</note>
is a ſigne we are but weak in grace. It
was a good ſaying of that famous man of
God, Dr. <hi>Sibbs; I like that Chriſtian well, that
will hear much and live much, that, will pray
much and work much.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Sibbs.</note> In young Converts their
affections are ſtrong and ſtirring, and they
think they can never hear enough, and they
many times do neglect the duties of their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30639:19"/>
callings, which doth argue their weakneſſe
and infirmity. An experienced grown Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
is regular in his general and particular
calling; ſo as the one ſhall not juſtle and
hinder the other.</p>
            <p>5. To have mens perſons in admiration
argues weakneſſe in grace;<note place="margin">Anſw. 5,</note> ſuch were the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> who had mens perſons in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Children, Babes
and poor, low, and carnall Chriſtians: Babes,</hi>
though they had the life of Chriſtians; yet
they had but little of the ſtrength of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
—<hi>They were carnal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1, 4.</note> 
               <hi>they ſavoure'd more of
the fleſh then of the Spirit.</hi> Ignorance is often a
cauſe of admiration; weak Chriſtians who
have but little knowledge, are apt to be ſo
taken with mens perſons, that one cryes, I
<hi>am of</hi> Paul,<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and another, <hi>I am of</hi> Apollo, and
ſo fall into the ſin condemned of having the
faith of Chriſt with reſpect of perſons, to
cry up one Miniſter, and to cry down others.
To idolize ſome, &amp; to deſpiſe others argues
that thou art weak in faith. A ſolid Chriſtian
loves all good miniſters, and can contemne
none.</p>
            <p>6. To be eaſily ſeduced and led away into
error, argues but weakneſſe in grace.<note place="margin">Anſw. 6.</note> Thoſe
the Apoſtle calls <hi>Children who are toſſed to

way not to fall from our ſtedfaſtneſſe, is, <hi>to

ſtrong Chriſtians are ſtedfaſt, whereas weak

Profeſſors that have been whirl'd about with

but weak grace, if any.</p>
            <p>7. Such as are only acquainted with the
common Principles of Religion,<note place="margin">Anſw. 7.</note> without
further ſearch into the depths and myſteries
of Religion.—There are ſome Profeſſors
who may be fitly ſtiled <hi>Babes</hi> in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

more ſolid doctrines of the Goſpel, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

and not in judgment, they have uſually
more heat then light; young Chriſtians are
like young horſes, they have much metal, but
are not ſo fit for a journey, becauſe they are
not ſo through paced: there are many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
that have much zeal and affection, but
are not ſo ſolid in their judgments; but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30639:20"/>
this argues much weakeneſſe in grace.</p>
            <p>9. A weak Chriſtian is one that cannot

as it was in the Creation; it is not with
the Trees of Righteouſneſſe, as it was with
the Trees of Paradiſe, which were created
all perfect at the firſt: but it is not ſo in the
Work of Grace, we are not perfectly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
nor at once, but we perfect holineſſe in
the fear of God, and that by degrees; and
God hath given to ſome of his people but
ſmall beginnings and meaſures of grace, and
that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. To put a difference between our eſtate
on earth, and our being in heaven. In heaven
we ſhall all have an equal ſtature in grace,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30639:21"/>
though it be diſputed that there are different
degrees of glory. But in heaven the <hi>ſpirits of
juſt men</hi> ſhall all be <hi>made perfect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23</note> and there
we ſhall all come unto the <hi>meaſure of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> All believers here
are juſtified by God alike. God doth not
acquit the ſtrong, and hold guilty the weak,
but juſtification is alike to all, but our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
is not alike, but when we come to
heaven, our ſanctification ſhall be then as
our Juſtification is now, that is, perfect and
equal, we ſhall have not only a perfection of
parts, but of degrees.</p>
            <p>2. This is to make men live in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
dependance upon divine influxe and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
from the Spirit of God. If children
ſhould be born perfect men as <hi>Adam</hi> was
created, we ſhould not then ſee that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
need of, &amp; dependance on our Parents.
We are bred in the womb, and afterward
born in the world, and then by degrees grow
up from ſtature to ſtature; and ſo it is in
grace, God deals thus—Converting grace
doth not make us ſo perfect as we ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
At the firſt Creation he made the
trees all fruitful, and at their full growth;
but now 'tis otherwiſe, they are firſt kernels
or ſeeds, then plants before they are grown
trees, and they have dependance on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of heaven: ſo we are firſt babes, then
young men, and then ſtrong men in Chriſt,
to keep our ſouls in a dependance on Gods
grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:30639:22"/>
3. For the greater ornament of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
body of Chriſt. In a natural body, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
member ſhould be of an equal bigneſſe, the
body would be monſtrous: but the body is ſo
proportioned in its different members, that
the leſſer become ſerviceable to the greater,
and ſo they all orderly diſcharge their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
operations. As in Muſick there would
be no harmony, if the ſtrings were all of an
equal bigneſſe; but one ſtring being the baſe,
and the other the treble, that makes the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
to be more melodious; ſo it is in grace,
the different degrees of grace makes the body
of Chriſt more harmonious. It is here as in
ſome curious piece of needle work; if all the
ſilkes were of one colour, it would not ſet
out the work with ſo much luſtre and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
as the variety of colours will do.</p>
            <p>4. To make Gods people ſee a neceſſity of
maintaining fellowſhip and communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to edifie and build up each other.
There would be no need of Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and holy fellowſhip, did not our
weakneſſe require it. As among the members
of the body, God hath ſo ordered them, that
each member is ſerviceable to another, <hi>the
eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 21.</note>
ſo among the people of God, ſome being
weak, others ſtrong, there is a neceſſity of
maintaining Communion together. There
is an inſtinct in nature, that things weak in
themſelves cleave to thoſe things which are
ſtronger then they.<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 26</note> 
               <hi>The Conies are but a feeble
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30639:22"/>
flock, yet make they their houſes in the rocks:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>birds the Dove</hi> the ſillieſt and moſt
ſhiftleſſe creature,<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 14.</note> yet ſhe hides her ſelf in <hi>the
clefts of the rock;</hi> the Vine among the trees the
weakeſt, yet it clings to the wall; the Hopps
among the plants, yet it twines about the
pole. So God hath ordered it in his infinite
wiſdom, that ſome Chriſtians ſhould be
ſtronger, and ſome weaker in grace, that the
ſtrong may help the weake, and each be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to one another.</p>
            <p>5. To ſet out the glory of God in all his
glorious attributes.</p>
            <p>1. This different ſize of grace in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
doth glorifie the mercy of God, and the
free grace of God, who when there are ſome
Chriſtians that have but a little grace, yet
God rewards thoſe ſmall meaſures of grace
with great meaſures of glory.</p>
            <p>1. This magnifies the power of God, who
when we are weak, yet the great God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
his power in our weakneſſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9, 10.</note> yea, <hi>his
ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> And
therefore <hi>Paul</hi> addes, <hi>verſ. 10. For when I am
weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> that is, <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> Is it
not a demonſtration of great power, to keep
a ſmall ſparke of fire that it ſhall not be
quenched in a flood of water? yet behold
that little ſpark of grace in thee, ſhall not be
quenched in thee by the flood and torrent
of thy corruptions. It is by Gods power
that the leaſt meaſure of grace ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
There is not ſo much of Gods power
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30639:23"/>
ſeen in preſerving the Angels, as a weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever;
for the Angels, though mutable, yet
are perfect creatures, they have no weights
of ſins and corruptions to pull them down.
But alas! we have ſuch a bias and inclination
to ſin, that we are apt to be turned aſide
from God every moment. The Power of
God is more ſeen in preſerving a poor belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the ſtate of grace, then in preſerving
the Angels in the ſtate of innocency. And as
Gods power is ſeen in preſerving of a little
grace, ſo it's alſo ſeen in the increaſing of
ſmall grace. Grace is like to that cloud w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
the Prophets ſervants ſaw, <hi>which at firſt was
but like a mans hand,</hi> but afterwards, <hi>it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
the whole heavens.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 18 44, 45.</note> True grace is of a

            </p>
            <p>3. God doth hereby glorifie his wiſdome,
As Gods wiſdome is demonſtrated in the
world, by the variety of creatures, which are
not all of the ſame bulk and bigneſſe, but
ſome bigger and ſome leſſer: ſo in the
Church of God, his wiſdom appears, that
ſome Chriſtians are of greater, and ſome of
a leſſer meaſure of grace. Search the whole
Creation and you ſhall find the wiſdome of
God in the variety of Creatures. In the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30639:23"/>
there are the greater and leſſer lights,
and ſo ſtarres of different magnitude, doe
beautifie and beſpangle the heavens: ſo in the
ſea there are greater and leſſer fiſhes: in the
air the great Eagle and little Sparrow: on
the earth the Elephant and little Dog: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the creeping things there's the great
Serpent and the little Piſmire: amongſt the
vegetables, the tall Cedar and the Hyſop on
the wall: And alſo amongſt the rationall
Creatures, there is a Gyant and a Dwarfe: a
grown man of a tall ſtature, and a childe but
of a ſpan long. So is Gods wiſdome greatly
illuſtrated, that as there is variety of natural
proportions in the world; ſo there are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
proportions of grace in his Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his children.</p>
            <p>Before I come to apply this point, which
is of very great uſe to Gods children, for
their comfort; I ſhall lay down ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Poſitions about ſmall meaſures of
grace.</p>
            <p>That in the Church there are found more
weak Chriſtians then ſtrong,<note place="margin">1. Poſit.</note> more young
Converts then old and grown Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>As in a Forreſt there are more young
ſprouts then old trees, in a garden more
young ſlips then old roots, in the world
more young children then old men. In <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh</hi>
there were 120000 Infants, but there
was not ſuch a number of old men.<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">Jer. 46. 23.</note> in the aire
there are more ſwarms of flies, then flocks of
birds; ſo in the Church of God there are
more that are young and weak Converts
then old Chriſtians. It is with moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
as it was with <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſignal arrows,
which he ſhot to warn <hi>David</hi> by,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20. 36.</note> of which

where one Chriſtian ſhoots home <hi>to

Jeſus,</hi> there are many fall ſhort.</p>
            <p>That there are many that have but weak
meaſures and ſmall beginnings of grace,<note place="margin">2. Poſit.</note>
who have been a long time under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Religion, and under the means of
grace; ſuch were the Hebrews, <hi>who for the time
that they ought to be teachers, yet had need that
one ſhould teach them again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>which be the firſt
Principles of the Oracles of God, and are become
ſuch as have need of milk and not of ſtrong meat;</hi>
and I may accommodate to this purpoſe
that ſpeech of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 30</note> 
               <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall
be laſt, and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi> There are
many who went out early, and took as it
were the firſt ſtep in Profeſſion of Religion;
and yet others have over-gone them, who
went out after them. Many who have but
weak meaſures of grace, have been of long
ſtanding under the meanes of grace. And
therefore Chriſtians are not to judge the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30639:24"/>
ſtrength of grace by their Profeſſion, but by
their Proficiency; It is not how many yeares
you have been Profeſſors, but what experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

theſe expreſſions gather this, that a <hi>little faith</hi>
unexerciſed, as to comfort, is as good as no
faith: it was ſo little, it was as good as none
in that particular exigence they were in;
you may have a little grace, and yet as to
comfort, that little and weak grace may not
further thee in a way of ſtrong conſolation.
Not but that a weak Chriſtian is accepted,
that the weaker Chriſtian may lie in his
Fathers boſome;—yet it is the ſtrength of
grace that gives us ſtrong conſolation.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider, that ſmall meaſures of grace,
though they may bring you to heaven, yet
they are not ſo uſefull to others; a weak
Chriſtian cannot do much good in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

and ſo were not fit for that ſtrong duty

thoſe young <hi>Abijahs,</hi> in whom there is
found but ſome little good. Let ſuch know
to their comfort,</p>
            <p>1. Though thy grace be but little in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
yet it is much in value. A pearle, though
but litle in ſubſtance, yet it is of great worth,
ſo a little grace is of great value; <hi>The heart of a
wicked man is nothing worth;</hi> you may have
much knowledge, and ſeeming grace, but no
true worth. A ſhop full of barrels will not
make a man rich, unleſſe thoſe veſſels be full
of commodities: gifts as to heaven, are but
the lumber of a Chriſtian, it is grace that
makes him rich towards God.</p>
            <p>2. Though thy grace be little for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet it will grow for the future to a
greater meaſure.<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 31 32.</note> The little <hi>grain of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed

            <p>4. The weakeſt Chriſtian hath grace alike
for quality, though not for quantity, though
thy grace be not ſo much; yet it is as true as
others: though but a convert of yeſterday:
yet grace as true as of an old Stander in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.—<hi>Faith is alike precious</hi> in all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note>

            <p>2. The Object, it holds upon the ſame
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. The Means of working it are the ſame,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Word and Spirit. A little grace
is true grace. Fire in the ſparke is as
well fire as the flame: the filings of
gold are gold, as well as the whole
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30639:27"/>
wedge, a drop of water is water, as
well as the whole Ocean. A little grace
is true grace.</p>
            <p>4. The End, it hath the ſame ſalvation of
ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>5. God will not put your weak grace to
tryal beyond your ſtrength;<note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 8.</note> 
               <hi>God will debate

            </p>

thou ſeeſt ſin and its ſinfulneſſe. And it was
in the firſt creation, the firſt thing that was
created was light: ſo in the ſecond creation,
the firſt work is <hi>to open the eyes of the blind,
and to turn them from darkneſſe to light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 26. 18</note> 
               <hi>and
from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Upon the
work of converſion in the ſouie, the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of grace is to be inlightned with the
<hi>light of the living</hi> So that where this light is
wanting;<note place="margin">Job 33. 30.</note> there cannot be a work of grace.</p>
            <p>2. A ſetled and fixed purpoſe of heart to
leave ſin, and to cleave unto God.—Grace
doth not conſiſt ſo much in an actual mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of ſin, as in an unfeigned and ſettled
purpoſe of heart to leave every ſin.</p>
            <p>The Prodigals reſolution to go to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 17, 18.</note> argued ſome grace in him. <hi>I
will ariſe and go to my fathers houſe,</hi> that is, I
will leave my wicked company and courſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and it is ſaid, <hi>His father ſaw him afar off, and
ran and met him.</hi> The Lord did work in him
a purpoſe to leave his ſin. <hi>Gregory</hi> on this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30639:28"/>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Greg.</note> 
               <hi>That remiſſion of ſin came to his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Confeſſion breake out in his ſpeech to his
father.</hi> So <hi>David, I acknowledged my ſin unto
thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I ſaid
I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion to the Lord, and
thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
obſerves on this place, <hi>That David doth not
ſay he did confeſſe, but he purpoſed to confeſſe hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſin,</hi>
and yet this his purpoſe was true grace,
though one of the leaſt meaſures of grace.
That holy purpoſe of <hi>David</hi> argued grace
in him, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 17. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I have purpoſed and will
not tranſgreſſe thy law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 106.</note> 
               <hi>I have ſworn and will
perform it, that I wil keep thy righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
It argues grace when a ſoul doth <hi>cleave
unto the Lord with ful purpoſe of heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 11. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Another low meaſure of grace is this;
A ſenſible complaint of the want of grace.
Thus he that came to Chriſt, and ſaid with
teares, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief,</hi> he
had grace.<note place="margin">Mar. 9. 24.</note> He doth not ſay, Lord help my
faith, but <hi>Lord help my unbelief.</hi> His expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
about his unbelief, did note not onely
his want, but his ſenſibleneſſe of his want.
This is that <hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> which hath the
firſt place in the Beatitudes;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 3.</note> this is the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
round of the ladder. The Apoſtle tels us,
<hi>That the Spirit helps our infirmities, in ſighs and
groans that cannot be uttered.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> Obſerve here,
that it's not ſaid the Spirit helps us with
comforts and joyes, but <hi>with ſighs and groans,</hi>
whence we may learn that the Spirits help is
as well <hi>in ſighs and groans,</hi> and ſenſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30639:29"/>
of our wants, as in holy raviſhments.
Strength of grace is ſeen in holy joyes and
raviſhments of Spirit, but truth of grace
may be ſeen &amp; diſcerned in ſighs, groans and
complaints of our wants; they are ſaid to be
<hi>ſighes and groans which cannot be uttered,</hi> not
in regard of their greatneſſe; but (as Maſter
<hi>Perkins</hi> obſerves) in regard of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Perkins.</hi> Curae leves loqueuntur, ingentes ſtupent.</note>
               <hi>Gods children at firſt wanting ability to
expreſſe their own thoughts.</hi> To be ſenſible of
the want of grace is grace; for nature cannot
make a man duly ſenſible of the want of
grace, nor ſenſibly to complain of that want.</p>
            <p>4. Earneſt deſire after more grace, argues
there is grace in the ſoul, though it be but
ſmall. I do not place the beginning of grace
in an ability to exerciſe grace; but rather in
an earneſt deſire after grace. Deſire after
grace, is accounted by God the grace it ſelfe
we deſire; for ſo we finde that <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to fear the Lord, is counted for actuall
fearing God.<note place="margin">Neh. 1. 11. compared with Neh. 5.</note> Deſires are the ſeeds of grace,
and the graces themſelves are the bloſſomes
and ſweet fruit that ſpring from thence;
grace exerciſed is the fruit of a holy deſire
after grace.</p>
            <p>That the deſires after grace is in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
grace, may be thus demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>1. Gods people have appealed unto God,
concerning the uprightneſſe of their hearts,
meerly by their deſires;—ſo ſaith the
Church.<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>The d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſire of our ſoul is to thy name,
and the remembrance of thee; and with my
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30639:29"/>
ſoul have I deſired thee in the night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. God hath made many gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
not only to the acting and exerciſing of
grace, but to the deſires after grace. <hi>Bleſſed are
they that do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 6.</note>
               <hi>for they ſhal be filled.—If any man thirſt</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt) <hi>let him come unto me and drink;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 37.</note>
nay there is a general and univerſal invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>to every one that thirſteth, to come to the
waters;</hi> and God hath promiſed <hi>to give to him
that is at hirſt of the fountain of the water of life
freely.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 1.</note> The Lord hath promiſed <hi>to fulfil the
deſire of thoſe that fear him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and wil heare the
deſire of the humble.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 145. 19</note> So that by theſe promiſes
it doth appear,<note place="margin">Pſal. 10. 17.</note> that hungring and thirſting,
&amp; deſires after grace, are graces in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and acceptation.</p>
            <p>Now leſt men ſhould reſt in lazy and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
deſires, and thereby neglect the exerciſe
of grace, I ſhall give you an account in what
ſenſe the Scripture reckons upon deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grace, to be grace.</p>
            <p>1. They are ſupernatural deſires. 'Tis true
there are natural deſires in the ſoul after that
which is good,—it is the language of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6.</note>
               <hi>Who wil ſhow us any good;</hi> now theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
may and do ariſe from the motion of
the natural and unſanctified will of man;
and theſe deſires are after happineſſe, and
not after holineſſe; ſuch were the deſires of
<hi>Balaam:</hi> who ſaid,<note place="margin">Numb. 23. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi> This
was but a natural deſire. But true deſires in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30639:30"/>
the ſoul are after heaven, for holineſſe ſake.<note place="margin">Veluntatem fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is, non mediorum. Bern.</note>
               <hi>Bernard</hi> notably ſets out theſe deſires of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
men,—<hi>That they have a deſire of the
End, and not of the Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Deſires</hi> after grace are joyned with holy
<hi>indeavours;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle joyns
<hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> together;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note> to intimate that
<hi>true deſires</hi> are alwayes joyned with <hi>zealous
indeavours.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle alſo joyneth a
<hi>readineſſe of will,</hi> and <hi>performance</hi> together.
God will never accept the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi>
unleſſe there be an indeavour to performe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 11.</note>
what we ſay we are willing to do. And
therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> rightly deſcribes, how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
deſires are without indeavours. <hi>The
deſires of the flothfull</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>kil him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his hands refuſe to labour. Bernard</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes
the lazineſſe to the life: <hi>Carnal men
love to obtain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 21. 25</note> 
               <hi>but love not to follow Chriſt: they
will not indeavour to ſeek him whom they deſire
so finde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conales cupiunt Chriſtum conſequi, ſed non ſe quinon cu rant quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere quem deſiderant iavenire</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Deſires which are true and gratious are
unſatisfiable; thus <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires:
<hi>My ſoul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>breaketh for the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it hath to thy judgments at all times;</hi> yea
he further deſcrib es the ardency and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiableneſſe
of his deſires by the <hi>Harts panting
after the water-brooks.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bern.</note> The Hart is naturally
the moſt thirſty of all creatures,<note place="margin">—Pſal. 119. 20.</note> but this
thirſt is much increaſed when the poor
beaſt is chaſed with dogs: even ſo the true
deſires of the ſoul after grace,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 1.</note> are earneſt,
ardent and vehement deſires.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:30639:30"/>
4. You may know true deſires after grace
by their Object. Deſires they are not graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
if they be more after outward things
then after God.<note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 2.</note> So <hi>David, My ſoul thirſteth
after God, after the living God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 1.</note> 
               <hi>My ſoul thirſteth
for thee, my fleſh longeth after thee in a dry and
thirſty land where no water is.</hi> Thus his ſoul
longed, <hi>and did break</hi> with longing after
Gods judgements.—Now therefore would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou know whether thou haſt any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of grace in thy ſoul,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 20</note> examine what thy
deſires are; perhaps thou canſt not pray, but
thou deſireſt to pray: perhaps thou canſt not
mourn for ſin, but doſt thou mourn that
thou canſt not mourn? Perhaps thou doſt
not believe, (as thou feareſt) but doſt thou
deſire to believe? Perhaps thou canſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
but doſt thou deſire to repent, and doſt
thou labour to repent? Then thou mayeſt
conclude that thou haſt ſome beginnings of
true grace in thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>5. We may know the truth of grace
though it be little, by the earneſt deſire after
the Word and the means of grace.—Thus
<hi>Peter</hi> ſets forth our deſires,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>As new born babes
deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may
grow thereby.</hi> There is in a child a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
as ſoon as ever it is born, to deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the mothers breaſt: the Apoſtle makes it
a reſemblance of a ſpiritual man; a man ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
new born, wil deſire after the Word,
the means of grace, that he may grow in
grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:30639:31"/>
6. An indeared love to thoſe that have
grace.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>By this you know you are paſt from death
to life, becauſe you love the brethren.</hi> Caſuiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this text, ſay, that love to Gods children
is the firſt grace, and firſt appears in young
converts. The natives in New <hi>England,</hi> it is
obſerved, upon their converſion, (for God
hath begun there to bring ſome of thoſe
poor creatures <hi>from darkneſs to light, and from
the power of Satan to himſelf</hi>) the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of grace in them, is in their love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to thoſe that are truly gracious. Thus I
have ſhewed you an anſwer to the queſtion,
what are the leaſt meaſures of grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, or ſome of them, a man cannot be
ſaid to have grace, and whereſoever any of
theſe are, that mans condition is ſafe, and
theſe little meaſures of grace will bring a
man to heaven.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here lay down ſome cautions to
prevent miſ-application.—</p>
            <p>Though theſe ſmall meaſures of grace are
ſaving,<note place="margin">1. Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> yet you muſt not content your ſelves
with them. Take heed, leſt what I have ſaid,
for the ſupport of the weakneſſe of ſome
Chriſtians, become not a pillow for the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of others; <hi>But let us ſtriue to go on unto
perfection.</hi> We muſt not ſit down with any
meaſure of grace.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> And to perſwade you
hereunto;</p>
            <p>1. Conſider, that things meerly neceſſary
and ſufficient to maintain a natural life, wil
not content a man: what man is content,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30639:31"/>
though he hath clothes enough to hide his
nakedneſs, and food enough to keep life and
ſoul together?—But he deſires not onely
clothes for nakedneſs, but ornament, &amp; not
only food for hunger and neceſſity, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
Now ſhall men be unbounden after
their deſires for outward things, and ſhall
they ſit down and ſay they have enough for
heavenly things?</p>
            <p>2. Conſider, if thou contenteſt thy ſelf
with a ſmall meaſure of grace, though thou
ſhalt have the fruit of thy grace when thou
dieſt, yet thou wilt want the comfort of thy
grace whileſt thou liveſt. It is ſtrength of
grace that gives aſſurance. Weak grace will
bring thy ſoule to heaven, but it is the
ſtrength of grace will bring heaven into thy
ſoul.<note place="margin">Iſa. 32. 17.</note> 
               <hi>The work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace,
and the effect of Righteouſneſs ſhall be quietneſs
and aſſurance for ever.</hi> A childe of God hath
ſeldom peace and comfort from the habit of
Righteouſneſs, but from the exerciſe of
Righteouſneſs. <hi>He that lacketh theſe things</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Peter) is blinde, and cannot ſee afar off,
&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 9, 10, 11.</note> This is not ſpoken of wicked men who
have no grace, but of ſuch who have grace:
and becauſe they exerciſe it not, do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the comfortable fruits of grace in their
ſouls. A little faith unexerciſed, is as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
(as we have ſhewed) as good as no
faith.<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 26. <hi>compared with</hi> Mar. 4. 40.</note>—They that adde not to the ftocke
of grace, will want the comfort of grace. So
that a weak Chriſtian, who is compared by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30639:32"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> to a pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>blinde man: <hi>He cannot ſee</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the eye-ſight of his faith is weak) <hi>afar
off;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> he cannot ſee his name writ in heaven;
—He will want the comfortable evidence
of grace in his heart, who contents himſelf
with meaſures of grace.</p>
            <p>The ſecond caution is, Take not thoſe
things to be evidences of the <hi>truth</hi> of grace,<note place="margin">2. Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
which are evidences onely of the <hi>growth</hi> and
<hi>ſtrength</hi> of grace. <hi>Weak Converts</hi> do involve
themſelves in a Labyrinth of miſery, in
judging themſelves by thoſe ſymptomes,
which are evidences only of the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of
grace. Thou muſt not judge thy ſelf whether
thou art in the ſtate of grace by this; as
whether thou haſt raviſhing joyes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Holy Ghoſt; theſe are things
that God indulgeth to ſome few, and thoſe
of a long ſtanding in the ſchool of Chriſt.
In a <hi>School,</hi> a ſcholler muſt not compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with one of the higheſt Form: if thou
wouldeſt judge of the truth of thy grace,
judge by the loweſt meaſure. The reaſon
why hypocrites and low-form Chriſtians
do miſtake, is this: hypocrites judge they
have grace becauſe they have gifts, and weak
Chriſtians judge they have no grace becauſe
they do not finde ſuch meaſures of grace in
them as are in others. We do not uſe to ſay,
it is not day becauſe it is not noon.—It is
unthankfulneſs to God, and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to our ſelves, to argue a nullity of grace
from the weakneſs of it; &amp; therefore if thou
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30639:32"/>
canſt not ſay, I ſee my grace, yet it's well if
thou canſt ſay, Bleſſed be God, I ſee my ſin; If
thou canſt not ſay that thou leaveſt ſin, yet
it's well if thou canſt ſay, I have a full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of heart to do ſo: if thou canſt but cry
out for the want of grace, yet comfort thy
ſelf, and do not conclude thou haſt no grace</p>
            <p>Do not conclude you have ſmall meaſures
of grace,<note place="margin">3. Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> becauſe you have but ſmal meaſures
of comfort; this is the fault of young con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
they take meaſure of their grace by
their comfort, which is a falſe and deceitful
rule; growth of grace is not to be meaſured
by the working of joy: the ſweet bloſſome
of joy may fall off, when the fruit of grace
may come on; yea ſometimes Chriſtians of
the greateſt meaſure of grace, may have the
leaſt meaſure of comfort; and all to let us
know, that as the being and exerciſe, ſo the
comforts of our graces comes from free
grace. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
above his fellows, and was full of
grace and truth, yet in the time of his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was without comfort, when by reaſon
of the ſuſpenſion of the favour of God his
Father, he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why
haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> And ſo ſometimes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
that have but little meaſures of grace,
may have much comfort; and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that flaſh of joy that young converts
have; it is Gods indulgence towards them,
to give them great joy at their firſt converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and indeed their joy at that time is the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30639:33"/>
more taken notice of, becauſe uſually ſuch
have much trouble of minde when they
paſs through the pangs of the new birth,
the change is then ſpecifical, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
is but gradual: and ſo though they
have afterwards more grace, more ſetled joys
and comforts, yet at their firſt converſion
they may have more ſenſe of their joyes,
though afterwards they may find an increaſe
of grace, when joy may be as real, though
not ſo ſenſible; and therefore do not judge
thy grace by thy comfort.</p>
            <p>Do not conclude the meaſure of thy grace
little,<note place="margin">4. Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> becauſe thou haſt but a little meaſure
of gifts. Gifts are the iſſues of time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and the fruits of ſtudies advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the ſtrength of natural parts. A man
may have a quick and pregnant invention, a
profound judgement, a retentive memory, a
clear elocution, and the like, and yet none
of theſe things can be arguments of grace,
but all are but natural endowments. Gifts
may be high, and grace may be low: Thus
it was with the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> they
were <hi>inriched with utterance and knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 5. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note>
and they came behind other Churches in no
gift; and yet the Apoſtle ſpeaks of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they were very low in
grace:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1, 3</note> for ſo he taxeth them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 1. that
<hi>they were not ſpiritual, but carnal men, Babes in
Chriſt,</hi> that by reaſon of their <hi>envying, ſtrife
and diviſions, they were carnal, and walked as
men;</hi> thus the Church of <hi>Laodicea was rich,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30639:33"/>

So gifts may carry men far from matter of
diſcourſe about Religion, but its only grace
that inables a man to practice Religion. A
childe of God that hath but a little meaſure

            <p>The truth and eſſence of grace is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
ſo much by good acts,<note place="margin">2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> as by good

ſaith Chriſt to the Spouſe? God reckons of
our beauty by our love, and of our perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the ſincerity of our affections. Natural
abilities, to which formaliſts and hypocrites
may come up, may and doe reſemble good
actions, but they cannot come up to good
affections. A Painter may paint the colour
of the face, but his art cannot give heat unto
the picture. Good actions may give you
the reſemblance of a Chriſtian. So what
<hi>Jehu</hi> did reſembled a true Reformer; but
they are good affections that doe ſet out the
life and heat of true grace. Judge they grace
therefore by thy affections, and take comfort
in this, though thou art little and low in
actions, if thou art warm and working in
thy affections.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt comfort is this, That
little grace ſhall be laſting grace.<note place="margin">3. And laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> had

but haſt perſerverance in grace. The moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

ſhall not quench the leaſt meaſure; the leaſt
ſpark of true grace, the moſt boyſterous blaſt
of temptation ſhall not extinguiſh this poor
ſmoaking flax, not one drop of his divine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30639:35"/>
oyntment ſhall be ſpilt as water upon the

they fall;<note place="margin">Stella ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens non eſt ſtella.</note> to ſhew that it was a Comet and
not a Star.—True Stars doe not, cannot
fall. Oh then bleſſe God, who though in his
anger, <hi>he breaks the Nations like a Potters vessel
with an iron mace;</hi> yet ſuch is his tenderneſſe
over weak believers, <hi>he will not break the

laſts. A child of God may be toſſed
by reaſon of corruption and temptation in

the Scriptures the Compaſſe, the Promiſes
the Tacklings, Hope the Anchor, Faith the

            <p>HAving finiſhed the former part of the

I come now to the ſecond part, which is
this, <hi>That God doth exactly take notice, tenderly

and the ſmalleſt meaſures of grace in the
hearts of his people.</hi>

            <p>In the proſecution of which point, I ſhall

            <p>1. I ſhall prove the truth of it.</p>
            <p>2. I wil alſo endeavour to give you the
grounds hereof, and then make application.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that God doth thus cheriſh the ſmal

1. Theſe Scripture-inſtances,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 10</note>

regards not the flame only,<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 13.</note> but the ſmoking

takes not onely notice of the leaſt good that
is in his people, but he eyes alſo the common
good that is in ſuch as have no grace; thus
when the young man came to Chriſt,—though
he had no true grace, yet it is ſaid,
<hi>Jeſus loved him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 21</note> And he took notice of that

               <note place="margin">Mar. 12. 34</note> and ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art not far
from the Kingdom of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The truth of this point, may be made
out by thoſe ſweet and gracious promiſes,
God hath made to grace though weak I wil
give you one inſtead of many, mentioned
by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa 40. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He ſhall feed his flock

lead thoſe that are with young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. By counſels that Chriſt giveth to us,
how we our ſelves ſhould carry our ſelves to
thoſe that are weak, <hi>viz.</hi> to uſe them with all

others, then ſurely himſelfe wil deal with

argument why the rich ſhould not deſpiſe
the poor, and ſo why the rich in grace
ſhould not deſpiſe thoſe that are poore in
grace; for God made and faſhioned them
both. Now what is a reaſon unto us, God is
alſo pleaſed to make a reaſon unto himſelf,
<hi>That he will not forſake what he hath formed;</hi>
for ſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, The Lord that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thee O</hi> Jacob,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and be that formed thee O</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<hi>fear not; for I have redeemed thee; I have

again, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that made thee and

yea though he be the <hi>worme Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 1.</note> yet
God that made him will not cruſh him, but
cheriſh him. See a gratious promiſe made to
thoſe that have but little grace, upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ground, that God is the Author of that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30639:38"/>
little grace. <hi>Thy people alſo ſhall be all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
they ſhall inberit the land for ever, the branch

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>I the Lord will

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord will perfect his work that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his People,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 138. 8.</note> i.e. He will perfect and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the leaſt beginnings of grace, becauſe
<hi>Grace is his work in his ſervants.</hi> It is a very
good argument in Prayer, <hi>O Lord, for ſake not
the work of thy hands.</hi> And though in reſpect
of outward things God may deſtroy <hi>him
whom his hands have made and faſhioned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 10. 8.</note> but
it is otherwiſe in reſpect of grace. God will
not deſtroy any meaſure of grace which is
the work of his hands. Property is the
ground of love, care and tenderneſſe: as a
man will look to a weak childe, becauſe it is
his childe, and will repair a weak houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the houſe wherein he dwells. And
that is the third demonſtration of Gods ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
care over his people, that the meaneſt
meaſure of grace ſhall not be deſerted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
becauſe God is the Author of it.</p>
            <p>A fourth reaſon may be drawn from the
Covenant of grace, the nature and tenor
whereof, is to accept of ſincerity in ſtead of
perfection, deſires for deeds, purpoſes for
performances, pence for pounds, and mites
for millions; and therefore God will accept
and reward the leaſt meaſure of grace, that
is, in truth and ſincerity. God requires of

gloſſe upon it, as if God did not ſee ſin in his

ſins: But the meaning is, that God ſees not
ſin in his people, ſo as eternally to puniſh it.—And
moreover, the moſt proper ſenſe of
that place is this, That whereas <hi>Balak</hi> hired
<hi>Balaam</hi> to eurſe the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
that falſe Prophet for the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
was ready enough to have taken

all occaſions of curſing them, yet he could
not faſten any curſe upon them at that time,
becauſe there was no provoking ſin amongſt

of the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> women,<note place="margin">Vid. Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in loc.</note> he
drew <hi>Iſrael</hi> to idolatry and adultery, and ſo
made them fall. But God doth ſee ſin in his
own people, yea the leaſt ſin, yea he eyes
their failings, though not to damne them
for them, yet to chaſtiſe them for them. God
ſees the purpoſes of ſin, as well as the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of grace. It is ſaid of <hi>Balak,</hi> that he
aroſe and warred againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now we
doe not read that ever <hi>Baalak</hi> did actually
wage warre againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſh. 24. 9.</note> onely he did

            <p>Learn from hence,<note place="margin">2. Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> That the ſame minde
ſhould be in Chriſtians of greater growth to
the weak, as was in Chriſt Jeſus; who

his Scutchion, and wilt thou give the Lion
ſhall he like a Lambe be meek and gentle, and
thou like the Lion be ſtout, haughty and
ſtately, that contemns all the beaſts of the
Forreſt? Oh be not you ſupercilious and
contemptuous towards weak Chriſtians,
who are injured and diſcouraged by ſtrong
Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>1. When they are put upon ſuch auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Religion, as are far beyond their
ſtrength and growth. When theſe poor, torn
tottered and rent bottles are put upon to
hold new wine, alas poor ſouls,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 16, 17.</note> they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
wherefore Chriſt proportions
his doctrine to their capacities, and will not
ſay that to them which they cannot at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
hear, and ſo proportions out their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to their abilities, and will not out match
their ſtrength with his commands. Faſting
and ſuffering was a hard duty, and therfore
he will excuſe them till they have had more
time and more experience in the wayes of
God, till the Holy Ghoſt come down upon
them, and they have more grace; which is a
good rule for us, not to diſcourage young
beginners in the ſchoole of Chriſt, not to
put them to read ſuch Authors as are above
their capacities.</p>
            <p>2. When ſtrong Chriſtians are too ſharp
and rigorous in bitter reproofs, for the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and infirmities of weak Chriſtians.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30639:40"/>
Young converts like young twigges muſt be
gently handled, elſe you will break them;
you muſt excuſe their failings, hide their
wants, commend their performances, cheriſh
their forwardneſſe, reſolve their doubts, bear
their burdens, and by this gentleneſſe bring
them into a love of Religion, that they may
not diſtaſte it as ſoon as they know it.</p>
            <p>3. By ſetting light by their gifts. Alas,
how ſoon is the ſmoaking flax quenched,
by the too much ſuperciliouſneſſe of thoſe
that think themſelves bright torches? how
eaſily is the poor ſpark of grace trod out by
the <hi>foat of pride?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. By puzling them with doubtful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
contrary to that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Him
that is weake, in the faith receive, but not unto
doubtfull diſput ations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. By giving them ill example. Weak
Chriſtians are more apt to be led by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
then by Precept:<note place="margin">Gal. 2, 12, 13.</note> When <hi>Peter, who was a
Pillar in the Church, and a ſtrong Chriſtian, for
fear of Perſecution for ſook the Gentiles, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
and withdrew himſelfe, then others of
the Jewes, (which in all likelihood were weak
Chriſtians) diſſembled alſo.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> argues
to abſtain from giving ill example, about
the eating the <hi>Idolothyta; If any man ſee thee
which haſt knowledge,</hi> i.e. <hi>who art a ſtrong
Chriſtian, ſit at meas in the Idols Temple, ſhall
not the conſcience of him that is weak, he imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
to eat thoſe things that are offered to idols?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let Chriſtians learn from,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30639:41"/>
God, to cheriſh the weak beginnings of
grace in the people of God. <hi>Look not on me,</hi>
ſaith the Church, <hi>becauſe I am black, becauſe
the Sun hath looked upon me,</hi> i.e. look not on
me with a lofty and diſdainful look, and
with a coy countenance; and then the
Church addes, <hi>My mothers children were angry
with me,</hi> that is, other Congregations and
People did diſeſteem and diſdain me for my
infirmity.<note place="margin">Heb. 1. ult.</note> But this should not be amongſt
Chriſtians, but the ſtrong ſhould cheriſh the
weak. Angels deſpiſe not the pooreſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
but do miniſter unto them.</p>
            <p>Learn from hence,<note place="margin">3. Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> how God doth by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and degrees, carry on in the hearts of
his people the work of grace unto further
perfection. Muſhromes and ſuch like worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
things, like <hi>Jonas</hi> his gourd may ſpring
up in one night; but things of moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are of longeſt growth before they
come to perfection. The Elephant amongſt
the Beaſts, and the Oake amongſt the Trees,
and Man amongſt the rational creatures, are
longeſt before they grow up to their full
and perfect dimenſions. And as it is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo it is in grace; there is a progreſſe from
leſſe to greater: all this work is by degrees.
The godly are called <hi>Trees of Righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 3.</note>
and yet this is by degrees. There is firſt the
budding forth of the earth, and then thoſe
things that are ſown ſpring forth, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 11.
And therefore let young Converts learne
from hence not to be diſcouraged. Gods
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30639:41"/>
works both of nature and grace are perfected
by degrees.</p>
            <p>1. Though God regards the leaſt meaſures
of grace,<note place="margin">2. Vſe of Caution.</note> let not this make you regardleſſe
to grow in grace. In the firſt creation God
ſaid to the creatures, <hi>Increaſe and multiply,</hi>
and by vertue of that word the earth brings
forth to this day. Now it is ſo in the new
and ſecond Creation; the Lord expects that
our grace ſhould increaſe and multiply.</p>
            <p>2. Though you have but a little grace,<note place="margin">2. Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> yet
do not deſpiſe it, or diſparage it.—<hi>Oh, do
not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things in the ſoul. Do
not tread upon the bunch of grapes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>upon the
new wine in the cluſter, but ſay, there is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in it.</hi> Do not deſpiſe a little grain of
muſtard-ſeed, it will grow to a tree; true
grace is a ſpark of heaven, do not tread it
out; deſpiſe not the leaſt, and be not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the greateſt meaſure of grace.</p>
            <p>1. Let this comfort thy poor ſoul (Oh
weak Chriſtian!) whoſe burden it is,<note place="margin">3. Vſe of Comfort.</note> that
thou haſt much corruption and but little
grace. God will look over a great deale of
ſin, and will take notice of the leaſt grace.
God will not in refining his gold and ſilver
loſe one dram of grace, though it lie among
a heap of rubbiſh. Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to have his
Fan in his hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>he will throughly purge his
floore, and gather his wheat into his garner.</hi> Now
the uſe of a Fan is to caſt out the worſt and
keep in the beſt, to drive away the chaffe and
ſave the wheat: ſo Chriſt, though he purge
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30639:42"/>
out the chaffe of corruption, yet he will ſave
and preſerve every grain of grace. It is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
with the devils Sieve. Chriſt tells
<hi>Peter, that Satan deſired to ſift him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 31</note> Now the
uſe of the Sieve is contrary to the Fan, for
that keeps the waſte and lets out the beſt. The
devil doth all he can to deſtroy our grace,
and to increaſe our ſin. But 'tis otherwiſe,
God will kill thy corruptions and cheriſh
thy graces, and if the leaſt grace be in the
ſoul, though with a mixture of much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
God will not deſpiſe it.</p>
            <p>God carries the moſt tender regard to
thoſe that are weak in grace;<note place="margin">2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> the weak child
is ſtill carried in our armes, and the weakeſt
of the flock the good ſhepherd will carry in
his boſome.<note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 11.</note> Chriſt gave <hi>Peter</hi> charge in the
firſt place <hi>to feed his Lambs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 21. 15</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Gods care over weak Chriſtians is ſuch
that <hi>he will not ſuffer them to be tempted above
what they are able, but with the temptation will
make a way to eſcape, that they ſhall be able to

and the wiſe Phyſician of our ſoules will
mercifully weigh every grain of every doſe,
and will not outmatch their ſtrength whoſe
ſtrength is ſmall.</p>
            <p>2. God will not put them on difficult du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at the firſt.—Chriſt taught his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ſuch doctrines as their weakneſſe could
bear.</p>
            <p>3. God will bear with their infirmities; he

               <hi>Baldwin</hi> gives this reaſon, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſayes

            </p>
            <p>The true reaſons, why <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Timothy</hi>
his ſon, were</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was aged, and <hi>Timothy</hi>

the younger ſonnes.</p>

<hi>Timothy</hi> loved <hi>Paul</hi> as a father.</p>

            <p>Before I come to the main doctrines, let

upon theſe reaſons <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Timothy</hi> his

            <p>There are two obſervations which I ſhall

            <p>That believers are not to reſt ſatisfied in weak<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note>

            <p>That Chriſt is the ſubject in which all grace

receive all their grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the opening of the firſt doctrine, the
firſt thing is to make it appeare,</hi> That belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
muſt not reſt ſatisfied with weak meaſures
of grace received, but muſt labour after more
grace. <hi>And this I ſhall prove</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By inſtances of two ſorts. 1. That belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

grace is like a little mote, which is not ſeen
becauſe it is little. Little grace is as it were no

of Gods love to be preſumption,
their zeale to be lukewarmneſſe, their grace
to be but gifts, and (as here) their faith to be
but unbeliefe. It is ſtrong grace which gives

It is the Apoſtles prayer in the Inſcription

of many of his Epiſtles, <hi>that grace and peace
may be multiplied:</hi> If therefore you doe not

of a total lack of grace, (as hath been ſhewn)
for as after is expreſſed, he is purged from

            <p>4. Weak grace under great trials wil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a man to doubts and falls, as if he had
no grace at all; little grace wil keep a man
in ſmall trials, but not in greater. Little grace,
as to the ſtrait a man may be in, may be as
good as no grace; and therefore when the

let me ſhut up this Sermon, with a ſharp and
juſt reproofe of many profeſſors in our time,
who go from one ordinance to another, and
yet make little progreſſe or increaſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
They may be fitly compared to a
company of Ants, who are very buſie about
a mole-hill, and run to and fro, but never
grow great: Even ſo we have many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
they run from one Church to another,
from one Preacher to another, and it may
be from one opinion to another, but never
grow up in the true grace, and in the true
knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.—But I ſhall
meet with ſuch people hereafter in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.—</p>

that there was more grace required to ſuffer
for the name of Chriſt, then to believe on
the name of Chriſt, and accordingly as is
our ſtrength of grace, ſo is our courage for

we have in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who
was a diſciple of Chriſt, but ſecretly for fear
of the Jews.—But afterwards, when he

               <note place="margin">Mar. 15. 43</note> To profeſſe Chriſt
boldly, in a time when dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
attend that Profeſſion, argues a ſtrong
faith; a weakly Conſtitution dare not go
out, unleſſe the weather be faire; But a ſtrong
body can indure the hardeſt weather. A weak
and young Convert is fitter to live in the
proſperity of the Goſpel; but an old expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Chriſtian like an old tried ſouldier,
will not ſhrink in the hardeſt trials.—<hi>If

            </p>
            <p>He is one that is able to govern his tongue,<note place="margin">7. Anſw.</note>
that though paſſion be in the heart, yet
through the ſtrength of his grace he bridles
it in, and reſtraines it, ſo as it ſhall not break
into open railings, revilings and clamours
as others do. St. <hi>James</hi> gives this character
of a ſtrong Chriſtian;<note place="margin">Jam. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>If any man offend not

ſtrength of faith, that though the viſion

argues ſtrength of faith.</p>
            <p>He is one that labours for unity in the
Church,<note place="margin">Anſw. 9.</note> as wel as for purity in the Church.
He will labour for his power that Chriſts
coat ſhall be without rent, as well as with
out ſpot. This character I gather from that
exhortation of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Let us therefore,
as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if
in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall
reveal even this unto you. Nevertheleſſe, whereto
we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame
thing.</hi> It is a note thou art weak, when thou
makeſt a ſtirre in the Church about thy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
weak children are moſt froward; when
children are weak and ſickly, nothing will
pleaſe them: ſo it is with ſome weak ones in
the Church, their humour is ſuch; you know
not how to pleaſe them; but a grown expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Chriſtian is ſober and wiſe, and very
earneſt to preſerve unity in the Church of
Chriſt.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:30639:52"/>
1. Take heed you do not imagine your
ſelves ſtrong in grace, when you are weak;
this is a dangerous miſtake.</p>
            <p>2. Take heed of thinking and judging your
ſelves weak in grace, when you are ſtrong
in grace; this is an uncomfortable miſtake.
<hi>There is a man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) that maketh
himſelf rich,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 13. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and bath nothing; and there is a
man that maketh himſelf poor, and yet hath great
riches.</hi> I would therefore caution you that
you may neither live above nor beneath
what you have, that you may not proudly
fancy you have what you have not, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragedly
fear you want what you indeed
have.</p>
            <p>2. You are not to meaſure the ſtrength of
grace by the length of your Profeſſion.<note place="margin">1 Vſe of Caution.</note> Many
who are long <hi>ſtanders</hi> in the Profeſſion of
Religion, are but <hi>ſlow walkers</hi> in the wayes
and practice of Religion; the ſouls Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in grace, is not the iſſue of length of
time, but the fruit of free grace. There were
thoſe in the Church for ſo long a time, that
they <hi>ought to have been teachers of others,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> but
they had attained but little growth or
ſtrength of grace. They that came at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
houre had their penny, as well as thoſe
that came early into the Vineyard. The
ſcope of which Parable is (as ſome interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſay) to ſhew that thoſe who come late
to the Profeſſion of Religion,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 16 expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> may yet out-go
many in gifts and graces, who have been
long before them in Profeſſion. How many
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30639:52"/>
amongſt us, their years ſpeak them eighty,
but their knowledge and grace not eighteen.</p>
            <p>2. Meaſure not the ſtrength of grace, by
the ſtrength of your affections to ſome of
the wayes of God. The love of a newly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Couple may be more found at firſt, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it's more ſolid. Women who are the
weaker veſſels are uſually more affectionate.
Weak Chriſtians are uſually moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
When the Creeple was cured, we read
that upon his firſt cure he leaped for joy;<note place="margin">Acts 14. 10</note>
it's likely he did not continue to do ſo: the
newneſſe of the change did much affect him,
and ſo it doth young converts.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Meaſure not the ſtrength of grace, by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of the means of grace which you enjoy.</hi>
Alas, <hi>Laodicea</hi> had a glorious light ſhining
amidſt her; ſhe was one of the <hi>ſeven Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</hi>
And becauſe ſhe had ſuch meanes of
grace, ſhe miſtook her ſelfe, ſaying,<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>I am
rich, and increaſed with goods, and have need of
nothing.</hi> But ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Theu knoweſt not
that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor,
and blinde, and naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Meaſure not the ſtrength of grace by the
ſtrength of your gifts.</hi> There is a new diſeaſe
amongſt children called the <hi>Rickets,</hi> when
children grow big in the head, but weak in
their limbs: this diſeaſe is ſpiritually upon
the ſouls of many our of Profeſſors; their
heads grow in reſpect of gifts &amp; knowledge,
but they do not grow ſtrong to walk in the
wayes of God; they are like the <hi>Moon,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30639:53"/>
in light, but not in heat. In the
dayes of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> the gifts of men were
very high, and yet the power of godlineſſe
was at a low ebbe in thoſe dayes; there were
in thoſe times many <hi>ſublime notions, Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſpeculations, curious diſtinctions, ſubtile
objections,</hi> and <hi>elaborate anſwers</hi> to them,
<hi>grave and weighty ſentences;</hi> but alas, but a
little of the power of grace in the hearts of
thoſe men and them they taught.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Caution</hi> is,<note place="margin">2. Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to prevent miſtakes of thoſe
who are apt to judge themſelves weak in
grace, when indeed they are ſtrong in grace.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe thou haſt not perfection of
grace, do not therefore conclude thou haſt
not ſtrength of grace. Truth of grace is one
thing, and ſtrength of grace is another; ſo
ſtrength of grace is one thing, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of grace is another. You muſt ſtay for
perfection till you come to heaven; it is <hi>there</hi>
only, <hi>where the ſpirits of juſt men are made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>

that doth good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and ſinneth not,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon)
Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean? If I
waſh my hands with ſnow-water,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob)
and make my ſelf never ſo clean; yet ſhalt thou
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30639:53"/>
plunge me in the ditch, and my owne clothes ſhall
abhorre me.</hi> i.e. Though I have by Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſome grace, yet all my defilements ſhall
never in this life be put away. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of <hi>Zechariah</hi> we have the Lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thus: <hi>I will refine them as ſilver, and well
try them as gold is tryed;</hi> and yet in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Isaiah</hi> God ſaith,<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I have refined thee, but
not with ſilver;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 48. 10.</note> to reconcile both places, The
meaning is, that though God begin to refine
his people, yet they are not perfectly refined.</p>
            <p>2. Do not judge thy ſelf weak in grace,
becauſe thou haſt not ſtrong affections. God
doth make up in the experience of old and
grown Chriſtians, what is wanting of the
great affections they had at their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>
Holy <hi>Greenham</hi> often prayed that
he might keep up his young zeal with his
old diſcretion. What is wanting in affections
God makes up to thee in ſolidity of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
clearneſſe of knowledge, abundance
of experience, and ſtableneſſe in the faith.</p>
            <p>3. Judge not the ſtrength of thy grace by
the ſtrength of thy comforts, the fruit may
grow ſtrong, when the bloſſome is off. I
have ſpoken of this before; and therefore
will adde this, that heavenly joyes and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are very ſparingly found among Gods
people. They are Gods ſpecial indulgences
to ſome of his ſpecial children. I wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Proceed now to anſwer ſome caſes of
conſcience, which may be deduced from
the Doctrine I have laid down.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Whether ſtrong temptations may be conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with ſtrong grace?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe 1.</note> This is a needful and
practical Caſe, becauſe the People of God,
when tempted by the devil, they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
queſtion the ſtrength, but the truth of
their grace.</p>
            <p>Before I reſolve this Caſe, I ſhall premiſe
theſe general poſitions.</p>
            <p>1. It is certain,<note place="margin">Poſit 1.</note> where there is truth of
grace, there may be ſtrong temptations from
the devil. The devil is like a thiefe, which
robs not out-houſes, where there is nothing
but dung and ſtraw; but the Cabinets that
are in the Cloſet: ſo this great thief of the
world, he is not ſo eager to rob and ſpoil
the out-houſes, wicked and ungodly men;
but thoſe who have the riches of grace in
the cabinets of their hearts, theſe he labours
to rob and ſpoile: or as a Pirate, who ſets
not upon an empty veſſel, but upon a ſhip
laden with rich merchandize; thoſe who are
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30639:54"/>
fraught with the rich gifts of grace, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
by his temptations, will labour to make
prize of for himſelf.</p>
            <p>2. Let the temptations of the devil be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo ſtrong,<note place="margin">Poſit. 2.</note> yet they ſhall not be above the
ſtrength of grace, which believers have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from God.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>God is faithful, who will
not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
He will proportion the burden to the
back, and the ſtroak to the ſtrength of him
who is to bear it; if temptations increaſe, our
ſtrength ſhall alſo increaſe, whereby we may
be able to grapple with them.</p>
            <p>3. It is evident,<note place="margin">Poſit. 3.</note> that the temptations of the
devil are alwayes ordinarily moſt ſtrong,
after Gods people have diſcharged ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
duties to God, or have received
moſt diſcoveries of grace from God. In both
theſe Caſes the devils temptations are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
great. You finde that immediately after
the Celebration of the Lords Supper <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
deſired to winnow the diſciples;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 22. 31.</note> after they
had performed that extraordinary ſervice to
God, the devil was deſirous preſently to ſet
upon them. So you finde that after Chriſt
had in an extraordinary manner,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 2, 3</note> 
               <hi>fasted forty
dayes and forty nights,</hi> he was immediately
after tempted of the devil;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Halls</hi> obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and ſo alſo after
his baptiſme, <hi>no ſooner was he out of the water
of Baptiſme, but he was in the fire of temptation.</hi>
The <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God can be no ſooner out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> but this helliſh <hi>Pharoah</hi> purſues them.
And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had no ſooner kept the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30639:55"/>
Paſſeover, but <hi>Senacherib</hi> comes up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. All this is to ſhew us, that after
we have put forth moſt grace in a duty, then
the devil will labour to play his aftergame
with us, if he miſſe of his fore-game; if Satan
cannot keep us from duty and from inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in duty, he will flie-blow our duties
by pride and ſo marre them. And then after
we have received the moſt eſpecial manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from Gods love and favour in Chriſt,
then may we expect to be aſſaulted by the
devil: Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had <hi>thoſe heavenly
raptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and abundance of Revelations;</hi> the
devil ſet upon him with vile temptations; he
had <hi>the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, a thorn
in the fleſh;</hi> which is not to be meant of any
diſeaſe, but of ſome ſharp temptation from
the devil. So you finde that immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that voice to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>This is my well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſon, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> that then
the Tempter came to him. Hence you may
gather from that connexion between thoſe
two Petitions in the Lord Prayer, <hi>Forgive us
our treſpaſſes, and lead us not into temptation:</hi>
to note to us, that no ſooner can we get the
evidence of our pardon, but we may expect
to be tempted of the devil.</p>
            <p>4. That men who have the greateſt ſtrength
of grace,<note place="margin">Poſit. 4.</note> are like to meet with the fierceſt
aſſaults, and the ſtrongeſt temptations from
the divel; and this brings me to anſwer the
Caſe, <hi>That ſtrength of grace may be conſiſtent
with ſtrong temptations.</hi> To clear and confirm
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30639:55"/>
this, there are theſe two particulars to be
enquired into.</p>
            <p>1. Wben temptations may be ſaid to be
ſtrong?</p>
            <p>2. How, and why ſuch ſtrong temptations
may be conſiſtent with ſtrong grace?</p>
            <p>1. When temptations may be ſaid to be ſtrong?<note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then may temptations be ſaid to be
ſtrong,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> when the ſollicitations of the devil
to ſin are urgent with the ſoule, when they
are not weak and faint ſuggeſtions, but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
aſſaults, which wil not be removed until
aſſented to; when the divel haunts a man ſo
that he wil not let him alone, then may
they be ſaid to be ſtrong. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
ſtood up againſt Iſrael,</hi>—i.e. He ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to tempt <hi>David. And provoked him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 21. 1.</note> i. e.
He would not let him alone, but haunted
him with helliſh importunity,—<hi>till he had
numbred the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When they are frequent and continued.
Small temptations often ſuggeſted become
ſtrong. Small drops of water by frequent
falling make hollow the hard ſtone; which
a few great and forcible blows wil not doe:
ſo temptations, though but to ſmall ſins, if
they be continued, may have greater entrance
into the heart then a violent aſſault may.</p>
            <p>3. When they are ſuited by the devil to a
mans diſpoſition or preſent condition; ſo
was that temptation by which the devil ſet
upon Chriſt, after he had faſted forty daies
and forty nights: <hi>Command,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that theſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30639:56"/>
ſtones be made bread.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> It was ſuited to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
condition, meat for his hunger. If you
offer meat to a naked man, he values it not,
or cloaths to a hungry man, becauſe it is not
ſuited to his preſent exigence: but if the
gift you offer be ſuited to the mans neceſſity,
cloaths to him that is naked, and meat to
him that is hungry, then it becomes accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
The devil doth not caſt temptations at
random, he is more ſubtil then to row againſt
wind and tide, he knowes which way the
ſtream of our affections and diſpoſitions
runs, and he ſuits his baits accordingly.<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Every
man</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>is tempted, when he is
drawn away by his own luſt and enticed.</hi>

               </note> It is a
metaphor taken from Fiſhermen, who have
this skill, that according to the nature of the
fiſh, ſo they wil ſuit their bait, whereby they
lie in wait to deceive either the ſight or the
taſte of the poor fiſh. The divel is the great
fiſher of ſouls, and makes uſe of ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which are moſt likely to take; he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to what ſins a mans Relations, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or opportunities lay him moſt open &amp;
obnoxious, and accordingly he layes his
ſnare, and ſpreds his net. Though its true,
that every man hath a principle within him
ſuiting to every ſinne; yet it is as true that
every man is not equally active for, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
unto every ſin. The divel ſees what ſin
is moſt predominant in man, and ſo he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
a temptation ſutable; He ſets a wedge
of Gold before a covetous <hi>Achan; Cozby</hi> an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30639:56"/>
harlot, before an adulterous <hi>Zimri;</hi> a faire
preferment before an ambitious <hi>Abſalom:</hi> he
knows well, that a fit object preſented is a
victory half obtained. In theſe three caſes
temptations may be ſaid to be ſtrong.</p>
            <p>How doth it appear that temptations ſo ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,<note place="margin">2 Queſt.</note>
ſo continued, and ſo ſuited, may be conſiſtent
with ſtrong grace?</p>
            <p>By inſtances,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> whereby it appears the beſt
of Gods children have been moſt tempted.
<hi>Job</hi> a holy man, yet with what ſtrong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
was he aſſaulted? the devil impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
him in his ſtate, and ſo would tempt
him to diſtruſt Gods providence; took away
the lives of his children, to make him queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
providence; tormenting him with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
diſeaſes, to make him clamour againſt
providence; and above all this tempted him
<hi>to curſe God and die,</hi> by the inſtigations of his
wife;<note place="margin">Job 2. 8.</note> and yet though <hi>Job</hi> was thus haunted
by the devil, he was a believer ſtrong in
grace, and the moſt eminent Saint in that
age, and that part of the world at that time,
as God himſelfe teſtifies of him, <hi>that there
was none like him upon earth, a perfect and an
upright man.</hi>—He was not only for riches
the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt, but
for holineſſe the greateſt upon the earth; yet
thus was he afflicted and aſſaulted by the
devil.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance there is of <hi>David,</hi> an
eminent believer, and hath this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>that he was a man after Gods own heart,</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:30639:57"/>
and yet how furiouſly was he tempted by
the devil? one while Satan moved him to
number the people, another time to defile
another mans wife, another time to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
himſelfe mad before <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of
<hi>Gath,</hi> another time to judge all his holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be in vain, and at another time to
queſtion the faithfulneſſe of God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to make him King. <hi>He ſaid in his haſte
that all men were lyers,</hi> even <hi>Samuel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
alſo.<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 16 17. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 16. Ch. 22, 24.</note> Thus <hi>Peter</hi> an eminent Apoſtle of
Chriſt, after he had made ſuch a glorious
confeſſion of his faith, and had diſcovered
more grace then in all his life time before,
you finde him ſuddenly after by an inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the devil, begin to <hi>rebuke</hi> Chriſt,
and counſelling him to ſpare himſelfe. And
thus <hi>Paul</hi> that had ſuch high and heavenly
raptures, ſuch divine extaſies, yet had he the
meſſenger of Satan to buffet him. But above
all inſtances, you have <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who
though he had perfect grace, and was full of
grace and truth; yet this could not exempt
him from the temptations of the divel. He
was full of the holy Ghoſt, yet was he forty
<hi>daies tempted of the divel,</hi> &amp; that with ſtrong
temptations; if you conſider their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
their urgency one after another, and
ſuitability to that his preſent condition. So
that it is plainly manifeſt, that ſtrong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
may be conſiſtent with ſtrength of

Thus it pleaſes God to exerciſe his people
with great afflictions and temptations; for
the ſetting out of his own glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and magnifying of his own name.</p>
            <p>2. Another Reaſon may be drawn from
Gods people themſelves.<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. God in afflicting his children aimes at
their good. Thus when the devil tempted
<hi>David</hi> to number the people,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 21. 1.</note> and when he
was ſacrificing at the floore of <hi>Ornan</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſite,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 3. 1.</note>
there did God tel him that the Temple
ſhould be built, this was the iſſue of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
So when <hi>Job</hi> was ſo tempted and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
the iſſue of all was for his good. <hi>Jobs</hi>
graces had never been ſo <hi>illuſtrious,</hi> had not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30639:58"/>
the divels temptations been ſo <hi>furious.</hi> This
is one end of Gods afflicting his people, that
their graces may become more orient.</p>
            <p>2. Another may be to check pride. There
is no greater temptation in the world to
pride, then eminency in grace. Pride it is that
worſt fruit, which growes upon the beſt
ſtock. 'Tis not ſo much the ornaments of the
body, as the endowments of the mind which
ſtirs up pride;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9</note> and this was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, after
his abundance of Revelations, there was a
thorn in his fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to
buffet him, leſt he ſhould be lifted up. God
wil ſuffer thoſe which have ſtrong grace to
be ſtrongly tempted, to check the pride of
their hearts.</p>
            <p>3. The godly are more able to grapple
with ſtrong temptations then weaker Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are, and ſo God ſuits the ſervice and
ſufferings of his people, to the proportion
of the ſtrength of grace.</p>
            <p>3. Another reaſon may be taken from the
devil,<note place="margin">Reaſon. 3.</note> from that malice which he bears to all
the people of God, and eſpecially to thoſe
who have moſt grace; whom God loves
moſt, the devil hates moſt. When the voice
from Heaven ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved
ſonne,</hi> then came the devil to aſſault
and to tempt him; if you are the objects of
Gods deareſt love, you wil be the objects of
the devils deepeſt rage: and though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
damne thy ſoule, yet he wil trouble thy
conſcience; if he cannot break thy head, he
will bruiſe thy heel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:30639:58"/>
2. It alſo proceeds from the devils know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as wel as his malice; he knows, if he
can but get thoſe which are ſtrong in grace
to ſin, he ſhall doe the more miſchiefe, as</p>
            <p>1. It wil open the mouth of wicked men
to blaſpheme God and Religion, as in the
caſe of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>By this deed thou hast given great
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme.</hi>
How were the mouths of Gods enemies
opened to blaſpheme his name?</p>
            <p>2. It wil imbolden the weak to ſin with
more freedom, when they ſhall ſee thoſe
which are eminent to fall: and thus the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Peter</hi> made the Gentiles to Judaize.<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 14.</note>
When the ſtrong ſhall abuſe his liberty, he
becomes a ſtumbling block to thoſe which
are weak.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 9.</note> When <hi>Phigellus</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes</hi>
turned away from the faith how did all <hi>Aſia</hi>
turn aſide alſo?<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 15</note> Men of eminent gifts, when
they ſhall apoſtatize, how doe they draw
others in abundance?</p>
            <p>3. It wil provoke God to inflict heavy
judgements on the places where you dwel.
Thus the divel knew that if he could get
<hi>David</hi> to number the people, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a judgement upon them; and therefore
it is not ſaid, he ſtood up againſt <hi>David,</hi> but
<hi>againſt Iſrael, and provoked him to number the
people;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 21. 1.</note> he wel knew, if he could prevaile with
<hi>David,</hi> all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſuffer for it. Thus we
ſee, that where there is ſtrength of grace,
there may be and are ſtrong temptations.<note place="margin">Object.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But here may an objection be raiſed from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30639:59"/>
that of <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 18</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>He that is born
of God ſinneth not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and keepeth himſelfe that the
wicked One toucheth him not, &amp; that they which
are ſtrong have overcome the wicked one.</hi> And if
this be ſo, how can that be truth, that ſtrong
temptations from the devil, may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with ſtrong grace in the heart?</p>
            <p>When it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
               <hi>the wicked one toucheth him
not,</hi> it is not to be taken abſolutely, as if the
divel did not tempt a man at all, therefore
there muſt be a reſtriction of the clauſe, <hi>he
touches him not,</hi> that is, with a deadly touch;
and ſo <hi>Cajetan, This phraſe exeludes not the
kinds of temptations, but that we are not burt or
eternally doſtroyed by them</hi> But I conceive ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that theſe words have a peculiar refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the 16 verſe, where is mention made
of a ſin unto death; the divel ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
or touch a man ſo, as to commit that
ſin which is unto death. Though he may
tempt, and wil be continually aſſaulting a
man, yet he ſhall never prevaile againſt him,
ſo as to draw him to the committing of that
ſinne.</p>
            <p>1. From hence we may learn the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of God to weak Chriſtians;<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> whilst

not put young Converts to break through
an Hoſt of temptations, until they ſhall have
obtained experience and ſtrength of grace
to grapple with them.</p>
            <p>2. Hence alſo learn,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that men of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
and moſt eminent gifts and graces
ought not to preſume upon their own
ſtrength. <hi>Conſider thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note>
Thou which art moſt <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> take heed
leſt thou be foiled. Some mens pride may
make them think they are above <hi>Ordinances,</hi>
yet their own experience may ſatisfie them
that they are not above <hi>temptations;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they which are not above <hi>temptations,</hi>
wil ſtil ſtand in need of <hi>Ordinances;</hi> now no
man in the world, either is or ſhall be above
temptation; if any, ſurely <hi>Adam</hi> would, yet
he in Paradiſe, the beſt of places; and in In
noeency, the beſt of ſtates, was not exempted
from the temptations of the divel, and
thereby fell; therefore let no man preſume
upon his own ſtrength.</p>
            <p>3. Remember this for thy comfort, that
though the divel tempt thee with ſtrong
temptations, yet he ſhall never have his wil
againſt thee. It is true, a godly man may fall
into that particular act unto which the devil
tempts him, yet as to the devils general aime
(the damning of thy ſoul) he ſhall never
have his wil. It is a notable expreſſion that
of our Saviours to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>Satan hath
deſtred to have you,</hi>

have his wil as to a particular act, and thou
mayeſt yield to his temptation, yet he ſhall
never carry thee with himſelf into Hell.</p>
            <p>4. Remember to your great comfort, you
who are the people of God, and harraſſed

            </p>
            <p>In the anſwering whereof I ſhall ſpeak to
theſe particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:30639:60"/>
1. When may corruptions be ſaid to be
ſtrong?</p>
            <p>2. Why thoſe that have ſtrong grace, have
many times ſtrong corruptions?</p>
            <p>3. What ſtrong corruptions are they that
thoſe that are ſtrong in grace, are moſt
ſubject unto?</p>
            <p>4. In what caſes, and with what limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may ſtrength of corruptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with ſtrength of grace?</p>
            <p>1. When may corruptions and luſts be ſaid to
be ſtrong in the ſoule?<note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. When ſins are committed with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note>
Sin at firſt is like a ſnake that is almoſt
ſtarved by reaſon of the cold, and is very
weak and feeble; but if it be laid in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
then it gathers ſtrength, and after a
while ſin revives and becomes a delight in
the ſoul. If thou were at firſt troubled at ſin,
and afterwards takeſt pleaſure in ſin, its a
ſigne that ſin hath a great hand over thee.
Thus God complaines of his people, <hi>What
hath my beloved to doe in my houſe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 11. 15.</note>—<hi>When
thou doſt evil then thou rejoyceſt.</hi> We may know
the power and ſtrength of corruption in us,
by ſins activity in us, and by our chearſulneſs
and complacency in ſin.</p>
            <p>2. By the frequency of ſin, as a relapſe into
a diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Anſw. 2</note> argues the ſtrength of that peccant
humour in the body: ſo reiterated and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
acts of the ſame ſin, argue the power
and ſtrength of that ſin in our hearts. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
gathers ſtrength even as grace doth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30639:61"/>
by the frequent acting and exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>3. When ſin is perſiſted in againſt the
cheeks of conſcience.<note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note> And it argues the
ſtrength of a ſtreame that it beares down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it whatſoever bank would check the
courſe of it: So it alſo argues that there is
a ſtrong current of corruption in thy ſoul,
that bears down before it all the warnings,
checks and reproofs of conſcience.</p>
            <p>2. Why have thoſe that have the ſtrongeſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Queſt. 2.</note>
many times alſo the ſtrongest corruptions?</p>
            <p>1. It ariſeth from the natural temperature
and conſtitution of the body,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> which doth
diſpoſe men to ſome ſin more then another,
although they have ſuch eminency of grace;
and hence it is, that thoſe who are naturally
and conſtitutionally paſſionate, and given to
anger, though they may have a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of grace, yet what ado have they to
bridle in their anger? what ado to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
angry, and not greatly ſinful? And ſo
ſuch whoſe temperature inclines them to
be luſtful, though they have much grace, yet
all little enough to ſuppreſſe luſtfull
thoughts and wanton looks in them.</p>
            <p>2. God ſuffers this to humble his People,<note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note>
and to keep them humble under their great
meaſures of grace. It is obſervable in nature,
that thoſe creatures which have the moſt
excellency in them, have ſomething alſo of
defect and deformity in them, as if the God
of nature did it to keep them humble. The
Peacock hath glittering feathers, and yet
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30639:61"/>
black feet; The Swan hath white feathers,
but under that a black skin; The Eagle hath
many excellencies, quick ſight, and high
flight, but yet very ravenous; The Camel
and Elephant are great and ſtately creatures,
but of a deformed ſhape: So it is in the ſtate
of grace, God doth ſuffer ſome ſtrong &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubdued
corruptions to remain in them, who
have not only truth, but ſtrength of grace,
and this is to keep them humble.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> Thus <hi>Paul</hi>
after his great Revelation, had a meſſenger
of Satan to buffet him, and a thorne in the
fleſh to afflict and keep him humble; the thorn
in the fleſh did let out the impoſtumated
matter of pride out of his heart; and the
conſiderations of their corruptions doth
much affect the hearts of the godly, that
they become, 1. More condeſcending and
compaſſionate to the weak. 2. They do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
leſſe upon their own righteouſneſſe.
They ſee it is in vain to think of eſtabliſhing
their own righteouſneſſe, and that it is too
weak a foundation to lay the weight and
ſtreſſe of their ſalvation upon: the Covering
is too narrow, and the Bed is too ſhort for
them to reſt quietly upon. 3. They are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
brought to think better of others then of
themſelves, yea to judge themſelves <hi>the leaſt
of Saints, and the greateſt of ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This is from Satans malice,<note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note> who if he
can draw out great corruptions from them
who are eminent in grace;</p>
            <p>1. He thereby aims to blemiſh Religion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:30639:62"/>
and to darken the honour of Profeſſion, and
in this caſe uſually fights againſt none, <hi>great
nor ſmall, but the King of</hi> Iſrael, viz. ſuch as
are eminent for holineſſe. When <hi>David</hi> fell
into thoſe great ſins of murder and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Satan had a main end granted him, to
make the way of true Religion ſtink and be
abhorred.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. Hereby Satan hath his end to imbolden
thoſe that are weak to ſin. The ſins and
great miſcarriages of ſuch as are great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
are great ſtumbling blocks in the way
of the weak to make them fall.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 10</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Hereby the peace and purity of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is violated; the devil will play at ſmall
game rather then at no game: and if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prevail to damn thy ſoul, yet he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

            <p>1. To loſe thoſe ſtrong affections which

<hi>Greenham</hi> complained, that it was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to keep together his old diſcretion and

and but weak judgements. Their heat is
more then their light. Their preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
and ſenſe is great and high, their
experience little and low; And ſo alſo ſtrong
Chriſtians, who may have much grace, yet
tha flood and fluſh of affections may be
much abated, and it is the fault of old pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſors,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:30639:62"/>
that they do not labour to maintain
the primitive vigour and vivacity of their
firſt affections;<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 3, 4.</note> they are too apt <hi>to leave their
firſt love,</hi> yet we muſt know they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
ſo as to be bankerupts, in grace. In the
godly the decay and declining, though it
may be great, yet it is neither total nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
though he may fail, yet he is not a
banquerupt, he hath ſtill a ſtock remaining
which can never be quite ſpent, a fountaine
which can never be quite dry.<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 14.</note> 
               <hi>He hath in

The water of a fountain may be mudded, but
it will clear it ſelf again. It may be damm'd
up in one place, but it will break out in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſo it is with grace. A tree, you know,
in Winter-ſeaſon, the fruit and leaves fall
off, and it ſeems as if it were dead, but there
is life in the root; ſo it is in Chriſtians, their
beauty and bloſſom may fall off, their fruit
dry up, their leaves drop off, the beauty, the
exerciſe and the fruits of grace may ceaſe for
a time, and yet <hi>the root of the matter is in them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 19 28</note>
It often fares with old Profeſſors, as it did
with old <hi>David,</hi>

the cloaths he did wear, <hi>could not get or keep

and all the Ordinances they enjoy,
cannot keep up that youthful heat of vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
affections which once they had. Many

had, ſuch complacency in God, ſuch ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in prayer, ſuch attention in hearing, ſuch
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30639:63"/>
delight in Sabbaths, ſuch mournfulneſſe and
tenderneſſe of ſpirit, ſuch hatred of ſin. Now
they have not ſuch aggravating thoughts of
ſin, as in former times, nor the occaſions
unto ſin, ſo avoided as formerly. How many
are there, who heretofore look't on every

a mountain, but now they can extenuate
and excuſe their ſin. Heretofore the moſt
pleaſing ſin was abominable, the ſmalleſt
deteſtable, and the higheſt intolerable, but it
is otherwiſe now through ſpiritual decayes
and abatement in our affections. There are
many heretofore when they fell into ſin,
were wont to walk ſadly, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh deeply,
weep bitterly, pray affectionately: but now
do not theſe things with thoſe warme and
working affections as formerly. The time
was when many Profeſſors of Religion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
themſelves for holy duties with more
care, attended to them with more diligence,
delighted in them with more complacency,
and gained more profit and edification by
them then now they do. And that's the firſt
ſin, that thoſe who have grace, both in truth
and ſtrength, are apt to fall into, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tual
decay.</p>
            <p>2. Such as are ſtrong Chriſtians are very
ſubject to ſpiritual pride,<note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> and to be highly
conceited of their own gifts, parts and gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.
Spiritual pride is a ſecret ſpiritual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:30639:63"/>
that is in the moſt ſpirituall and
gracious heart; it is a bad fruit that growes
on the beſt root: there is nothing better
then grace, and there is nothing more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
then ſin, and there is no ſin ſo bad
as pride, and there are none ſo apt to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this ſin of pride, as they that have much
grace, and there is nothing weakens a ſtrong
Chriſtian more then pride, and nothing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
weakneſſe more then this boaſting.</p>
            <p>3. To behave themſelves with contempt
and ſuperciliouſneſſe towards weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note>
is an ordinary fault of the ſtrong. There
is not any one thing in Scripture more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mentioned then this, that we ſhould not
deſpiſe or diſcourage the weak, which notes
an aptneſſe in the ſtrong to be faulty herein.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3.</note>
               <hi>Let us not judge one another any more.</hi> The

before. Spiritual pride is a root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which bears theſe two bitter fruits. 1.
An over-valuing of our ſelves. 2. An under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of other mens perſons and gifts.</p>
            <p>4. Strong Chriſtians are apt to put too
much duty and task upon the weak.—
<hi>Johns</hi> diſciples failed in this towards the
diſciples of Chriſt about faſting.<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 16, 17.</note> Strong
Chriſtians ſhould deal tenderly with the
weak, they ſhould excuſe their failings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
their weakneſſes, commend their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
cheriſh their forwardneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
their doubts, bear their burdens, and
hereby make the way of Religion to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30639:64"/>
lovely and amiable to them, whereas by
their too much auſterity the weak are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
at their firſt entrance.</p>
            <p>5. To be content with meaſures of grace.
How apt are they that have grace to ſay in
one ſenſe, as he ſaid in another, <hi>Soul, take
thine eaſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12 19</note> 
               <hi>thou haſt goods laid up for many
years;</hi> and hereupon many grow ſlack and
careleſſe in holy duties, and do not improve
ordinances for the increaſe of their graces.
The beſt of Chriſtians are apt to fall into
this ſatiety, then which nothing can be more
prejudicial to the ſoul. The devil tempts
thoſe that have but a little grace to thinke
they have none, and thoſe that have more
grace to think they have enough. The beſt
are apt to miſtake themſelves in this, to think
that there is a juſt dimenſion and full
growth of grace attainable in this life:
Whereas indeed the beſt improvement of
having much grace, is to deſire more, and
not to be ſatisfied with any meaſure of grace
<hi>till we come to a perfect man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>unto the meaſure of
the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and that's
not attainable in this life. Perfection is the
aime of this life, but it is the reward of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life. We ſhould endeavour after Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in grace, but we ſhall not attain it
till grace be perfected in glory.</p>
            <p>4. In what caſes,<note place="margin">Queſt. 4.</note> and with what limitations
may ſtrength of corruptions conſiſt with ſtrength
of grace?</p>
            <p>The reſolving of this queſtion is of very
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30639:64"/>
much uſe to the ſoul: for that ſoul that is
over-maſtered with ſtrong corruptions, may
not only queſtion the ſtrength of his grace,
but the being of it. How may I then know,
that I have both the truth and ſtrength of
grace in me, though I am overpowered
ſometimes by ſtrong and prevailing corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>1. If you maintain in you a ſtrong oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt your corruptions.<note place="margin">Anſw. 1</note> The fleſh luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
againſt the Spirit, <hi>but doth the Spirit luſt
againſt the fleſh?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> though you cannot fully
ſubdue ſin, yet do you ſtrongly oppoſe it?
if ſo, there is grace and ſtrength of grace
too, which is able to make and hold up this
oppoſition. An uncontrolled ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſin, argues the ſtrength of ſin; but an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
oppoſition of ſin argues the
ſtrength of grace. Strength of grace is not ſo
much ſeen in thoſe particular acts of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and actual overcoming of it, as in
that conſtant and habitual frame of heart in
the oppoſition of ſinne.</p>
            <p>2. Though ſin be ſtrong,<note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note> yet grace may be
ſtrong too in thy ſoul. If thou haſt a ſtrong
meaſure of humiliation, though thy ſin be
great, if thy ſorrow be great too, it eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
thy grace is ſo alſo. It was great grace
in <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 23. 12.</note> that he <hi>humbled himſelf greatly,</hi>
though he had been a very great ſinner.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thou haſt ſtrong cryes to God againſt

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>flowered</hi> by thy corruptions. If
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:30639:65"/>
when corruptions and temptations prevaile,
thou prayeſt to the Lord with <hi>ſtrong cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and teares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 22. 26. 27.</note> this argues grace, yea and the
ſtrength of grace.</p>
            <p>4. If thou haſt ſtrong affections that carry
thee to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Anſw. 4.</note> certainly thou haſt grace,
though thy ſtrong corruptions often carry
thee from Chriſt. <hi>Peter</hi> had more infirmities
and corruptions and ſins, then all the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
beſides (excepting <hi>Judas.</hi>) He tooke
Chriſt aſide, gave him carnal counſel, and
ſaid as to his ſufferings,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 22</note> 
               <hi>Far be it from the
Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee;</hi> for which
Chriſt ſaid to him, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi>
He dreams of merit, and boaſts of what he
had done for Chriſt, at it is obſerved of him,
when he ſaid to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 27</note> 
               <hi>Behold, we have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
all and followed thee, what ſhall we have
therefore? Peter</hi> of all the diſciples was the
moſt confident of his own ſtrength; and
boaſts what he would do and ſuffer for
Chriſt; <hi>Though all men ſhould be offended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 33 35.</note> 
               <hi>yet will I never be offended. And if
I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.</hi>
Nay and preſently after this confident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
<hi>Peeer</hi> denies Chriſt, and ſwear:
and curſes that he knew him not. Some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that <hi>Peters</hi> curſing, was not only his
curſing of himſelfe if he knew Chriſt, but
that he alſo curſed Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo he
might appear to them to be none of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and yet notwithſtanding all this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had not only truth and reality, but emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30639:65"/>
and ſtrength of grace: for though
temptations and corruptions did ſometimes
prevail, yet he had ſtrong affections towards
Jeſus Chriſt; he did and ſuffered that which
few or none of the other diſciples did.</p>
            <p>1. He was the man,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 75</note> that of all the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
wept moſt bitterly for his ſins.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt that ran to the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 5.</note>
and went into the ſepulchre to ſee
what was become of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. He was the man,<note place="margin">Joh. 21. 7.</note> who hearing that
Chriſt was riſen and on the ſea-ſhore, leap't
into the ſea for joy.</p>
            <p>4. He was the man that made the firſt
Sermon,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 15.</note> and firſt preached the Goſpel after
the Aſcenſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>5. He had that love to Chriſt which was
as ſtrong as death; for he ſuffered death, and
was crucified, (as ſay Eccleſiaſtical Writers)
but would not be crcuified, but with his
heels upwards, deeming it too great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be crucified in the ſame manner that
his Lord and Maſter was; ſo that the ſtrength
of his affections, did argue notwithſtanding
his great failings, the ſtrength of grace in
him.</p>
            <p>To make application of what hath been
ſpoken in this caſe of Conſcience.—<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Vſe 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Though in the caſes before mentioned,
ſtrength of grace may be conſiſtent with
ſtrength of corruptions; yet there are other
cases wherein they are altogether inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:30639:66"/>
1. When the ſtrength and workings of
corruptions are not clearly diſcovered to
the ſoul; for grace alwayes, as a light ſet up
in the ſoul, doth diſcover the darkneſſe of
corruption.</p>
            <p>2. Where corruptions are not ſenſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed,
it is to be feared that there is not
ſtrength of grace.</p>
            <p>3. Where occaſions to thoſe ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
ſins and corruptions are not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoided. Certainly if thou haſt grace
to make thee ſenſible of what corruptions
thou art incident unto, thy grace will make
thee walk ſo circumſpectly, as to avoid all
occaſions leading thereunto.</p>
            <p>4. If they be not ſtrongly reſiſted, and the
beginnings of each corruption not diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppreſſed, in this caſe ſtrength of grace
and ſtrength of corruption are utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>5. Though there may be ſtrong grace and
ſtrong coriuption in the ſoul, yet the reign
of any one corruption is utterly inconſiſtent
with grace and the ſtrength of it. <hi>Let not ſin
reign in your mortall bodies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12, 14. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Rom. 7. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Sin ſhall not have
dominion over you, for you are not under the law
but under grace;</hi> which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in the <hi>Antinomiſis</hi> ſenſe, that believers
are not under the mandatory power of the
moral Law: But the meaning of the word
(Law) as <hi>Beza</hi> interprets it, <hi>is the law of ſin,</hi>
and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, chap.</hi> 7. 23, mentions
<hi>a law in his members that did war againſt the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30639:66"/>
law of his minde, and did hring him into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
to the law of ſin,</hi> that is; ſin would have
ſwayed in him with the power and force of
a law. And this argued grace and the
ſtrength of grace in <hi>Paul,</hi> that though he was
over-born by the ſtrength of corruption
and ſin, and taken Priſoner by it, yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yielded to it as to a lawfull Soveraign;
for ſo he addes, <hi>verſ. 29. So then with the mind.
I ſerve the law of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 25.</note> 
               <hi>but with my fleſh the law
of ſin.</hi> It may be ſaid of the corruptions in
Gods children, what was ſhewed to <hi>Daniel</hi>
concerning the beaſts, <hi>They had their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for
a ſeaſon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. When we ſay there is a conſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
grace and corruption; I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of ſpiritual and inward corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as hardneſſe of heart, ſpiritual pride,
deadneſſe in duties: for into groſſe external,
open acts of evil, ſtrong Chriſtians do ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fall.</p>
            <p>7. We muſt alſo be further informed, that
if we conſider particular acts of ſin, ſome
one luſt may ſeem to be more ſtrong in a
godly Chriſtian, then in a meer moral man.
As for inſtance, in the caſe of luſt, when we
conſider how <hi>David</hi> did abuſe his neigh
bours wife, and how <hi>Abimelech</hi> would not
touch another mans wife; one would have
judged <hi>David</hi> the heathen, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> the
believer, and therefore the ſtrength of grace
or corruption muſt not be judged by any
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30639:67"/>
one particular act when ſome impetuous
temptation hath prevailed.</p>
            <p>8. Laſtly, we are to know that a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be really weak'ned when ſenſibly
ſtrong. As a man in a Feaver is ſeemingly
ſtrong, but is really weak: ſo corruption
may be then moſt enfeebled when in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
it is moſt inraged; it may rave
and rage when it is in crucifying. As a cole
glows moſt juſt before its going out; a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
burnt't down in the ſocket gives a blaze
a little before it be extinct: ſo it is when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is ready to expire. As in a meer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man ſin may be reſtrained when it is not
ſubdued; corruption may be quiet where
it is not mortified: So in a regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it may be ſubdued and mortified, where
yet it may rage as if unreſtrained. A mans laſt
gaſpe may be the ſtrongeſt breath: So when
corruption is ready to give up the Ghoſt it
may ſeem to breath ſtrongeſt. As a bird may
flutter when his neck is broken: ſo ſin may
ſeemingly reſiſt grace, when the power,
ſtrength and life of it is utterly broke.</p>

            <p>WE have already handled two great

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30639:67"/>
grace,</hi> about the conſiſtency of ſtrong
temptations and ſtrong cortuptions with
the ſtrength of grace, and ſhall now proceed
to a third Caſe, which is this,</p>
            <p>3. Whether ſtrength of grace may conſiſt with
the want of thoſe ſtrong affections,<note place="margin">Caſe 3.</note> which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
have had at their firſt converſion?</p>
            <p>In anſwering whereof I ſhall endeavour
to ſhew three things.</p>
            <p>1. When a man may be ſaid to loſe his firſt
affections?</p>
            <p>2. In what Caſes may a ſtrong Chriſtian
want ſtrong affections?</p>
            <p>3. Whence it is that thoſe that have ſtrong
grace may want ſuch ſtrong affections as
they had at their firſt Converſion?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>When may a Chriſtian be ſaid to loſe his
firſt affections?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note> Affections are fitly compared
to the pulſes of the ſoul, by which may
judgement be given of the ſtate and temper
of the ſoul; and that we may know when
theſe affections beat low and are decayed,
we may make judgement hereof.</p>
            <p>1. When we have not ſuch eager deſires
after duties.<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> It is very remarkable, that at
a Chriſtians firſt converſion, he is ſo earneſt
and eager after holy duties, that he will
hardly allow time for the duties of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
calling; nay how have men at firſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves to hear ſo many Sermons,
make ſo many Prayers, read ſo many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſpend ſo many houres in holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by our ſelves, and good conference
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:30639:68"/>
with other Chriſtians? But alas, afterward
this fervour begins to cool and remit, and
men pray leſſe, and hear more ſeldome, and
this is from the multitude of their wordly
occaſions. Uſually men at their firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
(which as Divines have obſerved) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
doth fall out between the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
and twenty eighth year of their age
(though God indeed be tyed to no year) yet
men at that age have uſually leſſe of the
world, and ſo it comes to paſſe, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when the cares and profits, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the world ſteal away their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they grow much more remiſſe then
they were at the beginning.</p>
            <p>2. Affections may be judged to be decayed
when men have not ſuch raviſhing joyes as
we were wont to have.<note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> How many have been
at firſt in <hi>Davids</hi> frame of heart,<note place="margin">Pſal. 122, 1</note> 
               <hi>I was glad

and yet not be ſenſible of that his profiting.
A Chriſtian may grow at the root in ſolidity
of grace, though it may be not ſhoot up ſo
much in bloſſomes of affection.</p>
            <p>2. In what Caſes may a ſtrong Chriſtian
want ſtrong affections?<note place="margin">Queſt. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. In caſe you have leſſe ſin in duties,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note>
though leſſe affections. A weak young con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
hath oftentimes much affection in holy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30639:68"/>
duties, but much corruption too. They are
very ſubject to raſhneſſe and precipitancy in
their Prayers, and to be proud of any ſmall
meaſures of grace in duty, and too apt to
have carnal dependance upon their duties:
But old experienc't Chriſtians, as they have
often leſſe affection, ſo leſſe ſin in duties.
Papiſts have very much affection in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of their devotions: but alas, they
have the leaven of this errour in their beſt
duties, that they think they merit by them:
but grown and knowing Chriſtians, though
they may not be ſo affectionate in duty, as
the weak, yet they may exerciſe much more
grace then they do. And ſo alſo it is after
duties are performed. Weak Chriſtians are
apt to indulge their corruptions afterwards,
thinking they have made a compenſation
for their ſins by their duties: But an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
grown Chriſtian, though not ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
in duty, yet he is carefull after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that he do not by ſin ſpoyle all his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>2. A ſtrong Chriſtian may want ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,<note place="margin">Anſw. 2</note>
in caſe he hath ſtrength of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to recompence the want of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Young trees are more ſappy, but old trees
are more ſolid;</hi> Wherefore the Apoſtle prayes

               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 9.</note> As a man that is come to his full
age, though he do not grow in bulke and
extenſion of parts; yet he grows intenſively,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:30639:69"/>
and in the conſolidation of the parts of the
body: ſo old and experienced Chriſtians,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough they have not ſo much affection; yet
they have more ſolidity and clearneſſe of
judgement, more experimental knowledge
in the profound myſteries of the Goſpel, and
more diſtinct apprehenſions of the deep
things of Chriſt. A ſtrong believer, what he
wants in affections he hath compenſated to
him in a diſtinct and experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the deceitfulneſſe of his heart, of the
vanity of the world, of the ſinfulneſſe of ſin,
and of the tranſcendent excellency of Chriſt.
New converts are raſh, inconſiderate, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious;
and therefore we have a promiſe
made to new converts, that they ſhall proceed
in grace. It is a promiſe made to the Gentiles
when the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, that though at the firſt they
were raſh, yet it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Iſa. 32. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The heart of the raſh
ſhall underſtand knowledge, and the tongue of the
ſtammerers ſhall be ready to ſpeak plain.</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without knowledge will be but raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which (like metal in a young horſe)
will be apt to precipitate him and make him
ſtumble. An experienced Chriſtian though
he have not ſo much ſeeming metal in his
affection, yet ſhall rid more way to heaven
by farre then a young Convert, and that
without fear of ſtumbling. At the firſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the fire, there may be more ſmoak,
though afterward the flame will be clearer:
So when at firſt thou haſt much affection,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30639:69"/>
afterwards thou ſhalt have a clearer judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>3. A ſtrong Chriſtian may want ſtrong
affections in caſe it proceed from a natural
temper,<note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note> and not from a ſinful careleſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.
There are ſome perſons that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
of a ſoft and tender diſpoſition, and
theſe are naturally more affectionate; nay
the woman who is the weaker veſſel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
her heart holds moſt affection: And
ſo likewiſe there are ſome who naturally are
more bound up in their affections, and are
of a reſerved temper, who naturally do not
break out into any great expreſſion either of
the paſſion of joy or grief. We read in the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> that they that expreſt moſt affection
to Chriſt at his death, and made the moſt
paſſionate lamentation for him, were the
<hi>women,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 23. 27.</note> who naturally are of a more melting
diſpoſition. Some mens diſpoſitions are like
ice, they will eaſily thaw and melt; others
like iron, it muſt be a a hot fire that will

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them down: So it is, ſome men will be
more affectionate upon a ſmall occaſion
then others upon a greater, and this is from
naturall diſpoſition. <hi>Melancthon</hi> was not ſo
affectionate as <hi>Luther,</hi> but it is obſerved that
he was more judicious.</p>
            <p>4. In caſe of ſickneſſe and old age, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
weakneſſe,<note place="margin">Anſw. 4.</note> He that hath ſtrength of
grace may yet want ſtrength of affection.
The expreſſion of our affection depends
much upon the temperature of the body, if
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30639:70"/>
bodily ſtrength and vigour be impaired, our
affections muſt needs flag. As the ebbing and
flowing of the ſea depends upon the motion
and influence of the Moon: So our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do ebbe and flow much what, as the
ſtrength or weakneſſe of the body hath an
influence upon them. As a Muſician when
he is grown old, cannot ſo dexterouſly
handle an inſtrument, as when he was
young, though perhaps he hath now more
judgement and experience in muſick; ſo it
is in old age, that brings experience in the
wayes of God, yet may abate affections.
Old age and ſickneſſe makes the body like
a tyred horſe to the active ſoul; an
active traveller would faine ride away to his
journeys end, but his horſe is tyred. An aged
ſickly Chriſtian may have as much grace and
more then ne had at firſt, and yet not be ſo
able to pray; and ſo a Miniſter not ſo able
to preach affectionately as before; and this
from the indiſpoſition of the body.</p>
            <p>3. Whence it is that thoſe that have ſtrength of
grace,<note place="margin">Queſt. 3.</note> may yet want thoſe ſtrong affections which
they had at their firſt converſion?</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe at firſt converſion grace was but
particularly imployed,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1</note> which afterwards
was more diffuſed and generally imployed.
When much water runs in one Channel it
makes the ſtream the ſtronger; but when
there are many rivulets cut out, though
there is as much and more water, yet there
is not the ſame ſtrength of ſtream: So it is at
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30639:70"/>
our firſt converſion, all our affections made
but up one ſtream, and ſo our affections ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the ſtronger. A new convert hath not
ſo many duties to performe as a grown
Chriſtian hath, becauſe he doth not know
ſo many duties. It may be at firſt all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
run out to pray, and hear the
Word, and read good books, and whileſt all
the affections run in this one channel they
ſeem to be very ſtrong; whereas a grown
Chriſtian he hath not only theſe generall
duties, but many particular duties of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and relations to follow, he hath many
duties to perform to God and men, which a
new convert knowes not, and therefore it is
that though his affections may ſeem weaker,
yet his grace is as ſtrong as before &amp; ſtronger.</p>
            <p>2. This is from the newneſs of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Naturally we are much affected with any
new thing,<note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> as for example, for a man that
hath been many years in a dark dungeon, to
be ſuddenly brought into the light, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe
of the change would much affect a
man. This is the ſtate of our ſouls at our
firſt converſion; we are <hi>therefore brought from
darkneſſe into light, and from the power of Satan
unto God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> By the grace of converſion, <hi>God calls
us out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light;</hi>
and becauſe it is ſo marvellous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it doth ſo much affect. The change
at firſt converſion is very great, a man be
comes another man, and man is ſo affected,
that he is put into a kinde of aſtoniſhment.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30639:71"/>
Yet in this caſe we muſt diſtinguiſh between
ſolid affections, and floting and tranſient
paſſions, which do wear off preſently, and
vaniſh ſuddenly. The affections of ſome
Chriſtians, eſpecially young ones, are like
thoſe colours which are not in grain, they
will ſoon fade. It is with a young Convert
as with a man going to execution, while he
is upon the ladder a pardon is unexpectedly
brought, how will this man be tranſported
with joy? he will leap for joy, he will in that
caſe be all joy &amp; exultation for the preſent,
and it may be afterward the fluſh &amp; torrent
of his joy is abated, though his life be as dear
to him as ever: So when the ſoul hath been
brought by the Law of God to a ſight of its
loſt condition, &amp; then the Goſpel hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
a pardon, &amp; the Spirit of God hath
ſet on the comfort of that pardon upon his
heart. Oh what raviſhments hath that ſoule
for the preſent! which perhaps he ſhall not
long retain, the violence of his joy is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the ſolidity of it remains. The ſoule
is much affected with its firſt meeting with
Chriſt, and though the fluſh of that joy be
over, yet the ſouls love to Chriſt is as much,
and its prizing Communion with Chriſt
the ſame. The Creeple when he was reſtored
to ſtrength,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 8.</note> went leaping and praiſing God,
becauſe the unexpectedneſſe of the cure did
mightily affect his heart; and this is a ſecond
reaſon why thoſe who are grown and ſolid
Chriſtians, yet perhaps may not retain the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30639:71"/>
ſame meaſure of affections they had at their
firſt converſion.</p>
            <p>3. A third Reaſon may be taken from
Gods indulgence to young Converts,<note place="margin">Anſw 3.</note> who
uſually gives in comfort according to the
neceſſity of his people. It is with God our
heavenly Father as with naturall Parents,
they are moſt tender over their new-born
children.<note place="margin">Luke 15. 22.</note> That parable of the returning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall
is very full to this purpoſe; his father
did not onely receive him mercifully, but
bountifully too, he gave him more then was
for neceſſity; not onely <hi>ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> but a ring; not
only <hi>clothes,</hi> but the <hi>beſt robe;</hi> not only <hi>bread,</hi>
but the <hi>fatted calfe,</hi> and muſick at this Feaſt,
and all this was for this newly converted
and repenting ſon, though his father did not
entertain him ſo every day. So our God, at
our firſt converſion expreſſeth much of his
bounty and indulgence to his children,
though afterward we may have the ſame
love of God, &amp; the ſame love to God, though
the expreſſions may not be the ſame now, as
formerly in thoſe daies of Gods bounty.</p>
            <p>Let us from hence learn,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that though we
have loſt thoſe affections which we had, yet
we muſt</p>
            <p>1. Labour to be ſenſible of, and humbled
for thoſe decayes. A decayed condition is an
uncomfortable condition; though thou haſt
ſo much grace as will bring thee to heaven,
yet by thy decayes thou wilt be very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
here on earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:30639:72"/>
2. Labour to get thoſe decays repaired.
If thou <hi>haſt left thy firſt love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>repent and doe thy
firſt works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Make up the want of former affections
in ſolidity of knowledge and judgement;
and if the candle give not ſo great a blaze, let
it give a more clear and conſtant light.</p>
            <p>4 Labour to keep up the primitive vigour
of your affections.</p>
            <p>1. Remember you may loſe that in a ſhort
time, which you may be a long time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering.
A man may loſe more ſtrength in
one weeks ſickneſſe, then many months will
make reparation. A wound may be quickly
made, but not ſo ſoon cured. Philoſophers
wil tel us, that the way from the habit to
the privation is far eaſier, then from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to the habit; it is far eaſier to make a
ſeeing man blind, then to make a blind man
ſee; ſo it is far eaſier to loſe our holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then it is to recover them.</p>
            <p>2. Labour to keep up your holy affections:
for the truth of grace is more diſcerned by
our affections then our actions. Acts of grace
may be eaſier diſſembled then gracious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
A Painter may paint the colour, but
not the heat of the fire.</p>
            <p>3. Labour to keep up affections as they
were at firſt, becauſe it is very hard to retain
them: it is hard to keep them wound up to
any height. Fluſh of ſpirituall joy is like the
ſea; the tide doth not ſo flow, but the ebbe
doth fall as low. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid of theſe ſtrong
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30639:72"/>
guſts and great fluſh of theſe ſpirituall joyes
and gracious affections,<note place="margin">Rara hora, brevis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</note> 
               <hi>They come but ſeldom,
and ſtay but a ſhort time.</hi> As in nature there is
a ſpring, and then the fall of the leafe, and
one day is clear, and another is cloudy: ſo it
is with the beſt Chriſtian, his affections are
not alwaies at the ſame pitch, at the ſame
height; but it ſhould be our endeavour to
cheriſh and maintain in our ſoules our firſt
flouriſhing affections, in and towards the
waies of God.</p>

            <p>HAving diſpatched three Caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

            <p>VVhether a man that hath ſtrength of grace,<note place="margin">Caſe 4.</note>
may want the comfort of his grace?</p>
            <p>I ſhall anſwer this queſtion affirmatively;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
A man that hath the ſtrength of grace yet
may want the comfort of it: Strength of
grace (as you have heard) doth not exempt
a man from temptations from the divel, nor
from deſertions from God. It is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
rule, there may be ſtrength of grace,
where there is not the comfort and evidence
of it. A child of light may walk in darkneſſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:30639:73"/>
for a time; and though he have the holy
Ghoſt working grace, and encreaſing grace
in his heart, yet he may want the oyle of
gladneſſe, though he have received a precious
<hi>anoynting</hi> of grace.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27</note> A child of God, as to his
ſpirituall condition, may for a time be in the
ſame condition that <hi>Paul</hi> and the Marriners
were in, <hi>who for many daies had neither ſun nor
ſtars appearing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 27. 20</note> 
               <hi>being under no ſmall tempest,
hopes of being ſaved being taken away:</hi> So it
fares with Gods deareſt children, they may
be in the dark and can ſee no light, they may
have the graces of the Spirit, and yet want
the comforts of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>In the opening of which point I ſhall thus
proceed.</p>
            <p>1. I wil prove this from Scripture, that a
child of God may be ſtrong in grace, and
yet want the comfort of his grace.</p>
            <p>2 I wil lay down ſome reaſons, why it is
thus.</p>
            <p>3. Some directions, how thoſe that have
grace, and yet doe want the comfort of
their graces, ſhould procure unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the comfort of their graces.</p>
            <p>4. And then I ſhall commend ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
conſiderations to ſuch as have
grace, but want the comfort of it.</p>
            <p>1. For the firſt, I ſhall give you inſtances
both in the Old and New Teſtament, that
thoſe that have been ſtrong in grace have
wanted comfort.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Job</hi> a man eminent for grace, <hi>a perfect
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30639:73"/>
and upright man, and one that feared God and
eſchewed evil:</hi> and yet you have <hi>Job</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>Wherefore hidest thou thy face,</hi>

his eyes upon me.</hi> And that theſe ſad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
were upon <hi>Job,</hi> that God was

<hi>He hath deſtroyed me on every ſide,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 19. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>and I am
gone, and mine hope hath he removed as a tree, he
bath alſo kindled his wrath againſt me, and
counted me unto him as one of his enemies.</hi> Yea,
<hi>deſtruction from God was a terrour to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 31. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. Aſaph, <hi>a holy man, yet thus complains,</hi>
Will the Lord eaſt off for ever, and will he be
favourable no more? is his mercy clean gone for
ever? doth his promiſe faile for evermore? hath
God forgotten to be gracious?<note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 7,</note> hath he in anger
ſhut up his tender mercies? <hi>Theſe are the ſad
expoſtulations of a troubled ſpirit caſt down
under deep dejections, and in the dark, by
reaſon of the ſuſpenſion of divine favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods heart, whoſe
gracious breathings though the whole book
of Pſalms, ſhew that he was a man of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſpirit, and had much grace. Yet <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:30639:74"/>
wanted the comfort of his grace, when his
ſoul was caſt down, and his ſpirit was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
within him. And ſo</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Heman,</hi> a man who for wiſdom ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
that the Holy Ghoſt uſeth him as an
inſtance of wiſdome,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 5.</note> 
               <hi>As wiſe as Heman,</hi> and
yet in the 88. Pſalme, quite through that
Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 88.</note> was a ſtraine of as ſad a complaint
as you ſhall meet withall in the whole book
of God. <hi>Thou haſt laid me in the loweſt pit,
in darkneſſe, in the deep, thy wrath lyeth hard
upon me, and thou haſt afflicted me with all thy
waves.</hi> So little comfort had theſe holy men
though they were eminent in grace. It is
true of many dear children of God, what
was ſaid of the Apoſtles and diſciples of
Chriſt; <hi>Whither I go</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye know,
and the way ye know:</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14. 4, 5. expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> To which ſpeech of
Chriſt, <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwers in the next verſe,
<hi>Lord, we know not whither thou goeſt, and how
can we know the way? Auguſtine</hi> doth thus
reconcile this, <hi>They did know whither Chriſt
went, but they durſt not once believe that they
had ſuch knowledge, they did not know their own
knowledge:</hi> The expreſſions of Chriſt were
different from thoſe words of <hi>Thomas,</hi> the
Lord Jeſus ſpake as it was; and <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpake
as he thought. The Apoſtles had grace, and
yet wanted the comfort and aſſurance of it.
I will not inſtance here of the Lord Jeſus,
who though he was full of grace and truth,
yet he wanted comfort when he was in that
bitter agony, and cryed out, <hi>My God, my God,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:30639:74"/>
why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Indeed in the new
Teſtament there are not ſo many inſtances
of thoſe that wanted the comfort of their
graces, as we finde in the Old Teſtament.
And the reaſon is this, Profeſſion at the firſt
publiſhing and promulgation of the Goſpel,
met with ſo many and ſuch ſharp afflictions,
that God did indulge them, and made <hi>their
inward graces to abound, as their outward ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
did abound.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 4.</note> Theſe inſtances may ſuffice
to prove that it is truth, believers who are
ſtrong in grace, yet may want the comfort of
their graces.</p>
            <p>2. To give you ſome grounds of this, the
reaſons may be drawn, either 1. From God,
Or 2. From our ſelves. Or 3. From the devil.</p>
            <p>1. Reaſon is from the Lord, to with-hold
from them to whom he hath given grace
the comfort of their grace.</p>
            <p>1. To manifeſt his divine authority and
abſolute ſoveraignty over his people. As the
natural light of the day, and darkneſſe of
the night are at Gods diſpoſe; ſo alſo is this
ſpiritual ligh of comfort, and the darkneſſe
of a deſerted and dejected ſpirit. God gives
divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and ſpiritual conſolations out of the
goodneſſe of his will, and withdraws them,
to ſhew the abſoluteneſſe and ſoveraign li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of his Will.</p>
            <p>2. To let his people know, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is not eſſential to holineſſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſeparably and neceſſarily belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to grace. Though there cannot be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:30639:75"/>
true peace, where there is no grace; yet there
may be true grace, where there is no peace.</p>
            <p>3. God in the diſpenſation both of grace
and comfort, ſhews himſelf a free and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Agent; and all our graces which God
works in us, are meerly from Gods grace to
us. He will give comfort when and to whom
he pleaſeth, but ſtill as a reward of his own
free grace, the comfort of a pardon. The
comfortable knowledge of our pardon is as
well from Gods free grace as the pardon it
ſelf; and therefore God ſuſpends the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of grace to make us looke up to him
for it. When thou repenteſt, God gives a
pardon, but therein he rewards his owne
work in thee. To give a pardon or ſenſe of
a pardon is an act of meer liberality in God.</p>
            <p>4. God doth this to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
heaven and earth. Heaven is a place
for comfort, earth for duty: earth is for the
getting of grace, heaven for the rewarding
of grace. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, like the
good Maſter of the Feaſt, reſerves the beſt
for laſt. The ſons of Nobles, when they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
into forraign parts, have no more allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
then what will accommodate their
travels, the inheritance is reſerved for them,
when they come to their fathers houſe: So
believers, who are ſtrangers and pilgrimes
here, they have ſo much grace and comfort
as befits their paſſage to heaven; but they
have an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled,
that fadeth not away, but is reſerved in the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:30639:75"/>
heavens. God thinks it not ſit to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
comforts in an inconſtant world, nor
full comforts in an empty world, nor laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
comforts in a tranſitory world.</p>
            <p>2. Reaſon may be taken from our ſelves,
and that in many regards, that have much
grace, yet may have but a little comfort; and
this may ſpring from a threefold root in us;</p>
            <p>1. From ſomething that is meerly natural
in us.</p>
            <p>2. From ſomething that is ſpiritual and
good.</p>
            <p>3. From ſomething that is evil in us.</p>
            <p>1. This may ariſe from the prevalency of
a natural melancholy in the body, whereby
the underſtanding may be darkned, the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
troubled, reaſon perverted, and the ſoul
ſadned. Melancholy is the mother of diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>comfort,
and the nurſer of doubting. It was
(as ſome think) depth of melancholy that
prevailed upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that he did
not know, whileſt under the power of that
diſtemper whether he was a man or a beaſt:
And in the like manner may this bodily me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
ſo far diſtemper thy ſoul, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
who haſt grace, yet mayeſt not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art a childe of God, or a childe of
the devil. It is no more wonder to ſee a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
man doubt and queſtion his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
condition, then it is to ſee a childe cry
when he is beaten, or to heare a ſick man
groan. You may ſilence a melancholy man
when you are not able to comfort him, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30639:76"/>
though you may reſolve his doubts and
ſcruples by evident and convincing anſwers
and arguments, yet let but ſuch a man retire
alone, and brood over his melancholy
thoughts, by the prevalency of this pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
humour, all is forgotten, and he is as
unſatisfied, as if you had ſaid nothing to
him. And you may perceive, that it is the
power of melancholy, that is the cauſe
of a mans diſtemper, when he is very much
troubled, and yet can give no diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any particular thing that doth
trouble him.</p>
            <p>2. This diſcomfort often ariſeth from
that which is good in us, <hi>viz.</hi> from that holy
jealouſie and tenderneſſe of conſcience,
which makes a childe of God ſuſpect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into his condition: and though he
have true grace, and much grace, yet he is
afraid leſt all be but a deluſion; in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the ſoul doth ſo pore on ſin and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that it cannot ſee its own evidences. A
tender conſcience is more apt to be dejected
in the ſight of ſinne, then to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ſenſe of grace, and the reaſon of
this is, becauſe ſin doth more directly fall
under the cognizance of our conſcience, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
a natural conſcience.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>The works of the
fleſh are manifeſt,</hi> but the fruits of grace and
of the ſpirit are not ſo eaſily diſcerned.</p>
            <p>3. This diſcomfort uſually ſprings from a
root of bitterneſſe, even in the beſt of Gods
children, and that whereby God doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the ſins of his people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:30639:76"/>
1. <hi>Their quenching the motions of the Spirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Res delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta eſt, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Dei ità nos tractat, ſicut tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</note>
If you grieve the Spirit of God, it is juſt
with God to grieve your ſpirits: you never
ſend Gods Spirit ſad to heaven, but God
may make ſad your ſpirits on earth.</p>
            <p>2. Sleightineſſe and fearleſſeneſſe of heart
towards God. When children grow ſaucy,
peremptory and malapert before their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
'tis no wonder if a fathers frown cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
not their irreverence. Moſt of thoſe who
lie uncomfortably under ſenſe of diſpleaſure
of God, may thank themſelves for it, they
have provoked God by their bearing them
ſelves too much upon his love, and growing
ſecure and fearleſſe to offend God. God
loves to have his children come near him in
an holy confidence that he is their father,
but yet to keep their diſtance by humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</p>
            <p>3. Another ſin that God puniſhes in his
children, by withholding comfort from
them that are ſtrong in grace, is their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliouſneſſe,
contempt and uncompaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateneſſe
towards others that are but weak in
grace. God own people are very much to
blame herein, in rigour and unmercifulneſſe
towards thoſe that are weak in the faith, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing
all that are inferiour to them in gifts
and graces, whereby they often <hi>break the
bruiſed reed, and quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> and
want bowels of pitty and tenderneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their brethren. To take down pride,
God often brings ſuch, even his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:30639:77"/>
to be low in comfort; and it is but juſt
that they ſhould want comfort, who have
neglected to comfort and cheriſh thoſe that
were weak in grace.</p>
            <p>4. A growing cold and lazy, and heedleſſe
in holy duties. If we put off God without
true ſervice, God may juſtly put us off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
true comfort. This rule holds in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
affairs, <hi>He that will not work ſhall not eat.</hi> If
we abate in the ſanctifying work of the
Spirit, it is but juſt that God withhold the
comforting work of the Spirit. <hi>The ſluggard</hi>
ſaith <hi>Solomon, hath poverty enongh,</hi> ſo if we
grow lazy and ſluggiſh in holy duties, it is
juſt that our ſtock of comfort do decay.
Though holy duties do not merit comforts,
yet comfort uſually riſeth and falls accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our diligence in duties. True grace
is never ſo apparent to, and ſenſible in the
ſoul, as when it is in action; and therefore
want of exerciſe muſt needs cauſe want of
comfort. As fire in the flint is never ſeen or
felt, till it be ſtruck out by the Steel: ſo is
grace and the comfort of grace, never ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
as when it is exerciſed much in holy
duties.</p>
            <p>5. Any one ſin indulged by, or concealed
in the conſcience, is enough to marre all
your comfort. Concealed guilt contracts
horrour. The Candle will never burn clear
whileſt there is a thief in it. Sin in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is like <hi>Ionah</hi> in the ſhip, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a tempeſt, that the conſcience is like a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30639:77"/>
troubled ſea whoſe waters cannot reſt: or
it is like a mote in the eye, which cauſeth a
perpetual trouble while it is there: or like
the winde gathered in the caverns of the
earth, makes earthquakes and terrible erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It is juſt with God,<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 19.</note> that <hi>a mans own
iniquities ſhould correct him, and his back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſhould reprove him.</hi> Concealed guilt,
though it may not bring a childe of God to
hell, yet for a time it may bring hell into
his conſcience. So that by all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
we may ſee,<note place="margin">Pro. 14. 14.</note> that if our comforts be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
we may thank our ſelves for it.</p>
            <p>3 Reaſon is taken from the reſtleſſe rage
and malice of Satan, who when he cannot
do the greater, will do the leſſe: and if he
cannot damn thy ſoul, he will labour all he
can to diſquiet thy conſcience. The devill
aim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> principally to make us walk ſinfully,
and if not ſo, then uncomfortably: if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make us live without God and Chriſt,
and grace in the world, then he indeavours
to make us live beſide the comfort of our
grace. And hence it is, that many dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to God, who have truth and ſtrength
of grace in them, yet heark'ning too much
to Satan, live beſide the comfort of their
grace.</p>
            <p>3. But what ſhall I do,<note place="margin">Queſt. 3.</note> that want the comfort
of my grace, to procure it, that ſo I may have
comfort anſwerable to grace?</p>
            <p>1. Live more in the exerciſe of grace;<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> and
and that is the ready way, not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30639:78"/>

               <hi>quietneſſe and aſſurance
for ever. Great peace have they which love thy

            <p>2. Leave no ſin unrepented of;<note place="margin">Anſw. 2</note> take heed
of guilt of ſin lying on the conſcience; take

the more ordered our wayes are, the more
ſteddy and full are our comforts, the more
ſin in the ſoul, the leſſe comfort in that ſoul.</p>
            <p>3. Call to minde former experiences that
thy ſoul hath had of God.<note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note> Thus did <hi>David,</hi>
when by reaſon of the diſcomfort of this

diſcomfort, when he cried, <hi>Will the Lord caſt

for ſo he addes,<note place="margin">Pſ. 77. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.</note> 
               <hi>verſ. 12. I will remember
the works of the Lord; ſurely I will remember
thy wonders of old, I will meditate of all thy
works, and talk of thy doings.</hi> Paſt experience
ſhould be preſent incouragements.</p>
            <p>4. Attribute to God the glory of his own
grace,<note place="margin">Anſw. 4.</note> and this is the way to enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of our grace. Say with the Church, <hi>Not
unto us O Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 115. 1.</note> 
               <hi>not unto us, but unto thy name
give the glory.</hi> It will be juſt with God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
you the comfort of grace, if you deny
him the glory of his grace. Want of comfort
is Gods Phyſick, to cure our ſouls of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
pride: and humble thankfulneſſe for the
leaſt grace, is the way to enjoy the comfort
of all our graces.</p>
            <p>5. Spend more time in cheriſhing thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
then in queſtioning of them.<note place="margin">Anſw. 5.</note> It is the
fault of ſome Chriſtians, to ſpend more
time in fruitleſſe complaints of the want of
comfort, then in faithful indeavours after
comfort in Gods way. There are thoſe who
are more inquiſitive how they loſt their
comforts, then careful how to recover them;
and ſo indeed they weaken their own hands,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30639:79"/>
but do ſtrengthen the hands of Satan.</p>
            <p>A fourth general propounded in the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Caſe, was this: What may be the
comfortable conſiderations which may be
gathered from the truth delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> That
ſtrong Chriſtians may be but weak in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?
Now the handling of this laſt, wil be an
application of the other three particulars, by
way of conſolation to thoſe that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
now have ſtrong grace, but weak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>1. The godly are never without the
ground of comfort,<note place="margin">Conſolat.</note> though they may be
without the ſenſe of comfort. Though they
may be without preſent feeling, yet they do
not want real cauſe of conſolation. They
have an undoubted right to comfort,
though not a clear ſight of comfort. A childe
may have right to an inheritance, though he
be not able to demonſtrate and prove his
right. Perhaps a man cannot read his eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for his land, and yet thoſe evidences
give him a right to his lands: So it is with a
childe of God, he hath comfort ſowen,
though perhaps he cannot preſently reap it.
<hi>Light is ſowen for the righteous, and joy for the
upright of heart.</hi> As it was with <hi>Hagar</hi> in the
wilderneſſe of <hi>Beer-ſheba,</hi> her water was
ſpent in the bottle, and ſhe caſt her childe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from her, becauſe ſhe could not endure
to ſee him die; ſhe lift up her voice and wept
that ſhe and her child ſhould both miſerably
periſh by thirſt, and yet there was a Well of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30639:79"/>
water hard by her,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 16 17.</note> but ſhe ſaw it not: ſo it is
with many a poor ſoule, who are athirſt for
comfort, and (as they think) ready to periſh,
and yet there is a Well of water of life and
comfort faſt by, but they want the eye of
faith to ſee it. And this is a great comfort,
that a child of God, though he may want
comfort, yet he hath right unto comfort, in
that he hath truth of grace in him.</p>
            <p>2. At that time when God withholds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from thee, yet he doth really love thee.
Jeſus Chriſt doth ſometimes ſerve his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſerved his brethren. He ſpake
roughly to them, and he put them in priſon,
and yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> did dearly love his brethren,
and his bowels did yern towards them.
Thus Jeſus Chriſt, his real love is the ſame
to his children at all times, though the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of it may not be alwaies alike;
<hi>Joſeph</hi> knew his brethren, though his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
did not know him. <hi>The Lord knows who
are his,</hi> though thoſe that are his perhaps do
not know that they are ſo. Jeſus knew
<hi>Mary,</hi> though ſhe did not know him.<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There may be as much mercy to us in
withdrawing of comfort, as in the giving of
comfort. God many times in wrath lets a
man be filled with the ungrounded comfort
of ſuppoſed grace. Oh (beloved) it is farre
better to want comfort then grace. Many a
man that hath no true grace, yet hath ſee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming
comfort; but a child of God is often
without comfort, that he may examine and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30639:80"/>
exerciſe his grace, and ſo at laſt enjoy a wel-grounded
joy, and a wel-bottom'd conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Grace is the beſt foundation of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
conſolation.</p>

            <p>4. Whether a man may have ſtrength of grace,
and yet want the comfort of his grace?</p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed now to a fifth Caſe of
Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether a man may be ſaid to have ſtrength
of grace,<note place="margin">Caſe 5.</note> who hath but weak gifts?</p>
            <p>In the opening of which Caſe I ſhall thus
proceed:</p>
            <p>1. I wil premiſe ſome propoſitions.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall poſitively reſolve the Caſe.</p>
            <p>3. And then give you ſome practicall in
reference, by way of Application.</p>
            <p>Ile begin with the firſt, namely the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30639:80"/>
and they are theſe four following:</p>
            <p>This firſt Poſition is this,<note place="margin">Poſit. 1.</note> That though all
believers they have the ſame Spirit, yet God
in his wiſdom thinks it fit they ſhalnot have
the ſame gifts.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> 
               <hi>There are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<hi>diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit.</hi> As it is
with flowers, there is not the ſame ſmell but
different ſmels to different flowers, and yet
all their ſents have the ſame influence from
above; and as it is with inſtruments of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
there are divers ſounds in the Organ,
but the ſame breath doth cauſe the ſeverall
ſounds: So in the Church of God, though
there is the ſame influence of the Spirit of
God, yet not the ſame meaſure of gifts in
each member of the Church.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Poſition is this,<note place="margin">Poſit. 2.</note> that diverſity
of gifts is not to be aſcribed to mans indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
diligence or education, but to the free
pleaſure and diſpenſation of God. It is true,
much may be aſcribed to ſtudy, and induſtry,
and diligence in a way of gifts, which was
the ground of the Apoſtles exhortation,
<hi>Give attendance to reading,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13. Ver. 15.</note> 
               <hi>to exhortation, to
doctrine, &amp;c. and meditate on theſe things, give
thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to all.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks there of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
in miniſteriall gifts: which gifts, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and ſtudy doe much advantage and
promote: yet though we were all equall in
ſtudy and diligence, there would be a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
in our gifts, leſt men ſhould vaunt of
their induſtry in acquiring gifts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

exclude Gods bounty in beſtowing them,

                  </gap>)
Suppoſe that two men were to read the ſame
books, and to ſtudy the ſame matter every day, yet
the one may be a dun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and a man of low gifts,
and the other may have rare parts and excellent
endowments; this is to ſhew who we are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to, that is God, whoſe diſpenſation of gifts
are many and variouſly beſtowed.</hi> Hence it is the
Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That all theſe gifts worketh
that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, dividing to
every man ſeverally as he will;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 11.</note> ſo that though
one man differ from another in gifts, yet it
is God that maketh him to differ.</p>
            <p>The third Poſition is this,<note place="margin">Poſit. 3.</note> That a man
may be excellent in one gift, and yet defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in other gifts, one man ſhall not have
all; this is very obſervable by inſtances you
have in Scripture. The firſt inſtance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> if you look unto
<hi>Paul,</hi> his gift was the gift of utterance, and

Paul</hi> was taken for <hi>Mercury</hi> the God of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 11.</note>
becauſe he was the chiefe Speaker,
and though it is ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>he was rude
of ſpeech,</hi> that is, not as if it were ſo indeed,
but in the opinion and conceit of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
who being ſeduced by falſe teachers,
hearkned to their diſparagements of <hi>Paul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 6</note>
               <hi>Paul</hi> he was a moſt eloquent man,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 36.</note> and had

other Apoſtles had. So that though ſome of
the Apoſtles had moſt excellent gifts, yet
ſome of them excelled others in ſome one
gift.</p>
            <p>The fourth Poſition is,<note place="margin">Poſit. 4.</note> That there are
Caſes, wherein men may have great gifts, but
weak grace. God is pleaſed ſometimes to
carry mens gifts very high, when their graces
have not a proportionable elevation, and
the reaſon is, becauſe gifts are for the good
of others, for the edification of the Church
of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 1 Cor. 3. 1.</note> and not for the good of a mans ſelf
only; <hi>They were wanting in no gift, and had all
knowledge;</hi> and yet when he mentions their
graces, he ſaith, <hi>I could not ſpeak to you as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
but carnal;</hi> They outſtrip other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in gifts, yet they came ſhort of other
Churches in grace. Such was the Church of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30639:82"/>
               <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſhe was rich in gifts,<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 11.</note> and poor in
grace. Now there are foure Caſes wherin
men may have ſtrong gifts, and yet but little
grace.</p>
            <p>1. When mens notions are clear and
ſtrong,<note place="margin">Caſe 1.</note> but mens experiences and affections
but low and weak, to have more expreſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
then impreſſions; to be like the Moon, that
though from the waine it grows big, and
increaſes to the full; yet it increaſes only
in light, and not in heat: So men when they
meerly increaſe in light of notions and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
and not in heat of affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and the practical part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
and it is to be feared, that much of
the Religion of theſe times is of this ſtamp,
it is more in notion then motion, more in
talking then walking, more in parts then
grace.</p>
            <p>2. When thy gifts are not influential up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy life.<note place="margin">Caſe 2.</note> Look as it is in that diſeaſe of the
Rickets, that children are liable to, they may
grow big in the head, and yet decay in the
lower parts: So there are ſome (as it hath
been ſhown) who have the diſeaſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Rickets, they do grow big in the head,
big in gifts, and yet decay in their vitals, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in grace and the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>3. When their gifts do but tend to the
promotion of diviſion in the Church,<note place="margin">Caſe 3.</note> and
pride in their own hearts. This was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 7.</note> they came
behinde in no gift; but ſee what he ſaith in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:30639:82"/>
               <hi>Verſ. 11. For it hath been declared unto me of
you (my brethren) by them which are of the
bouſe of</hi> Cloe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> 
               <hi>that there are contentions among
you.</hi> And then in <hi>verſ. 12. Now this I ſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> 
               <hi>that
everyone of you ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,
<hi>I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I of Chriſt,</hi> they
were carnal as to grace, and walked as
men, though they were high in gifts, and
when gifts engender ſtrife in the Church
and pride in a mans own heart, and when
they doe elevate and puffe up the heart with
vaine and high conceits; this is an argument
they are but meere gifts. The <hi>Corinthians</hi>
were in every thing inriched by God; in all
utterance and in all knowledge, ſo that they
came behind in no gift,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 7.</note> they had abundance
of knowledge,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note> but <hi>knowledge puffeth up, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
edifieth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. When gifts are encreaſed meerly by
vertue of continuall ſtudy and induſtry,<note place="margin">Caſe 4.</note>
when gifts proceed meerly from ſtrength of
natural parts, advantaged by education,
ſtudy and diligence; if gifts do meerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from that fountain, there may be much
gifts, but little grace. The greateſt ſchollers
are not alwaies the beſt men, the reaſon is,
becauſe their gifts are gotten by induſtry
and diligence; their gifts may be high, when
their graces are low.</p>
            <p>The fifth Poſition,<note place="margin">Poſit. 5.</note> there are caſes wherein
men may decay and be weak in gifts, and yet
may be ſaid to have ſtrength of grace.</p>
            <p>1. If it proceed meerly from a naturall,<note place="margin">Caſe 1.</note>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:30639:83"/>
not a ſinfull defect. If weak gifts proceed
from ſinfull defects, it argues grace is but
weak, as if it proceeds from negligence, from
ſloth, from careleſneſſe to attend upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
from idleneſſe in not reading, in
not meditating, in not praying, not uſing
holy conference, then grace decayes with
gifts, theſe are ſinful defects; but now if gifts
proceed meerly from naturall defects, as a
man of a ſhallow capacity, of a ſlow ſpeech,
of a bad memory, of a weakly body, that
either through ſickneſſe or old age the body
is weakned, in that there are natural decayes
in the body, becauſe the putting forth of
gifts depends upon the temperature and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the body. As it is with an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of muſick that is out of tune, it make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
no melody though the inſtrument be good:
So a body out of tune, hath not that uſe of,
or putting out of gifts. As it is with an old
Preacher, his gifts may decay when he is an
old man, that he may not have ſuch freedom
of ſpeech, ſuch clearneſſe of judgement, ſuch
ſtrength of memory; as the body decayes,
the gift of Elocution wil decay, and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
may decay, that he may not be ſo ready
in delivering the Word, but yet he may have
as great ability in preaching, yea more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
more ſolid judgement, and more
clear underſtanding in the myſteries of the
Goſpel, then a young man can have: ſo it is
with Chriſtians, their gifts may decay, as the
temper of the body decayes; as it is with a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30639:83"/>
Muſician, when he is a young man his joints
being more plyable, playes more nimbly and
melodiouſly upon an inſtrument of muſick,
but when he comes to be an old man he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
play ſo nimbly and melodiouſly, his
joynts being ſtiffe, but yet he hath more skill
then a young man hath. When this doth not
proceed from ſinful defects, but from natural
defects, then may a mans grace be ſtrong,
though his gifts and parts be weak.</p>
            <p>2. If you want thoſe externall advantages
to further and promote the growth of gifts,<note place="margin">Caſe 2.</note>
as for example, A Chriſtian that follows an
ordinary trade, which carries a Water-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
on his ſhoulder, he may attain more
brokenneſſe of heart, more humility and
ſelf-denial, more experience of the goodneſs
of God toward his ſoule, and of the method
of God, then he who perhaps is in ſome
great, honourable, and eminent imployment:
But that Chriſtian who hath this mean im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and ſuch poore education, ſhall
not attain thoſe gifts, that others have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
who have greater advantages. As it is
with a Scholler that hath been divers yeers
at the Univerſity, he hath thoſe external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
as education and literature, that
his gifts and parts may be much increaſed;
when perhaps a poore man that follows the
Plough, may attain to more grace, and more
acquaintance with the waies of God. Now
if ſuch a man have not ſo many gifts as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it is not his ſin: God doth not require
more then he gives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:30639:84"/>
3. If you have not a calling to uſe or put
forth the exerciſe of your gifts.<note place="margin">Caſe 3.</note> Your gifts
may decay, though grace do not decay. Gifts
are encreaſed by exerciſe, the leſſe they are
exerciſed the more they decay: if thou haſt
not an opportunity to exerciſe thy gifts as
in former times, to pray in company, to
uſe holy conference, as in former times
thou hadſt; in ſuch a caſe a Chriſtian
who is ſtrong in grace may grow weaker in
gifts.</p>
            <p>4. If what you want in gifts you make up
in humility.<note place="margin">Caſe 4.</note> Strength of grace is not to be
meaſured by notions and ſpeculations in the
head, but by humility in the heart; therefore
if thy gifts be weak, if thy humility be great,
thou haſt ſtrength of grace: the leſſe bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes
there are on the branches, the more
ſap there is in the root. He that hath great
parts, and is proud of them, it is much to be
feared hath leſſe grace, then that man who
hath but few gifts, and low parts; but in the
ſenſe of their own weakneſſe, hath low and
ſelf-denying thoughts of himſelf.<note place="margin">Caſe 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, if what you want in gifts you
make up in your practice, by a holy and
conſcionable walking. That Martyr that
ſaid, <hi>I cannot diſpute, but I can burn for the
truth,</hi> had more grace, then thoſe that could
diſpute, but not burn.</p>
            <p>The application of this Caſe is onely for
Caution,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and I ſhall give you a threefold
Caution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:30639:84"/>
1 Caution. Take heed ye be not proud of
the greateſt meaſure of gifts you have; there
is nothing in the world that a man is ſo apt
to be proud of as his gifts; a man is not ſo
apt to be proud of grace, becauſe he hath a
principle to check his pride, but he is apt to
be proud of his gifts; a man is not ſo apt to
be proud of outward endowments, as clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
riches and the like, as he is apt to be
proud of his gifts. Expoſitors that do handle
the propheſie of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> they ſay that <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>
is called ninety three times (<hi>Thou ſon of
man</hi>) in that Propheſie; now there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prophet that is mentioned in all the
Bible, but onely one, which is called <hi>The ſon
of man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 7.</note> and that is <hi>Daniel.</hi> Now expoſitors
give this reaſon why he is called by this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
becauſe he was a Prophet of the greateſt
gifts, and had the moſt glorious viſions of
all the other Prophets. Compare this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
with <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Hoſea,</hi>
or all the reſt, yet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> propheſie is a
more dark, myſterious, profound book. Now
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> being a Prophet of the greateſt gifts;
God takes this care to keep his heart low,
<hi>Thou Son of man, Thou Son of man,</hi> and all is
to keep his heart low; which doth teach us
thus much, that thoſe that have great gifts,
they ought to ſpend a great deal of time to
keep their hearts humble and low, becauſe
there is a flatuous humour in our nature,
whereby we are apt to ſwell and be puft up
in the ſenſe of our own gift.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:30639:85"/>
2. Caution. Prize a little grace before a
great meaſure of gifts; ye will prize a pearle
though no bigger then a pea, more then a
great heap of ſtones. There is great reaſon
why we ſhould prize a little grace before
much gifts.</p>
            <p>1. Grace will laſt when gifts are withering.
Blazing Comets will fall when the Star ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
falls;<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> a falling Star is no Star but only a
Comet: So the hypocrites may have a great
blaze of their gifts, and yet may fall like
Comets that hover in the aire. Grace is like a
Star that keeps fixed in its orbe; there is a
great deal of difference betwixt a painted
face and a natural complexion, the painted
face will not alwayes laſt, but natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
that will alwayes remain. Gifts are
put paint, the ornament of the creature, but
true grace which is as the natural complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that will remain.</p>
            <p>2. Prize a little grace before much gifts,<note place="margin">Reaſon. 2.</note>
becauſe gifts will leave thee ſhort of heaven.
Chriſt told the learned Scribe, that he was
<hi>not far from the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> but alas,
for all his gifts and learning, he fell ſhort of
heaven. <hi>Many will ſay to me,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>in
that day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, have not we propheſied in
thy name, and in thy name caſt out devils, and
in thy name done many wondrous works.</hi> You
ſee it is obſervable, theſe men might pretend
to high and great gifts, and yet they to
whom God opened the ſacrets of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
againſt them he ſhut the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:30639:85"/>
A man may be a Preacher, and have the
ſecrets of heaven opened to him, and yet
have the gates of heaven ſhut againſt him. A
man may attain the gift in Chriſts name to
caſt out devils, a great and a miraculous gift,
and yet thoſe men that caſt out devils were
themſelves caſt to devils. <hi>We have done many
wondrous works,</hi> they that did wonders were
made a wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they that had ſo much gifts
came ſhort of heaven, yea they <hi>who may preach
to others may themſelves be caſt-awayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Do not miſtake ſtrength of gifts to be
ſtrength of grace.<note place="margin">3. Cant.</note> Parents would not judge
their children ſtrong when their heads and
breaſts are big, and their feet but feeble; ſo
you may grow big in your heads, in noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſpeculations, in gifts, and yet feeble
in practice of grace. Now that you may not
miſtake your ſelves, and may not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
I'le ſhew you how you may know the
difference betwixt thoſe that have ſtrong
gifts, and thoſe that have ſtrong grace. In the
generall take this: As Art reſembles nature,
ſo gifts reſemble grace. Now there are four
differences.</p>
            <p>1. As grace ſtrengthens, corruption wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens.<note place="margin">1. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>
It is with grace and luſts as it was
with the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.
As Davids houſe grew ſtronger and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ſo</hi> Sauls <hi>houſe grew weaker and weaker.</hi> As
the Ark was ſet up, <hi>Dagon</hi> was throwne
down; the <hi>Dagon</hi> of corruption will be
thrown down before the Ark of grace, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30639:86"/>
the Ark of the Covenant; But gifts may
ſtrengthen, and yet corruptions never the
weaker. Indeed gifts diſcover corruption,
but we are not able to mortifie and ſubdue it.
Gifts diſcover many corruptions, but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
none. Gifts take a cognizance of many
a ſin, but never put a period to any. Men that
have gifts are reſembled to the Moon, and
men that have grace are reſembled to the
Sun; the Moon hath an influence upon the
water to make that move; to ebbe and flow:
the Moon ſheds light upon all creatures, but
no heat, to make thoſe creatures grow and
ſpring: So a man of gifts may have light,
but no heat to thoſe gifts to make grace to
grow, and make ſin to fade and wither. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men are like the Sun, that doth not
only give light but heat, by the influence
thereof things ſpring and grow out of the
earth;<note place="margin">Surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

occaſionally ſtrengthen his corruptions, but
do not weaken them, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> could ſay,
<hi>Ignorant and illiterate man, they take heaven;
when others with all their Schollerſhip go to hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Where there is ſtrength of grace, there
the heart is more humbled under the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of grace received; the ſtronger the gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
are, the more the heart is humbled. But
ſtrength of parts in moſt men makes them
proud and lofty. Empty veſſels make the
greateſt noiſe, and ſo do ſhallow ſtreams: So
men that have great gifts are often empty of
grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. They are puft up with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:30639:86"/>
pride, who have more gifts then grace, and
by the humility of the ſoule you may know
whether that ſoule be ſtronger in grace then
in gifts.</p>
            <p>3. He looks more after the ſupply of the
grace he wants,<note place="margin">3. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> then in a way of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the grace he hath. This argued <hi>Paul</hi>
had much grace, when he thus ſpeaks, <hi>I doe
ſtrive after more and more grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13. expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> 
               <hi>if by any means
I might attain the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> that
is, I doe labour after perfection of grace,
which thoſe ſhall have that are raiſed from
the dead, and exalted in heaven, but now a
man that hath gifts, is more apt to look
what he hath then what he wanteth. Men of
gifts are more apt to look upon their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
then their imperfections, they look
upon their gifts in a multiplying glaſſe,
more then they are;<note place="margin">Munera non vulnera oſtendit. 4. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> and upon their failings
in an extenuating glaſſe, leſſe then they are.</p>
            <p>4. The more grace any one hath, the more
communicative he is, that others may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the ſame grace, When the Apoſtle
ſpeaks of the duties of husbands and wives,
he would have them further one another in
the way to heaven, <hi>conſidering they are heires
together of the grace of God.</hi> Chriſt alſo ſpeaks
to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7. Luk. 22. 32 33.</note> 
               <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen
thy brethren.</hi> By Converſion is not meant
Gods firſt act in bringing <hi>Peters</hi> ſoule home
to Chriſt, but it is meant by an eſtabliſhing
worke of grace, as if Chriſt ſhould have
ſaid, <hi>Peter,</hi> now thy grace is weak, and it will
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:30639:87"/>
be weaker by thy fall, but when thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from thy fall, and deniall of thy
Maſter, then ſtrengthen thy brethen, labour
to ſtrengthen the graces of other men, when
thy graces are ſtrong, and thy ſtrength reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and this is a very good evidence that
thou haſt not onely grace, but ſtrength of
grace thy ſelfe, when thou art carefull to
ſtrengthen others: but ſuch as have gifts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with little or no grace, they are loath to
communicate their gifts unto others, they
would willingly monopolize their gifts,
and grudge to impart them to others, they
would not have other men have the like
gifts with themſelves, leſt their glory ſhould
be darkned. They are not of <hi>John Baptiſts</hi>
mind, who cared not though he decreaſed,
ſo as Chriſt encreaſed, but rather they are
like to one <hi>Aſpendius</hi> a skilfull Muſician,
who would never play on his inſtrument
before any of his profeſſion, leſt they ſhould
learn his skill. This is a notable diſcovery
whether thou haſt ſtrong grace, or ſtrong
gifts only, which thou mayſt know by thy
willingneſſe and readineſſe to communicate
unto others, what God hath imparted unto
thee.</p>

If thou haſt grace in truth and reality, it will
encreaſe; be ſure thy grace be right, and as
the light ſhineth more and more to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
day, and as the nature of the leaven is,
that it doth ſpread through the whole lump,
ſo is grace, it is of a ſpreading and encreaſing
nature; and therefore be carefull thy grace
for nature and for eſſence be true, and for
the meaſure of it, it wil then encreaſe.</p>
            <p>2. In ſinding out the truth of grace, we
muſt not meaſure it ſo much by actions as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and holy diſpoſitions of the heart:
the bent, frame, and tendencies of the heart
are the beſt diſcoverers of grace in the heart.
When a Chriſtian caſts up all the ſtock of
grace he hath, he wil finde that it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
more in deſires then endeavours, &amp; more
in endeavours and attempts to perform holy
duties, then in performance it ſelf. Natural
life is more diſcernable by the heat, then by
the colour: a Painter may counterfeit the
one, but not the other. When the Lord Jeſus
is deſcribing the beauty of his Spouſe, he
doth not ſay, How faire are thy looks, but,
<hi>How fair is thy love.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Be not diſcouraged, though men of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
gifts fall away: for the pooreſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
that hath but the ſmalleſt meaſure of grace
ſhal never fall away. The gifts of a Formaliſt
may quickly wither, for they have their root
in nature: but the graces of a true Chriſtian
ſhal never periſh, becauſe they have their root
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:30639:88"/>
in Chriſt, <hi>A Chriſtians life is hid with Chriſt,</hi>
hid in him as in a root,<note place="margin">Col. 33.</note> as in the fountain of
life. A painted face may ſoon fade, ſo doth
not a true and natural complexion; the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
of a formal hypocrite is ſoon waſh't
out, but when true grace like a colour in
grain, hath grown habitual in the ſoul, it is
not removeable; ſooner will the Sun diſcard
its own beams, then Chriſt will deſert and
deſtroy the leaſt meaſure of true grace, which
is a beam from that <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Improve your little grace well; this is
the way to have more.<note place="margin">Luke 19. 1</note> 
               <hi>To him that hath ſhall
it be given,</hi> i. e. more ſhall be given. God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave any man a talent to hide it in a
napkin. The leaſt meaſure of grace is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
for. God is improved,</p>
            <p>1. When we aſcribe all the glory of grace
unto God; as he ſaid right,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 10</note> 
               <hi>Lord, thy pound
hath gained ten pounds.</hi> Thy pound, and not
my pains; We ſhould do all to the praiſe of
the glory of Gods grace. If we give God the
glory of his grace, he will give us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of our grace, and the increaſe of it.</p>
            <p>2. When for the edification and building
up of others in their moſt holy faith: to do
good to others is the beſt way to get more
good our ſelves: The more the Well is
drawn, the more water comes, and the better
the water is; ſo the more thy grace is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
the more grace thou wilt have, and the
ſweeter will the comfort be of thy grace.</p>
            <p>5. To weak Chaiſtians. Do not deny the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30639:89"/>
truth of grace in your ſouls, becauſe you
cannot finde the ſtrength of grace in your
ſouls. A poor weak man in a Conſumption
cannot lift up ſuch a weight, nor can he bear
ſuch a burden as a man in ſtrength and
health can do, yet he hath life as well as the
ſtrongeſt man in the world. It may be <hi>day</hi>
when it is not <hi>noon,</hi> thou mayſt in reſpect of
ſpiritual eſtate, have the ſtrength of a <hi>child,</hi>
though not the ſtrength of a <hi>man.</hi> It is not
only an act of <hi>untbank fulneſſe</hi> to God; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of <hi>uncharitableneſſe</hi> to a mans own ſoul, to
conclude a nullity of grace from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it.</p>
            <p>6. Look not ſo much on your ſins, but look
upon your grace alſo, though weak grace.
Weak Chriſtians look more on their ſins
then on their graces, yet God looks on their
graces, and overlooks their ſins and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
ſaith the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Ye have heard of
the patience of</hi> Job. He might alſo have ſaid,
<hi>Ye have heard of the impatiency of</hi> Job, but
God reckons of his people, not by what is
bad in them, but by what is good in them.
Mention is made of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>habs</hi> entertainment
of the ſpies, but no mention is made that ſhe
told the lie when ſhe did ſo, that which was
well done was mentioned to her praiſe, and
what was amiſſe is buried in ſilence, or at
leaſt is not recorded againſt her and charged
upon her. He that drew the picture of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
with his ſcarre on his face, drew
him with his finger on his ſcarre. God layes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:30639:89"/>
the finger of mercy upon the ſcarres of our
ſins. Oh it is good ſerving ſuch a Maſter,
who is ready to reward the good we do, and
is ready to forgive and paſſe by what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe;
and therefore thou that haſt but a
little grace, yet remember God will have his
eye on that little grace. <hi>He will not quench the
ſmoaking flax,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 20</note> 
               <hi>nor breake the bruiſed reed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Learn this for thy comfort, that though
thou haſt but a little grace, yet that little
grace ſhall not be extinguiſhed by thy ſtrong
corruption, but at laſt it ſhall over-maſter
your corruptions. What was ſaid of <hi>Eſau</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 23</note> 
               <hi>the one ſhall be ſtronger then the
other, and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> and
ſo it came afterwards to paſſe in the time of
<hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when there was no King in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King 22. 47.</note>
That may be fitly applyed to the affairs
of the ſoul, the elder ſhal ſerve the younger;
corruption in the ſoul is elder then grace in
the ſoul, and corruption is ſo oppoſite to
grace, that it labours for the extinction of
grace, but this ſparke ſhall live in the midſt
of the ſea of corruption, till at laſt that great
deep ſhall be made dry; and the houſe of
<hi>David</hi> ſhall at laſt quite put down the houſe
of <hi>Saul,</hi> the Name of the Lord will perform
this. And therefore thou that art but a weak
Chriſtian, learn to ſtay thy ſelf on the Name
of the Lord, till judgement be brought forth
into victory.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Vſe</hi> of this doctrine is unto ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
ſuch as have attained unto a higher
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:30639:90"/>
forme of grace in the ſchool of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Though you are ſtrong in grace, yet
remember it is not the grace of God in you,
but the free grace of God towards you, by
which you are juſtified. It is not our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
righteouſneſſe, but the imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of Jeſus Chriſt that is our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Oh conſider, you that have moſt
grace, what would become of you were it
not for free grace? Free grace is the ſureſt
and only refuge for a ſoul to flie unto. God
can finde matter of condemnation againſt
you not only for your worſt ſins, but your
beſt duties. The beſt Chriſtian hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to venture his ſoul on the beſt thought
that ever he conceived, nor on the moſt holy
duty that ever he performed, nor on the
higheſt grace that ever he exerciſed. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
inſtance hereof we have in <hi>Nehemiab,</hi>
who had much grace, and did much for
God, his people, his houſe, his cauſe, yet
prayes after all this,<note place="margin">Nehem. 13. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Spare me according to the
greatneſſe of thy mercy.</hi> Intimating that God
might finde therein matter enough to ruine
him, if God did not ſpare him for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
ſake. So <hi>Paul</hi> in the diſcharge of his
Miniſtery, proceeded with ſo much upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that he ſpeaks thus of himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I know
nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not hereby juſtified.</hi>
He knew that all the grace and excellency,
and uprightneſſe in him would not make
him righteous in the ſight of God.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 11. 19.</note> We read
of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> that when he had muſtered up
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:30639:90"/>
all his ſtrength, which was very great,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 11. 19.</note> for
he had <hi>eleven hundred thouſand men in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>
yet he goes to God, and prayes, <hi>Lord,
we have no might or power againſt theſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 10. 12.</note>
               <hi>and we know not what to do, only our eyes
are up to thee:</hi> So when a Chriſtian hath
muſtered up all the ſtrength of his grace, and
conſiders the great power of his corruptions
which do ſet themſelves againſt him, he had
beſt go to God and ſay, Lord I have no
power againſt theſe many and great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but my eyes are to thy grace that thou
mayſt help me. As in a pair of Compaſſes,
one foot is fixed in the Center, whilſt the o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
turns about the circumference: ſo muſt
the ſoul fix and ſtay it ſelfe on Chriſt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
it is exerciſed about holy duties. Though
Chriſt (as I formerly mentioned,) commen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
many parts of the Spouſe, yet not her
hands, to teach us, that all the Spouſe could
do,<note place="margin">Cant. 4. 1. to 8.</note> could not make her amiable in the eyes
of Chriſt, nor the Spouſes working for
Chriſt, but Chriſts work in the Spouſe made
her beautiful. Oh it is very hard through
ſtrength of grace to abound, in the work of
the Lord, and yet keep the heart humble:
And therefore</p>
            <p>2. Conſider, they that have moſt grace,
yet have great cauſe to be humbled, and that
in many reſpects.</p>
            <p>1. Thou haſt not ſo much grace and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as once thou hadſt: Once man was
beautified and beſpangled with many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:30639:91"/>
perfections before the fall, it might have
been ſaid of man, that he <hi>was perfect as his
heavenly father was perfect,</hi> for God made
man upright, that is, perfect, nothing was
wanting then to make man both an happy
and holy creature; but alas, the image of
God in us is now obliterated and defaced.</p>
            <p>2. He that hath moſt grace,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 12, 13.</note> hath not ſo
much as he ſhall have in heaven. <hi>Not that I
am perfect already, but I forget thoſe things that
are behind, and I preſſe forward unto thoſe
things that are before, yea I preſſe</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle)
<hi>toward the mark of the price of the High
Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the law of ſeverall things that were to
be a cubit and half high and broad,<note place="margin">Ex. 25. 10.</note> it being
an imperfect meaſure,<note place="margin">The errour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſticall Perfectiſts very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</note> it was to note, that
no man in this life hath an exactneſſe and
perfection, the uttermoſt that is attainable
by us in this life, is but imperfect. In this life
there is a <hi>plus ultra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23</note> ſomething ſtill to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in religion,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 2.</note> but in heaven men ſhall
be <hi>perfect.</hi> We ſhall in heaven <hi>be like to Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> whom though we now ſee but darkly
and in a glaſſe, then we ſhall ſee him as he is.</p>
            <p>3. They that have much grace, yet ſhould
be humbled, for there are thoſe that have
more grace then you, and yet have had leſſe
time and fewer advantages then you have;
there are thoſe that have gone before you
much for ſtrength of grace, and yet have
come behind you for means of grace: there
are thoſe who were the laſt and are firſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 16</note> and
before you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:30639:91"/>
4 Be humbled under much grace; for ye
have not ſo much grace as you ſhould have
had, concerning the means of grace you
have lived under. How many years have
you been in the ſchool of Chriſt, and yet
what little proportionable progreſſe have
you made in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt?
we may all bluſh to think what dunces we
have been in the ſchool of Chriſt. The trees
of the garden ſhould bear nore fruit then
the trees of the forreſt:<note place="margin">Luke 13. 6, 7.</note> the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which was unfruitful, was the more
intolerable, becauſe it was in the garden, in
the vineyard. What the Apoſtle complains
of the Hebrews, we our ſelves may juſtly take
up the complaint againſt our ſelves,<note place="margin">Heb, 5. 12.</note> that <hi>For
the time we ought to have been teachers, and yet
have need that one teach us again what are the
firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, and are
become ſuch as have need of milk, and not of
ſtrong meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. They that have much grace, and are
ſtrong in grace, yet have cauſe to be humble,
becauſe its likely they had more grace and
did more good heretofore then now; and
who is there almoſt that is not decayed, that
hath not in ſome degree or other <hi>left their
firſt love?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 5.</note> have you not had (I ſpeak to
grown and experienced Chriſtians) more
love and zeal to God, more hatred of ſin,
more griefe for ſinne, more feare of
offending God then now you have? are
there not many that have and do expreſſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:30639:92"/>
leſſe deſire after duty, leſſe fervency, leſſe
frequency, leſſe delight in holy duties then
formerly? Alas! how many through pride
and ſpiritual improvidence, through neglect
of Ordinances, and worldly mindedneſſe
have much abated in their ſpiritual eſtate!</p>
            <p>6. Be humbled, that though you be ſtrong
in grace, yet you have many corruptions in
you more ſtrong then many graces. More
are our vain thoughts then our meditations,
and more are the things we are ignorant of
then the things we know.<note place="margin">Quantum eſt quod neſcimus.</note> Corruption is
ſtrong enough to keep grace low, but in the
beſt grace is not ſtrong enough to bring
corruption under. <hi>When we would do good, evil
is perſent and powerful with us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 7. 21.</note> to hinder us
from doing of good: but when we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of evil, good is not preſent to hinder us
from that evil: we are more in ſinning then
in obeying. Our corruptions are like <hi>Goliath</hi>
our grace as <hi>David.</hi> We exerciſe more kinds
of ſins then graces: as in a ſield there are
more briats and thorns then uſefull trees,
and in a garden more unprofitable weeds
then roſes and lilies; ſo in the ſouls of the
beſt there are whole ſwarmes of vain, earthly
and ſinful thoughts, when there are but very
few holy and heavenly thoughts.</p>
            <p>7. Another argument why ſtrong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſhould be humble, is this, that though
they may have grace, yet they are ſubject to
fall into that ſin, which is moſt contrary to
that grace wherein they are moſt eminent.

               <hi>Abraham</hi> was moſt eminent for faith;<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 20.</note> he is

               <hi>They which be of faith are bleſſed

did break out in many raſh ſpeeches and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.

            </p>
            <p>8. This further conſideration may alſo
humble us, that in the higheſt and greateſt
exerciſe of grace there is much mixture of
ſin. We may obſerve, that even thoſe good
actions, for which many of the People of
God are recorded in Scripture, are yet ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh't
with ſome notable defect <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

kill the male-children of the Hebrews, and
yet they miſcarried as ſome obſerve in their

beſt action we do, and ſo apt to plough with

            <p>2. It is of the nature of grace to grow and
increaſe;<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 47</note> and therefore if thou hadſt grace,
either in truth of it, or in ſtrength of it, it
wil certainly grow. Grace in Scripture is
compared to a grain of muſtard-ſeed, the
leaſt of ſeeds, which afterwards ſprouts and
ſprings ſo,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 31 32, 33.</note> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that it becomes the largeſt of
plants. In the ſame chapter grace is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto leaven, which <hi>being put into the heap
of meale, leaveneth the whole:</hi> ſo grace (as I
touched before) in the heart, is of a ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
nature, and wil diffuſe it ſelfe into all
the parts, powers, and faculties of ſoule and
body. Chriſtians are therefore compared to
the branches of a Vine,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1.</note> which of all trees
grows moſt, and brings forth moſt fruit. A

Picture doth not grow, but a living child
wil grow.</p>
            <p>3. Such as are ſtrong Chriſtians ſhould yet
grow more and more, becauſe in this world
there is not ſtint and meaſure ſet for ſpiritual
growth: the <hi>maximum quod ſic</hi> of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

            <p>4. Shall worldlings ſet no bounds to their

            <p>HAving in the laſt foregoing Sermons,
treated of grace in its ſtrength and
growth, I am come to ſpeak to this additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
clauſe in the text, viz, <hi>That is in Chriſt
Jeſus:</hi> which paſſage is here inſerted by the
Apoſtle, that he might let <hi>Timothy</hi> know to
whom he was beholding, for all the grace he
had received, even unto Jeſus Chriſt. In the
tenth verſe he ſpeaks of <hi>ſalvation that is in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:30639:95"/>
Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and here of grace that is in
Chriſt Jeſus: so note,</p>
            <p>1. That Jeſus Chriſt is the fountaine and
foundation, both of grace and glory. Jeſus
Chriſt gives <hi>grace,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt gives alſo
<hi>ſalvation, with eternall glory,</hi> Ver. 10.</p>
            <p>2. That thoſe who receive grace from
Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall alſo receive ſalvation by
him, for there is an inſeparable union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
grace and glory.</p>
            <p>The grace of God that is in Chriſt Jeſus.
<hi>Grace may be ſaid to be in Chriſt</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As a ſubject recipient, and ſo Chriſt is
ſaid to be <hi>full of grace and truth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>he had the

               <note place="margin">John 3. 34.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. In <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 19.</note> as a fountain redundant
over-flowing &amp; ever-flowing to his people,

               <note place="margin">John 1. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, when it is ſaid that grace is in
Chriſt Jeſus, we muſt conſider Chriſt</p>
            <p>1. As God co-eſſential with the Father,
and he is the Author and giver of grace, and
of every good and perfect gift.</p>
            <p>2. Conſider him as Mediatour <hi>God-man,</hi>
and ſo he is the purchaſer and procurer of
grace, and of all the bleſſings of the New
Convenant, for <hi>the bleſſing of Abraham commeth
upon the Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, through Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>through Chriſt
Jeſus.</hi> So that by this phraſe, <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
there are three things implied.</p>
            <p>1. That Jeſus Chriſt is the Author and
Giver of grace; he onely is the <hi>Author and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:30639:95"/>
Finiſher of faith,</hi> and every grace in his
people.</p>
            <p>2. That Chriſt is the purchaſe of grace,
ſo that all the grace that is beſtowed upon
us by God, it is through Chriſt, and for his
ſake; Grace is from Chriſt as a fountain,
and by Chriſt as a Conduit.</p>
            <p>3. That Chriſt is the preſerver of grace, all
the grace that is in us is <hi>in Christ Jeſus,</hi> he
keeps all our graces for us: As the beams of
the Sun may be ſaid to be the Sun, becauſe
they are preſerved by their union with the
Sun. <hi>Our life is bid with Chriſt in God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 3.</note> hid as
the life of a tree is hid in the root, and the
being of a ſtream is hid in the fountain. And
herein is the comfort of believers, that their
condition is more ſtable and immutable and
ſafe, then ever <hi>Adam</hi> was in innocency, for
he had all perfections of a creature, but they
were in their own keeping; but now all the
grace that is in a believer is in Chriſt Jeſus,
by whom and in whom grace is ſafely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
ſo as it ſhall never periſh.</p>
            <p>The point of doctrine I obſerve from theſe
words is this:</p>
            <p>That all thoſe meaſures of grace,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are partakers, they receive them in and
from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the handling of which point I will
thus proceed:</p>
            <p>1. Shew you the truth of it.</p>
            <p>2. Give you the reaſons and grounds of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:30639:96"/>
Now to prove that all grace is received
in and through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. I will ſhew the truth of this by many
reſemblances, to which Chriſt is compared
in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. By many types of Chriſt in the Old
Teſtament.</p>
            <p>3. By many expreſſe teſtimonies in the
New Teſtament concerning this turth.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. There are many reſemblances in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which do illuſtrate this, that all grace
is from Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>1. He is compared to a root. <hi>He is called
the root of</hi> Jeſſe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 11. 10.</note> not only becauſe he came of
the ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> but that he gives grace
to Jew and Gentile that do believe: for <hi>to
him ſhall the Gentiles ſeek,</hi> as it followes in
the next words. Now that the Prophet there
ſpeaks of Chriſt, is plain by the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
application of that propheſie unto
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 2.</note> calling him the <hi>root of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>in whom
the Gentiles ſhould truſt.</hi> And Chriſt ſpeaks of
himſelfe,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Vine. As the branch cannot
bear fruit of it ſelf except it abide in the Vine, no
more can ye except ye abide in me;</hi> the life, ſap,
nouriſhment, growth and fruitfulneſſe of a
branch is altogether from the root, with
which the branches have union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt is called the Head of his people;
<hi>He is the Head of the body of the Church.</hi> Now
as ſenſe and motion is derived from the
head to the members of the body;<note place="margin">Col. 1 18.</note> ſo alſo is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:30639:96"/>
grace derived from Jeſus Chriſt to every true
believer, every living member of his body.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſt is called the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſſe</hi>
becauſe as heat and light are communicated
by the Sun to things here below,<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note> ſo there is
a ſweet influence of grace from Chriſt upon
believers.<note place="margin">Niſi deſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> As by vertue of the Sunnes influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the vegetable and ſenſible creatures
live, move and grow; ſo alſo the life and
growth of grace in the ſoul is from that
divine influence which Jeſus Chriſt doth
ſhed upon believers.</p>
            <p>4. Chriſt is compared to a fountain,<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 1.</note> 
               <hi>even
a fountaine opened to the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and to
the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for ſin and for
uncleanneſſe.</hi> So that as water doth ſtream
forth in the river from the fountain, ſo
grace flowes down from Jeſus Chriſt upon
believers, who is a fountain, where all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of grace for ever dwels, and from
whence all grace is drawn and derived; and
this is the firſt proof.</p>
            <p>2. This truth may be demonſtrated by the
many types of Chriſt in the old Teſtament
which did ſhadow out unto us this, that all
grace is from Jeſus Chriſt. I ſhall mention
ſome.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt was to lay his
<hi>bands on the People, and to bleſſe them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 9. 22.</note> And
herein he was a type of Chriſt our great and
heavenly High Prieſt, through whom we
are bleſſed with all grace.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>God having bleſſed
us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:30639:97"/>
               <hi>in Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt is ſent by God to
bleſſe his people, and to turn every one of them
from their iniquities.</hi> And therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by St. <hi>Luke</hi> that a little before the
Aſcenſion of our bleſſed Saviour,<note place="margin">Luk. 24 50</note> 
               <hi>he laid his
hands upon his diſciples, and bleſſed them:</hi> and
ſo he doth ſtill bleſſe all true believers with
the ſpiritual bleſſing of grace.</p>
            <p>2. Another type of Chriſt was <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who
in many things was a type of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Joſeph</hi>
was the <hi>beſt beloved of his fathers children;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 30. 17.</note> ſo
was Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>the ſon of his fathers love:</hi>
Joſeph <hi>was hated of his brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>and ſold for
twenty pieces of ſilver;</hi> ſo was Jeſus Chriſt,
<hi>he came unto his own, and his own received him
not,</hi> he was rejected by them, <hi>and ſold for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pieces of ſilver.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> Joſeph was <hi>carryed into</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
and ſo perſection <hi>drove Chriſt into</hi>
Egypt <hi>preſently after he was born.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 28</note> Joſeph was
<hi>falſly accuſed and condemned:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 20</note> ſo was <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
Joſephs troubles ended in his advancement;<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 20</note>
ſo all the troubles of Chriſt, <hi>wrought for him
a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 9.</note>
               <hi>God having therefore highly exalted him, and
given him a name above every name,</hi> for now
Chriſt is ſate down at the right hand of the
Father; But eſpecially in this, <hi>Joſeph</hi> did type
out <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that in that dreadfull laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
famine in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 55, 56, 57.</note> 
               <hi>Joſeph</hi> had the cuſtody
of all the corne in the land, and he had the
iſſuing out of all the Proviſion for bread, in
all the land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So the Lord Jeſus is
the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> of all that ſtore of grace,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:30639:97"/>
with which believers are furniſhed, which
grace is given to help them in time of need.
Jeſus Chriſt hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> he hath
the Key of the treaſury of grace.</p>
            <p>3. Another type of Jesus Chriſt was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi>
who gave unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> entrance and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the good land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 84. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He will
give grace and glory, and no good thing will be
withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 8, 9.</note> Our
Jeſus gives his people a <hi>better reſt</hi> then ever
<hi>Ioſhua</hi> brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto.</p>
            <p>4. Another type of Chriſt was the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
of the tabernacle, the ſeven lamps
whereof did give light unto the whole ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.
Now theſe <hi>ſeven lamps,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo. 25. 37</note> what did
they type out but the graces of the Spirit of
Chriſt, for ſo it is ſaid, that there were <hi>ſeven
lamps of fire burning before the throne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>which
are the ſeven ſpirits of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 42.</note> The Holy Ghoſt
and the graces of it, being ſo deſcribed by
<hi>ſeven ſpirits</hi> in this regard, becauſe of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
and protection of that grace which is
in the Lord Jeſus, and by his Spirit commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to all his members.</p>
            <p>3. The third proof of this doctrine may
be drawn from the conſideration of thoſe
clear teſtimonies of this truth in the New
Teſtament. St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks thus of Chriſt
that <hi>of his fulneſſe we have received, and grace
for grace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 16. expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Plenitudo repletiva &amp; dissusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
               </note> In Chriſt there is not only <hi>plenty,</hi>
but <hi>bounty;</hi> not only an <hi>abundance</hi> of all
grace, but a <hi>redundance</hi> of grace. Chriſtians
have the fulneſſe of a <hi>veſſel,</hi> but Chriſt hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:30639:98"/>
the fulneſſe of a <hi>fountain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plenitude vaſis Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> Take a drop of
water out of a veſſel, and it is not ſo full as
before, but draw as much water as you pleaſe
out of the Well of the water of life, and
there is no want of water. From Chriſt we
receive <hi>grace for grace,</hi> that is, ſay ſome, the
grace of the New Teſtament, added to that
grace which was revealed under the Old
Teſtament.<note place="margin">Perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So Jeſus Chriſt, that true Olive tree, doth

ſo as not excluding God the Father, and to

            <p>3. And then again, Jeſus Chriſt is commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated
and deſigned by the Father, to give

               <hi>I came down from heaven, not to do

Now it is the will of God, that from Chriſt
believers ſhould receive both juſtifying and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:30639:99"/>
ſanctifying grace. <hi>Our ſanctification is Gods
Will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 3</note> and Chriſt came to fulfil that will

who is called the holy Spirit, and the Spirit of

            <p>What Chriſt is ſaid to work,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 3, 4.</note> So it is ſaid, that

of gifts, yet the ſame Spirit, and though
there are differences of adminiſtrations, yet
the ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Author of
all grace through the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. The reaſon and ground of this, why
Jeſus Chriſt is the Author, Purchaſer and
conveyer of grace to his People, is,</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe God the Father hath appointed
Jeſus Chriſt, as Mediatour, to tranſact the
great work of ſanctifying and ſaving his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe by this ſhall the reproach be
rowled away from Chriſt, who in his life
time was reputed the greateſt of all Male-factors,
and accordingly ſuffered death.
They were wont to ſay, <hi>can any good come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of</hi> Nazareth? God hath therefore given
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:30639:100"/>
               <hi>him a name above all names,</hi> that he ſhould
not only <hi>be anointed with oyl above his fellows,</hi>
by his receiving the <hi>Spirit without meaſure,</hi>
but that the oyl that was <hi>poured upon the
head of our High-Prieſt ſhould run down upon
the skirts of his garments;</hi> and that grace
which was abundant in him, ſhould alſo be
redundant to his Church, and run down,
and diffuſe it ſelf to all his members.</p>
            <p>3. To manifeſt that Jeſus Chriſt was the
ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and came into the world to
repaire the breaches which the ſin of the firſt
<hi>Adam</hi> had made. For by the fall we did not
only contract upon our ſelves the guilt of
<hi>Adams</hi> ſin, to take off which we have need of
the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed, but we
have drawn upon our ſelves the filthineſſe
and pollution of ſin, to take away the power
whereof, only the grace, holineſſe, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to us
doth avail: and as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was the
Author and conveyer both of the guilt, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
and puniſhments of ſin to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
ſo Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs
the life of grace into all his. As the
firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was the author to communicate
natural life, as he <hi>was made a living ſoule;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 45.</note> ſo
the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did communicate the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
life of grace as he was made <hi>a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſpirit.</hi> From the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by natural
generation and propagation, we receive cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
for corruption; ſo from the ſecond
<hi>Adam</hi> we receive grace for grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:30639:101"/>
1. <hi>Vſe</hi> of this Doctrine is for Confutation.</p>
            <p>1. Of the Socinians errour, who ſay that
all grace in Chriſt, whether his active or
paſſive righteouſneſſe, was only to qualifie
his perſon, and to merit his own glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without any reference unto us, unleſſe
as an exemplar or patterne. But this opinion
is ſufficiently confuted by this Doctrine, by
which hath been ſhown, that as all our grace
is from Chriſt, ſo that abundance of grace
that is in Chriſt is for us. As the woman
hath abundance of milk in her breſt, not for
her ſelf, but for her childe; and the Sun
hath abundance of light, not for it ſelf, but
for the world: So Jeſus Chriſt is full of
grace and truth, but this fulneſſe is in order
to the filling of his members. As in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
body there are ſome ſpecial parts, that
do ſtand as officers unto all the reſt; the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
receives much meat, not for it ſelf, but
that it might communicate it to all the
members; the head hath the ſenſes ſeated in
it, not for it ſelf, but for the whole body: So
it is in the myſtical body, whereof Chriſt is
the head; the abundance of grace, which is
treaſured up in Chriſt, is in order to ſupply
every member with grace. <hi>For their ſakes</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt himſelf of his elect,) <hi>I ſanctifie
my ſelfe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 19.</note> 
               <hi>that they alſo might be ſanctified
through the truth.</hi> Some do refer this to
Chriſt, being ſet apart to the office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
that it was not for his own ſake,
but for the ſake of his members, and though
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:30639:101"/>
there be grace enough in Chriſt to qualifie
his perſon, yet alſo there is grace enough in
him to juſtifie our perſons too, and ſanctifie
our natures.</p>
            <p>2. This alſo reproves the errour, pride and
folly of the Pelagians, Papiſts and Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who derogate from God, and arrogate
to themſelves. Theſe people like <hi>Sampſon,</hi>

this doctrine, quell all boaſting in us of any

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30 31.</note> 
               <hi>and redemption, are all
from Chriſt, and therefore he that gloryeth let
him glory in the Lord.</hi> Conſider, <hi>who maketh
thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou
that thou didſt not receive? now if thou didſt
receive it, why didſt thou glory as if thou hadst
not received it?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor 4. 7.</note> Who but a proud foole
would magnifie himſelfe in that, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
another giveth him, or another hath
done for him. We count it an odious pride
and folly in a man to boaſt himſelfe of that
which another hath done. And therefore
the Apoſtle profeſſeth, that he did not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
himſelfe as thoſe falſe teachers had done,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:30639:103"/>
who were crept into the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>We doe not boaſt of things
beyond our meaſure, that is, of other mens labours,
nor boaſt in another mans line of things made
ready to our hand.</hi> Now all grace is made
ready to our hands, and is onely the worke
of Jeſus Chriſt in us, <hi>who worketh all our works
for us. Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> tels us of one
<hi>Lampadius,</hi> a great perſon in <hi>Rome,</hi> who in

are they guilty of, who wil ſet their owne
names before Gods, over the work of grace
in their own ſouls. <hi>Oh remember that boaſting
is excluded by the law of faith.</hi> Faith is that
grace which emptieth the creature of all its

            <p>1. How voluntarily and freely Jeſus Chriſt
doth iſſue out his grace to his people. Never
did a mother more willingly give her child

               </gap> did ake and were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to break, then Jeſus Chriſt doth beſtow
grace upon his people. Chriſt doth not like
a merchant ſell his grace, but like a King
freely beſtow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of grace how free it was,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ho, every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that
hath no money, come ye, buy and eate, yea come,
buy wine and milk, without money and without
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:30639:105"/>
price. Let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever
will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 17</note> 
               <hi>let him take the water of life freely;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is ſo free as grace: it is offered and is
beſtowed upon the freeſt termes imaginable.
All that Chriſt requires,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 31.</note> is but our receiving
it. It is the delight of Chriſt to ſhew mercy,
and beſtow grace upon his people. It is the
meat of Chriſt to do the Will of God that
ſent him,<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 34.</note> and to finiſh his work. Never was
man more willing to eat his meat when he
is hungry, then Jeſus Chriſt was to do good
and beſtow grace upon them that wanted it.
So alſo it is ſaid of Chriſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. (which
is clearly a prophesie of Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>that he
ſhould come down like raine upon the mowen
graſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 6</note> 
               <hi>and as ſhowers that water the earth.</hi> Now
there is nothing comes down more ſweetly
and freely, then the rain upon a dry and
thirſty ground.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, look unto Jeſus the Author
of grace, how irreſiſtibly he doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his grace. <hi>I will work, and who can let it?</hi>
It's true,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43. 13.</note> not only of Gods eternal delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
but is as true of Gods working grace
in the hearts of his people. <hi>Who ſhall let?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Satan ſhall not, for though he be a
ſtrong man, and armed, and hath got poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
yet when Chriſt comes, he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
ſtronger then Satan.</p>
            <p>2. Sin ſhall not be able to hinder Gods
work of grace. Grace ſhall be too hard for
the ſtrongeſt oppoſition, that is made againſt
it. It is true, a man may and doth reſiſt the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:30639:106"/>
grace of God, with a gainſaying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
reſiſtance, but not with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, look up to Jeſus the beſtower
of grace, how proportionably he gives grace
ſuitable, and anſwerable to thy temptations
and need.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 11.</note> 
               <hi>God divides to every one his grace

                  </gap>nd gifts, ſeverally as he will,</hi> and yet he gives
grace that ſhall be enough. <hi>My grace is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for thee,</hi>

ſufficient to make thee wait upon me,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill I give thee deliverance.</p>
            <p>5. Be exhorted to have recourſe to Jeſus
Chriſt for ſupply of grace. Go to Jeſus, and
by the Prayer of faith approach to the
Throne of grace, and beg grace to help thee
in time of need. Go unto God by Chriſt,
and God through Chriſt will ſupply all
your wants.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 19. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>My God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,
ſhall ſupply all your need, according to
his riches in glory by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Go to this
God, and expreſſe your ſelves before his

requeſts, ſay, Lord, ſeeing there is ſo
much water in the fountain, why ſhould my
ciſterne be empty? ſuch fulneſſe of grace in
Chriſt, and ſo little grace in my heart? Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 58. 18</note>
haſt thou not <hi>gifts for men, yea for the rebellious
alſo,</hi> and that's the worſt that can be ſaid of
me, and haſt thou not a bleſſing for me alſo?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Vſe</hi> of caution, though we ſay that all
grace is in and from Chriſt.</p>

1. This ſhould not cut off our endeavours
after grace:<note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note> we ſhould ſo earneſtly labour
to get grace, as if there were no way to have
it but by our endeavours, we ſhould ſo ſtrive
to get heaven, as if it were to be gotten by

promiſes and purpoſes of giving grace
ſhould rather quicken, and greaten, then any
ways ſlacken our endeavours after grace. See
how the apoſtle makes Gods working grace
in us, a ground why we ſhould work: <hi>Work
out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12, 13.</note>
               <hi>for it is God which worketh in you both to will
and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> And again, <hi>I
know the thoughts that I think towards you
(ſaith the Lord,) thoughts of peace, and not of e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vil,
to give you an expected end;</hi> but ſee alſo
how God joyns their <hi>duty</hi> with his <hi>promiſe,</hi>
the <hi>means</hi> unto the <hi>end:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Then ſhall ye call upon
me, and ye ſhal go, and pray unto me, and I wil
hearken unto you.</hi> So alſo in the propheſie of
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Lord had promiſed to do great
things for them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37.</note> and then addes, <hi>Thus ſaith
the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by
the houſe of</hi> Israel, <hi>to do it for them.</hi> Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to <hi>David</hi> to build him an houſe, did not
at all ſlack his prayer to God for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for thus we finde <hi>David</hi> praying,
<hi>Thou, O my God haſt told thy ſervant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chro 17. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>that thou
wilt build him an houſe, therefore thy ſervant
hath found in his heart to pray before thee. And
now Lord (thou art God, and haſt promiſed this
goodneſſe to thy ſervant) now therefore let it pleaſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:30639:107"/>
thee to bleſſe the houſe of thy ſervant, that it may
be before thee for ever, for thou bleſſeſt, O Lord,
and it ſhall be bleſſed for ever.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 10.</note> Thus alſo did
<hi>Paul, By the grace of God I am what I am, and
his grace which was beſtowed upon me, was not
in vaine, but I laboured more abundantly then
they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was
in me.</hi> See how he joyns Gods grace and his
own indeavours together. Thou muſt then
ſo indeavour after grace, as if it were to be
gotten by <hi>labour,</hi> and not beſtowed by <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
yet when thou haſt done all thou canſt,
thou muſt acknowledge grace to be free, as
if thou hadſt not laboured at all.</p>
            <p>2. Though there be abundance of grace in
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.</note> yet let all ſuch as have no intereſt in
Chriſt, take heed how they flatter themſelvs
into a conceit, that they ſhall receive grace
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt; Intereſt in the Perſon, gives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of his grace. As it was in Chriſts
Perſon, he could not have had thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
and attributes which were in God,
had not his two natures humane and divine
been perſonally united in him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid by vertue of the hypoſtatical
union,<note place="margin">Col. 2 9.</note> that <hi>in him, i. e. in his Perſon, dwelleth
all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</hi> So unleſſe
there be that myſtical union between Chriſt
and us, we could not be Partakers <hi>nor grow
ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Ieſus. Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the ground of Communion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12, 16. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note> and therefore
we read firſt of <hi>receiving Chriſt,</hi> and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
of <hi>receiving of his fulneſſe grace for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:30639:107"/>
grace.</hi> Though thou art near Chriſt by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
yet if thou art not one with Chriſt
by faith, thou canſt not receive any vertue
from him. If a man tie food to any part of
his body, it will not nouriſh him, becauſe
it is not received, concocted or concorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
that only nouriſhes, which becomes one
and the ſame ſubſtance with us. So we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſtrength and increaſe of grace from
Chriſt, as we are united unto him by faith
Take a graft, and tie it to a tree, and it
brings forth no fruit, but let it be united
unto a tree by implantation, then the graft
growes fruitful: ſo <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> (or as it
is in the Original) <hi>ſeparate from Chriſt you
can do nothing.</hi>

is a fountain of grace, but it is faith that
draws out of this fountain, Chriſt is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of grace, but it is faith that unlocks this
treaſury. By our communion with Chriſt
we receive grace for grace. We are made by
love, meekneſſe and patience like unto
Chriſt, but by faith we are made one with
Chriſt; and that Union is the cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and therefore Chriſtleſſe perſons
are graceleſſe perſons.</p>
            <p>3. If men want grace, yet let them know,<note place="margin">Caut. 3.</note>
that not Chriſt, but themſelves are to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:30639:108"/>
There is fulneſſe in Chriſt, there is
grace enough in Chriſt, in him there is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſufficiency, of efficiency, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy;
but if a veſſel be ſtopt, caſt it into
the Sea, and it will receive no water; and
the fault is in the veſſel which is ſtopt, there
is no want of water in the Sea. They that
have the river-water or conduit-water come

ſtopt or broken; So it is, if ever you are
ſtraitened, you are ſtraitned in your own
bowels, and not ſtraitened in your God. If a
houſe be dark, it is not for any want of
light in the Sun, but for want of windowes
in the houſe: So if thou wanteſt grace, it is
not for want of grace in Chriſt, but for want
of faith in thy ſoul, to draw and derive
more grace from Chriſt.</p>

men, as <hi>Cain</hi> envied <hi>Abel, becauſe his ſacrifice
was accepted, and his own rejected,</hi> but alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
good men are too apt to envy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren envied their brother,
becauſe he was beloved of his father,<note place="margin">John 21. 20, 21.</note> and
<hi>Peter</hi> (it is thought) envied <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:30639:108"/>
diſciple. But take heed of envy, it's diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to God, and often hinders us from
receiving mercy and grace from God. To
envy Chriſts diſpenſing of his grace, to
whom and in what meaſure he pleaſes, is
unbecoming a Chriſtian; to rejoyce in others
happineſſe, is to do as the Angels of heaven;
to envy others good is like the devils in
hell. Would a father take it well that his
children fall out about their portions,
which their father hath given them. God is
abſolutely free, to give one or two, or five
talents, as he pleaſes, and if another have
more grace then thou, yet be thankful for
that grace thou haſt, and envy no man.</p>

As there is no ſin ſmall, becauſe it is
an offence againſt the great God: ſo there
is no grace little, becauſe it comes from the
great God. Unthankfulneſſe hinders this
oyl from running. As a man muſt not be
contented with the greateſt meaſure of
grace, ſo he muſt not be unthankful for the
leaſt meaſure of grace. Conſider, it is Jeſus
Chriſt that hath begun the work of grace:
that there is <hi>ſome little good wrought in thee,</hi> is
the work of Chriſt, and he that hath begun
a good work will alſo finiſh it; he that hath

I ſhall give you ſome practical deduction

ſpeech of <hi>Iob,</hi> touching his own mortality,
and in them we have three particulars.</p>

brings it in with an illative. <hi>For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Particularity of it. He drawes a
particular meditation of death, &amp;c. <hi>Me.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The piety of it, he acknowledges Gods
hand in bringing him to death. <hi>Thou,</hi> and
not chance or fortune.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, the Rationality of it. Holy
<hi>Job</hi> doth not ſpeak of his death without
ſome cauſe, but for the ground and reaſon
foregoing. <hi>By the great force of my diſeaſe is
my garment changed, it bindes me about as the
Collar of my Coat;</hi> and then he breaks out
into this holy meditation, <hi>For I know thou
wilt bring me to death.</hi> From thence obſerve,
<hi>That it is a very Rational thing in weakneſſe to
have holy meditations about death.</hi>

                  </gap>oct 1.</note> Job lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a diſeaſe, that even was ready to choak
and ſtrangle him, and then he breaks out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this holy meditation, <hi>For I know thou wilt
bring me to death, &amp;c.</hi> It is obſervable, the
Ancients take notice that <hi>David</hi> made three
Pſalmes, when he lay upon his ſick-bed,
<hi>Pſalm. 6 Pſalm 30. Pſalm</hi> 39. and in all thoſe
Pſalmes there are divine raptures and holy
meditations about death. <hi>Iob. 17. 1. My breath
is corrupt, my dayes are extinct, the grave is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for me.</hi> He doth not mean an ill ſavour
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:30639:110"/>
in his breath, but it was an obſtruction and
ſtopping in his breath, that is, he was <hi>ſhort-breathed,
and ſtraitned under a violent diſeaſe.</hi>
It is conceived that <hi>Job</hi> had that diſeaſe
which is called the Tiſſick, and the conſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration
of this diſeaſe, made him think that
the grave was ready for him. So <hi>Heman</hi> lay
und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a violent diſeaſe, <hi>Pſal. 88. 3, 4, 5. For
my ſoul is full of trouble, and my life draws nigh
to the grave,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 88. 3, 4 5.</note> 
               <hi>I am accounted with them that go
down into the pit, I am as a man that hath no
ſtrength, free among the dead, like the ſtain that
lye in the grave, whom thou numbreſt no more,
and they are cut off from thy hands.</hi> When ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is in the chamber, then death is at the
window. Diſeaſes are but the meſſengers,
harbingers and fore-runners of death; in the
Prophets phraſe, <hi>Death is come up into our
windowes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">ler. 9. 21.</note> When diſeaſes are in the houſe,
then death is at the threſhold. So <hi>Job recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
When I lye down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 7. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>I ſay, when ſhall I riſe,
and the night be gone? and I am full of toſſings
to and fro, unto the dawning of the day,</hi> and then
he ſaith, <hi>My fleſh is clothed with wormes, and
clods of duſt. My skin is broken, and become
loathſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Vſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> is to condemn thoſe, that when
they lye on a ſick-bed, they hope for life, but
never think of death, their own guiltineſſe
and their own wickedneſſe of living doth ſo
fill them with fear and horrour, that the
thoughts of death are irkſome and tedious
to them. Juſt like <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:30639:111"/>
King of <hi>France,</hi> when he lay ſick of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
diſeaſe, he charged his ſervants and
attendants, that they ſhould not ſpeak of
death in his hearing. Many mens bodies are
Magazines and Hoſpitals of diſeaſes, who
when they are living never think of death,
though there is but little betwixt them and
the grave.</p>
            <p>Second <hi>Vſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> is to thoſe that are healthful
and ſtrong; 'tis true, diſeaſes are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
harbingers and fore-runners of death
in an ordinary way, yet you may ſoon dye
though a diſeaſe ſeize not on you. As the
fruits of a tree do more periſh by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
windes and tempeſts, then do ſtay upon
the tree, and are gathered by the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
So violent diſeaſes may ſoon kill you,
though marrow be in your bones, and
ſtrength in your joynts. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> a skilful
Phyſician, he gloryed, that if any man
would follow his Phyſical Preſcriptions, he
ſhould not dye any violent death, but meer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
through age, and yet that boaſting man
before he was forty yeares of age, he himſelf
dyed of a Feaver. Thus I have done with the
firſt conſideration, the Reaſonableneſſe of
this; I am under a ſore diſeaſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do think of death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Particularity of <hi>Johs</hi> ſpeech
is to be obſerved. <hi>Job</hi> doth not ſtand upon
that general concluſion, <hi>There is no man that
liveth but he ſhall ſee death,</hi> Pſal. 88. 48. He
doth not ſpeak in general ſo, but <hi>I know
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:30639:111"/>
I must die.</hi> From thence obſerve this
point,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That general Concluſions about death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould
be enforced upon the ſoul by particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Beloved, we ſhould not only have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
notions and empty ſpeculations about
death, but practical and particular concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning our death, ſuch as may lay
an awe upon the conſcience. Thus in the
caſe of the godly,<note place="margin">Job 5. 26. 27.</note> ſaid <hi>Eliphaz, Thou ſhalt
come to thy grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of
Corne cometh in his ſeaſon;</hi> and then he addes,
<hi>verſ. 27. Lo this, we have ſearched it, hear it, and
know thou it for thy good.</hi> General Concluſions
that all muſt dye, muſt be enforced upon the
ſoul with particular applications, to turne
you from the world, to beget in you ſerious
thoughts touching your future and eternal
welfare. General truths do not carry that
force upon the conſcience, unleſſe they are
drawn by applicative inference; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Pſ. 73. ult.</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſaith not only
<hi>It is good to draw near unto God,</hi> but <hi>it is good
for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third particular, is the Piety of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bs</hi>
ſpeech, in theſe words, <hi>Thou wilt bring me to
death.</hi> Now there are three particulars in it
which note <hi>Iobs</hi> Faith and Piety.</p>
            <p>1. He doth not aſcribe dying to fate and
fortune, but to the Providence of the moſt
High. From thence obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the property of the godly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> 
               <hi>to ſee Gods
band in taking away men by death.</hi> It was but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:30639:112"/>
the dotage of the Heathen that knew not
God, to aſcribe events to blind fortune, and
it was the corruption of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook
the Deity in all fatal events; Yet
<hi>Iob</hi> he deſired to ſee and ſubmit to death, and
to Gods hand in bringing it upon him. <hi>Thou
wilt bring me to death.</hi> Another thing obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
is this, <hi>I know thou wilt bring me to
death.</hi> It is not a notional and bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the underſtanding, but ſuch a kinde
of knowledge that is conſiderate and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
which works upon the affections. From
thence obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That though all men do know notionally they
muſt dye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> 
               <hi>yet only godly men know it practically
and conſiderately.</hi> To know practically of

I do to launch into the eternal gulfe? what
ſhall become of me in another world, when
I leave this? Is my peace made with God?
Is my perſon juſtified? Am I in a ſtate of
grace? Now <hi>Iobs</hi> ſpeech hath latitude in it,
<hi>I know thou wilt bring me to death,</hi> that is, I
do ſo know it, that I will provide for it, and

There is none but a godly man, that ſo
knowes any thing of dying; as to know it ſo
practically, affectionately and conſiderately,
and ſo as to do theſe three things.</p>
            <p>1. None but a godly man conſiders of his
dying, that he dies deſervedly, he taſtes the
bitterneſſe, and feels the burden of ſin; in his
diſeaſes and ſenſe of approaching death, he
conſiders with himſelf, that it is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
that will bring him to his grave, but
the ſins of his life that kill him.</p>
            <p>2. None knowes that he muſt dye ſo as a
godly man, whoſe care it is to dye prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
A godly man he knows he muſt dye, and
this knowledge makes him prepare for a
dying time, to live every day as his laſt day.

is the houſe that I muſt go to, as after a hard
dayes labour in my houſe I go to bed in a
dark night: So we go to our beds, as into
our graves for a long night; going to bed
is but for a ſhort night, but going to the
grave is for a long night; death is ſomtimes
repreſented with dreadful conſiderations,
but with amiableneſſe too. There is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency
in nature againſt death, it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed
by Jeſus Chriſt; he lay in the grave
three dayes, to embalme the grave to you,
though your beds be cloudy and dark, yet ye
reſt in them till the Reſurrection-day. For
the opening of the doctrine.</p>
            <p>I ſhall diſpatch theſe two Queries.</p>
            <p>1. I ſhall ſhew you, why the grave is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to an houſe.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall ſhew you, what kinde of houſe
the grave is.</p>
            <p>For the firſt Query,<note place="margin">Query 1.</note> why the grave is
compared to an houſe?</p>
            <p>1. This Reaſon ſome Authors give, becauſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:30639:114"/>
in ancient times, (as hath been hinted) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Egyptians their graves and ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,
they were made after the faſhion of
houſes, with Arches, and ſuch kind of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures;
therefore they ſay it is called
an houſe.</p>
            <p>2. Other Authors give this reaſon; becauſe
that as a man after a dayes labour abroad, he
comes to his houſe for reſt, ſo a man after a
lifes labour in this world, he comes to his
grave, as to his houſe for reſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Query is this,<note place="margin">Query 2</note> what kinde of
houſe is the grave? Now I will give you
theſe four properties of this houſe. 1. It is a
deſolate and a loneſome houſe. 2. It is a dark
houſe. 4 It is an old houſe. 4 It is a ſilent
houſe. For the firſt, the grave is</p>
            <p>1. A deſolate and a loneſome houſe.<note place="margin">Job 3. 14.</note> I ſhall be,
<hi>ſaid</hi> Iob, with Kings &amp; Counſellers of the earth
which build deſolate places for themſelves, <hi>that
is, they build tombs, and monuments where
they ſhall lye, and then they ſhall leave all
their</hi> attendance.<note place="margin">Ezek. 26. 20.</note> When I ſhall bring thee down
with them that deſcend into the pit, with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of old time, and ſhall ſet thee in the low parts
of the earth, in places deſolate of old, with them
that go down into the pit, that thou be not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.
<hi>Job</hi> 17. 14. I have ſaid to corruption,
Thou art my Father, and to the wormes, Thou
art my mother and my ſiſter: <hi>there is all the
company you will have, corruption and
the wormes; friends bring you to your
grave, and there they leave you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:30639:114"/>
2. Your grave is a dark houſe, <hi>I have made
my bed in the darkneſſe,</hi> that is, in the grave.
The grave is like the ſleeping room in a
houſe, not like the dining room and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
room. The dining room is to be light,
and ſo the working room, but the ſleeping
room is dark. 'Tis but the ſtopping of the
mouth of the grave, and it is but the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Curtains of the bed, where thou
ſhalt lye in darkneſſe till the Reſurrection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
day. In the grave there is neither the light of
the body, which is the eye; nor the light of
the aire, which is the Sun: the Sun it ſhall
not ſhine there, nor the body ſee there;
Therefore <hi>Eccl. 11. 9. Rejoyce, Oh young man
in thy youth, and let thy heart cheere thee in the
dayes of thy youth, and walk in the wayes of thy
heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes, but know
thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee
unto judgement.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 8. He had ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the dayes of darkneſſe; for they ſhall be
many.</hi> The meaning is this, The continuance
in the grave, which is the houſe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſhall be long, even to the end of the
world.</p>
            <p>3. The grave is an old houſe, as old as
<hi>Adam,</hi> he digged his grave with his owne
fingers;<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore as by one man ſin entred into
the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed
upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> The
grave it is a laſting houſe, a houſe where
thou muſt ſtay a great while. <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 5. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
when they ſhall be afraid of that which is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:30639:115"/>
high, and fear ſhall be in the way, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
tree ſhall flouriſh, and the Graſhopper ſhall
be a burden, and deſire ſhall faile, becauſe man
goeth to his leng home, and the mourners go about
the ſtreets,</hi> 'Tis a long home, a kinde of a
houſe of eternity, a long while till Chriſts
comming to judgement, our long home, in
oppoſition to our preſent houſes, that is; our
ſhort home. Your houſes are your ſhort
homes, but the graves are your long homes.</p>
            <p>4. The grave is a ſilent houſe, <hi>Pſal. 31. 17.
Let me net be aſhamed, Oh Lord, for I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon thee: let the wicked be aſhamed and let
them be ſilent in the grave.</hi> The Pſalmiſt prayes
here for deliverance from his Perſecutors,
here is nothing but clamour, perſecution
and oppoſition, and one ſhall not have a
good word from them. But as <hi>Iob</hi> comfort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
himſelf in the grave, <hi>There the voice of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor
ſhall not be heard:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 3. 18.</note> So may we, we ſhall
be at reſt and ſilence there, there the weary
ſhall be at reſt, and there the Priſoners ſhall
reſt together. For the Uſes of this point.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Vſe,</hi> is an uſe of comfort to the
godly, they may be comforted upon this
doctrine. This doctrine is a doctrine that is
dreadful to wicked men, their graves are
dungeons to them; but to Gods children the
grave is an houſe. Now you may be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon theſe four conſideratious.</p>
            <p>1 That though the grave be an houſe, yet
be comforted, it is a reſting houſe, <hi>Iob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3 17.
There the wicked ceaſe from troubling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>and there
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:30639:115"/>
the weary be at reſt.</hi> He ſpeaks here of the
grave in <hi>verſ. 13. For now ſhould I have lien
ſtill and been quiet, I ſhould have ſlept, then had
I been at reſt.</hi> There is no work to be done in
this houſe, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 10. Whatſoever thy hand
findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no
work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in
the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> Iſa. 57. 2. <hi>They ſhall
reſt in their beds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That though the grave be a houſe, yet
be comforted, it is but a ſleeping houſe, it is
not a houſe where thou ſhalt be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Beloved though it be a houſe, yet it is but
a ſleeping houſe; it ſhall not alwayes keep
your bodies; that is the meaning of <hi>Pauls</hi>
exultation: <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? Oh
grave where is thy victory?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 57.</note> He refers it to the
Reſurrection; the grave though it compaſſe
us, yet it ſhall not conquer us.</p>
            <p>1. Though the grave be a houſe, yet be
comforted, it is but a hiding houſe, ſuch a
houſe as is but a hiding place for Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Job. 14. 13. Oh that thou wouldſt hide me in
the grave, that thou wouldest keep me in ſecret
untill thy wrath be paſt, that thou wouldſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
me a ſet time and remember me.</hi> Times
may be ſo calamitous, that there may be
more ſafety under ground then above
ground, they that have layen a long time in
their graves, may be more happy then thoſe
that are living,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Iſa. 26. 20. Come my peeple, enter
thou into thy chambers, and ſhut thy door about
thee, hide thy ſelf, as if it were for a little moment
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:30639:116"/>
until the indignation be overpaſt.</hi> Though
ſome refer this to a temporal deliverance,
yet others refer it to the grave, where God
lodges his children, when he takes them
from the evil to come.</p>
            <p>Though the grave be a houſe, yet be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
it is a perfumed houſe, a houſe imbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and perfumed by Chriſts lying in the
grave. All the acts that Chriſt did, they were
for our ſakes. Chriſt died to ſave us by dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.
Chriſt lay buried in the grave, to make
the grave a bed of reſt, he roſe again from
the dead to ſanctifie our reſurrection, and by
his preſence there he hath perſumed this
bed; this houſe the grave.</p>
            <p>Second <hi>Vſe</hi> for inſtruction. 1. Here is
matter of meditation; when you are in your
own houſes, bethink your ſelves thus, Now
I am here walking in my houſe, from cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to chamber, but ere long my chamber
ſhall be in the duſt. Now I am comming to
my bed in a dark night, but ere long God
wil put out the candle of my life, and wil
lay me in the grave, as in a bed of darkneſſe.
Now I am in my own houſe, but ere long
my houſe wil caſt me our to my grave, and
that is the houſe that wil take me in.</p>
            <p>2. Let it check in you all covetous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
deſires after worldly things; Thou
ſhalt come from lying in the dark houſe in
the womb, to lye in the dark houſe of the
grave. Oh what a vaſt company of inordinat
and luxurious deſires are there in the hearts
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:30639:116"/>
of men. In the womb one foot, in the cradle
three foot wil content you, and in the grave
ſix foot, but when thou liveſt in the world a
whole world wil not content you, there is
ſuch inordinate and luxurious deſires in
mens hearts, when they have all affluence
and confluence of creature comforts; Now
they muſt have their variety of Houſes, a
Countrey-houſe, a Summer-houſe, a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
houſe, yet thou muſt exchange thy many
houſes for one houſe, 'Tis worthy your
notice that paſſage you read of in Scripture,
<hi>1 Sam. 10. 24. Samuel</hi> when he had anointed
<hi>Saul</hi> King, and the people had choſen him;
what ſignal doth he give him to confirme
him anointed, it was to goe to <hi>Rachels</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre;
now the reaſon is this, that he
might not be glutted with the preferments
&amp; honours he was entring upon. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours

on their Coronation daies,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that this Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

a ſpiritual and eternal death, and it is ſaid,
John 11. 25, 26. <hi>I am the reſurrection and

Chriſts Reſurrection, and pledges of ours.</p>
            <p>But ſome wil ſay,<note place="margin">3. Obj.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51. We ſhall
