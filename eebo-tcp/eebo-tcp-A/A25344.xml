         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One Groan more,
From under the Altar, breathed forth from the grief of the
Spirit, for the Sufferings of the Saints, by reaſon of her Cruelties
and Abominations, and the filthineſs and of her Fornications.</p>
            <p>Under the burthen of Gods wrath againſt the preſent <hi>Rulers, Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that repent not and give glory to God;
that have drunk of her Cup, and Refuſe to come out of her at
Gods Call, but remain in the falſe Church and Worſhip ſtill, that's
not taught by Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>With a Warning to all ſuch, that they prepare to meet the Lord in
the Way of his Judgements; and as they have partaken with her
in her ſins, that they expect alſo to partake of her plagues which
are ready to be poured forth from the Lord God, who is mighty
that judgeth her, and will certainly avenge the blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
on her, for <hi>Babylons <hi>Deſtruction</hi>
               </hi> is Gods Determination in
<hi>England,</hi> and the world.</p>
            <p>Behold your Day is paſt and the Night cometh, and Gods fulfilling
Day draweth nigh.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all the Lords People haſten out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which all
men are that follow not the Light of the Lamb, that are not guided
&amp; led by the preſent Teachings of Gods Spirit, &amp; let them that are
faithful in the Land, be faithful ſtill to follow the Lamb whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he goes, for its given to him and his Followers to overcome.</p>

hearts, <hi>is not our ſtrength great,</hi> and <hi>is it not our right to Reign,</hi>
and <hi>is not this great Babel that we have built?</hi> wherein you intend
to make you a name, that you may not be ſcattered in the Earth,
as a people driven out from the preſence of the Lord: And the
arm of fleſh is your confidence; as if the ſtrength of <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould keep you from the wrath of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
and that <hi>great Whore <hi>Myſtery Babylon the Mother of Harlots,</hi>

And her <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> of all ſorts, ranks and orders,
cry aloud, <hi>great is Diana of the Epheſians,</hi> becauſe of their
crafts which brings them their gain from their quarters; her
Prophets <hi>propheſie falſly,</hi> her Prieſts <hi>bear rule by their means,</hi> and
the people <hi>love to have it ſo;</hi> who ſay unto them that deſpiſe the
Lord, <hi>ye ſhall have peace,</hi> and to them that walk after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of their own heart, <hi>none evil ſhall come upon them;</hi> ſo
that they are Prophets of lyes, deceit and falſhood, that ſay,
<hi>the wicked ſhall proſper:</hi> And a horrible thing is committed in the
Land, the whole head is ſick, the whole heart is faint, that from
the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head there is no ſoundneſs
in you, but full of wounds and putrifying ſores, full of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ſtink in the noſtrils of our God; yea, and your
wayes are become wholly corrupt and abominable before the
Lord; So that <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>true Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
are not found <hi>amongſt you;</hi> but <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
within you; <hi>for by <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>Killing,</hi> ye
break out, and <hi>blood</hi> toucheth <hi>blood;</hi>
               </hi> So that the Lord God is come
down and will ſurely viſit for theſe things, he hath taken view
of all your actions and evil deeds done under the Sun, which
grieve his Spirit all the day long, that his Soul is weary to bear
your abominations which are great in the Land, for ye have not
done the thing that is right in the ſight of the Lord, but have
provoked him more than any that have gone before you, having
again ſet up the abominable thing in the Land which maketh
deſolate, and have not regarded the Counſel of the Lord, to
walk in his wayes, and to bring forth Righteouſneſs and Truth in
the Earth, which the Lord expects; that Chriſts Kingdome
might be known amongſt the ſons of men, whoſe right it is to
Reign, who is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you would not have this man to Rule over you; but have
gone a whoring after the gods of the Heathen in falſe wayes and
worſhips, after the corrupt luſts and wicked imaginations of
your own hearts; ye have ſtumbled alſo at that Stumbling-ſtone
and Rock of offence, <hi>CHRIST JESUS</hi> the Light of the
world, and the onely way to the Father, upon which many have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93883:3"/>
fallen and are broken; And what think ye, that they on whom
the Tower in <hi>Siloe</hi> fell, were greater ſinners than any that dwelt
at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Nay verily, ye alſo that repent not ſhall know,
that it ſhall be more tollerable for <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in
the day of Gods Judgements <hi>than for you,</hi> who have had ſo much
&amp; large experience of the Lords wayes &amp; dealings towards you
and the people of theſe Nations, of what the Lord required
at your hands in the day of your viſitation, which ye have not
regarded, but have caſt the Lords Counſel behind your backs,
and would not come to him who is the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>living Way,</hi>
the <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Life; <hi>CHRIST JESUS the Light of
the world,</hi>
               </hi> the <hi>rightful King</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> of Nations, that
ye might in him have found peace and reſt in the Land of your
Nativity; that ye might have eaten the good of the Land, and
proſpered as the glory of Nations; but ye have revolted and
rebelled againſt the God of Heaven yet more and more; and
though he hath ſmitten you, ye have not regarded, but have
forgotten him dayes without number; and though he hath wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
long alſo to be gracious unto you, to have gathered you, but
ye would not, but are gone back again into <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi>
into your <hi>bad old wayes</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Iniquity, Superſtition</hi> and
<hi>Vanity, <hi>in the luſts</hi> of the fleſh, <hi>the luſt</hi> of the eye,</hi> and <hi>pride <hi>of
life;</hi>
               </hi> that your wickedneſſes and abominations are abounding in
the Land more than ever, as if ye had ſaid in your hearts,
<hi>that God ſees you not, and that the Lord hath forſaken the Earth,</hi>
becauſe his Judgements are not ſpeedily executed upon ſuch
evil-doers as theſe are, that ſit down to eat and drink, and riſe
up to play, and commit Whoredoms, and ſay, <hi>to morrow ſhall be
as this day, and much more abundant;</hi> as if your <hi>Return</hi> and all
the <hi>ſtrange Arts</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Wonder</hi> which the Lord hath
wrought and brought to paſs in this Nation, were even to this
very end, that you might live <hi>at eaſe</hi> in <hi>the fleſh</hi> in your <hi>pleaſures,
pride</hi> and <hi>vanities,</hi> and in <hi>cruelties</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions,</hi> to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the juſt on your old dregs and lees of corruption, ſettled as
if ye could not be moved.</p>
            <p>But <hi>blindneſs</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> in judgement is happened <hi>unto you,</hi>
that ye having eyes <hi>might not ſee,</hi> and hearts, and <hi>might not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
that the Lord God Omnipotent ruleth and reigneth in the

Kingdoms of men, and giveth them unto whomſoever he will,
that in the Clouds he is come to judgement, Yea and he will
ariſe and plead the cauſe of the innocent, and by no means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
the guilty: He will make Inquiſition for the blood of the
ſlain, and certainly avenge the blood of the Righteous, which
cries loud from the Earth for vengeance upon <hi>Cain</hi> that hath ſlain
his Brother, and his cruelty ſhall not paſſe unpuniſhed, but he
that hath done this wickedneſſe in the Land, with Gods Mark is
he Marked, and ſhall become a <hi>Fugitive</hi> and <hi>Vagabond</hi> in the
Earth, and ſhall ſeek to hide himſelf from the avenger of blood,
but ſin ſhall lie at his door, and Gods Righteous Judgements ſhall
overtake him whereſoever he flies, becauſe of his Brothers inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood, that ceaſeth not to cry Day &amp; Night for Juſtice to be
done upon the Murderer, that hath ſlain the Juſt; Yea and God
ſhall multiply his Plagues and Judgements upon them that have
ſhed Innocent Blood in the Land, and no Coverings ſhall hide
them from the fierceneſſe of Gods wrath; neither ſhall the
City that <hi>Cain</hi> hath built with Blood, nor the Towers of <hi>Babel,</hi>
though never ſo lofty be able to ſhelter the wicked from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
ſtroak of Gods anger and juſt Judgements which haſten to
be accompliſhed in this Nation; for they are a Rebellious and
Gain-ſaying people, with whom the Love and Mercies, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Long-Suffering of our God prevails not: But ye
have hardned your Hearts, and ſtiffned your Necks even for a
Day of Slaughter, that the Lord is weary to bear Your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to ſuffer with your ſins any longer; And therefore
hath determined to cut ſhort the work in Righteouſneſſe for the
Elects ſake, who are made as the dung of the Earth, and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring
of all things; but <hi>the meek of the Earth the Lood <hi>will
exalt,</hi>
               </hi> and the <hi>High and Lofty ones <hi>he will bring down from their
Seats;</hi>
               </hi> the wicked will he ſcatter in their imaginations. And
all your <hi>Carnal confidences</hi> ſhall fail you in the day of <hi>great
diſtreſs, perplexity</hi> and <hi>anguiſh</hi> that's coming upon every ſoul
that obeys not the Light, the Goſpel of God, by which ye might
have been gathered, and ſo have been honourable by doing the
Lord ſervice in the day of his love to you, if ye had known and

Your <hi>Glory</hi> ſhall be turned <hi>into ſhame;</hi> Your Sun ſhall let <hi>at

of VVorſhip (as you may call it) would be no better
than the cutting off a Dogs Neck, or offering of Swines Blood,
which is altogether abominable in the ſight of the Lord: For
men have ſo long talked in words of Religion, Righteous Laws
and Juſt Government to be ſet up and eſtabliſhed, that the
Lords Spirit hath been long grieved therewith, and he hath caſt
them out as unprofitable Servants, becauſe they came not to the
Light, to Gods Righteous VVitneſſe and Principle <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
which teacheth men <hi>to do <hi>Iuſtly,</hi> to love <hi>Mercy,</hi> and to

expect, that Miniſters of unrighteouſneſs, and Servants
of ſin and Satan, ſhould ſet up a Righteous Government for
God, as they ſtand in that Ground and Nature which is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Gods Righteous Laws for ever? Can he that is not Born
of God, do the Will or VVork of God to his Praiſe? Or can
any evil Tree bring forth good Fruit? no not one.</p>
            <p>It's high time for men (if ever they will) come to the
Light, to the Root and Ground of things in themſelves that is
good, that they may know of what Spirit they are of; for moſt
men in this Nation will confeſs (I believe) that there is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Truth which doth the VVill of God, and there is a Spirit
of error which is of the Devil, and againſt God in the VVorld;
Now that Spirit (as the Scriptures teſtifie) that confeſſeth that
Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is true, which is the Power of God
that deſtroys the works of the Devil in the Creature, in the Root
and Ground that is evil, from whence all wickedneſſe proceeds,
even out of the heart of man where Satans ſeat hath been; And
ſo this ſame Spirit that reproves the world of ſin, and condemns
ſin in the fleſh, leads us and thoſe that follow it, out of ſin and
tranſgreſſion, and mortifies luſt in the Root, and leads us into
all Truth, <hi>and teacheth us to deny ungodlineſſe and Worldly Luſts,
and to walk Righteouſly, Soberly and Godly in this preſent World, no
longer in the oldneſſe of the Letter, but in the newneſſe of the Spirit,</hi>
according to the Rule of the new Creature, <hi>Chriſt in us the hope
of Glory,</hi> which changeth and reviveth us in the Spirits of our
Minds, whereby we are inabled unto every good word and work,
according to the meaſure of his eternal Spirit working in us, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93883:6"/>
which we are taught to deny our own wills, <hi>and to do Gods will in
Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> the enmity in the carnal Mind, being
deſtroyed by the Croſſe of Chriſt, which is the Power of God
unto Salvation, unto all them that believe; From which all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Nations that turn away, they crucifie Chriſt, and do
but caſt lots about his Veſtment, and retain at the utmoſt, <hi>but a
form of godlineſſe</hi> without <hi>the Power;</hi> and ſo worſhip a God in
their imaginations ignorantly, and come not to witneſs and feel
the VVord of Life in themſelves, which begets the Creature
again into the likeneſs of Gods Image, by deſtroying and caſting
out that which is begotten in man by the Seed of the Serpent,
which is Gods and the Creatures enemy. And ſo as the enmity
is deſtroyed in the Root and Ground, and the cauſe of Seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God done away, ſo the word of Reconciliation comes
to be known and witneſſed; for there cannot be Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God, ſo long as that ſtands, even Sin and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
which Separates from God, againſt which his wrath is for
ever; and there can be no <hi>Communion</hi> between <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
no <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial, <hi>for he that is
joyned to an Harlot, is one with the Harlot, and he that is joyned to
the Lord, is one Spirit, unto which no unclean thing can be joyned;</hi>
               </hi>
Therefore he that will be joyned to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and know his
Maker to be his Husband, muſt firſt know a Separation <hi>from ſin</hi>
and <hi>Satan,</hi> by the VVord of God <hi>which purifieth the Heart, and
cleanſeth us from all filthineſſe of Fleſh and Spirit;</hi> And this is the
Blood of ſprinkling which cleanſeth the conſcience, the Life of
Chriſt made manifeſt in us, in the meaſure of his Eternal Spirit
given every one to profit withall, in which we come to know
the Father and the Son, whom to know is eternal Life, without
which in the preſence of the Lord, all people and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are yet dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and not come again out
of the fall into Gods Creation which is bleſſed, but remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Curſe, Enemies in their minds to God and Chriſt, by
reaſon of wicked works.</p>
            <p>And as the Spirit of Truth draws the mind <hi>to within,</hi> to the
knowledge of God <hi>in the heart,</hi> and worketh contrary to the
will of man; ſo the Spirit of Antichriſt worketh with the will
of man contrary to the Will of God in all things, and draws the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93883:7"/>
mind <hi>forth into Airy conceptions, into vain Notions</hi> and <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
of worſhipping an unknown God afar off; and he that is
led by this ſpirit ſeeks ſelf in all things, <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> of men;
delights to live in words, in the talk of Gods Work, Kingdom
and Glory to come, and cannot endure to ſit ſtill to wait to feel
the preſent work of Gods Power, and Enjoyment of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
within; for that deſtroys the Devils kingdom, root and
branch; for if luſt by Gods Power be mortified in the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſin be conceived there, from whence ſhall it be brought
forth? <hi>For out of the heart proceeds Hatred, Malice, Murthers,
Adulteries, Fornications, and all manner of ſin and uncleanneſs;</hi> So
that there can be no hopes of better fruits, until the Tree be
changed, until a new heart be known, wherein the Righteous
Law of God is written, and the Light ſhineth; that ſo out of
a good heart, the good Treaſures of life may flow forth, and
fruit to the praiſe of God brought forth: And he is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that ſeeks not his own, but the glory of him that ſent
him, which is Chriſts work for ever, who is ſent of the Father
to do his Will <hi>in us,</hi> and we <hi>in him,</hi> according to the meaſure
and operation of his Spirit in us, which worketh both to will
and do according to his good pleaſure; in which as we wait and
abide we are bleſſed for ever, and the body is kept in unity,
and every member in its proper place and office, which is the
Order of Saints, and Government of the Church in God, in
which is peace and ſafety.</p>
            <p>And now ye <hi>Wiſe Men, Rulers, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People <hi>of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               </hi>
who will not be inſtructed by Gods Spirit, that ye might

in which the Nations of all them that are ſaved muſt walk; ye
that will not ceaſe to do evil and learn to do well, that will not
break the bonds of the Oppreſſor, and let the Oppreſſed go free,
but daily adde ſorrow to the afflicted, and grieve the upright in
heart in the Land; whoſe fear towards God is not taught them
by the precepts of men, whom the Lord regards and tenders as
the Apple of his Eye, who have eaten his Paſſeover with bitter
herbs, and the Lord will ſpare them as his choiſe Jewels in the
day of his fierce wrath upon the wicked; after ſo many years

experience of the grace, favour, patience, long-ſuffering and
goodneſs of our God, which ſhould have led you to repentance,
if you had obeyed Gods Voice, and followed his Counſel;
What have you now to plead for your ſelves before the Lord,
whoſe wrath is turned againſt you, and the Teſtimony of a good
Conſcience ye have not, and who ſhall plead for you? And
what may be ſaid on your behalf, that have neglected ſo great
Salvation, and kept Chriſt Jeſus ſo long out of his Right and
Kingdom; Why the Lord God whoſe wayes are equal and juſt,
ſhould not ariſe in his fierce wrath, and in his hot diſpleaſure
ſweep you away with the beſom of deſtruction, and give you
your portion in that lake that burns with fire and brimſtone;
and as ye have drunk of the VVhores Cup which hath made all
Nations drunk with the VVine of her fornications; and as ye
have partaken with her in her ſins, why ye ſhould not according
to Gods Righteous Decree and Judgement, partake of her
plagues: Conſider theſe things, and ſhew a reaſon if you can? and
who ſhall deliver you in the day of her judgements, from her
plagues and torments which haſten, and in one day ſhall come
upon her? And the Spirit ſaith, <hi>Spare her not, but give
her blood to drink, yea, fill to her double according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

Saints, and is worthy to drink the Cup of the Wine of Gods

and ſhall <hi>eat her fleſh,</hi> and <hi>burn her with fire,</hi> who amongſt all

But rejoice over her to ſee the ſmoak of her burnings, and give
Praiſe, Honour and Glory to the Lord God Almighty, whoſe
Judgements are Righteous and True, for that he hath avenged
on her the blood of the Saints their fellow Servants, that have
ſuffered and been ſlain for the Teſtimony of Jeſus; yea, and

               <hi>Prepare therefore ye People of England, to meet the Lord in
