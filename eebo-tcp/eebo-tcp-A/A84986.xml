         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> Thought it my duty, having received another pledge and token of the mercy and goodneſſe of God to this poor Nation, to give you a ſpeedy account thereof; when I came to <hi>Andover,</hi> after ſo tedious a march, ten Troops of the Mutineers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to <hi>Marlborow,</hi> from thence to <hi>VVantage,</hi> and to the end they might get a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Col. <hi>Harriſons</hi> Regiment they lay all this day between <hi>Abington</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> at a place called <hi>Blagrave,</hi> expecting to have more Troops come, but there came onely to them Cap. <hi>Pecks</hi> and Cap. <hi>VVinthrops,</hi> and marched all the day towards <hi>Abington,</hi> ſome of the Quarters being 22 miles from thence; and when I came neer <hi>Abington</hi> they were marched away, being in all twelve Colours, towards <hi>Newbridge,</hi> where <hi>Colonel Reynolds,</hi> Major <hi>Shilburne</hi> and others kept the Bridge, which they would have forced; but when they ſaw they could not do it, they march't up the River and got
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116219:3"/>
over at a Ford neer a mile from the Bridge. Some three houres after they were gone I marched towards <hi>Bampton</hi> in the Buſh, and from thence to <hi>Burford,</hi> where, and in the adjacent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illages we tooke (I thinke) almoſt the whole party; the particulars I ſhall give you an account of (God willing) hereafter more exactly. Thoſe Troops at <hi>Salisbury of Col.

               <p>AN Account in generall is already ſent of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and diſperſing of the mutinous Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Burford; a more particular account thereof will alſo come from the Generall very ſhortly, yet thus much in briefe. That as they were ſurprized in the very nick of time (when as one day more would have given them opportunity to have joyned with other Regiments: ſo it was very happy it was done with ſo little bloodſhed, there being but one of their party ſlaine (who fought it out to the laſt) and one of ours.</p>
               <p>The firſt Horſe that entered the Town were thoſe under Col. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> the Dragoons under Col. <hi>Okey,</hi> and Major <hi>Shelburne,</hi> with the Buckinghamſhire horſe. The Generall brought up as a Reſerve his own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe, and Col. <hi>Scroop</hi> the Reare. Cap. <hi>Fiſher</hi> was ſent with a Troop of Horſe on the further ſide of the Town, where he offering to charge two Troops of the Enemy (who were likewiſe in a poſture to charge him, with their Swords drawn and Piſtols cockt) upon his advance, and offering them quarter if they would ſubmit to mercy, they all ſubmitted but one, who diſcharged his Piſtoll, but did not hurt; (which two Troopes he brought to the Generall.) Cap. <hi>Packers</hi> Troop was very diligent, and this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that he had but one man who joyned with this party, yet he did engage himſelfe to his Captaine to be faithfull, and it was his hap to take Col. <hi>Eyres,</hi> who was very earneſt with him to let him goe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his engagement to his Captaine, he brought him priſoner to the Generall.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday Cornet <hi>Denn,</hi> and Cornet <hi>Thompſon</hi> (bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to <hi>Thompſon</hi> the great) was tried at a councell of war and condemned to die. <hi>Denn</hi> hath bought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a winding-ſheet, and is ſo ſenſible of his errour, that he doth not deſire to live; he doth acknowledge the juſt hand of God upon him, and is putting forth a Declaration to the world to ſhew the wickedneſſe of the deſigne, and by what means it was contrived.</p>
               <p>There are between three and four hundred priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the church, the reſt eſcaped in the darke; many of them are very reſolute, and ſay (as the Cavaliers uſed to ſpeak) it is our day to day, it may be theirs to morrow; others of them are very penitent. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that beat up their quarters had their Horſes and Arms for prize, and Crookback (who fought it out ſo ſtoutly) being heretofore of <hi>Maſſeys</hi> brigade, had 30 li. about him when the Souldiers pillaged him; they had frequent advertiſement from their friends in <hi>London</hi> and in the <hi>Tower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> how to mannage their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and as ſome of them confeſt) had promiſe of money for the carrying on of their deſigne; but more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Generall and the Officers are very weary, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never in all the time of the former wars marcht 45 miles in one day (in which the Foot went a great part) and to conclude the day to beat up quarters.</p>

               <p>We had one Dragoon ſhot, and ſome wounded; Col. <hi>Reynolds</hi> made good Newbridge with a ſmall party of his own and Major <hi>Shelburnes</hi> horſe, and parlyed with the Mutineers, and forced them to ford
