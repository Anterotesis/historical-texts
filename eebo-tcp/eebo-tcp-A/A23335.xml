            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ The Preface.</head>
            <p>MAtters beyng yet in doubt, maie with questions and reasons, bee brought out of doubt: but thinges beyng without doubt, ought not with the subteltie of wordes, bee broughte into doubte. As without all doubte Edmonde Boner, late vsurped bishop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, was a bastarde, and also the soonne of a Bastarde: that is a Bastarde in grosse, and a Bastarde can not, neither maie not bee a bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. Boner was a Bastarde, <hi>ergo</hi> no bishop, and this is a true conclusion. This is not true said an old <hi>Dunsticall</hi> felowe, sittyng at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a graue learned Lawier of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawe, and an eloquente Ciuilian, that were all three together: the one frouned, the seconde did bite his lippe, the third in a greate rage saied: men maie saie what thei will now a daies, &amp; belye the truthe as you haue doen, he was a blessed confessor, although a bastard, and a true bishop, bothe by Gods Lawes, the Canonicall lawes, &amp; the lawes of this realme of Englande. To this thei saied all <hi>Amen,</hi> Proue you the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary saied thei, and we wil yelde vnto you: will you <abbr>q</abbr> he, then will I proue hym no bishop, when he liued, whiche you graunt to bée bastarde by these thrée La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.
<pb facs="tcp:4652:3"/>
Make proffe saied these three, I will by Gods grace quod he, proue that neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, nor Boner, were any bishoppes of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but vsurped, bicause thei twoo were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardes: and all bastardes bee vnder the same predicament. For the booke of Wisedome in the. iiii. Chapit. makyng a difference betwene twoo generations of the lawfull, and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Of the lawfull it is saied: <hi>O quam pulcra, &amp; casta generatio. &amp;c.</hi> O how faire is a chaste generation with vertue: the memoriall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is immortall, for it is knowen with God, and with men: when it is presente, men take example thereat, and if it goe awaie, yet thei desire it: it is alwaies crouned, and holden in honor, and winneth the rewarde of the vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed battaill. But the other generation, that is vnknowen emong men, that are called the children of the people: thus muche is spoken of in the same booke. <hi>Multigena autem impioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> multitudo non erit vtilis, &amp; spuria vitulamina non dabunt radices altas, nec stabile fundamentum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituit.</hi> That is. The multitude of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, are vnprofitable children, and the thynges that are planted with whoredome, shall take no depe roote, nor laie any fast foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, though grene for a tyme in the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet thei shalbe shaken with the winde,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall inheritaunce. The Ciuill Lawe, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of the birth of children, saieth: <hi>Quod non potest arbor mala fructus bonos facere. &amp;c.</hi> An euil tree, saie thei, can not bring forth good fruite: nor a good tree beare euill fruites, and by the consente of the lawes it is agreed, that euery plante yeldeth to the nature of the grounde,
<pb facs="tcp:4652:4"/>
wherein it is planted. The childe also hath<note place="margin">Leges Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiles dicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t filium na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse fil. um populi.</note> muche more certaine, and sure knowledge of the mother, then of the father. Therfore saith the Ciuill Lawe, your naturall or bastarde soonne, is the soonne of the people: and when suche a bastarde is, hauing no certain, or kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen assured father at the birthe, as it is daily seen, and so iudged by lawe. How can he come by a father after: as example. If one woman should beare twoo children, of twoo fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and one of these fornicatours, after doe marie with this woman, whiche of these chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should this mariage make legitimate? This would partly help Tunstall by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil<note place="margin">Tunstall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starde.</note> lawe, bicause his father reconsiled his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into mariage, but lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after his birth: this is not Boners case (whose father was neuer maried to his mother) fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tasy would som what perswade: but reason can not finde, seyng the tyme was ones, when bothe these children were bastardes, and the sonnes of the people, and did not knowe their fathers: it wer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore against all reason, that a child afterward borne in the same Matrimonie, being lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Genes. 16.</note> borne, should lose the inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and place<note place="margin">Galla. 4.</note> the bastardie in the same, as lawfull heire. The lawes of Englande agreeth with the scriptures. Ismael did not inherit with Isaac:
<pb facs="tcp:4652:4"/>
So no bastardes doe inherite lawfully, by the lawes of Englande, neither is equall to the lawfull begotten in the inheritaunce, whiche by the Ciuill lawes can be deuided, but onely emong the male children. Saincte Augustine in <hi>lib. xvi. de Ciuitate dei,</hi> saieth, Abraham gaue all his substaunce vnto Isaac his soonne, but vnto the soonnes of the Concubines, he gaue giftes, and sente them awaie from Isaac his soonne. Wherevpon he ment that to bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, there is no inheritaunce due, but onely necessary liuyng, and vnder the name of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starde. Sainct Augustine vnderstande all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull issues, and so doeth holie scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and thinketh no small difference betwene the succession of the lawfull begotten, and the bastarde in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall thynges, or worldly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, muche lesse in the churche of Christ, in that, that it admitteth them not into holie Orders: and that is proued in the Popes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, againste the bastardly Papistes: and if the Pope dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with suche a one, yet he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not hym to haue a dignitie, or prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in the Churche, as to bee a bishoppe.<note place="margin">Et ecclesia que eos a sacris re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellit ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus. &amp;c. Et si tale dispensaue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit non eni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere in ecclesiae dei.</note> Therefore it is conuenient, that mannes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes should cutte them shorte, in the benefite of worldly succession. When the Churche doe iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnworthy of orders, of ministerie,
<pb facs="tcp:4652:5"/>
of pontificall dignitie: yea, whom the holie scripture do thrust doune, and greatly embace for though some, that is, one, emong a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande is good, yet most are not onely giuen to wickednesse, and persecution. &amp;c. Example of Ismael, some to murder. Example of Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,<note place="margin">Iudicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ix.</note> the bastarde soonne of Gedion, whiche Gedion had lawfull begotten sonnes. lxx. and but one bastarde, whiche bastarde Abimelech with one stone, traiterously killed al his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, one excepted. So there is more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one bastard, then in. lxix. lawfull son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Many examples I can bryng forthe of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, repugnant to bastards, of their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, whoredome, idolatrie, extortion, treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, murder, glottonie. &amp;c. For it is thought that thei doe drawe a certain staine from the volupteous lust, mutuall of bothe their filthie pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, whiche in lawfull chaste mariage ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no place:<note place="margin">Note this.</note> and then knowing them selues to be bastardes, hateth all them that are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully borne, inuentyng mischief against them as traitors would haue all men traitors: this base borne Bocher Boner, like Abimeleche, hath slain a great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the legitimate chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren of God: whose blood asketh the same cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well vengeaunce, that holie Abels doe still in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, against his brother Cain.
<pb facs="tcp:4652:5"/>
So you shall not doubte, but by Gods lawes, the lawes of Englande, and also the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawes, that bastardes are all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Iudge of this your selues,<note place="margin">Ergo.</note> and then make answere, when it shall please you. Sir, we will depart, quod thei, referryng this matter till an other tyme.

We moste humbly praie thee, to haue mercie vpon vs, accordyng to thy great mercie, and perdon vs good Lorde for our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: that we haue rebelled against thy diuine Maiestie, in thought, woorde, and deede, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng thee to cast vpon vs sondrie plagues for our offences: As pestilence, dearthe, rebellion with other greuous calamities, vnto our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable bodies.

Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce oh Lorde GOD, the guide and pathe waie to all deadly synnes, death, and finallie dampnation, banishement from thy glorious Maiestie, worlde without ende.

Oh lette God a rise, and let his enemies be scattered, lette them also that hate hym flie before him: so that we that are the Shepe of his pasture, maie in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his worde, be fedde in the pleasaunt fieldes of his holy scriptures, to life euerlastyng: Through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our lorde.</p>
