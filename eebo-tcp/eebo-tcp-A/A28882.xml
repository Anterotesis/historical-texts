         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that when the Heart

our Appetites, are put into
Action, and the intimate reſults
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43306:9"/>
of all our Faculties are brought

the very <hi>Index Animi,</hi> by which
the Temper and Diſpoſition of

evident; it's the Ultimate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult

is no Reaſon, that
a Muſcle ſhould be

deſigned for Motion, eſpecially

ſhall enquire into the Efficient

my own Hypotheſis, it
is neceſſary that I firſt confute
what has hitherto been ſaid on
this ſubject; nevertheleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it would be too tedious
to examine the Opinions of
ſo many Authors, I will only
ſhew the Errors of Two or
Three of the lateſt and moſt

            <p>The moſt Learned and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>
Conjectures,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion examin'd.</note> that
the Spirits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the Tendons of a
Muſcle, and are there plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid up as in a convenient
Store-houſe; which Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43306:11"/>
of an Agile and Elaſtick
Nature, as far as they are able,
and are permitted, always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to expand themſelves;
and that when an Inſtinct to
perform Muſcular Motion, is
carried from the Brain or <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi>
to this common Store-houſe,
they preſently leap out
of the Tendinous, into the
fleſhy Fibers, where they meet
with active Principles of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nature, ſupplied by the
Maſs of Blood; which two
ſtrongly &amp; mutually fermenting,
ſtuff up and tumifie the Fleſhy
Fibers; whence proceeds the
Contraction of a Muſcle. When
the Contraction ceaſeth, he
thinks that moſt of the pureſt
Spirits that remain, return into
the Tendons, the other more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43306:11"/>
impure Particles remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Fleſhy Fibers; he
fancies, that the Fibers of the
outward Membrane contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
promote the Retroceſſion
of the Spirits into the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons;
and that for a continual
ſupply of theſe Liquors, the
one is always ſtored up in the
Tendons, through the Nerves;
and the other in the Carnous
Fibers, from the Maſs of
Blood.</p>
            <p>This Conjecture as it ſeems
ingenious,<note place="margin">No Elaſtick Spirits laid up in the Tendons.</note> and at
the firſt view very
myſterious, yet
upon a more ſtrict Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it appears altogether as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.
For to ſuppoſe that
theſe Elaſtick Spirits are laid
up, and ſtored in the Tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43306:12"/>
Fibers, is contradictory
to Reaſon, as well as the Laws
of Circulation; for ſince in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Syſtole of the Brain, a freſh
ſupply of Animal Spirits is ſent
into all the Branches of the
Nerves, thoſe Animal Spirits in
the Tendinous Fibers, muſt
needs by a ſucceſſion of new
matter, be preſſed forwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fleſhy Fibres; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
Accidental Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
muſt follow: for as
much as there are no Valves
to hinder their immediate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
And that there are no
Valves, nor any thing elſe to
ſtop the continual Paſſage of
theſe Spirits, may be argued
hence; becauſe whatever would
ſtop the protruſion of theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
when preſſed by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43306:12"/>
of the Brain, would alſo
hinder 'em from ruſhing out
of their Store-houſe, though
ſtirred up by an Inſtinct, and
ſo the Muſcle would be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of Motion.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing that it were
poſſible for theſe Elaſtick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to be ſtored up in the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous
Fibers, and that neither
their agility, and continual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to exploſion, nor the
force of ſucceeding Spirits
would drive 'em out; yet when
a Muſcle ceaſeth from Motion,
perhaps a Day or Two; the
Tendon would be ſo filled and
ſtuffed up, that being no longer
capable of receiving more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
either they muſt be forced
forth into the Carnous Fibers,
and cauſe violent and Involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43306:13"/>
Contractions; or regur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitating
and flowing back upon
the Brain, would there cauſe a
<hi>Vertigo,</hi> or ſome other more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Diſeaſe; and beſides the
Spirits by ſtagnating ſo long,
would be chilled and coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and thereby render'd unapt
for Motion.</p>
            <p>It is not only abſurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,<note place="margin">Nor inſtinct ſent from the Brain, becauſe</note> that the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
are Store-houſes
for Spirits;
but alſo that they,
the Inſtinct being given, ſhould
cuſh out of the Carnous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
one might as well think,
that the Contents of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
the Gall in the <hi>Veſica

that the Circulation of the

            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Either it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that the Spirits are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent,</note>
to allow, that
thoſe Elaſtick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

the Carnous Fibers,
when the Inſtinct is given from

properly, <hi>ad imperium animae,</hi>
either implies, that thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

Matter; that they are able to
underſtand the Dictates and

in the Tendons to be uneaſie,
and by exagitation to expand
themſelves more powerfully,
and conſequently to leap forth.
But if neither the texture of

ſays, give the Inſtinct, be
changed, and different from thoſe
in the Tendons, nor the Subtile

would be no Exploſion, or

or the acceſſion of new

as I noted before, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which filled the Tendinous

Fibers, were driven, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively

ſo, Muſcular Motion would
not be Voluntary, but Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.</p>
            <p>That this Matter is not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent,
is proved
ſufficiently;<note place="margin">The Matter is not Intelligent.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to allow that
this acts as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
Inſtinct from the Brain,
is to allow a ſubordinate Soul
which acts <hi>proprià facultate</hi> in
every Tendon; which is falſe;
for an Intelligent Faculty in a
Tendon, which muſt act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Dictates of the
Principal Soul, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be a Faculty of that

of a Diſciple, <hi>Juratus in Verba

the Dictates of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
can be ſaid to be a part
or faculty of his Maſter's
Soul.</p>
            <p>That no Spirits of a different
Nature from thoſe
he suppoſes to be in
the Tendons,<note place="margin">No Spirits of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſent from the Brain.</note> can be
tranſmitted from
the Brain, is evident. For ſince
the ſame Spirits are diſtributed
through all the Nevervous Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
from the ſame Fountains,
the Brain, or the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
whatever cauſes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to leap out of one Tendon,
would cauſe the ſame Effects in
all, and all the Muſcles muſt be
contracted at the ſame Inſtinct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43306:15"/>
Having thus confuted the
Grounds and Foundation of his
Hypotheſis, it's not irrational
to expect, that the whole
Superſtructure ſhould fall: I
ſhall only further take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">No active Principles heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the Fleſhy Fibers.</note>
That if Active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were heaped
up in the Fleſhy
Fibers, by degrees
they would be ſo ſtuffed and
ſwelled up, that there would
be no room for the entrance of
Elaſtick Spirits from the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons;
but they themſelves
would rather, by reaſon of
their quantity, be forced into
the Tendinous Fibers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:43306:16"/>
Secondly, That it would be
abſurd to imagine,<note place="margin">Nor retroceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſubtile Matter into the Tendons.</note>
how theſe Two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
after ſo intimate
a commixture, as
would be produced by a ſtrong
Fermentation, can be ſo eaſily
ſeparated, that the one ſhould
ſuddenly run back into the
Tendons, leaving the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
in the Fleſhy Fibers: For
when Two Liquors of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Nature, and whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
and Subtile Particles have
a different Motion, are mixed
together; by a mutual Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is produced ſo intimate
a mixture, that it is impoſſible
to ſeparate the one from the
other ſincere; becauſe by a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
colliſion of different Particles,
both muſt needs in ſome meaſure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43306:16"/>
be altered, and degenerate from
their Priſtine State, ſo that if
the pureſt part of theſe Spirits
remaining ſhould run back into
the Tendons, they would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to, and different from
thoſe purer Spirits ſent from
the Brain; and would infect the
Store-houſes with ſuch a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
taint, that as new ſupplys
were laid down by the Nerves,
freſh Exploſions and Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Muſcles muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To help the Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of theſe Spirits into the
Tendinous Fibers; Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>
would have the Fibers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting
Membrance to contract:
But I ſhould rather think, that
they would contract at the ſame
time with the Muſcle, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43306:17"/>
were carried through the
ſame Nervous Channels with
the Spirits; becauſe, as he ſays,
they are firſt laid down in the
Membrane, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
to the Tendon?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> in the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his <hi>Myoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia
Reformata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cowper's</hi> opinion exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects;
that the
Blood is a Pondus, by which
the action of a Muſcle is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
The grounds of this
ſuſpition are cheifly taken from
two Experiments: The firſt is a
Ligature on the deſcending
ttunk of the Aorta, whereby all
the inferior Parts, became deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Motion, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
again when that Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was looſed: The ſecond, is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43306:17"/>
to be taken for a more ſurprizing
Argument, becauſe after a ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of Motion, the Muſcles
of the Legs renued their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
by an Injection of
Water into the Crural Arterie.</p>
            <p>But that there is no Reaſon to
aſſert, that the Blood acts as a
Pondus from theſe Experiments,
will hereafter ſufficiently appear,
by giving other Reaſons for theſe
<hi>Phenomena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time to evince,<note place="margin">The Blood does not act as a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note>
that the Blood as a
Pondus does in no
wiſe help the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of a Muſcle, but does
on the contrary, much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and reſiſt the Intumeſcence
of the Muſculous Fibers,<note place="margin">The Firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> by
which the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Muſcle is
performed, let any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43306:18"/>
one hold his hands before a Fire,
with his Arms perpendicular,
continuing 'em in that poſture
till he feels the Muſculous Parts
well filled with Blood; then lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up both his Hands, let him
hold 'em up as high as he can,
till the Pondus of the Blood be
drained, and the Veins which
before were full and tumid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
flaccid and empty, and
he'l move his Fingers much more
eaſily and ſwifter, when the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are eaſed of the Pondus of
Blood, than he did whilſt his
Hands were dependent; yet
certainly there was a greater
Pondus of Blood upon the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in the former poſture, whilſt
they were tumid, than in the
latter when emptied of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43306:18"/>
Another Argument to prove,<note place="margin">A Second.</note>
That the Pondus of
the Blood doth not
at all promote the Contraction
of a Muſcle; may be taken from
the Obſervation of Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Bodies, who are far more
dull and unapt for Motion than
healthful people, whoſe Veins
and Arteries are moderately fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Blood, which is not ſo
thick and heavy; for in Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymick
Bodies, there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pondus of Blood, but becauſe
it doth not yeild matter for to
ſwell the Carnous Fibers, as
plentifully as blood of a more
healthful conſtitution, Motion
is not ſo brisk and ſtrong; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if the Pondus of the Blood
did any ways contribute to the
performance of Muſcular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43306:19"/>
they would be far more
ſtrong; for the thicker the Blood
is, the greater is the Pondus.</p>
            <p>In the Muſcles of the Legs
and Thighs there is
always,<note place="margin">A Third.</note> when the
Body is erect, a greater weight
of Blood, than on the Muſcles
belonging to the Hands and
Arms; and yet the latter, are
far more agile and nimble in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Again, if we but make a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature
two or three fingers
breadth above the Cubit, ſo as
to hinder the Reflux, but not the
Influx of the Blood; when the
Sanguiferous Veſſels are ſwelled,
and the Muſcles well filled, they
are rendered much more unapt
for Motion: Which evidently
ſhews that the more the Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43306:19"/>
Veſſels are diſtended, the
more the Motion of a Muſcle
is hindered; becauſe when the
Veſſels are dilated they reſiſt
the Intumeſcence of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Fibers, and conſequently
the Contraction of a Muſcle.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of a Muſcle is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by the Pondus of the
Blood, is apparently evident in
the following Experiment:<note place="margin">A Fifth.</note> 
               <hi>Viz.</hi>
Make a Ligature
two or three fingers
breadth above the Cubit, ſo
ſtrong as to ſtop the Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blood; then open the
largeſt Vein with the common
Inſtrument, and the Blood which
more than uſually ſwelled up the
Sanguiferous Veſſels will leap
forth; but preſently for want of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43306:20"/>
ſubſequent Matter, and due Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
the Vein falls and the
Blood ceaſes to run; yet by a
Contraction of the Muſcles to
which that Vein leads, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
part of the Blood, which
lay in the Muſcle, is forced out:
which plainly ſhews there is leſs
Blood in a contracted Muſcle,
than before Contraction.</p>
            <p>The ſame appears alſo in Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">A Sixth.</note>
or any other
violent Exerciſe, in
which moſt of the Muſcles are
Contracted; for preſently the
Blood flows more than uſually
upon the tender Lungs, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
an Intollerable ſhortneſs of
Breath: Becauſe by an Intumeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the fleſhy Fibers, the
Muſcles are not only made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of receiving ſo much Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43306:20"/>
Blood as before Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but alſo, becauſe the Blood
which lay in the Veinous Ducts
is driven out more forcibly upon
the Heart, and the Heart being
overwhelmed, drives it out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lungs. Whence proceeds
that Palpiration of the Heart
upon violent Motion, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
as Dr. <hi>Croone</hi> ſuppoſeth,
becauſe an Inſtinct is ſent from
the Brain to raiſe ſtronger Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
that the Blood may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
be driven into the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and thereby cauſe Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
for then why doth it
not at the firſt inſtinct thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the Lungs with its quanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
but this ſtrong Palpitation
is Accidental; for when the
Blood is more than uſually dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the Heart, and not ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43306:21"/>
plentifully received by the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
by degrees it oppreſſes
the Heart with it's quantity, and
the Animal powers being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the oppreſſion, raiſe ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Syſtoles to drive it out
which preſently is received and
heaped up in the Lungs as a
Part leſs able to reſiſt its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Incurſion. Nay many times,
when the Veſſels are well filled
with Blood, by violent and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Exagitations, betwixt the
Contraction of the Heart and of
the Muſcles, its texture is ſo
looſened; that it ferments and
boyles up ſo that the Lungs are
not only ſwelled up and almoſt
ſtifled, being rendered uncapable
of receiving Air, but it is alſo
more ſtrongly &amp; forcibly driven
into the Muſcles themſelves, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43306:21"/>
there diſtending the Sanguife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Veſſels hinders the Intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſcence
of the Fibers, and
thereby the Contractions of the
Muſcles So that I have not
once, trying this Experiment,
found ſuch an Oppreſſion on my
whole Thorax; and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
and in ſome meaſure pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
endeavours, betwixt the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous
Veſſels tumified and
the Carnous Fibers ſtriving to
ſwell; that I was forced to lay
me down, to the end that the
Carnous Fibers being flaccid
might give way to the incourſe
of the Blood; and by receiving
it more plentifully might caſe
both my Thorax of its Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and that the Carnous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
yeilding to the Sanguife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Veſſels might put an end
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43306:22"/>
to that uneaſie contention.
Thus much I think is ſufficient
to prove, that the Blood as a

are always Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with a Fluid;<note place="margin">The common Poſtulatum is not to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>
and that the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Liquor equally flows into
the Branches of all the Nerves,
according to their Proportion,
is beyond Contradiction; but
if we allow the common <hi>Poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum,</hi>
we muſt alſo conclude,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43306:23"/>
That <hi>the Animal Fluid</hi> is Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
and there will follow the
ſame Difficulties as were before
mentioned, about the leaping
forth of Spirits out of Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>
his <hi>Tendinous Receptacles;</hi> where
I have given ſufficient Reaſons
to reject this <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
            <p>Moreover if it were Poſſible,<note place="margin">There is no Retroceſſion of a Fluid from the Autagoniſt.</note>
for ſo much of
this <hi>Animal Fluid</hi>
as is requiſite to
diſtend the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Fibers, to be conveiged
in ſo ſhort a time as Muſcular
Motion follows our Appetite
through the ſmall Branches of
the Nerves; yet it would be
altogether unconceivable, how
it ſhould flow back from the
Antagoniſt, thus contrary to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43306:23"/>
the Courſe of Circulation;
but the Reaſon he gives is
partly this, to avoid a Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:
This is a moſt Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
ſort of a Motion; at
the ſame time that the Liquid is
forced into the one Muſcle, it
runs directly oppoſite from the
Antagoniſt; which is very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and unlikely.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I cannot underſtand
how it comes to
paſs,<note place="margin">Nor is it forced out ſo as to cauſe a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum.</note> that the Animal
Fluid is ſo much
forced out of the
Branches of the Nerves leading,
to the Muſcles to be contracted
as to leave a <hi>Vacuum</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Liquids from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt;
but if an Emptineſs or
Vacuum could be ſo made, the
Fluids would as ſoon be drawn
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43306:24"/>
back again, out of the Muſcles
into which our Appetite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them, to fill that empty
Space, as out of the Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt.</p>
            <p>To prevent an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Suppoſition, that the
fluid runs back again from the
Antagoniſt, he thinks he has
anſwered it already, but very
inſufficiently: He ſays, if it be
ſaid, that the Reflux is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the conſtant direct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it's eaſie to reply, that
it's ſlow direct Motion, is eaſily
repelled, by the violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
of the forcibly relaxed
Muſcle. I muſt confeſs, it's
no piece of difficulty to make
ſuch an Anſwer; but the Reply
ſeems not ſo eaſily to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
I would fain know
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43306:24"/>
how the Antagoniſt comes to
be ſo forcibly relaxed, as by
a violent impulſe to overpower
the direct Motion: For the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Motion cannot be ſo weak,
as to be eaſily overcome; and
ſince the Animal Fluid, as he
calls it, is continually driven by
the Pulſation of the Heart,
through the Brain or Spinal
Marrow into the Nerves, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
repells the direct Motion,
muſt be of equal, if not greater,
force than the Syſtole of the
Heart.</p>
            <p>He begs leave to ask, how
when another bends his Arm
againſt his Will, the Muſcles
become tumid, as when volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
contracted. This Queſtion
doth not at all confirm his
Hypotheſis, but on the contrary
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43306:25"/>
pleads againſt it. It doth not
confirm it, becauſe he doth not
account for the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi>
nor give a Reaſon agreeable to
his Opinion, but leaves the
thing barely without explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
it pleads againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
according to his Opinion,
the Muſcle inſtead of growing
tumid, ought violently to relax,
at leaſt to endeavour a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not contrary to the
Appetite, to run into a Muſcle
againſt our Will: For he ſays
at the ſame time, that the
Muſcles to be contracted, grow
tumid; the Antagoniſts by a
violent relaxation, drive out
the fluid contained in them:
So that it will follow, that at
the ſame time we endeavour
to keep our Arm unbent, by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43306:25"/>
ſtriving to keep the one Muſcle
contracted, at the ſame time we
ought to endeavour a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Antagoniſt; and
though that force which bends
our Arm, doth reſiſt the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Contraction of the
Muſcle, yet there would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hinder the voluntary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
of that Muſcle, which
is the Antagoniſt, but the ſlow
direct Motion, as he calls
it.</p>
            <p>But here I humbly take leave
to ask, whether there is not a
great deal of difference, betwixt
a Muſcle that is thus tumid, and
one that is Contracted? For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
a Muſcle cannot but be tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid,
when contracted, yet it
may be tumid though not
contracted: I mean, as it is in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43306:26"/>
Muſcular motion. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
oft taken notice, that when
my Arm has been bent againſt
my Will, the Muſcles become
tumid, but not as in Muſcular
Motion; for when a Muſcle is
Voluntarily contracted, it's hard
and tumid; but when my Arm
is bent againſt my Will, it's
far more ſoft; and though
tumid, yet very little contracted.
Since the Reaſon why the
Muſcles grow thus tumid,
cannot be accounted for by this
Hypotheſis, I ſhall explain it
hereafter.</p>
            <p>Having thus examined, and
I hope confuted the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Opinions, I ſhall in the
next place briefly conſider the
Fabrick of a Muſcle, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

the Belly, and the Tail; they
acquaint you how the Belly is
compoſed of ſeveral <hi>Faſciculi</hi> of
Fleſhy Fibers, which lie parallel

of Muſcles in the Original
Authors: I ſhall omit the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
here, and only take
Notice of it's Fabrick, as far as
relates to my Hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43306:27"/>
Every Muſcle is endowed
with oppoſite Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,<note place="margin">Of the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Muſcle.</note>
which are

            <p>Theſe Fibers being ſtrictly
joyned together, compoſe a
ſtrong, tenacious and firm Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
but being ſeparated one
from another, are more fragile,
and ſubject to be eaſily broke,
and pulled in pieces; they are
continued from each Tendon to
it's oppoſite.</p>
            <p>The Interſtices of the Fibers
thus ſeparated, are filled with
the Branches and Extremities
of Veſſels, the major part of
which are Sanguiferous; ſo that
the Fibers continued through
the Belly of a Muſcle, being

therefore are called Fleſhy.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fibers as they are

            <p>As for the Efficient Cauſes of
Muſcular Motion; before they
can be ſufficiently ſhewn, we
muſt enquire how many ſorts of
Veſſels are implanted into each
Muſcle, which according to
Anatomiſts are Four, <hi>Nerves,
Arteries, Veins</hi> and
<hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Veſſels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into a Muſcle.</note> the

back the ſuperfluity of Blood

            <p>The Branches of all theſe
Veſſels are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely
diſtributed
through the whole
Muſcle,<note place="margin">Their diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</note> and by an intermixture
and texture of the moſt Minute
and Subtile Branches of the

which fills up the Interſtices of

the whole Belly of a
Muſcle Fleſhy. The colour of
theſe Veſſels, as of all others,
is without doubt White, but by
the Contents of the Sanguiferous
Veſſels, the whole Belly of a
Muſcle is coloured Red.</p>
            <p>The Terminations of theſe
Veſſels are ſo minute and ſmall,
ſo brittle, and ſubject to be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43306:29"/>
broke, that it's as difficult to
trace, and find their Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Inſertions, as to divide

and though many things are
made viſible by the help of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcopes,
which are otherwiſe
too ſubtile to be diſcerned and
diſcovered by the naked Eye;
yet I am not without Reaſon
perſwaded, that the terminations
of theſe Veſſels, cannot be
perceived by the help of a
Microſcope.</p>
            <p>Some indeed, whatever they
think is probable, leſt it ſhould
not be credited, preſently ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

perhaps prevent thoſe not ſo
exquiſitely skill'd in Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes,
from making any further
ſearch after truth. I ſhall not
here ſay, that what I propoſe
concerning the Terminations of
theſe Veſſels, was ſeen with
any Microſcope, but ſhall declare
my Opinion in this Matter, too
ſubtile for any Microſcope but
Reaſon.</p>
            <p>It being impoſſible for any

the true Reaſon of
Muſcular Motion,<note place="margin">And termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in ſmall Glands.</note>
unleſs firſt acquainted with the
diſtribution of theſe Veſſels,
and their Contents; firſt, I
conceive, that as the Nerves,
Arteries and Veins, are all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
through a Muſcle, ſo
it is but Reaſonable to conclude,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43306:30"/>
that their minute and ſubtile
twigs are all, before they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
interwoven and mixed
with one another: And if ſo,
it will not be abſurd to imagine,
that they all end, as it were, in
ſmall and <hi>Diminutive Glands:</hi>
And if the ends of the Veſſels
be ſo ſmall, that their termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
cannot be perceived by a
Microſcope, theſe <hi>Glandules</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

be very ſmall and fine, and
conſequently may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

            <p>From theſe <hi>Glandules</hi> thus

This Paſſage very likely, may
be compoſed of the external

            <p>For a Gland is nothing elſe,<note place="margin">What a Gland is.</note>
but a Compoſition

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43306:31"/>
Veſſels, ſeveral, and
moſt of which, have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication

which Gland ſo compoſed, is
as a Store-houſe to receive and

neceſſity requires, or its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
cauſes an excluſion of it:
And this ſeems plainly to be
favour'd by Dr. <hi>Ridley,</hi> when
he ſays, that the whole Body
is a continuity of Veſſels, <hi>ad
infinitum.</hi> Now, if a Gland
conſiſts of an infinite Number
of ſmall Veſſels; and if the
Branches of Nerves, Veins
and Arteries be divided before
they terminate, into an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
number of moſt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
twigs, as is moſt certain;
when from one twig of each
ſort, is derived a vaſt number,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43306:31"/>
and all theſe ſo derived, are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and interwoven one with
another; why may we not ſay,
at leaſt Metaphorically, ſince
they in their Diſtributions imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Compoſition of Glands,
that they terminate in ſmall
Glandules.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps will ask, how
muſt we diſcover theſe Glands
<hi>Malpigius</hi> hath obſerved the
Liver to be compoſed of Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Glands, hanging at the
Extremities of the larger Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
like ſo many Bunches of
Grapes; and the Glands in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts are apparent; but in
a Muſcle we can diſcern no ſuch
things; for it, eſpecially when
boiled, parts into diſtinct Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Fibers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:43306:32"/>
To which I Anſwer,<note place="margin">Why they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcerned.</note> That
thoſe Glands are
nothing elſe but a
Compoſition of the
ends of importing and export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Veſſels; and the Reaſon why
we cannot diſcern the ſame in a
Muſcle is this, becauſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the Veſſels are ſo
fine, and conſequently ſo brittle,
and are contained in the Interſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſo ſtrong and firm Fibers;
that whenever we endeavour a
ſeparation of the Fibers, the
Glandules are torn away from
the Veſſels from which they are
derived; whereas the Fibers
which run tranſverſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
eaſily crumble away, being
much more weak and leſs Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:43306:32"/>
The Reaſon why the Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Fibers are ſo much ſtronger,
than thoſe that run through the
Liver, is apparent enough, <hi>Viz.</hi>
becauſe the former are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of Motion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
there lies a greater
ſtreſs of them, than on the latter,
which ſerve to make the Part

            <p>Now becauſe it is impoſſible
to ſeparate and remove theſe
Muſcular Fibers, ſo as to leave
the Sanguiferous Veſſels as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
as would be requiſite for
the exact and certain diſcovery
of their Terminations; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is certain, that theſe

I have given a breif Account

            <p>That Voluntary Motion does

of our Appetite, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
Evinced; becauſe it's
inſtantly perform'd according
to our Will. Where the Soul

I ſhall defer my Thoughts

            <p>In the mean time, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Soul, nor any of it's

open and ſhut the Pores of the
Brain, by an Organical Motion,
as neceſſity requires, what this
Motion is, and how it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and after what manner
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43306:36"/>
the Dictates of the Soul and
of its Faculties are put in Action,
is reſerved for its proper Seat.</p>
            <p>After what manner ſoever the
Soul exerts it's Faculties, and
directs that Subtile Matter the
Animal Spirits (which is ſent
through the Branches of the
Nerves, in greater or leſs quati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
according to our Appetite)
to this or that Part: it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that when our Body
ceaſeth from Motion, and all
our Voluntary Faculties are at
quiet, the Pores and Paſſages of
the Brain leading to the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Voluntary Motion are
locked or cloſed up: And then
I ſuppoſe, that the Spirits mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
flowing into each
Muſcle, do prepare ſo much of
the <hi>Subtile Liquor</hi> aforemention'd
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43306:36"/>
as is ſufficient to Nouriſh the
Parts as it paſſeth through 'em.</p>
            <p>But when the Pores of the
Brain are opened,<note place="margin">The Reaſon of Tonick Motion</note>
and unlocked, the
Animals Spirits forced by a
continual Succeſſion of Matter,
flow into all the Branches of
the Nerves more plentifully, and
being laid down in the <hi>Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
raiſe a ſtronger Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
by which means a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quantity of the Subtile <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>
is prepared, and forced
into the fleſhy Fibers more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
and rather faſter that it
can be received and evacuated
by the Lymphaeducts; ſo that
the Fibers being all equally
ſwelled with its quantity, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Contract the Muſcles;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43306:37"/>
which is the Cauſe of a Tonick
Motion.</p>
            <p>When theſe Animal Spirits,
are by a preſſure and Syſtole of
the Brain and ſucceeding Spirits,
ſent yet more plentifully into
the Nervous Channels leading
to the Muſcles to be Contracted,
than into thoſe which are in
<hi>Motu Tonico,</hi> or into the Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts
(the Paſſages and Pores
leading to thoſe Nerves being
yet more expanded and opened)
there is a greater quantity of the
Subtile Liquor prepared in the
<hi>Glandules,</hi> and thruſt out into
the Carnous Fibers; and their
Cells being more ſwelled and
dilated, conſequently there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
ſtronger and more violent
Contractions of the Muſcles;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43306:37"/>
whence proceeds Local Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>By the Syſtole of the Brain
I don't mean any other Motion
than what proceeds from the
Pulſation of the Arteries diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
through that Part. That
this motion only proceeds from
the Pulſation of the Arteries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
that it is ſtronger, &amp; drives
the Spirits through the Brain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Nerves with greater force
than if it were really the Motion
of the Brain it ſelf; the Heart from
whence the Pulſation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
proceeds, being a ſtronger
and more compact Part as to
its Subſtance, than the Brain.</p>
            <p>If it be asked, why this <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Liquor</hi> is not more eaſily
forced into the Venous Ducts,
than into thoſe that lead to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43306:38"/>
Fibrous Cells, becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
are larger?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, That the Venous
Ducts are ſo proportioned, that
they might not be capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
all that is laid down by
the Nerves and Arteries; on
purpoſe, that ſome Subtile Parts
might be continually driven into
the Fibrous Cells; and when
by a more copious Influx of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Spirits, a ſtronger Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention
is raiſed in the <hi>Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi>
preſently the Contents
ſwell up and are expanded; ſo
that the Veins being not able to
receive them as before, more of
that <hi>Liquor</hi> is not only ſubtilized,
but forced into the Fibers.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as, according to our
Appetite, the Pores of the Brain,
which conveigh Spirits to the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43306:38"/>
Nerves leading to the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Muſcles, are ſhut more
cloſely up again, and leave of to
be dilated; the Animal Spirits
ceaſe to flow more into the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<hi>Glandules,</hi> than are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to Subtilize, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a ſufficient quantity of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
for the Fibers (as in the
Antagoniſt,) then preſently the
Contraction ceaſeth to be carried
on, and the Superfluous <hi>Liquor</hi>
heaped up in the Fibers, is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
by the Lymphaeducts.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps, becauſe I ſaid
in the foregoing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph;<note place="margin">Objections An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> the <hi>Liquor</hi>
heaped up in the Fibers is Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
by the Lymphaeducts;
it may be a Queſtion whether
this <hi>Liquor</hi> does all the time a

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43306:39"/>
flow through theſe Cells into
the Lymphaeducts; or whether
it remains in the Cells till Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to ceaſe, and is not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
by the ſaid Ducts till
then.</p>
            <p>I ſay it does continually run
of by the Lymphaeducts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
all the time a Muſcle is
Contracted: Otherwiſe ſince as
long as Spirits are directed, in a
competent quantity, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Muſcles, to keep up the
Dilation of the Fibers; they
would preſently be incapable of
receiving it, and it muſt needs
Regurgitate as it was prepared,
and in a great Meaſure diſturb
Circulation. But to prevent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
abſurd Conſequences, if it
ſhould remain in the Cells ſo
long; I affirm, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43306:39"/>
forced forward, by a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Matter; and as it is
forced into, and Circulates
through, theſe Cells, in greater
or leſs quantities, ſo Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are ſtronger or weaker or
not at all, the Fibrous Cells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accordingly Diſtended, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and Contracted in Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and when according to
our Appetite, this <hi>Liquor</hi> ceaſeth
to flow into the Fibers in ſo great
a quantity as to Contract the
Muſcle; that matter which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dilated the Fibers, is Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,
as being Superfluous
Nouriſhment, ſo that for the
future it runs through in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
quantity as before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
till their Repletion is
again renued to Reiterate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:43306:40"/>
If it be asked, why this <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>
is not as eaſily forced back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
out of the Fibrous Cells
into the <hi>Glandules</hi> from whence
it came, as into the Lymphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts;
and ſo think there
would be no need for Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That if there be no
Valve at the inward Orifice of
every <hi>Duct,</hi> to hinder its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux;
(which would be no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
to conclude; for we
ſee always upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Nature hath furniſh'd ſuch
Places with Valves;) yet I ſay,
if there were none, the direct
Motion of ſubſequent Matter
from the <hi>Glandules,</hi> would ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
hinder the reflux of it;
and ſince its reflux is oppoſed,
by new matter forced ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43306:40"/>
after it; and ſince according
to the courſe of Circulation,
the Matter driven into the
Lymphaeducts before it, will
give way for its expulſion, it
would be more reaſonable to
imagine, that the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Fibers is evacuated
<hi>qua datur porta,</hi> rather than <hi>qua
non datur;</hi> for when we deſign
the Relaxation of a Muſcle,
though the Liquor ſucceſſively
ſent from the <hi>Glands,</hi> does not
preſs forwards altogether as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly,
and in as great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as whilſt Contraction is
continued; yet it follows mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately,
ſo as to oppoſe the
Retroceſſion of any thing; I
mean moderately, as to its
quantity; for the continual vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
concourſe of the Animal
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43306:41"/>
Spirits, and Arterial Blood,
drive it then into the Fibers,
almoſt as violently as when the
Muſcle is contracted.</p>
            <p>That theſe <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> do
thus receive this
Subtile Liquor;<note place="margin">The Uſe of the Lymphaeducts.</note> and
that for that end
they are inſerted into the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous
Cells, I am perſwaded;
becauſe it cannot otherwiſe be
underſtood, how the Matter
that ſtuffs them up, and cauſes
Contraction, could be drawn
out again, without a Retroceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
through the ſame Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
by which it was brought
in: And though the moſt
Learned and Famous Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> and others, do allow
a Retroceſſion, yet ſince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
the courſe of Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43306:41"/>
we muſt either deny Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
or reject their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I cannot conceive,
what other occaſion there is for
Lymphaeducts in a Muſcle;
ſince whatever is brought by
the Arteries, might as well be
returned by the Veins, as by
two ſorts of Veſſels: But for
as much as Nature hath made
nothing in vain, and ſince there
is ſo great neceſſity, that they
ſhould be inſerted into the Cells,
I think it not irrational nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
to conclude they were
deſigned for the afore-mentioned
end.</p>
            <p>That we may
underſtand a little
better the Nature
of this Liquor,<note place="margin">The Nature of the Liquor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, and the manner of its preparation.</note>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:43306:42"/>
which we have ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
let us conſider a little
more fully, how that Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is carried on in the ſaid
<hi>Glandules.</hi> It's commonly known,
that when a Ferment is put to
a Maſs, whether Liquid, or of
a ſolid conſiſtence, whatever is
the nature of the Ferment, it,
according to its power, always
endeavours to render whatever
comes within the Sphaere of its
Activity, as like it
as poſſible.<note place="margin">By Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> So in
theſe <hi>Glandules,</hi> the
Animal Spirits fermenting with
the Arterial Juice, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of 'em being, according to
Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> and <hi>Diemerbroeck, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituo-Saline,</hi>
compoſed of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litile
Salt and Sulphur, they
by Reaſon of their abſolute
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43306:42"/>
Quality, more readily mix with
the crude Sulphureo-ſaline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the <hi>Nutricious Arterial
Juice;</hi> and as they are more or
leſs in quantity, ſo they exalt
and carry forth into a Flux,
more or leſs of that Crude Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureo-ſaline
Maſs; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Fermentation ſubtilized,
is diluted with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Lympha,</hi> or the watry
part of the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood,
and the <hi>Liquor</hi> reſulting from
that Compoſition, is thruſt out
into the Fibrous Cells.</p>
            <p>That this <hi>Lympha</hi> might be
thin enough to dilute the ſaid
<hi>Liquor</hi> ſufficiently, it is much
attenuated in that Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:43306:43"/>
That there is ſuch a Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">Proved.</note>
that the Nerves
are inſerted into the
<hi>Glandules,</hi> and lay down Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, as the Principal
Cauſe of that Fermentation;
that the Arteries lay down
Blood together, with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<hi>Juice,</hi> and that in
thoſe <hi>Glands,</hi> a ſubtile <hi>Liquor</hi>
is prepared, being compoſed of
Animal Spirits, and the moſt?
rarified parts of the ſaid <hi>Succus;</hi>
that neither the Arterial Juice,
nor the Animal Spirits ſimply
can cauſe the Contraction of a
Muſcle; but furthermore, that
it is neceſſary that this Subtile
<hi>Liquor</hi> ſhould be ſo prepared
and compoſed, as being capable
to enter into the Fibers, and
to contract the Muſcle, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43306:43"/>
apparent from what hath
been ſaid, and will more clearly
be evinced by what follows.</p>
            <p>And firſt, if there be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of theſe Veſſels, as
certainly there is; then it muſt
needs follow, that there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of their Contents; if there
be a commixture of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
then there is a Fermentation,
and in that Fermentation it muſt
needs follow, that the Animal
Spirits will according to their
Energie and Activity Subtilize
and Attenuate the Crudeſt Parts
of the <hi>Arterial juice:</hi> By a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Fermentation there muſt
needs be implyed an intimate
Commixture, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of that Commixture muſt
needs be different from the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, or <hi>Arterial juice</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:43306:44"/>
ſimply before they are mixed;
ſo that the <hi>Liquor,</hi> reſulting
from the Mixture of 'em, may
be properly called a <hi>Subtile Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor:</hi>
And accordingly as the
Animal Spirits are more or leſs
in quantity, to mix with the
<hi>Arterial juice,</hi> more or leſs will
be prepared and thruſt out into
the Fibrous Cells, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Fibrous Cells muſt
be more or leſs Tumified, and
the Muſcle Contracted, as more
or leſs Spirits are laid down in
the <hi>Glandules.</hi> So that all I have
to Prove is, That neither the
<hi>Arterial juice,</hi> nor the <hi>Animal
Spirits</hi> can cauſe the Contraction
of a Muſcle, and then it will
follow conſequently, that there
is a Communication of theſe
Veſſels, and for that end, in the
aforeſaid <hi>Glandules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:43306:44"/>
It hath often been found, that
an <hi>Atrophea</hi> of the
Parts will follow
the Relaxation;<note place="margin">The <hi>Arterial juice</hi> ſimply can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cauſe the Contraction of a Muſcle.</note> &amp;
a Palſie the Abſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

ſufficiently ſhews, that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
juice</hi> it ſelf, cannot cauſe
the Contraction of a Muſcle,
without the aſſiſtance of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Spirits; becauſe when the
Animal Spirits ceaſe to flow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Glandules,</hi> for want of a
dew Fermentation, to Subtilize
and Prepare a ſufficient quantity
of the <hi>Arterial juice,</hi> the Carnous
Fibers are not only deprived of
neceſſary Recruits, and Alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

Languid, but alſo for want of a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43306:45"/>
ſufficient quantity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>Liquor,</hi> to diſtend the Fibrous
Cells, they become deſtitute of
Motion.</p>
            <p>That the Animal Spirits ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,<note place="margin">Nor the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits.</note>
cannot cauſe
the Contraction of
a Muſcle is proved; becauſe by
a Ligature on the Deſcending
Trunk of the Aorta, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Parts become deſtitute of
Motion: For tho' the Influx of
the Animal Spirits, be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
yet for want of <hi>Arterial

Contract without an Efficient
cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43306:45"/>
From what is contained in
theſe two Paragraphs, it appears;
that neither the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi>
nor the <hi>Arterial juice,</hi> ſimply
can cauſe the Contraction of a
Muſcle; becauſe when the Animal
Spirits are hindered to flow into
the <hi>Glandules,</hi> to Subtilize and
prepare the <hi>Arterial juice,</hi> it is
not thin enough to be driven
out into the Fibers: And tho'
when the Influx of the <hi>Arterial
juice</hi> is hindered, the Spirits are
permitted to flow in; yet by
Reaſon of the ſmall quantity
of 'em, they run through the
Fibers without diſtending 'em.</p>
            <p>That this <hi>Arterial juice</hi> ought
not,<note place="margin">Becauſe the <hi>Arterial juice</hi> cannot paſs into the Fibers till prepar'd by the Spirits.</note> nay cannot, paſs
into the Fibrous
Cells, till ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and prepared
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43306:46"/>
by the Fermentation in the
<hi>Glandules,</hi> is Plain; becauſe if it
could, they wou'd be ſtuffed up
with the quantity of it, driven in
by the continual courſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
ſo as to Contract the
Muſcle againſt our Will; which
is otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the <hi>Arterial juice</hi>
cannot paſs into the Fibers till
Subtilized; and ſince the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits</hi> are not enough in
quantity; moreover ſince neither
of 'em, ſimply are capable of
Contracting the Fibers, and if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be obſtructed the Action is
aboliſhed; I ſay ſince it is an
Action, that depends upon the
mutual Aſſiſtance of each; it is
apparent. That it muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by a <hi>Liquor</hi> reſulting
from a Mixture of both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:43306:46"/>
And then we muſt of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
allow a Communication of
theſe Veſſels; elſe there could
be no mixture of their contents;
and the <hi>Arterial juice</hi> muſt be
prepared before it can be forced
into the Fibers, for the Reaſons
beforementioned: to which end
it will be neceſſary that the
Veſſels terminate in the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,</hi>
That their Contents may
be mixed, and that this Subtile
<hi>Liquor</hi> (reſulting from a Mutual
conflict of the Animal Spirits
ſubtilizing the cruder <hi>Arterial
juice</hi> by Fermentation, in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or leſs quantities accordingly
as the Spirits are laid down by
the Nerves) may be prepared
and made ready to be driven
into the Fibers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:43306:47"/>
To promote the Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Preparation of this
Subtile <hi>Liquor,</hi> the forcible influx
of the Animal Spirits, and of
the Arterial Blood much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce:
For be the Temper of the
<hi>Arterial juice</hi> and of the <hi>Animal
Spirits</hi> never ſo good, unleſs
they are driven violently one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another, there would be
required a longer time before
they could be ſo mixed and,
fermented as they ought, but
the ſucceſſion of new Matter
admitting no long delay, it is
requiſite that they ſhould be
thus forcibly driven in together;
to the end that the Spirits might
be diffuſed through the whole
Maſs ſooner, and that their
Minute Particles, ſtriking more
violently againſt the fixed and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43306:47"/>
compacted Particles of the Blood,
might more immediately break
and ſeparate the ſtrict Union of
its Parts; and by a violent Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
ſufficiently diſſolve
and volatilize 'em, in ſo ſhort
a time as the Continual Pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſucceeding Humors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>The violent concourſe of the
Blood and Spirits, do not only
promote this Fermentation, and
the ſeparation of the Subtile <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi>
but alſo ſucceſſively force
the Matter prepared and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the fleſhy Fibers: This
is ſo highly Probable, that it
needs no Arguments to make it
more Evident; it being the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable

            <p>

Now I have given the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

conveigh Animal Spirits
in a ſufficient quantity to cauſe
a perpetual Motion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Pores being ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
there is no need that
they ſhou'd have ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick
Motion as thoſe ſerving
to the Inſtruments of Voluntary
Motion; becauſe ſince they are
proportioned ſo, as to carry Spirits
in a competent quantity, there
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43306:49"/>
is no neceſſity that they ſhould
be either Dilated or Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>To Prove that theſe Pores
do lay down a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Quantity of
Spirits to be carried to the
<hi>Glands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Proved.</note> I need not bring many
Arguments; for its plain and
evident to all Practitioners in
Phyſick, that when the Spirits
are too much carried forth, and
exalted, as in a <hi>Diary</hi> Fever,
the Pulſe is ſtrong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by a too great exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
of them, it becomes
more quick and frequent; it is
alſo Evident, that when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Spirits are depreſſed, the
Pulſe is Weak, Slow and Rare,
as moſt commonly in Women,
ſubject to Hyſterick Fits; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43306:49"/>
when the Spirits by an Acute
or Cronick Diſtemper are worn
out, and almoſt ſpent, the Pulſe
is either <hi>Vermiculans, Formicans</hi>
or <hi>Tremens;</hi> which are ſigns that
Nature is almoſt ſpent, and
ready to yield to the Diſtemper.
I ſay this is evident enough;
it is then beyond Contradiction,
that a healthful Pulſe depends
upon a moderate Quantity of
Animal Spirits, and that they
continually flow into thoſe
Nerves leading to the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Involuntary Motion;
and as their Quantity varies, ſo
more or leſs of the Subtile <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>
is prepared to diſtend the
Fibers of thoſe Muſcles.</p>
            <p>When the Spirits are weak,
or almoſt ſpent, there muſt
needs flow a leſs quantity into
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43306:50"/>
the <hi>Glandules;</hi> and when they
are exalted, a greater; and if
Extremes either fruſtrate Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or cauſe Preternatural Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
we may not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that Natural Actions
are performed by a moderate
Quantity, but from hence we
may bring good Arguments for
a further proof and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Hypotheſis about
Voluntary Motion.</p>
            <p>Since I have ſaid, that the
Spirits,<note place="margin">How it comes to paſs, that the Syſtole of the Heart, is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ſuch frequent Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoles.</note> by Reaſon
of a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the Pores,
flow continually in
a juſt Quantity;
and that theſe Pores
are not ſubject to be Dilated
or Contracted according to our
Appetite; it remains, that I
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43306:50"/>
ſhould ſhew how it comes to
paſs, that the Syſtole of the
Heart is interrupted with ſuch
conſtant Diaſtoles; whereas,
when the Pores ſerving to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Contractions are open,
ſo as to convey a ſufficient
quantity of Spirits, the Motion
is continual and without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of the Difference
will eaſily appear, if we do but
take Notice, how when a Vein
is opened, the Blood runs out
continually, without ceaſing or
intermiſſion; but if an Artery
be opened, it guſhes out with
Intermiſſions anſwerable to the
Diaſtoles of the Heart: becauſe
the Veins are always as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ciſtern, diſtended with
Blood; and before they can be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43306:51"/>
emptied with a ſmall Orifice,
they are filled by the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
but the Blood being
continually received by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the Veins, and
thoſe Extremities being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Valves, to hinder it from
Regurgitation; the Arteries are
always kept more lank and
empty, and are not as the Veins
diſtended with Superfluous
Blood: So that it only flows
out of them, when they are
diſtended upon violent Syſtoles
of the Heart.</p>
            <p>In like manner, that part
of the Brain that furniſhes the
Nerves ſerving to Voluntary
Motion with Spirits, is like a
common Ciſtern full of Spirits;
and when Vent is given (the
Pores being opened according
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43306:51"/>
to our Appetite,) the Spirits
are thruſt forth in one conſtant
courſe: But the Muſcles ſerving
to Involuntary Motion, being
in continual Action, do ſo drain
their Store-houſe, as to keep it
more flaccid and empty; ſo that
the Animal Spirits, as they are
prepared, are continually wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
through their proper Pores;
and as one Wave follows ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo one Contraction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
ſucceeds, the <hi>Subtile
Liquor</hi> being according to the
ſame Rules prepared in the
<hi>Glands,</hi> and thruſt out through
the Fibers.</p>
            <p>Some of the Muſcles deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Involuntary Motion, are,
in ſome meaſure, ſubject to our
Will, ſo that it lies in our power
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43306:52"/>
to retardate or quicken the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of their Contractions,
but not totally to obſtruct or
hinder them; as the Muſcles
ſerving to Reſpiration: The
Reaſon of which is this.</p>
            <p>The Pores of the Brain lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Nerves, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
Spirits to theſe
Muſcles,<note place="margin">Why the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles ſerving to Reſpiration, are ſubject in ſome meaſure to our Appetite.</note> are ſo fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Spirits to them,
as to the other
Muſcles ſerving to Involuntary
Motion, in a competent Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
but theſe Pores differ
from thoſe, for as much as theſe
have ſuch an Organick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to contract or dilate
according to our Appetite, we
can by a conſtriction cloſe up
theſe, ſo as to deny a Paſſage
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43306:52"/>
for Animal Spirits, ſufficient
to prepare a quantity of the
<hi>Subtile Liquor</hi> to cauſe due
Contractions of the Muſcles;
till by degrees they increaſe to
ſuch a great Quantity, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend
their Receptacles ſo long,
that thoſe are no longer capable
of receiving more; till that force
which drives them violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Receptacles overcomes
the conſtrictive Faculty of the
Pores; and then the Spirits, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Will, break forth, and
flow violently into the Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Glands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſily noted, that after
we have holden our Breath a
long time, the firſt Contractions
are as if Two or Three were
joyned together without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
I mean ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43306:53"/>
which is ſufficient to
prove what I have ſaid of the
Muſcles ſerving to Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For when by a Conſtriction
of the Pores, the Spirits which
ought to flow out, are kept
in, and heaped up in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle,
and Two or Three
Contractions are by that means
hindered, that Receptacle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
like a common Ciſtern;
and as ſoon as the Pores are
forced open, the Spirits run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out, cauſe long continued
Contractions, till that ſtore is
ſpent, and then they wave
through, as before the Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>What I have hitherto ſaid,
might be ſufficient to prove my
Hypotheſis reaſonable; but to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43306:53"/>
illuſtrate it a little more, I ſhall
explain ſome of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
about Muſcular Motion, and give
ſufficient Reaſons for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to my Hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>Common Experience tells us,
that Old People,<note place="margin">Why old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſubject to a trembling of their Head or Hands.</note>
whoſe Spirits are
flat and weak, are
moſt uſually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to a Trembling
of their Head or Hands; the
Reaſon of which is this: The
Fermentation in the <hi>Glandules</hi>
is too low and weak, and doth
not ſubtilize a ſufficient Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the ſaid Liquor, to keep
the Muſcles in a conſtant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The Reaſon why a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Quantity of Liquor is not
prepared, is plain; for though
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43306:54"/>
their Appetite and Deſire is
ſtrong enough, and endeavours
to open and dilate the Pores of
the Brain; yet when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are weak, it's a ſign few are
ſeparated from the Blood; and
if few be ſeparated, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
flow plentifully into the
Nerves, be the Pores never ſo
wide.</p>
            <p>This confirms the Reaſon I
have given, why the Syſtole of
the Heart is interrupted with
conſtant Diaſtoles: For the
Store-houſe which ſupplies it,
is always kept empty, by reaſon
of the conſtant efflux of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
and in Old People, the
Store-houſe which furniſhes the
Nerves ſerving to Voluntary
Motion with Spirits, is kept
empty; becauſe few Spirits are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43306:54"/>
ſeparated from the Blood; and
as they are ſeparated, they are
continually ſpent by a conſtant
diſtribution of them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Nouriſhment in the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Glands: So that when
the Pores are opened wider for
Voluntary Motion, for want
of a ſufficient Stock, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
flow out in a conſtant and
equal proportion, but as they
are ſeparated, they wave through
thoſe Pores that are moſt ready
to receive them. The Motion
indeed is not interrupted with
ſuch perfect Intermiſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this Store-houſe is not ſo
clearly drein'd; but there is a
perfect Remiſſion, becauſe the
Stock is not ſo copious as in
Young and Luſty People to
yield conſtant Supplies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:43306:55"/>
Moreover, when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are weak, its a ſign that
the Blood is much depaupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and declines from its
Natural ſtate; and then there
is more need for ſtrong Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to raiſe the Fermentation
in the Glands, and to ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the Liquor: Upon which
account, when the Spirits are
weak, the Diſadvantage muſt
needs be the greater.</p>
            <p>Hence may be deduced a
Reaſon, why when our Spirits
are low, and almoſt ſpent,
though our Appetite be ſtrong,
we cannot perform ſtrong A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>From hence it may be proved;
that there is ſomething prepared
in theſe <hi>Glands</hi> by the Animal
Spirits, which is incapable of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43306:55"/>
entring into the Fibers till pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared:
For whether the Spirits
be weak or ſtrong, there is a
ſufficient quantity of <hi>Arterial
juice</hi> laid down in the <hi>Glands,</hi>
tho' its not made capable of
paſſing into the Fibers, but as
it is prepared, accordingly as the
Spirits are more or leſs in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
ſtronger or weaker.</p>
            <p>I have known Women, who
ſeemed healthful,<note place="margin">Another Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note>
and of a Sanguine
Complexion, whoſe
Hands wou'd, when they were
about any Moderate Exerciſe,
Tremble as if Paralytick: For
the Maſs of Blood being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more than uſually depraved,
and degenerated from its Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
and Sulphureous, into a
more crude and Phlegmatick
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43306:56"/>
State, was unapt for Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo that the Animal Spirits
being not able eaſily to prepare
a ſufficient quantity of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Subtile <hi>Liquor,</hi> to keep the
Muſcle in a conſtant Motion,
were forced to do it by an
unequal Influx: juſt as an Horſe,
ſet to draw too great a Burthen,
is forced by many reiterated
draughts to get it forwards.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> Mentions an
Experiment,<note place="margin">A Third.</note> how
by an Injection of
Water into the Crural Arterie,
the Muſcles of the Legs renue
their Contractions. From this
he would infer, that Muſcular
Motion is performed by the
Blood as a Pondus; but tho'
his <hi>Myotomia</hi> Argues, it came
from an Inquiſitive Author, yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43306:56"/>
I rather an fully perſwaded,
that the Blood does not Act as
a Pondus, becauſe this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
pleads againſt it; but to
avoid a long diſpute, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give the Reaſon of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the injection of this
Water, the Branches of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
are full of Blood, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
juice;</hi> and when by the
mixture of the Water with this
<hi>juice,</hi> it is attenuated and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the <hi>Glands,</hi> faſter than
it can be received by the Venous
Channels, the moſt Subtile Part
is by the force of injection, ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Fibers and diſtends
'em ſo as to Contract the Muſcle.</p>
            <p>Perhaps here it will be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that if the Water can thus
paſs through into the Fibers,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43306:57"/>
what need is there that the
Nerves ſhould lay down their
contents in the <hi>Glandules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that the Water is
thin and apter to paſs through
thoſe <hi>Ducts</hi> than the <hi>Arterial
juice,</hi> which is thick and viſcid;
wherefore it is neceſſary, that
the <hi>Nerves</hi> ſhould lay down
their contents there, to Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
and Rariſie this Thick
<hi>juice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſeen People inclining
to a Dropſie,<note place="margin">A Fourth.</note> whoſe
Blood and Serum
was much diluted, could move
much more nimbly, tho'
more ſeebly, than ſome of a
healthful Conſtitution, whoſe
Blood and this <hi>Arterial juice</hi>
was thicker and not ſo much
diluted; which doth plainly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43306:57"/>
ſhew, that the thinner the
Blood is, and the more diluted
the Nutritious juice, the leſs
quantity of Spirits is required
to ſubtilize it, and make it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of paſſing into the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>It may eaſily be obſerved,
that thoſe People
whoſe Spirits are
ſtrong,<note place="margin">A Fifth.</note> and their <hi>Arterial
juice</hi> very thin, are Nimble;
but the Contractions of their
Muſcles are not ſo durable,
as of thoſe, whoſe Serum is
of a thicker Conſiſtence: For
tho' in the former more of the
Subtile <hi>Liquor</hi> is prepared, yet
by Reaſon of its Tenuity it's
ſooner receiv'd, and carried off
by the <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> which
makes the Contraction ſhorter,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43306:58"/>
Thoſe whoſe Blood abounds
with fixed Salts &amp;
Phlegmatick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,<note place="margin">A Sixth.</note>
which too much dull
and reſiſt the Activity of the
Animal Spirits, are always ſlow
and unapt for Motion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if the Blood Acted as a

nimble and ſtrong; becauſe
the thicker the Blood is the
heavier would be the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</p>
            <p>As Muſcular Motion is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways vitiated, by the fault
of the <hi>Arterial juice,</hi> or of the
Spirits, and conſequently by
the Diſtemperature of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<hi>Liquor;</hi> ſo it is very often
depraved, and accordingly as
the Maſs of Blood degenerates
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43306:58"/>
from its genuine and proper

the Maſs of Blood is viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.
The Animal Spirits
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43306:59"/>
meeting with this vitious Salt,
and fermenting in the <hi>Glands,</hi>
do there cauſe irregular Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of matter, into the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Fibers, ſubtilized in that
Fermentation; whence follow
irregular Contractions of the
Muſcles.</p>
            <p>Why Convulſive Paroxyſms
come at uncertain times, will
eaſily appear, if we do but
conſider the Procatartick Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
amongſt which I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention two, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Quantity of Morbiſick matter
irritating Nature to an Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it; and ſudden Paſſions
of the Mind.</p>
            <p>The Quantity of Morbiſick
matter is far greater in ſome
Bodies than in others, before
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43306:59"/>
the Spirits are able to recover
themſelves, and to endeavour an
Expulſion of it: In the former
Caſe, Convulſions are Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
and ſeiſe the whole Body;
in the Latter Particular, the
Morbiſick matter being acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
driven more on one
Part than another. Again in
ſome Bodies it is ſooner hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up, being generated in
greater quantities.</p>
            <p>The Matter heaped up, at
the firſt is very crude and thick,
and although it be caſt forth
into, and Circulates through,
the Muſculous parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
Ferments with the
Spirits in the <hi>Glandules;</hi> yet
becauſe it is not ſufficiently
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43306:60"/>
attenuated to be driven forth
into the fleſhy Fibers, till by
frequent Circulations and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
it is exalted from
it's ſtate of ſixedneſs to a more
Volatile, no Convulſions ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
Moreover as long as it
continues in its ſtate of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
the Animal Spirits are
much dulled and their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
quaſhed by mixing with
it, but it being at the length
ſubtilized and rarified by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Circulations, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits recovering 'em ſelves,
and violently Fermenting with
it in the <hi>Glands</hi> carry this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<hi>juice</hi> exploſively into the
Fibers. The Reaſon why this
Motion is Involuntary, is, be
cauſe it is not produced by a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43306:60"/>
greater quantity of Spirits flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Brain, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the Pores are dilated by
our Appetite, but by a mixture
of Morbifick and Fermentitious
Particles, which cauſe Preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Fermentations &amp; Expulſions
of Matter Attenuated thereby.</p>
            <p>Convulſive ſits are ſometimes
brought on, before the Morbifick
matter gradually arrives at
this ſtate of tenuity, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſudden Paſſions of the Mind,
the Animal Faculties quit
their Stations, and being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
by external Objects can
no longer moderate the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the Animal Spirits.
The Formal Cauſe of the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Emanations of the Spirits
in theſe Convulſions is this; the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43306:61"/>
Pores of the Brain being ſhut up,
to keep out external Objects, heap
up the Spirits, till by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their quantity, the Pores
can no longer retain them; and
then the Spirits ruſh out <hi>quà
datur portà</hi> in a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and violently ſetting upon
the Crude <hi>juice,</hi> which they
meet with in the <hi>Glandules,</hi>
ſtrongly Ferment Attenuate and
carry it forth into the Fibers, of
the Muſcles wherein the Spirits
are thus accidentally laid down:
The Brain being thus emptied, the
Pores are ſhut up again, till the
quantity of Spirits make way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and ſo ſucceſſively follow
Convulſive Motions, in this or
that Part where-ever the Spirits
ſet upon the Crude Morbiſick

People, whoſe Blood is rather
of a Vitriolick Tenacious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

and impregnated with

that by reaſon of the Viſcidity

            <p>In the Cramp, the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

from that which is
Natural,<note place="margin">Of the Cramp.</note> or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Convulſive Motions; that
which is Natural, being cauſed
by the Animal Spirits preparing
a Subtil and Homogenious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor:
In other Convulſions the
Animal Spirits ferment with,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43306:63"/>
and endeavour to ſubdue a
Morbiſick Humour brought and
layed down by the Arteries,
and the Matter thus attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is accidentally forced into
the Fibers: But theſe are cauſed
by the continual Conflict of the
Volatile Animal Spirits, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fermenting with Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Elaſtick Particles of
another Nature, ſupplied by
the Maſs of Blood; where
both ſtriving to ſubdue each
other, the Elaſtick Particles of
the Blood, more ſtrongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and the Spirits them, by a
contrary agitation and inteſtine
Motion of their Particles; and
theſe Two being violently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded,

out of the Brain, and
raiſe the Fermentation in the

becauſe it is ſo very thin, eaſily

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of a</hi> Spaſmus Cynicus.</note>
which ſeems
more evidently to
prove, that Muſcular Motion
depends on the greater influx
of Animal Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> Why
the Contraction of one Muſcle
followeth, when the Antagoniſt
becomes Paralytick, as in <hi>Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Cynicus:</hi> The Branches of
the Nerves being derived from
the Brain, when the Influx of
the Spirits into the Muſcles of
the one ſide are hindered, they
regurgitate, and are driven
preſently in a greater quantity
into the Antagoniſt; as by
the Loſs of one Eye, the other,
by a greater Influx of Spirits,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43306:64"/>
becomes more Acute: This is
evident, and needs no further
proof.</p>
            <p>Thus I have laid down my
Hypotheſis of the Formal and
Efficient Cauſes of Muſcular
Motion, and how it is vitiated
or depraved; which I the more
willingly commit to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Enormous Motions and
Impoſſibilities, which uſually
