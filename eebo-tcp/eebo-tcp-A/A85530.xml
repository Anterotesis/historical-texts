            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this preſent evill world, the deareſt of God's Saints are often militant (in a warfaring conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on often;) and whiles here they are, alwayes itinerant (in a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring condition alwayes.)</p>
            <p>They have Enemies enough, and ſtrangers are they unto all that are not right to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123370:4"/>
Heaven-wards, that are open ſinners, or but preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Saints.</p>
            <p>They are hated by many, and not owned by the moſt; perſecuted by not a few, deſerted (in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame wants) almoſt by every one, by all, ſure in whoſe hearts Chriſt dwelleth not by faith <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 3. 17.</note>; So this Apoſtolicall exhortation is needfull for their conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that they take none offence at the Croſſe of Chriſt, but that they cloſely buckle themſelves to be with him crucified, and ſoundly animated, perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to deny their owne ſelves, to take up their owne croſſe daily, and ſo chearfully and undantedly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 9. 23.</note>, even unto death and in death to be his couragious and moſt conſtant Followers.</p>
            <p>I called this Text an Exhortation; I may fitly call it a chaine of Exhortations, of ſutable and ſeaſonable Exhortations, and all of them cloſed up in a pithy apprecation.</p>
            <p>The firſt Exhortation is to the perpetuity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; the next to the moderate behaving a mans ſelfe in all occurrences.</p>
            <p>The laſt, to a dependency upon God amidſt the throngs of whatever cares the world preſſeth us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and enforceth continually upon us, to make us forgetfull of our God.</p>
            <p>We are thus to the perpetuity of rejoycing, by our holy Apoſtle exhorted, and the Exhortation (to worke us ſeriouſly unto it) is redoubled, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, and againe I ſay Rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The againe and againe rejoycing, is the Chriſtian rejoycing, the rejoycing it is in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Worldlings rejoycings are in their vanities, ever
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123370:4"/>
with vexations accompanied; mad rejoycings are they, ever ending in horrour: <hi>I have ſaid of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what doth it</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eccleſ. 2. 2</note>.</p>
            <p>Mad laughter and prophane mirth, doth it knoweth not what.</p>
            <p>Chriſts woe is thereon; <hi>Woe unto you that now laugh, for yee ſhall mourne and weep</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 6. 25.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Extremum gaudij luctus occupat,</hi> all rejoycing out of Chriſt is wound up in mourning, and that mourning ſhall have no ending, nor ſhall any of the teares thereof be put up into the Lords bottels.</p>
            <p>The right rejoycing (that ſhall be an evermore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing) is the rejoycing in the Lord: That our names are written in the book of Life, is the very life of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 10. 20</note>.</p>
            <p>All other rejoycing is but madneſſe, it is groundleſſe altogether; it knoweth not what it doth, it doth what it cannot know, that it ſhall have Gods approbation; nay if it reflect upon Gods revealings, cannot but know, that reprobation will thereof be the diſmall concluſion.</p>
            <p>But the Chriſtian rejoycing, is an evermore rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> is our Apoſtles expreſſion <note n="f" place="margin">Theſ. 5. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the hope of the glory of God is their rejoycing, that have in their hearts this aſſurance by faith, that their names are in the records of Heaven indelibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred.</p>
            <p>In the hope of the glory of God is their rejoycing <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note>.</p>
            <p>And not onely ſo, the Apoſtle addes further, in the three annexed verſes; but we (the rejoycers in the Lord) glory in tribulations (not onely rejoyce, but even glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in them) as knowing that tribulation worketh pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and patience experience, and experience hope, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123370:5"/>
hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us.</p>
            <p>You here may cleerly ſee the wide difference now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the rejoycings of ſinners and of Saints, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane worldlings, and of religious Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The one is deceitfull, vaniſhing, periſhing and in perdition enwrapping; the other fixed, eternall, happy making, and ſo continuing in thoſe in whom it takes place, being in proſperity and adverſity ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>Plenties ſwell it not up, neither wants caſt it downe, calme times never make it forgetfull of God, nor tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults deterre them from the conſtant ſervice of God, in whom God works it by the Miniſters of his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing.</p>
            <p>This <hi>rejoycing in the Lord alway,</hi> this <hi>againe and again rejoycing,</hi> is the joy in the holy Ghoſt; it is that glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that ſweet, that comfortable motion of the heart by the Spirit of Adoption, ſtirred up in the elect Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Saints of God, upon the feeling of Gods love to them-wards in Jeſus Chriſt, as the forerunner and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the life eternally happy. Both in earthly and ſpirituall bleſſings have we the tokens of Gods love to us-wards in Chriſt, eſpecially in the ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Kingdome of God is righteouſneſſe and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> writes our Apoſtle <note n="h" place="margin">Ro. 14. 17.</note>.</p>
            <p>When Chriſts joy remains in us, our joy becomes the Full joy <note n="i" place="margin">Joh. 15. 11.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is the joy unſpeakable, the glorious joy, ſo by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſtiled <note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note>: and fitly, becauſe of Heavens Kingdome, it is a maine part.</p>
            <p>With all joy and peace through beleeving, are the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ſelected ones of God filled <note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 15. 13.</note>.</p>

            <p>This were a fit bough alwayes to be chirping on; but our Text is a Tree of many boughs and branches, and gladly bird-like, would I be upon them all in this one Houre.</p>
            <p>To the next then doe I ſwiftly betake me, and that is Moderation, <hi>Let your Moderation be knowne to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtian moderation is the bridler in of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the bounder of our paſſions, throughout our converſation among men of all ranks and humours.</p>

            <p>A four-fold exemplification of Gods preſence in mens troubles, and of his reſcuing them graciouſly thereout, is in that Pſalme diſtinctly ſpecified.</p>

            <p>The Churches deliverances by her Saviour the Lord Jeſus, ſhould often be revolved in our thoughts, and all the yeer (yea all our yeers on Earth) ſhould be a Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe in this regard, a feſtivall, continuated and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated rejoycingly.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt, before he was exhibited to the World in the fleſh, was once promiſed, and often re-promiſed, and our Forefathers in the faith thereby ſuſtained in their longings for him and expectations of him; ſo after his manifeſtation in our nature, and finiſhing the work of our Redemption therein: Firſt he gave direction for the Faith Chriſtian, by the Apoſtles and their cloſe Succeſſors; and afterwards, when Hereſies and Sciſmes had tainted the ſame, he againe reformed it, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth that bleſſed Reformation.</p>
            <p>I have here before me a world of matter, but I muſt take up and ſpeed me to the next Bough, largely diſpread and into many branches diſtinguiſhed: <hi>Be carefull for</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be carefull for nothing.</hi>) A double carefulneſſe we read of, a carefulneſſe forbidden, and an enjoyned care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
            <p>This latter is a taking thought, both in what and how we may approve our ſelves unto, and in our perſons and whole deportment on earth pleaſe our good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father which is in Heaven, wherein his Sonne our redeeming Lord he hath prepared the Manſions of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for us, after our pilgrimage in this vale of miſery.</p>
            <p>By doing the will of our Father, as in his Word he hath revealed the ſame to us, is this care taken, and by us conſcionably performed.</p>
            <p>This is to us recommended in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11</note>, <hi>The ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing after a godly ſort, what carefulneſſe hath it wrought in you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This carefulneſſe is a ſtudiouſneſſe to avoyd the track of ſinne and ſinners, and a cloſeneſſe of adherence unto God in a way of holineſſe that leadeth to happineſſe.</p>
            <p>When we take due thought for the welfare of our owne ſoules, and for the drawing of others with us on to God, this way are we carefull, and God accepteth of us in Chriſt, and highly approveth us.</p>
            <p>Yea, a moderate carefulneſſe for the things of this life, without diſtruſtfulneſſe in God, is both good and commendable; but when our Apoſtle chargeth us to take care for nothing, it is Anxiouſneſſe he points at, and diſſwades from.</p>
            <p>This is interpreted by that of our provident Lord; <hi>Care not for to morrow</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 6. 34.</note>, our faith on Gods Providence muſt caſt diffidence out of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:123370:9"/>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> thus expreſſeth it; <hi>caſt all your care upon God, for he careth for you</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>Where the word <hi>All</hi> is emphaticall, and very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive.</p>
            <p>It is not ſufficient for a right Chriſtian, to caſt this care, or that care, or the other on God.</p>
            <p>Nothing muſt excrutiate us who have God for a Provider.</p>
            <p>It may fall out that the very lighteſt cares may ſo preſſe us downe, that we may become unfit to undergoe the very leſt burden of our calings, as not the greateſt can be too heavy for us, when the whole load of our cares are on God, the perpetuall care and provider for us.</p>
            <p>And in the word <hi>Caſt</hi> likewiſe, an intimation is there worthy our cloſeſt obſervation.</p>
            <p>It ſignifies, that we ſhould rouſe up what perplexeth us, and roule it all on God.</p>
            <p>Be we rid of Anxieties, as for us over-maſterfull; but no burden is over-heavy for his Shoulders.</p>
            <p>And how ſhall we caſt all our cares on God? by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our requeſts be made knowne to God.</p>
            <p>God is ready to free us of our cares, and to take the charge both of our perſons, and of what concerns us for good; but he will be requeſted of us, and then ſhall we be under his wings for ſhelter and for ſafety. It is not to informe God that we put up requeſts to God; no, he knowes our thoughts afarre off, he knoweth them ere they ariſe in us, knowes them ere we can mold them up into requeſts, and ſo put them up unto the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>It is not ſimply for the manifeſting of them to God, but to obtaine Gods approbation of them, and of us for them.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Requeſts made knowne to God are ſuch, as God by effects makes it knowne, that he hath with approbation admitted them.</p>

our gracious Lord hath taught us, to put up affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately unto thee.</p>
            <p>And now from the Apoſtles Exhortations to various duties, which (in a plaine way) we have explained; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we in the laſt place, to the Apoſtles cloſing up of all with a right ſutable apprecation; <hi>and the peaco of God which paſſeth all under standing ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly &amp; cloſely open this, &amp; leave it with you as an hearty farewell of your worn-out Paſtour, whoſe prayer ever ſhall be for your thriving to Heaven-wards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The peace of God</hi> was the Apoſtles apprecation to his <hi>Phillipians,</hi> and is mine to you; once mine, but now left to your owne choice of a Preacher, and God fit you with one that may fit you for God.</p>
            <p>By the peace of God (in this paſſage) conceive that peace which God worketh in beleeving conſciences, as an effect of the Goſpell to them ſincerely preached.</p>
            <p>My ſoule aſſures me, that I never delivered any thing from this Pulpit that was unſound, untrue; never hucſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Word of God to the humouring of any, for by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends of mine owne, never hood-winked any Pariſhoner by forged interpretations, raked out either of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Dung-hils of <hi>Amſterdum;</hi> otherwiſe (even of a child from my beleeving Parents, ſoundly Proteſtant) learned I Chriſt, and both in truth and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe have ſo taught him.</p>
            <p>And this Teſtimony of mine owne conſcience (on it ſelfe ſeriouſly reflecting) is to me as thouſands of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: God ſo deale with my ſoule, as I have been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to you-wards (in the whole courſe of my Miniſtery among you) for the ſolid good of your ſoules: And now my prayer is for you, that the peace of God may ſettle
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123370:12"/>
in you; onely that peace is the peace ſurpaſſing, a peace that hath no bounds, no termination, no expiration.</p>
            <p>The peace it is the onely peace that paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>The World conceives the Godly to have no peace, but the godly know that the wicked World hath none, no not when it is at the quieteſt; we have it from him that had it immediately from God (<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Evangelicall, or propheticall Evangeliſt) <hi>There is no peace (ſaith my God) to the wicked;</hi> and in that one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet we find it twice recorded <note n="b" place="margin">chap. 48. 22 &amp; 57. 21.</note>.</p>
            <p>And he addes this compariſon to ſet it forth to the very full; Sea-like the wicked cannot reſt; when any winds trouble them, their waters caſt up mire and dirt, and with their fulſomneſſe and noyſomneſſe, not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is there any where that ſtinks not of them; yet even in their diſturbances, a peace there is in godly conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, a peace paſſing the capacity of worldly mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, a ſetled and a ſetling peace.</p>
            <p>And no mervail, for it keepeth their hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Liſten unto the legacy of Chriſts bequeathing.</p>
            <p>The Hearts keeper it is, and the minds keeper, and both in the right temper of un-diſturbed tranquility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you; let not your heart be troubled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it be afraid</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 14. 27</note>.</p>
            <p>The peace of the world is like the world, fickle; now on, ſoone againe quite off, ever giddy never ſteady: <hi>The children of men are deceitfull upon the weights, light as vanity, yea then vanity it ſelfe lighter</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 62. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>And wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> (the Sonne of religious <hi>David</hi>) proves throughout his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> that book of proofes by him experienced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:123370:12"/>But the Peace of God through Jeſus Chriſt, or that peace we have bequeathed us from Chriſt is ſuch a peace, which as the world cannot give us, ſo it cannot take the ſame from us: Our Peace-maker is the ſecurer of the peace we have from him; our hearts and minds are in ſafe cuſtody thereby. Out of Satans reach they are, and above the malice of every ſatanically-minded and handed wretch (yea and tongued too) in both ſexes. We may have our good names by ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſneſſe blemiſhed, our eſtates by the violence of plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ruined, our temporary lives by the bloodineſſe of war or by any manner of diſeaſe (peſtilentiall or otherwiſe) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us; but the peace made between the God of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and our beleeving ſouls is altogether unbereavable.</p>
            <p>Hel! gates cannot there be prevalent, where Gods pardon and peace are entred; and where in the blood of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are ſealed (by the ſpirit of Chriſt) to the day of full Redemption. I ſhall now referre you to the preſent cloſe peruſall (and to the practicall uſe, whiles you have a day on earth to live) of that 91 Pſalm, It begins thus, <hi>He that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the ſecret place of the moſt high ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty:</hi> and it thus concludes, <hi>he ſhall call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me and I will anſwer him, with long life will I ſatisfie him, and ſhew him my ſalvation.</hi> Here (and in the reſt of that Pſalm) is the peace of God diſplayed, a peace paſſing the underſtanding of naturall men, as not at all therewith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted a peace keeping the hearts and minds of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in an heavenly temper, and filling them with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable &amp; full of glory <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The Kingdom of God is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ro. 14. 17.</note>. And our Saviour tels us that this Kingdom is within us <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 12 11.</note>. A Kingdom it is that comes not with obſervation, loe, it is here, or, loe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> there, is but frivolous diſcourſe: for behold the Kingdom of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, it conſiſteth (as formerly you heard from St. <hi>Paul</hi>)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123370:13"/>
in righteouſneſſe, peace &amp; joy in the holy Ghoſt, all within all in the hearts of beleevers. When Jeſus Chriſt dwels in the heart by faith (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> averreth he doth <note n="h" place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 17.</note>) &amp; every Beleever knoweth it) there is rejoycing in the Lord, there is the unſtinted expreſſion of Moderation, there is the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Lords aſſiſſance, there is a caſting on God the care of our welfare in a perpetuated laying downe of our requeſts before him in prayer, ſupplication, thankſgiving, and there the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding keeps through Jeſus Chriſt the hearts and minds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. I hope what I have at this time delivered is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtood, and my prayer is that it may particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be derived into practiſe. If wirh this reſolution you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Lords Table, my hope is (and my prayer ſeconds it) that you will (hence-forward) prove thriving Chriſtians, that you will grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt <note n="i" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18.</note>. Not to goe forward in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is to goe backward, is to pull downe what formerly we have built up; is to end in the fleſh, although we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the ſpirit. And from any ſuch courſe the Lord divert us all, and make our wils plyable to his will in all things, to his glory in our ſalvation. The Lord evermore bleſſe you and evermore keep you all; the Lord make his face to ſhine perpetually upon you all &amp; unto you all, &amp; to all your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity be unſtintedly gracious; the Lord lift up his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon you all, &amp; give you al his peace that paſſeth all underſtanding, to the keeping of all your hearts and minds in all integrity through Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, to whom (with thee; O Father, &amp; the holy Ghoſt, from you both our comforter, three Perſons, one very God) b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
