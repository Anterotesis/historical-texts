            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>SOON after the Acceſſion of His Preſent Majeſty, with his late Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of bleſſed Memory, to the Imperial Crown of this Kingdom, was the Firſt Part of the above-mentioned Treatiſe publiſhed: Of which, poſſibly, the leſs notice has been taken; becauſe the <hi>Writers</hi> againſt <hi>this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> have thought it more prudent to enter the Liſts with them who grant their Premiſes, than with one who diſputes every Inch of Ground with 'em; nor fears to deny Principles long receiv'd, when he can trace 'em to their corrupted Fountains.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> having been ſome time ſince diſpoſed of, and the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> being ready for the Preſs, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker</hi> intends to have the two Firſt Printed together by the End of the next <hi>Eaſter-Term</hi> at the fartheſt; and the Laſt by the Beginning of the next <hi>Michaelmas-Term;</hi> with an exact Index to the Whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45190:2"/>
The Firſt Part, among other things, ſhews;</p>
            <p n="1">I. That this Kingdom was founded in <hi>Contract;</hi> and explains that <hi>Contract,</hi> with its Natural and Legal Conſequences.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Gives an Impartial Repreſentation of the Publick Acts of the <hi>People of England,</hi> in Aſſertion of what they held to be their Right: and more particularly, of the <hi>Barons</hi> Wars in the Reigns of King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Inſtances are brought of the Claim, and Exerciſe of the like Powers, by other Deſcendants from the <hi>Old Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Antiquity and Power of thoſe <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People, <hi>Earls Palatine, Lords High-Conſtable, High-Steward,</hi> and <hi>Earls Marſhal,</hi> are touch'd upon.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Many Arguments are brought to evince, that this <hi>Monarchy</hi> is, in ſome ſort, <hi>Elective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. An Account is given of the Titles of <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of <hi>H.</hi> 8's various <hi>Settlements</hi> of the Crown, and the Effects of 'em, in relation to the Queens <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to King <hi>J.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The Antient Authority of <hi>Conventions</hi> of the <hi>States</hi> of the Realm, is vindicated.</p>
            <p>The Second and Third Books prove at large, That <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Baſtard,</hi> as his own Charters ſtile him, was in no Senſe (now commonly received) a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> either at his firſt Entrance, or after; nor ever pretended to it, or acted like a <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein what has been urg'd by Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> and the Author of <hi>Elementa Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> (ſince publiſhed under the Title of <hi>Vindiciae Regiae)</hi> with other late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to prove their Title to <hi>Slavery,</hi> is fully conſidered and refuted.</p>
            <p>Particularly, in the Second Book, it is ſhewn;</p>
            <p n="1">I. That <hi>William</hi> 1. being qualified for an <hi>Election,</hi> was, in the Life-time of <hi>Edward the Conſeſſor,</hi> choſen to ſucceed him; and that <hi>duly,</hi> according to the Law of Succeſſion to the <hi>Engliſh Hereditary Monarchy:</hi> The <hi>Foundation</hi> of which, is prov'd to have been laid by the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> King <hi>Ina, Anno</hi> 699, more truly than by <hi>Egbert, Anno</hi> 800.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Law of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and Nature of the <hi>Inheritance</hi> in the <hi>Crown of this Realm,</hi> is ſhewn, and explain'd, by a Law paſs'd in a <hi>General Council</hi> of this Nation, prior to the Fixation of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> though ſubſequent to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it; By King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Will; the <hi>Rituals</hi> for the <hi>Coronations</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Race; and by undoubted Records, and the moſt antient Hiſtories and Law-Books.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Caſe of the Mortgage in Fee, to the late <hi>Bankers,</hi> of part of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Crown, is impartially conſidered.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It is ſhewn, That <hi>W.</hi> 1. did not by his Victory over <hi>Harold,</hi> or others, break the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. That he was, in a proper Senſe, <hi>choſen</hi> by the <hi>People of</hi> England, as well after his Landing, as before: and truly made a <hi>Contract</hi> with 'em both before, and at his <hi>Coronation;</hi> and renew'd that <hi>Contract</hi> more than once.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. From comparing his <hi>Real Title</hi> with the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> of <hi>Harold,</hi> occaſion is taken to ſet the Controverſy about King <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> in its true Light.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That Property was, throughout the Reign of <hi>W.</hi> 1. preſerv'd upon the Saxon Bottom, is demonſtrated from <hi>Doomſday-Book,</hi> that great Record of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45190:2"/>
Reign, yet to be ſeen in the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> from ſome of his Charters and Writs; and the beſt Writers of, and neareſt, thoſe Times.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The ſame is confirm'd from the large Omiſſions out of the Entries in <hi>Doomſday-Book:</hi> Which Omiſſions are ſhewn to have been greater, and upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grounds, than Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> and others have ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Upon examining the Liſts of Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> or holding of the Crown in <hi>Chief,</hi> enter'd in <hi>Doomſday-Book,</hi> within three Counties near <hi>London;</hi> it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably concluded, that the Majority of <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>Chief,</hi> throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were <hi>Saxons,</hi> and others, ſettled here before the Time of <hi>W.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="10">X. It is ſhewn, by the Liſt of the King's Tenants in the three Ridings of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> that in Parts of the Kingdom remote from <hi>London,</hi> few of the Owners of Land are to be thought <hi>Normans,</hi> or other Followers of <hi>W.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. It is ſhewn, That many of the Engliſh Saxons were Barons throughout his Reign; that ſome continued in great Offices both in Church and State; and were Witneſſes to his Charters paſs'd in <hi>Parliament</hi> or elſewhere; longer than they who argue for a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> will allow.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. That Engliſh Saxons continued <hi>Earls</hi> for ſome Years after his Entrance; nor did he take Life or Honour from any one of 'em, without legal Trial.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. That <hi>Counties Palatine</hi> were held by the Saxon Right of Succeſſion.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. An Account is given of ſeveral Saxon Families, which continued conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable all his Reign, and long after.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. It is ſhewn by particular Inſtances, and by way of Supplement to Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s ingenious Book on this Subject; That the general and tragical Expreſſions of ſome of the old Monks concerning his Reign, are to be taken with Limitations.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. It is made evident, That the Saxon Law was the receiv'd Rule of his Government: nor was any Change of that Law made in his Time by Parliament, or otherwiſe, to the Prejudice of the Engliſh Nation.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. That he made no Alteration as to the Form, or Power, of the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Third Book, it is ſhewn;</p>
            <p n="1">I. That neither <hi>W.</hi> 1. nor any of his Succeſſors, made any general Laws, without the Conſent and Authority of the <hi>Great Council,</hi> or <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that the Pretence to a Legiſlative Power, without ſuch Conſent and Authority, was always fatal to the Pretenders.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That neither he, nor any of his Succeſſors for many Deſcents, ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by their ſole Authority, to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Statute Law;</hi> and that the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> of more Modern Times, have been under conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> has given bounds to the <hi>Pardoning Power;</hi> and that no <hi>Pardon,</hi> unleſs paſs'd or ratified in <hi>Parliament,</hi> can <hi>defeat</hi> an <hi>Impeachment;</hi> or qualify one to be a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> whom the Law had diſabled.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the Supream <hi>Judicial Power,</hi> under the <hi>King,</hi> both <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> has reſided with the Peers of the Realm: that their <hi>ordinary</hi> Power, ſuch as us'd to be exercis'd out of Parliament, is diſcontinued; but the <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> remains; with ſome Limitations, occaſioned by their Modern Practice in ſome Caſes, and Deſuetude in others.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the Law of the Kingdom, as well as the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> limits the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Lords</hi> to Caſes not <hi>Capital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45190:3"/>
VI. That the Lives of the Subjects were never at the abſolute Diſpoſal of the <hi>Prince,</hi> in Times of Peace or War. And as the Equality of the Trials of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners</hi> has been preſerv'd from before the Reign of <hi>W.</hi> 1. to this day; ſo was that of <hi>Peers,</hi> till the <hi>Trial</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> by a cull'd Number of Peers, in the Time of <hi>H.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. An Account is given of the Antiquity and Diſtinctions of the <hi>Baronage,</hi> or <hi>Barnage,</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. It is made evident, againſt all Objections, that the <hi>Commons</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, from the Beginning of this <hi>Monarchy, eſſential,</hi> and very <hi>ſignificant, Members</hi> of the <hi>Great Council,</hi> or <hi>Parliament:</hi> and, for the moſt part, till the latter End of the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Proprietors of Land,</hi> as ſuch, came to the <hi>Great Council,</hi> in their own Perſons.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Boroughs</hi> came by <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> from the Times of their reſpective Erections: and that probable Grounds may be aſſign'd for their having <hi>Repreſentatives;</hi> while the others came in their <hi>Perſonal</hi> Right.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That the <hi>Kings of England</hi> have ſeveral great and uſeful <hi>Prerogatives:</hi> and that Common and Statute-Law have made due Proviſion, for their Safety, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Supply.</p>
