            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur acquaintance with the Author before his death was not long, which I have oft heard you say, you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your great unhappinesse, but within a short time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you knew not well whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to count your selfe more happie in that you once knew him, or unhappy in that upon your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance you so suddenly lost him. This his worke then being to come forth to the censorious eye of the
<pb facs="tcp:8774:4"/>
world, and as the manner usually is to have some Patronage. I have thought good to dedicate it to your selfe; and that for these two reasons especially.</p>
            <p>First, in respect of the sympathy betwixt it, and your studies; Laboures of this nature being usually offered to such persons whose profession is that way setled</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the great love and respect you alwayes shewed to the Author, being indeed a man that would deserve no lesse, humble, void of pride, ever ready to impart his knowledge to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in what kind soever, loving and affecting those that affected learning.</p>
            <p>For these respects then, I offer to you this Worke of your so much honoured friend. I my selfe also (as it is no lesse my duty) for his sake stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to make you hereby some part of a requitall, least I should be found guilty of ingratitude, which is a solecisme in manners, if having so fit an opportunity, I should not expresse to the world some Testimonie of love to you, who so much loved him. I desire then (good Sir) your kind acceptance of it, you knowing so well the ability of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and being also able to judge of a Worke of this
<pb facs="tcp:8774:4"/>
nature, and in that respect the better able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the furie of envious Detractours, of which there are not few. Thus with my best wishes to you, as to my much respected friend, I rest.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>FRiendly Reader, that which is here set forth to thy view, is a Translation out of <hi>Ramus.</hi> Formerly indeed Translated by one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Hood,</hi> but never before set forth with the Demonstrations and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrammes, which being cut before the Authors death, and the Worke it selfe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, the Coppie I having in mine hands, never had thought for the promulgation of it, but that it should have died with its Author, considering no small prejudice usually attends the printing of dead mens Workes, and wee see the times, the world is now all eare and tongue, the most given with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> to little else than to heare and tell newes: And if <hi>Apelles</hi> that skilfull Artist alwayes found somewhat to be amended in those Pictures which he had most curiously drawne; surely much in this Worke might have beene amended if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour had lived to refine it, but in that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the first draught, and that he was prevented by death of a second view, though perused by others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Presse; I was ever unwilling to the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but that I was often and much solicited with
<pb facs="tcp:8774:6"/>
iteration of strong importunity, and so in the end o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled: perswading me from time to time unto it, and that it being finished by the Authour, it was farre better to be published, though with some errours and escapes, than to be onely moths-meat, and so utterly lost. I would have thee, Courteous Reader know, that it is no conceit of the worth of the thing that I should expose the name and credit of the Authour to a publike censure; yet I durst be bold to say, had he lived to have fitted it, and corrected the Presse, the worke would have pointed out the workeman. For I may say, without vaine ostentation, he was a man of worth and note, and there was not that kinde of learning in which he had not some knowledge, but especially for the Easterne tongues, those deepe and profound Studies, in the judgement of the learned, which knew him well, he hath not left his fellow behind him; as his Workes also in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript now extant in the publike Library of the famous Vniversity of Cambridge; do testifie no lesse; for him then being so grave and learned a Divine to meddle with a worke of this nature, he gives thee a reason in his owne following Preface for his principall end and intent of taking this Worke in hand, was not for the deepe and Iudiciall, but for the shallowest skull, the good and profit of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler sort, who as it was in the Latine, were able to get little or no benifite from it. Therefore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the worth of the Authour, and his intent in the Worke. Reade it favourably, and if the faults be not too great, cover them with the mantle of love,
<pb facs="tcp:8774:6"/>
and judge charitably offences unwillingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and doe according to the termes of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as thou wouldest be done unto, but it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying, as <hi>Printers</hi> get Copies for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, so Readers often buy and reade for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and there is no worke so exactly done that can escape the malevolous disposition of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting spirits, to whom I say, as one well, <hi>Facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Read then, and if by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, thou reapest any profit, I have my desire, if not, the fault shall be thine owne, reading haply more to judge and censure, than for any good and benefit which otherwise may be received from it; let but the same mind towards thine owne good possesse thee in reading it, as did the Author in writing it, and there shall be no neede to doubt of thy profit by it.</p>

            <p>TWo things, I feare me, will here be objected against me: The one concerneth my selfe, directly: The other mine Author, and the worke I have taken in hand the translating of him. Concerning my selfe, I suppose, some will aske, Why I being a Divine; should meddle or busie my selfe with these prophane studies? <hi>Geometry</hi> may no way further Divinity, and therefore is no fit study for a Divine? This objection seemeth to smell of Brownisme, that is, of a ranke peevish humour over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing the stomach of some, whereby they are caused to loath all manner of solid learning, yea of true Divinity it selfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not deserve an answer: And this we in our Title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore signified. For we have not taken this paines for Turkes and others, who by the lawes of their profession are bound to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all manner of learning. But if any man shall propose it, as a question, with a desire of satisfaction, we are ready to answer him to the best of our abilitie.

But in what time thinke yau, may a man learne all <hi>Euclide,</hi> and so by him be made skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this Art? By himselfe I know not whether ever or never: And with the helpe of another, although very expert, I will not promise him that hee shall attaine to perfection in many yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Prince of Physicians hath, as they say, in his workes laid out the whole Art of Physicke; but I marvell how long a man should study him alone, and read him over and over, before he should be a good Physician?

too, would all die before he should be able to helpe them, or peradventure ere he should be able to know what they ail'd; and after 30, or 40. yeeres of such his study, I would be very loath to commit my selfe unto him. How much therefore are the students of this noble Science beholding unto those men, who by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, practise, and painefull travells, have shewed them a ready and certaine way through this wildernesse?</p>
            <p>The Elements of <hi>Euclide</hi> they do containe generally the whole art of <hi>Geometry:</hi> But if you will offer to travell thorow them alone, you shall finde them, I will warrant you, Elements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: for there you may walke through the spacious Aire, and over the great and wide sea, and in and about the vaste and arid wildernesse many a day and night, before you shall know where you are. This <hi>Ramus,</hi> my Authour in reading him found to be true; and confesseth himselfe often to have beene at a stand: Often to have lost himselfe: Often to have hitte upon a rocke, when he had thought he had touch'd land.</p>

Yet in what time I cannot warrant thee: For all mens capacity, especially in these Arts, is not alike: All are not a like painefull, industrious, or diligent: All are not of the same ability of body, to be able to continue or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Worke gentle Reader, was in part above 30. yeares since published by M. <hi>Thomas Hood,</hi> a learned man, and loving friend of mine, who teaching these Arts, in the Staplers Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in. Leadenhall London, for the benefit of his Schollers and Auditory, did set out the Elements apart by themselves. The whole at large, with the Diagrammes, and Demonstrations, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> promised, as appeareth in the Preface to that his Worke, at his convenient leysure to send out shortly, after them. This for ought we know or can learne, is not by him or any other perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: And yet are those alone, without these of small use or none to a learner, where a teacher is not alwayes at hand. Wherefore we are bold being (encouraged thereunto by some private friends, and especially by the learned M. <hi>H. Brigges,</hi> professour of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry</hi> in the famous Vniversity of Oxford) to publish this of ours long since finished and ended.</p>
            <p>The usuall termes, whether Latine or Greeke, commonly used by the <hi>Geometers,</hi> we have set downe and expressed in English, as well as we could, as others, writing of this argument in our language, have done before us. These termes, I doubt not, may by some in English otherwise be expressed, but how harsh those termes, may unto Mathematicall eares, at the first appeare, I will not say; and use in short time will make these familiar, and as pleasing to the eare as those possibly may be.</p>
            <p>Our Authour, in the declaration of the Elements hath many passages, which in our judgement doe not make so much for the understanding of the matter in hand, as for the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now <hi>a Measure,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth determine it, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to be measured, is some small thing conceived and set out by the measurer; and of the Geometers it is called <hi>Mensura flamosa,</hi> a knowne measure.

True it is, that beside those, there are some other sorts of measures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially greater ones, taken from other things, yet all of them generally made and defined by those. And because the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and bignesse of men is greater in some places, then it is ordinarily in others, therefore the measures taken from them are greater in some countries, then they are in others.

               <p>These, as I said, are according to diverse countries, where they are used, much different one from another: which difference, in my judgment; ariseth especially out of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Foote, by which generally they are all made, whether they be greater or lesser. For the Hand being as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene taught, the fourth part of the foot whether greater or lesser: And the Ynch, the third part of the hand, whether greater or lesser.</p>
               <p>

Of this diversity therefore, and difference of the foot, in forreine countries, as farre as mine intelligence will informe me, because the place doth invite me, I will here adde these few lines following.

               <p>
                  <hi>Magnitudo,</hi> a Magnitude or Bignesse is the subject a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which Geometry is busied. For every Art hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subject about which it doth employ al his rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: And by this especially they doe differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So the subject of Grammar was speech; of Logicke, reason; of Arithmeticke, numbers; and so now of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry it is a magnitude, all whose kindes, differences and affections, are hereafter to be declared.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A Magnitude is a continuall quantity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Magnitude is <hi>quantitas continua,</hi> a continued, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall quantity. A number is <hi>quantitas discreta,</hi> a disjoined quantity: As one, two, three, foure; doe consist of one, two, three, foure unities, which are disjoyned and severed parts: whereas the parts of a Line, Surface, and Body are contained and continued without any manner of disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, separation, or distinction at all, as by and by shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more plainely appeare. Therefore a Magnitude is here understood to be that whereby every thing to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured is said to bee great: As a Line from hence is said to be long, a Surface broade, a Body solid: Wherefore Length, Breadth, and solidity are Magnitudes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That is</hi> continuum, <hi>continuall, whose parts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or held together by some common bound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This definition of it selfe is somewhat obscure, and to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8774:15"/>
understand onely in a geometricall sense: And it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth especially of the common bounde. For the parts (which here are so called) are nothing in the whole, but in a <hi>potentia</hi> or powre: Neither indeede may the whole magnitude bee conceived, but as it is compact of his parts, which notwithstanding wee may in all places assume or take as conteined and continued with a common bound, which Aristotle nameth a <hi>Common limit</hi>; but <hi>Euclide</hi> a <hi>Common section,</hi> as in a line, is a Point, in a surface, a Line: in a body, a Surface.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A bound is the outmost of a Magnitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Terminus,</hi> a Terme, or Bound is here understood to bee that which doth either bound, limite, or end <hi>actu,</hi> in deede; as in the beginning and end of a magnitude: Or <hi>potentia,</hi> in powre or ability, as when it is the common bound of the continuall magnitude. Neither is the Bound a parte of the bounded magnitude: For the thing bounding is one thing, and the thing bounded is another: For the Bound is one distance, dimension, or degree, inferiour to the thing boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: A Point is the bound of a line, and it is lesse then a line by one degree, because it cannot bee divided, which a line may. A Line is the bound of a surface, and it is also lesse then a surface by one distance or dimension, because it is only length, wheras a surface hath both length and breadth. A Surface is the bound of a body, and it is lesse likewise then it is by one dimension, because it is onely length and breadth, whereas as a body hath both length, breadth, and thickenesse.</p>
               <p>Now every Magnitude <hi>actu,</hi> in deede, is terminate, bounded and finite, yet the geometer doth desire some time to have an infinite line granted him, but no otherwise infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite or farther to bee drawane out then may serve his turne.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:8774:15"/>6. <hi>A Magnitude is both infinitely made, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and cut or divided by those things wherewith it is bounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A line, a surface, and a body are made gemetrically by the motion of a point, line, and surface: Item, they are conteined, continued, and cut or divided by a point, line, and surface. But a Line is bounded by a point: a surface, by a line: And a Body by a surface, as afterward by their severall kindes shall be understood.</p>
               <p>Now that all magnitudes are cut or divided by the same wherewith they are bounded, is conceived out of the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>Continuum,</hi> e. 4. For if the common band to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and couple together the parts of a Line, surface, &amp; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, be a Point, Line, and Surface, it must needes bee that a section or division shall be made by those common bandes: And that to bee dissolved which they did containe and knitt together.</p>

               <p>A Point, as here it is defined, is not naturall and to bee perceived by sense; Because sense onely perceiveth that which is a body; And if there be any thing lesse then other to be perceived by sense, that is called a Point. Wherefore a Point is no Magnitude: But it is onely that which in a Magnitude is conceived and imagined to bee undivisible. And although it be voide of all bignesse or Magnitude, yet is it the beginning of all magnitudes, the beginning I meane <hi>potentiâ,</hi> in powre.</p>

or rationality: Of themselves, Congruity and Adscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the measure of a magnitude is onely by suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at the discretion of the Geometer, to take as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him, whether an ynch, an hand breadth, foote, or any other thing whatsoever, for a measure. Therefore two magnitudes, the one a foote long, the other two foote long, are commensurable; because the magnitude of one foote doth measure them both, the first once, the second twice. But some magnitudes there are which have no common measure, as the Diagony of a quadrate and his side, 116. p. X. <hi>actu,</hi> in deede, are <hi>Asymmetra,</hi> incommensura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And yet they are <hi>potentiâ,</hi> by power, <hi>symmetra,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable, to witt by their quadrates: For the quadrate of the diagony is double to the quadrate of the side.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Rationall Magnitudes are those whose reason may bee expressed by a number of the measure given. Contrariwise they are irrationalls.</hi> 5. d. X.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ratio,</hi> Reason, Rate, or Rationality, what it is our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour (and likewise <hi>Salignacus</hi> have taught us in the first Chapter of the second booke of their Arithmetickes: Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore I referre thee.</p>

               <p>Therefore Irrationall magnitudes, on the contrary, are understood to be such whose reason or rate may not bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by a number or a measure assigned: As the side of the side of a quadrate of 20. foote unto a magnitude of two foote; of which kinde of magnitudes, thirteene sorts are mentioned in the tenth booke of <hi>Euclides Elements</hi>: such are the segments of a right line proportionally cutte, unto the whole line.

               <p>
                  <hi>Congruentia,</hi> Congruency, Agreeablenesse is of two magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, when the first parts of the one doe agree to the first parts of the other, the meane to the meane, the extreames or ends to the ends, and lastly the parts of the one, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to the parts, of the other: so Lines are congruall or agreeable, when the bounding, points of the one, applyed to the bounding points of the other, and the whole lengths to the whole lengthes, doe occupie or fill the same place. So Surfaces doe agree, when the bounding lines, with the bounding lines: And the plots bounded, with the plots bounded doe occupie the same place. Now bodies if they do agree, they do seeme only to agree by their surfaces. And by this kind of congruency do we measure the bodies of all both liquid and dry things, to witt, by filling an equall place. Thus also doe the moniers judge the monies and coines to be equall, by the equall weight of the plates in filling up of an equall place. But here note, that there is nothing that is onely a line, or a surface onely, that is naturall and sensible to the touch, but whatsoever is naturall, and thus to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned is corporeall.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8774:17"/>
Neither is that axiome reciprocall or to be converted; For neither in deede are Congruity and Equality reciprocall or convertible. For a Triangle may bee equall to a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogramme, yet it cannot in all points agree to it: And so to a Circle there is sometimes sought an equall quadrate, although in congruall or not agreeing with it: Because those things which are of the like kinde doe onely agree.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Euclide</hi> at the 3. <hi>d j.</hi> saith that the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities

Now seeing that a Periphery or an hoope line hath neither beginning nor ending, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to bee bounded with points: But when it is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed or made it beginneth at a point, and it endeth at a pointe. Wherefore a Point is the bound of a line, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>actu,</hi> in deed, as in a right line: sometime <hi>potentiâ,</hi> in a possibility, as in a perfect periphery. Yea in very deede, as before was taught in the definition of <hi>continuum,</hi> 4 <hi>e.</hi> all lines, whether they bee right lines, or crooked, are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or continued with points.

of a point. For every magnitude generally is made by a geometricall motion, as was even now taught, and it shall afterward by the severall kindes appeare, how by one motion whole figures are made: How by a conversion, a Circle, Spheare, Cone, and Cylinder: How by multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the base and heighth, rightangled parallelogram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are made.</p>

               <p>This division is taken out of the 4 d j. of <hi>Euclide,</hi> where rectitude or straightnes is attributed to a line, as if from it both surfaces and bodies were to have it. And even so the rectitude of a solid figure, here-after shall be understood by a right line perpendicular from the toppe unto the center of the base. Wherefore rectitude is propper unto a line. And therefore also obliquity or crookednesse, from whence a surface is judged to be right or oblique, and a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy right or oblique.</p>

perpendicular unto a periphery, if falling upon it, it doe reele neither way, but doe ly indifferently betweene either side. And in deede in all respects lines right betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and perpendicular lines are one and the same. And from the perpendicularity of lines, the perpendicularity of surfaces is taken, as hereafter shall appeare.

Hitherto a Line, which of all bignesses is the first and most simple, hath been described: Now followeth a Lineate, the other kinde of magnitude opposed as you see to a line, followeth next in order. <hi>Lineatum</hi> therefore a Lineate, or <hi>Lineamentum,</hi> a Lineament, (as by the authority of our Authour himselfe, the learned <hi>Bernhard Salignacus,</hi> who was his Scholler, hath corrected it) is that Magnitude in which there are lines: Or which is made of lines, or as our Authour here, which is more then long: Therefore lines may be drawne in a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, which is the proper soile or plots of lines: They may also be drawne in a body, as the Diameter in a Prisma: the axis in a spheare; and generally all lines falling from aloft: And therfore <hi>Proclus</hi> maketh some plaine, other solid lines. So Conicall lines, as the Ellipsis, Hyperbole, and Parabole, are called solid lines because they do arise from the cutting of a body</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To a Lineate belongeth an Angle and a Figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The common affections of a Magnitude were to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, cutt, jointly measured, and ascribed: Then of a line to be right, crooked, touch'd, turn'd about, and wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8774:22"/>
All which are in a lineate by meanes of a line. Now the common affections of a Lineate are to bee Angled and Figured. And surely an Angle and a Figure in all Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall businesses doe fill almost both sides of the leafe. And therefore both of them are diligently to be considered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>An Angle is a lineate in the common section of the bounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Angulus superficiarius,</hi> a superficiall Angle, is a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face consisting in the common section of two lines: So <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus solidus,</hi> a solid angle, in the common section of three surfaces at the least.</p>
               <p>[But the learned B. <hi>Salignacus</hi> hath observed, that all angles doe not consist in the common section of the bounds, Because the touching of circles, either one another, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilineal surface doth make an angle without any cutting of the bounds: And therefore he defineth it thus: <hi>Angulus est terminorum inter se invicem inclinantium concursus: An angle is the meeting of bounds, one leaning towards another.</hi>] So
<figure/>
is <hi>a e i.</hi> a superficiall angle: [And such also are the angles <hi>o u y.</hi> and <hi>b c d.</hi>] so is the angle <hi>o.</hi> a solid angle, to witt comprehended of the three surfaces <hi>a e i. i o e.</hi> and <hi>a o e.</hi> Neither may a surface, of 2. dimensions, be bounded with

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Angles homogeneall, are angles of the same kinde, both in respect of their shankes, as also in the maner of meeting of the same: [Heterogeneall, are those which differ one from another in one, or both these conditions.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Therefore this <hi>Homogenia,</hi> or similitude of angles is two-folde, the first is of shanks; the other is of the manner of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the shankes: so rectilineall right angles, are angles homogeneall betweene themselves.

               </p>
               <p>This is drawne out of the 10. e j. For if twice two shanks doe agree, they are not foure, but two shankes, neither are they two equall angles, but one angle. And this is that which <hi>Proclus</hi> speaketh of, at the 4. p j. when hee saith, that a right lined angle is equall to a right lined angle, when one of the shankes of the one put upon one of the shankes of the other, the other two doe agree: when that other shanke fall without, the angle of the out-falling shanke is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: when it falleth within, it is lesser: For there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth; here it is comprehended.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The same Lunular also may bee equall to an obtusangle and Acutangle, as the same argument will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>

All these consectaries are drawne out of that same axiome of congruity, to witt out of the 10. e j. as <hi>Proclus</hi> doth plainely affirme and teach: It seemeth saith hee, that the equalities of shankes and bases, doth cause the equality of the verticall angles. For neither, if the bases be equall, doth the equality of the shankes leave the same or equall angles: But if the base bee lesser, the angle decreaseth: If greater, it increaseth. Neither if the bases bee equall, and the shankes unequall, doth the angle remaine the same: But when they are made lesse, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased: when they are made greater, it is diminished: For the contrary falleth out to the angles and shankes of the angles. For if thou shalt imagine the shankes to be in the same base thrust downeward, thou makest them lesse, but their angle greater: but if thou do againe conceive them to be pul'd up higher, thou makest them greater, but their angle lesser. For looke how much more neere they come one to another, so much farther off is the oppe removed from the base; wherefore you may boldly affirme, that the same

base and equall shankes, doe define the equality of Angels. This <hi>Poclus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>

               <p>[This consectary teacheth how unto a point given, to make an angle equall to an Angle given. To the effecting and doing of each three things are required; First, that the shankes be homogeneall, that is in each place, either straight or crooked: Secondly, that the shankes bee made equall, that is of like or equall bignesse: Thirdly, that the bases be equall: which three conditions if they doe meete, it must needes be that both the angles shall bee equall: but if one of them be wanting, of necessity againe they must be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall.]</p>
               <p>This shall hereafter be declared and made plaine by many and sundry practises: and therefore here we bring no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>An angle is either right or oblique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of the Affections of an angle; the division into his kindes followeth. An angle is either Right or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: as afore, at the 4 e ij. a line was right or straight, and oblique or crooked.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:8774:25"/>13. <hi>A right angle is an angle whose shankes are right (that is perpendicular) one unto another: An Oblique angle is contrary to this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As here the angle <hi>a i o.</hi> is a right angle, as is also <hi>o i e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the shanke <hi>o i.</hi> is right, that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular

to <hi>a e.</hi> [The instrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they doe make triall which is a right angle, and which is oblique, that is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lesser then a right angle, is the square which carpenters and joyners do ordinarily use: For lengthes are tried, saith <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> by the Rular and Line: Heighths, by the Perpendicular or Plumbe: And Angles, by the spuare. Contrariwise, an Oblique angle it is, when the one shanke standeth so upon another, that it inclineth, or leaneth more to one side, then it doth to the other: And one angle on the one side, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that on the other.</p>

               <p>The axiomes of the equality of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
<figure/>
were three, as even now wee heard, one generall, and two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectaries: Here moreover is there one speciall one of the equality of Right angles.</p>
               <p>Angles therfore homogeneall and recticrurall, that is whose shankes are right, as are right lines, as plaine surfaces (For let us so take the word) are equall right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8774:26"/>
So are the above written rectilineall right angles equall: so are plaine solid right angles, as in a cube, equall. The axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome may therefore generally be spoken of solid angles, so they be recticruralls; Because all semicircular right angles are not equall to all semicircular right angles: As here, when the diameter is continued it is perpendicular, and maketh twice two angles, within and without, the outter equall betweene themselves, and inner equall betweene themselves: But the outer unequall to the inner: And the angle of a greater semicircle is greater, then the angle of a lesser. Neither is this affection any way reciprocall, That all equall angles should bee right angles. For oblique angles may bee equall betweene themselves: And an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique angle may bee made equall to a right angle, as a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nular to a rectilineall right angle, as was manifest, at the 6 e.</p>
               <p>The definition of an oblique is understood by the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the shankes: whereupon also it appeareth; That an oblique angle is unequall to an homogeneall right angle: Neither indeed may oblique angles be made equall by any lawe or rule: Because obliquity may infinitly bee both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased and diminished.</p>

the <hi>Diagonius,</hi> when it passeth from corner to corner. In solids it is called the <hi>Axis,</hi> as hereafter we shall heare.</p>

notwithstanding by the center there may be divers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry. In a circle the thing is most apparent: as in the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe the index may be put up and downe by all the points of the periphery. So in a speare and all rounds the thing is more easie to be conceived, where the diameters are equall: yet notwithstanding in other figures the thing is the same. Because the diameter is a right line inscribed by the center, whether from corner to corner, or side to side, the matter skilleth not. Therefore that there are in the same figure infinite diameters, it issueth out of the difinition of a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</p>

               <p>As here thou seest <hi>a, e, i,</hi> this ariseth out of the definition

of the diameter. For because the diameter is inscribed into the figure by the center: Therefore the Center of the figure must needes be in the diameter thereof: This is by <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> assumed especially at the 9, 10, 11, and 13 <hi>Theoreme</hi> of his <hi>Isorropicks,</hi> or <hi>AEquiponderants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This consectary, saith the learned Rod. Snellius, is as it were a kinde of invention of the center. For where the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters doe meete and cutt one another, there must the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter needes bee. The cause of this is for that in every figure
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8774:29"/>
there is but one center only: And all the diameters, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was said, must needes passe by that center.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As in the examples following. This also followeth out of the same definition of the diameter. For seeing that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

diameter passeth by the center: The center must needes be common to all the diameters: and therefore it must also needs be in the meeting of them: Otherwise there should be divers centers of one and the same figure.

               <p>The proportion of first figures is here twofold; the first is direct in those which are of equall height.

From hence in rationall figures the content of those which are of equall height is to bee expressed by a number. As in two right angled parallelogrammes, let 4. the same height, multiply 2. and 3. the bases; The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts 8. and 12. the parallelogrammes made, are directly proportionall unto the bases 2. and

                  </gap>e as 2. is unto 3. so is 8. unto 12. The same shall afterward appeare in right Prismes and Cyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nders. In plaines, Parallelogramms are the doubles of triangles: In solids, Prismes are the triples of pyramides: Cylinders, the triples of Cones. The converse of this element is plaine out of the former also: First figures if they be in reason one to another as their bases are, then are they of equall height, to witt when their products are proportionall unto the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, the same number did multiply them.</p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>

               </p>
               <p>[The reason is, because then those two figures compared, have equall sides, which doe make them equall betweene themselves; For the parts of the one applyed or laid unto the parts of the other, doe fill an equall place, as was taught at the 10. e. j. <hi>Sn.</hi>] So Triangles, so Parallelogrammes, and so other figures proposed are equalled upon an equall base.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The second kind of proportion of first figures is recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. This kinde of proportion rationall and expressible by a number, is not to be had in first figures themselves: but in those that are equally manifold to them, as was taught even now in direct proportion: As for example, Let these two right angled parallelogrammes, unequall in bases and heighths 3, 8, 4, 6, be as heere thou seest: The proportion
<figure/>
reciprocall is thus, As 3 the base of the one, is unto 4, the base of the other: so is 6. the height of the one is to 8. the height of the other: And the parallelogrammes are equall, viz. 24. and 24. Againe, let two solids of unequall bases &amp; heights (for here also the base is taken for the length and heighth) be 12, 2, 3, o, 3, 4. The solids themselves shall be 72. and 72, as here thou seest; and the proportion of the bases
<figure/>
and heights likewise is reciprocall: For as 24, is unto 18, so is 4, unto 3. The cause is out of the golden rule of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Arithmeticke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Therefore the plots made of them shall be equall. And againe, by the same rule, because the plots are equall: Therefore the bounds are proportionall; which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of this present element.</p>

               <p>The second consectary is of situation and place. And this like situation is then said to be when the upper parts of the one figure doe agree with the upper parts of the other, the lower, with the lower, and so the other differences of places. <hi>Sn.</hi>

               <p>This third consectary is manifest out of the definition of like figures. For the similitude of two figures doth conclude both the same equality in angles and proportion of sides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themselves.</p>

In Triangles, which are the halfes of rightangled parallelogrammes, there is the same truth, and yet by it selfe not rationall and to be expressed by numbers.</p>
               <p>Said numbers are alike in the trebled reason of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologall sides; As for example, 60. and 480. are like solids; and the solids also comprehended in those num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are like-solids, as here thou seest: Because their sides, 4.3.5. and 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus farre of the first part of this element: The second, that like figurs have a meane, proportional lesse by one, then are their dimensions, shall be declared by few words.

                  <hi>Planum,</hi> a Plaine, is taken and used for a plaine surface: as before <hi>Rotundum,</hi> a Round, was used for a round figure.</p>

               <p>Three things are from the former ground begg'd: The first is of a Right line. A right line and a periphery were in the ij. booke defined: But the fabricke or making of them both, is here said to bee properly in a plaine.</p>
               <p>The fabricke or construction of a right
<figure/>
line is the 1. petition. And justly is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that it may bee done onely upon a plaine: For in any other surface it were in vaine to aske it. For neither may wee possibly in a sphericall betweene two points draw a right line: Neither may wee possibly in a Conicall and Cylindra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceall betweene any two points assigned draw a right line. For from the toppe

unto the base that in these is only possible:<note place="margin">

                  </note> And then is it the bounde of the plaine which cutteth the Cone and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder. Therefore, as I said, of a right plaine it may onely justly bee demanded: That from any point assigned, unto any point assigned, a right line may be drawne, as here from <hi>a</hi> unto <hi>e.</hi>

               <p>And from a point unto a point is this justly demanded to be done, not unto points; For neither doe all points fall in a right line: But many doe fall out to be in a crooked line. And in a Spheare, a Cone &amp; Cylinder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But by the example of a right line doth <hi>Vitellio,</hi> 2 <hi>p j.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that betweene two lines a surface may be extended: And so may it seeme in the Elements, of many figures both plaine and solids, by <hi>Euclide</hi> to be demanded; That a figure may be described, at the 7. and 8. e ij. Item that a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure may be made vp, at the 8. 14. 16. 23.28. p.vj. which are of Plaines. Item at the 25. 31. 33. 34. 36. 49. p.xj. which are of Solids. Yet notwithstanding a plaine surface, and a plaine body doe measure their rectitude by a right line, so that <hi>jus postulandi,</hi> this right of begging to have a thing granted may seeme primarily to bee in a right plaine line.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Continuation</hi> of a right line is nothing else, but the drawing out farther of a line now drawne, and that from a point unto a point, as we may continue the right line <hi>a e.</hi> unto <hi>i.</hi> wherefore the first and second Petitions of <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore,</p>

               <p>One Right line may bee the common section of two plaines: yet all or the whole in the same plaine is one: And all the whole is in the same other: And so the whole is the same plaine.

of them shall be in the same plaine. And this plaine is geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically to be conceived: Because the same plaine is not alwaies made the ground whereupon one oblique line, or two cutting one another are drawne, when a periphery is in a sphearicall: Neither may all peripheries cutting one another be possibly in one plaine.</p>

But here the terme or end of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is onely sought, which is better drawne out of the definition of a periphery, at the 10. e ij. And in a plaine onely may that conversion or turning about of a right line bee made: Not in a sphearicall, not in a Conicall, not in a Cylindraceall, except it be in top, where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a periphery may bee described.

But the word <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum,</hi> alterne [or <hi>alternate, H.</hi>] here, as <hi>Proclus</hi> saith, signifieth situation, which in Arithmeticke signifyed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, when the antecedent was compared to the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; notwithstanding the metaphor answereth fitly.

                  </gap>use; So on the other part is the acute unto his successively following obtuse: Therefore alternly, As the acute unto the acute: so is the obtuse, unto the obtuse. But the outter and inner are opposite, of the which the one is without the parallels; the other is within on the same part not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively; but upon the same right line the third from the outter.</p>
               <p>The cause of this threefold propriety is from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular or plumb-line, which falling upon the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lells breedeth and discovereth all this variety: As here they are right angles which are the inner on the same part or side: Item, the alterne angles: Item the inner and the outter: And therefore they are equall, both, I meane, the two inner to two right angles: and the alterne angles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themselvs: And the outter to the inner opposite to it.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>u y o,</hi> is made acute: And the alterne angles are made acute and obtuse: As also the outter and inner opposite are likewise made acute and obtuse.</p>
               <p>If any man shall notwithstanding say, That the inner an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles are unequall to two right angles; By the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may he say (saith <hi>Ptolome</hi> in <hi>Proclus</hi>) That on each side they be both greater than two right angles, and also lesser: As in the parallel right lines <hi>a e</hi> and <hi>i o,</hi> cut with

               <p>The same impossibility shall be concluded, if they shall be sayd, to be lesser than two right angles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The second and third parts may be concluded out of the first. The second is thus: Twise two angles are equall to two right angles <hi>o y u,</hi> and <hi>e u y,</hi> by the former part: Item, <hi>a u y,</hi> and <hi>e u y,</hi> by the 14 e. Therefore they are equall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themselves. Now from the equall, Take away <hi>e u y,</hi> the common angle, And the remainders, the alterne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, at <hi>u,</hi> and <hi>y</hi> shall be least equall.</p>
               <p>The third is thus; The angles <hi>e u y,</hi> and <hi>o y s,</hi> are equall to the same <hi>u y i,</hi> by the second propriety, and by the 15 e. Therefore they are equall betweene themselves.</p>
               <p>The converse of the first is here also the more manifest by that light of the common perpendicular, And if any man shall thinke, That although
<figure/>
the two inner angles be equall to two right angles, yet the right may meete, as if those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall angles were right angles, as here; it must needes be that two right lines divided by a common perpendicular, should both leane, the one this way, the other that way, or at least one of them, contrary to the 13 eij.</p>
               <p>If they be oblique angles, as here, the lines one slanting or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8774:44"/>
liquely crossing one another, the angles on one side will grow lesse, on the other side greater. Therefore they would not be equall to two right angles, against the graunt.</p>
               <p>From hence the second and third parts may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The second is thus: The alterne angles at <hi>u</hi> and <hi>y,</hi> are equall to the foresayd inner angles, by the 14 e: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both of them are equall to the two right angles: And so by the first part the second is concluded.</p>
               <p>The third is therefore by the second demonstrated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the outter <hi>o y s,</hi> is equall to the verticall or opposite angle at the top, by the 15 e. Therefore seeing the outter and inner opposite are equall, the alterne also are equall.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as <hi>Parallelismus,</hi> parallell-equality argueth a three-fold equality of angels: So the threefold equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of angles doth argue the same parallel-equality.</p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>

<figure/>
the 7 e iij. This is the first: Then by 21 e, the alterne angles <hi>e i a,</hi> and <hi>i e o,</hi> are equall betweene themselves: And those are made by <hi>a i,</hi> and <hi>e o,</hi> cut by the right line <hi>e i</hi>: Therefore they are parallell; which was the second.</p>
               <p>On the same part or side it is sayd, least any man might understand right lines knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by opposite bounds as here.</p>

               <p>If the lines cut be not parallels, but doe leane one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, the portions cut or intercepted betweene them will not be equall, yet shall they be proportionall one to another.

               <p>The truth of this proposition, saith <hi>Proclus,</hi> according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions, appeareth by two perpendiculars erected upon the ends of the base: for looke how much by the leaning of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is taken from two right angles at the base, so much is assumed or taken in at the toppe, and so by that requitall the
<figure/>
equality of two right angles is made; as in the triangle <hi>a e i,</hi> let, by the 24. ev, <hi>o u,</hi> be parallell against <hi>i e.</hi> Here three particular angles, <hi>i a o, i a e, e a u,</hi> are equall to two right lines; by the 14. e v.

               <p>Thus forre of the Geometry, or affections and reason of one triangle; the comparison of two triangles one with another doth follow. And first of their rate or reason, out of their sides and angles: Whereupon triangles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themselves are said to be equilaters and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles. First out of the equality of the sides, is drawne also the equalitie of the angles.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Triangles therefore are here jointly called equilaters, whose sides are severally equall, the first to the first, the second, to the second, the third to the third; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every severall triangle be inequilaterall. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the equality of the sides doth argue the equality of the angles, by the 7. e iij. As here.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>If two triangles be equall in angles, either the two equicrurals, or two of equall either shanke, or base of two angles, they are equilaters,</hi> 4. <hi>and</hi> 26. <hi>p j.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh thus; If two triangles be equall in their angles, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8774:59"/>
in two angles contained under equall feet, or in two angles, whose side or base of both is equall, those angles are equilater. <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This element hath three parts, or it doth conclude two triangles to be equilaters three wayes. 1. The first part is apparent thus: Let the two triangles be <hi>a e i,</hi> and <hi>o u y</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the equall angles at <hi>a,</hi> and <hi>o,</hi> are equicrurall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are equall in base, by the 7. e iij.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The second thus: Let the said two triangles <hi>a e i,</hi> and
<figure/>
                  <hi>o u y,</hi> be equall in two angles a peece, at <hi>e,</hi> and <hi>i,</hi> and at <hi>u,</hi> and <hi>y.</hi> And let them be equall in the shanke <hi>e i,</hi> to <hi>u y.</hi> I say, they are equilaters. For if the side <hi>a e,</hi> (for examples sake) be great or than the side <hi>o u,</hi> let <hi>e s,</hi> be cut off equall unto it; and draw the right line <hi>i s.</hi> Here by the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the triangles <hi>s e i,</hi> and <hi>o u y,</hi> shall be equiangles, and
<figure/>
the angles <hi>s i e,</hi> shall be equall to the angle <hi>o y u,</hi> to which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8774:60"/>
also the whole angle <hi>a i e,</hi> is equall, by the grant. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole and the part are equall, which is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Wherefore the side <hi>a e,</hi> is not unequall but equall to the side <hi>o u</hi>: And by the antecedent or former part, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles <hi>a e i,</hi> and <hi>o u y,</hi> being equicrurall, are equall, at the angle of the shanks: Therefore also they are equall in their bases <hi>a i,</hi> and <hi>o y.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="3">3 The third part is thus forced: In the triangles <hi>a e i,</hi> and <hi>o u y,</hi> let the angles at <hi>e,</hi> and <hi>i,</hi> and <hi>u,</hi> and <hi>y,</hi> be equall, as afore: And <hi>a e.</hi> the base of the angle at <hi>i,</hi> be equall to <hi>o u,</hi> the base of angle at <hi>y</hi>: I say that the two triangles given are equilaters. For if the side <hi>e i,</hi> be greater than the side <hi>u y,</hi> let <hi>e s,</hi> be cut off equall to it, and draw the right line <hi>a s.</hi> Therefore by the antecedent, the two triangles, <hi>a e s,</hi> and <hi>o u y,</hi> equall in the angle of their equall shankes are equiangle; And the angle <hi>a s e,</hi> is equall to the angle <hi>o y u,</hi> which is equall by the grant unto the angle <hi>a i e.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>a s e,</hi> is equall to <hi>a i e,</hi> the outter to the inner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the 15. e v. j. Therefore the base <hi>e i,</hi> is not une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the base <hi>u y,</hi> but equall. And therefore as above was said, the two triangles <hi>a e i,</hi> and <hi>o u y,</hi> equall in the angle of their equall shankes, are equilaters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Triangles are equall in their three angles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason is, because three angles in any triangle are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8774:60"/>
equall to two right angles, by the
<figure/>
13. e v j. As here, the greatest triangle, all his corners joyntly taken, is equall to the least.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithstanding it is not therefore to be thought to be equiangle to it: For Triangles are then equiangles, when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall angles of the one, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the severall angles of the other: Not when all joyntly are equall to all.</p>
               <p>Therefore</p>

               <p>The division of a triangle, taken from the angles, out of their common differences, I meane, doth now follow. But here first a speciall division, and that of great moment, as hereafter shall be in quadrangles and prismes.</p>

               <p>A right angled triangle in Geometry is of speciall use and force; and of the best Mathematicians it is called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister matheseos,</hi> the master of the Mathematickes.</p>

               <p>Either of the shankes is proportionall betweene the summe, and the difference of the base and the other shanke. And contrariwise. If one side be proportionall betweene the summe and the difference of the others, the triangle given is a rectangle. M. <hi>H. Brigges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a consectary arising likewise out of the 4 e. of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great use.</p>
               <p>In the triangle <hi>e a d,</hi> the shanke <hi>a d,</hi> 12. is the meane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall betweene <hi>b d,</hi> 18.

And by the 9 e, <hi>b d, d a,</hi> and <hi>d e,</hi> are continually proportionall.</p>

6. let it be 36. and the quotient of 36. by 4. be 9: And the side it 6. for the one shanke. Now 9—4. that is, 5. is the difference of the divisour and quotient, whose halfe 2.½, is the other shanke. And 9—4. that is 13. is the summe the said devisour and quotient, whose halfe 6.½, is the base.</p>
               <p>Againe let 4. and 8. be given. The quadrate of 8. is 64. And the quient of 64 is 16. and the side of 64. is 8. for the one shanke. The halfe 16—4. that is 6. is the other shanke. And the halfe of 16—4. that is 10, is the base.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8774:67"/>
(9.c.ij.) the triangle <hi>e i s,</hi> is equall to the triangles <hi>e a u,</hi> and <hi>i a y.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Converse is thus proved: Let the triangle be <hi>a e i</hi>: And let the perpendicular <hi>e o,</hi> be erected upon <hi>a e,</hi> equall to <hi>e i</hi>: And draw a right line from <hi>o</hi> to <hi>a</hi>: Here by the former, the rectilinealls situate at <hi>o e,</hi> and <hi>e a,</hi> that is by the construction, at <hi>a e,</hi> and <hi>i e,</hi> are equall to the rightilineall at <hi>a o,</hi> made alike and situate a like: And by the graunt they are equall, to the rectilineall at <hi>a i,</hi> made a like and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated alike. Therefore seeing the like rectilineals at <hi>a o,</hi> and <hi>a i,</hi> are equall; they have by the 20 e iiij, their homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logall sides equall: And the two triangles are equiliters: And by the 1 e vij, equiangles. But <hi>a e o,</hi> is a right angle, by the construction: And <hi>a e i,</hi> is proved to be equall to the same <hi>a e o</hi>: Therefore, by the 13 e v. <hi>a e i,</hi> also is a right angle.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>An obliquangled triangle is either Obtusangled or Acutangled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The division of an obliquangled triangle is taken from the speciall differences of an oblique angle. For at the 15 e iij, we were taught that an oblique angle was either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse or acute: Therefore an obliquangled triangle is an obtuseangle, and an Acutangle.</p>

                  <hi>Radius,</hi> commonly called <hi>Baculus Iacob, Iacobs</hi> staffe, as if it had beene long since invented and practised by that holy Patriarke, is a very auncient instrument, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Geometricall instruments, commonly used, the best and fittest for this use. <hi>Archimedes</hi> in his book of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the sand, seemeth to mention some such thing: And <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> with an instrument not much unlike this, boldly attempted an haynous matter in the sight of God, as <hi>Pliny</hi> thinketh, namely to deliver unto posterity the number of the starres, and to assigne of fixe them in their true places by the <hi>Norma,</hi> the squire or <hi>Iacobs</hi> staffe. And indeed true it is that the Radius is not onely used for the measuring of the earth and land: But especially for the defining or limiting of the starres in their places and order: And for the describing and setting out of all the regions and waies of the heavenly city. Yea and <hi>Virgill</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poet, in his 3 <hi>Ecloge, Ecquis fuit alter, Descripsit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio totum, qui gentibus orbem?</hi> and againe afterward in the 6 of his <hi>Eneiades,</hi> hath noted both these uses. <hi>Coeliquè me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus.

This instrument, at the discretion of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer may be greater or lesser. For the quantity of the same can no other wayes be determined.</p>

The principall parts of this instrument are two, the <hi>Index,</hi> or <hi>Staffe,</hi> which is the greater or longer part: and the <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarium,</hi> or Transome, and is the lesser and shorter.</p>

               <p>Or, The transversary is to be moved upon the Index, sometimes higher, sometimes lower: <hi>H.</hi> This proportion in defining and making of the shankes of the instrument is perpetually to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: as if the transome be 10. parts, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex

must be 21. If that be 189. this shall be 90. or if it be 2000. this shall be 4200. Neither doth it skill what the numbers be, so this be their proportion. More than this, That the greater the numbers be, that is the lesser that the divisions be, the better will it be in the use. And because the Index must beare, and the transome is to be borne; let the index be thicker, and the transome the thinner.</p>

For here the eye is as it were the center of the circle, into which the transome is inscribed. Thirdly, the hands must be steady; for if they shake, the proportion of the Geodesy must needes be troubled and uncertaine. Lastly, the place of the station is from the midst of the foote.</p>

               <p>The Demonstration, by drawing of <hi>a o,</hi> a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar unto <hi>u y,</hi> is a proportion out of two triangles of equall heighth.

there is given <hi>n l,</hi> and <hi>u r,</hi> for the first proportionall: <hi>u r,</hi> for the second: and <hi>y u,</hi> for the third: Therefore there is also given <hi>o u,</hi> for the fourth: Which <hi>o u,</hi> subducted out of <hi>u y,</hi> there remaineth <hi>o y,</hi> that is, <hi>a s,</hi> the lesser altitude sought.</p>
               <p>For let the parts of the yard be 12. and 6. and the summe of them 18. Now as 18. is 12. so is the whole altitude <hi>u y,</hi> 190. foote, unto the excesse 126⅔ foote. The remainder therefore 63⅓ foote, shall be <hi>a s,</hi> the lesser heighth sought.</p>
               <p>But thou maist more fitly dispose and order this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus: As <hi>u r,</hi> is unto <hi>n l</hi>: so is <hi>u o</hi> unto <hi>o y.</hi> Therefore by Arithmeticall composition, as <hi>u r,</hi> and <hi>n l,</hi> are unto <hi>n l</hi>: so <hi>u o,</hi> and <hi>o y,</hi> that is, the whole <hi>u y,</hi> is unto <hi>o y,</hi> that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>a s.</hi> For here a subduction of the proportion, after the composition is no way necessary, by the crosse rule of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietia, thus:

               <p>One may againe also out of the toppe of a Turret mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the distance of two turrets one from another: For it is the first manner of measuring of longitudes, neither doth it here differ any whit from it, more than the yard is hang'd without the heighth given.

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:8774:80"/>
that indeed is the least: For even a triangle it selfe, may be cut into as many triangles as one please.</p>
               <p>That both the inner and outter are equall to right angles, in every kinde of right line figure, it was manifest at the 4 e vj. The inner is a Quadrangle, are equall to 4. In a Quinquangle, to 6: In an Hexangle, to 8; and so forth.
<figure/>
But the outter, in every right-lined figure, are equall to 4 right angles: as here may be demonstrated, by the 14 e v and 13 e vj.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As in <hi>a e i o.</hi> And here hence you must understand by one right angle that all are right angles. For the right angle at <hi>a,</hi> is equall to the opposite angle at <hi>i,</hi> by the 10 e x.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8774:86"/>
may it indeed possible be, that in a parallelogramme there should be one right angle, but by and by they must be all right angles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Comprehension,</hi> in this place doth signifie a certaine kind of Geometricall multiplication. For as of two numbers multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied betweene themselves there is made a number: so of two sides (<hi>ductis</hi>) driven together, a right angle is made: And yet every right angle is not rationall, as before was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, at the 12. e iiij. and shall after appeare at the 8 e.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The reason is, because it doth cut the parallelogramme into two equall portions.</p>

               <p>The Demonstration of this is
<figure/>
from the rule of congruency: Because the whole agreeth to all his parts. But the same reason in numbers is more apparent by an induction of the parts: as foure times eight are 32. I breake or divide 8. into 5. and 3. Now foure times 5. are 20. And foure times 3. are 12. And 20. and 12. are 32. And 32. and 32. are equall. Therefore 20. and 12. are also equall to 32.</p>
               <p>Lastly, every arithmeticall multiplication of the whole numbers doth make the same product, that the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one of the whole numbers given, by the parts of the other shall make; yea, that the multiplication of the parts by the parts shall make.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8774:87"/>
sort amongst all the rectilineals hitherto spoken of, we have not had one: The first is a Right angled parallelogramme; And yet not every one indifferently: But that onely whose base is rationall to the highest: And that reason of the base and heighth is expressable by a number, where also the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurate is defined. A rectangle of irrational sides, such as were mentioned at the 9 e j. is irrationall. Therefore a rectangled rationall of rationall sides, is here understood: And the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thereof, is called, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<figure/>
name, A <hi>Plaine:</hi> Because of all the kindes of <hi>Plaines,</hi> this kinde onely is rationall.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Base of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctangle be 6. And the height 4. The plot or content shall be 24. And if it be certaine that the rectangles content be 24. And the base be 6. It shall also be certaine that the heighth is 4. The example is thus.</p>
               <p>And this multiplication, as appeared at the 13. e iiij. is geometricall: As if thou dost multiply 5. by 8. thou makest 40. for the Plaine: And the sides of this Plaine, are 5. and 8. it is all one as if thou hadst made a
<figure/>
rectangled parallelogramme of 40. square foote content, whose base should be 5. foote, and the heigth 8. after this manner.</p>
               <p>This manner of multiplication, say 1, is Geometricall: Neither are there here, of lines made lines, as there of vnities were made vnities; but a magnitude one degree higher, to wit, a surface, is here made.</p>
               <p>Here hence is the <hi>Geodesy</hi> or manner of measuring of a rectangled triangle made knowne unto us. For when thou shalt multiply the shankes of a right angle, the one by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou dost make the whole rectangled parallelogramme, whose halfe is a triangle, by the 12. e x.</p>

foote, have an unity taken from it, the halfe of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shall be the other foote, and the same halfe increased by an unitie, shall be the base: <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in the example: The sides are
<figure/>
3,4, and 5. And 25. the square of 5. the base, is equall to 16. and 9. the squares of the shanks 4. and 3.</p>
               <p>Againe, the quadrate or square of 3. the first shanke is 9. and 9—1. is 8, whose halfe 4, is the other shanke. And 9—1, is 10. whose halfe 5. is the base. <hi>Plato's</hi> way is thus by an even number.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>If the halfe of an even number given for the first shanke be squared, the square number diminished by an vnity shall be the other shanke, and increased by an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it shall be the base.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in this example where the sides are 6, 8. and 10. For 100. the square of 10. the
<figure/>
base is equall to 36. and 64. the squares of the shankes 6. and 8.</p>
               <p>Againe, the quadrate or square of 3. the halfe of 6, the first shanke, is 9. and 9—1, is 8, for the second shanke. And out of this rate of rationall powers (as <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> in the 2. Chapter of his IX. booke) saith <hi>Pythagoras</hi> taught how to make a most exact and true squire, by joyning of three rulers together in the forme of a triangle, which are one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as 3,4. and 5. are one to another.</p>
               <p>From hence Architecture learned an Arithmeticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the parts of ladders and stayres. For that rate or proportion, as in many businesses and measures is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious; so also in buildings, and making of ladders or staires, that they may have moderate rises of the steps, it is very speedy. For 9—1. is, 10, base.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:8774:90"/>12. <hi>The power of the diagony is twise asmuch, as is the power of the side, and it is unto it also incommensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus: The diagonall line is in power double to the side, and is incommensurable unto it, <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As here thou seest, let the first quadrate bee <hi>a e i o:</hi> Of whose diagony <hi>a i,</hi> let there be made the quadrate <hi>a i u y:</hi> This, I say, shall be the double of
<figure/>
that: seeing that the diagonies power is equall to the power of both the equall shankes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is double to the power of one of them.</p>
               <p>This is the way of doubling of a square taught by <hi>Plato,</hi> as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> telleth us: Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding may be also dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, trebled, or according to any reason assigned increased, by the 25 e iiij, as there was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
               <p>But that the Diagony is incommensurable unto the side it is the 116 p x. The reason is, because otherwise there might be given one quadrate number, double to another quadrate number: Which as <hi>Theon</hi> and <hi>Campanus</hi> teach us, is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be found. But that reason which <hi>Aristotle</hi> bringeth is more cleare which is this; Because otherwise an even number should be odde. For if the Diagony be 4, and the side 3: The square of the Diagony 16, shall be double to the square of the side: And so the square of the side shall be 8. and the same square shall be 9, to wit, the square of 3. And so even shall be odde, which is most absurd.</p>
               <p>Hither may be added that at the 42 p x. That the segments of a right line diversly cut; the more unequall they are the greater is their power.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>If the base of a right angled triangle be cut by a

perpendicular from the right angle in a doubled reason, the power of it shall be halfe as much more, as is the power of the greater shanke: But thrise so much as is the power of the lesser.

               </p>
               <p>Or thus: If the base of a right angled triangle be cut in double proportion, by a perpendicular comming from the right angle, it is in power sesquialter to the greater foote; and treb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to the lesser: But
<figure/>
if the base be cut in quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proportion, it is sesquiarta to the greater side, and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuple to the lesser.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>a e i,</hi> let the base <hi>a e,</hi> be so cut that the segment <hi>a o,</hi> be double to the segment <hi>o e,</hi> to wit, as 2 is to 1. The whole <hi>a e,</hi> shall be unto <hi>a o, sesqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altera,</hi> that is, as 2 is to 3. And
<figure/>
therefore by the 10 e viij, and 25 e iiij, the square of <hi>a e,</hi> shall be <hi>sesquialterum</hi> unto the square of <hi>a i.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by the same argument it shall be treble unto the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate or square of <hi>e i.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, of the fourefold or quadruple section, are manifest in the figure following, by the like argument.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>If a right line be cut into how many parts so ever, the power of it is manifold unto the power of segment, denominated of the square of the number of the section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus: if a right be cut into how many parts so ever it is in power the multiplex of the segment, the square of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the section, being denominated thereof: <hi>H.</hi>

parts, the power of it shall be nine fold the power of the third part. If into foure equall parts, it shall be 16 times so much as is the power of the quarter: As here thou seest in these examples.</p>

               <p>This is the rate of a quadrate with a rectangle &amp; a quadrate from whence is had the analisis or resolution of the side of a quadrate expressable by a number. For it is the same way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Secondly double the side now found, and it shall be 2, which I place in manner of a Divisor, on the left hand, within the semicircle: By this I divide the 40, the two complements or Plaines, and I finde the quotient or second side 2; which I place in the quotient by 1, This side I multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply first quadrate like, that is by it selfe; and I make 4, the lesser Diagonall: And therefore I place under the last 4: Then I multiply the said Divisor 2, by the same 2 the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,<note place="margin">

               <p>Sometime after the quadrate now found, in the next places, there is neither any plaine nor square to bee found: Therefore the single side thereof shall be <hi>O.</hi> As in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate 366025, the whole side is 605, consisting of three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall sides, of which the middle one is <hi>o.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometime also the middle plaine doth containe a part of the quadrate next following: Therfore if the other side re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining be greater than the side of the quadrate following, it is to be made equall unto it: As for example, Let the side of the quadrate 784, be sought;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>And from hence the invention of a meane proportionll, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two numbers given, (if there be any such to be found) is manifest.</hi> For it the product of two numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be a quadrate, the side of the quadrate shall be the meane proportionall, betweene the numbers given; as is apparent by the golden rule: As for example, Betweene 4. and 9. two numbers given, I desire to know what is the meane proportion. I multiply therefore 4 and 9. betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the product is 36: which is a quadrate number; as you see in the former; And the side is 6. Therefore I say, the meane proportionall betweene 4. and 9. is 6, that is, As 4. is to 6. so is 6. to 9.</p>
               <p>If the number given be not a quadrate, there shall no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall side, and to be expressed by a number be found: And this figurate number is but the shadow of a Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call figure, and doth not indeede expresse it fully, neither is such a quadrate rationall: Yet notwithstanding the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall side of the greatest square in such like number may be found: As in 148. The greatest quadrate continued is 144 and the side is 12. And there doe remaine 4. Therefore of such kinde of number, which is not a quadrate, there is no true or exact side: Neither shall there ever be found any so neare unto the true one; but there may still be one found more neare the truth. Therefore the side is not to be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a number.</p>
               <p>Of the invention of this there are two wayes: The one is by the <hi>Addition of the gnomon</hi>; The other is by the Reduction of the number assigned unto parts of some greater denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The first is thus:</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>If the side found be doubled, and to the double a unity be added, the whole shall be the gnomon of the next greater quadrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the sides is one of the complements, and being dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it is the side of both together. And an unity is the latter diagonall. So the side of 148 is 12 4/25.</p>
               <p>The reason of this dependeth on the same proposition,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8774:94"/>
from whence also the whole side, is found. For seeing that the side of every quadrate lesser than the next follower dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth onely from the side of the quadrate next above grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it but by an 1. the same unity, both twice multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the side of the former quadrate, and also once by it selfe, doth make the <hi>Gnomon</hi> of the greater to be added to the quadrate. For it doth make the quadrate 169. Whereby is understood, that looke how much the numerator 4. is short of the denominatour 25. so much is the quadrate 148. short of the next greater quadrate. For it thou doe adde 21. which is the difference whereby 4 is short of 25. thou shalt make the quadrate 169. whose side is 13. The second is by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as I said, of the number given unto parts assigned of some great denomination, as 100. or 1000. or some smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than those, and those quadrates, that their true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine may be knowne: Now looke how much the smaller they are, so much nearer to the truth shall the side found be.</p>
               <p>Let the same example be reduced unto hundreds squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red parts, thus: 1480000/10000. The side of
<figure/>
10000. by grant is 100. But the side of 1480000. the numerator by the former is 1216. and beside there doe remaine 1344: thus, 1216/100. that is, 12 16/100, or 4/25 which was discovered by the former way. But in the side of the numerator there remained 1344. By which little this second way is more accurate and precise than the first. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those remaines are not regarded, because they cannot adde so much as 1/100. part unto the side, found: For neither in deed doe 1344/2426. make one hundred part.</p>
               <p>Moreover in lesser parts, the second way beside the other, doth shew the side to be somewhat greater than the side, by the first way found: as in 7. the side by the first way is 3/25. But by the second way the side of 7. reduced unto thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands quadrates, that is unto 7000000/1000000, that is, 2645/1000, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side there doe remaine 3975. But 645/1000. are greater than 3/5.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8774:94"/>
For ⅗. reduced unto 1000. are but 600/1000. Therefore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way, in this example, doth exceed the first by 45/1000. those remaines 3975. being also neglected.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is the Analysis or manner of finding the side of a quadrate, by the first rate of a quadrate, equall to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rectangle and quadrate.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As for example, Let the sides of the triangle <hi>a e i,</hi> be 6. 8. 10: The summe 24. the halfe of the summe 12. From which
<figure/>
halfe subduct the sides 6. 8. 18. and let the remaines be 6. 4. 2. Now multiply continually these foure numbers 12.6.4. 2. and thou shalt make first of 12. and 6. 72. Of 72. and 4. 288. Lastly, of 288. and 2. 576. And the side of 576. by the 16.e. shall be found to be 24. for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the triangle: which also here will be found to be true, by multiplying the sides <hi>a e,</hi> and <hi>e i,</hi> containing the right angle, the one by the other; and then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the halfe of the product.</p>
               <p>This generall way of measuring a triangle is most easie and speedy, where the sides are expressed by whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>The speciall geodesy of rectangle triangle was before taught (at the 9 e x j.) But of an oblique angle it shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be spoken. But the generall way is farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <p>The converse likewise is manifest: For the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars given do halfe them: And the halfes as before are equall.</p>

               <p>The second part of the nearer, is manifest by the 5 e vij. because of the triangle <hi>i l o,</hi> equicrurall to the triangle <hi>u l y,</hi> is greater in angle: And therefore it is also greater in base.</p>

               <p>The first part is manifest, because the part should be equall to the whole, if the Center were

whole, as here <hi>a e</hi> and <hi>a i,</hi> the raies of the lesser periphery; And <hi>a e,</hi> and <hi>a o,</hi> the raies of the greater are equall. Wherefore <hi>a i,</hi> should be equall to <hi>a o,</hi> the Part to the whole.</p>

is more easie, and by the judgement of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi> it deserved not a demonstration, as here.</p>
               <p>The third part is apparent

out of the first: Otherwise those which cut one another should be concentrickes. For, by the 7 e, the center being found: And by the 9 e, three right lines being drawne from the center unto three points of

the sections, the three raies must be equall, as here.</p>
               <p>The fourth part is demonstrated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<figure/>
the same manner: Because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Part must be greater then the whole.

               <p>The same will fall out,
<figure/>
if the touch be without, as here: For, by the 9 e vj, <hi>e a</hi> and <hi>i a,</hi> are greater than <hi>i e.</hi> But <hi>e o</hi> and <hi>i u,</hi> are equall to <hi>e a,</hi> and <hi>i a.</hi> Wherefore <hi>e o,</hi> and <hi>i u,</hi> are greater than <hi>i e,</hi> the parts than the whole.</p>

the demonstration is but one and

the same: As here <hi>e a i,</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in the center, shall be prooved to be double to <hi>e o i,</hi> the angle in the periphery, the right line <hi>o u</hi> cutting it into two triangles on each side equicrurall; And, by the 17 e vj, at the base equiangles: Whose dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles severally are the angles, <hi>e a u,</hi> of <hi>e o a</hi>: And <hi>i a u,</hi> of <hi>i <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The second example is thus of the

angle in the center <hi>a e i</hi>: And in the periphery <hi>a o i.</hi> Here the shankes <hi>e o,</hi> and <hi>e i,</hi> by the 28 e iiij, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall: And by the 17 e vj, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles at <hi>o</hi> and <hi>i</hi> are equall: To both which the angle in the center is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, by the 15 e vj.

               <p>The third example is of the angle in the center, <hi>a e i,</hi> And in the periphery <hi>a o i,</hi> Let the diameter be <hi>o e u.</hi> Here the whole angle <hi>i e u,</hi> by the 15 e v j,

is equall to the two inner angles <hi>e o i,</hi> and <hi>e i o.</hi> which are equall one to another, by the 17 e v j: And therefore it is double of the one.

               <p>This followeth out of the former element: For the angle in the center is double to the angle in the periphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry standing upon the same base: Wherefore if the angle in the periphery be to be made equall to the angle in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his base is to be doubled, and thence shall follow the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of them both: <hi>S.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There are seven parts of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement:
<figure/>
The first is that <hi>The angle in a semicircle is a right angle</hi>: as in <hi>a e i</hi>: For if the ray <hi>o e,</hi> be drawne, the angle <hi>a e i,</hi> shall be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two angles <hi>a e o,</hi> and <hi>o e i,</hi> equall to the angles <hi>e a o,</hi> and <hi>e i o,</hi> by the 17 e v j. Therefore seeing that one angle is equall to the other two, it is a right angle, by the 6 e viij. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith that the angle in a semicircle is a right angle, because it is the halfe of two right angles, which is all one in effect.</p>
               <p>The second part, <hi>That the angle of a
<figure/>
semicircle is lesser than a right angle</hi>; is manifest out of that, because it is the part of a right angle. For the angle of the semicircle <hi>a i e,</hi> is a part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilineall right angle <hi>a i u.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third part, That it is greater than any acute angle; is manifest out of the 23. e x v. For otherwise a tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent were not on the same part one onely and no more.</p>
               <p>The fourth part is thus made manifest: The angle at <hi>i,</hi> in the greater section <hi>a e i,</hi> is lesser than a right angle; because it is in the same triangle <hi>a e i,</hi> which at <hi>a,</hi> is right angle. And if neither of the shankes be by the center, notwithstanding an angle may be made equall to the assigned in the same section.</p>
               <p>The fifth is thus: The angle of the greater section <hi>e a i,</hi> is greater than a right angle; because it containeth a right-angle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:8774:117"/>The sixth is thus, the angle <hi>a o e,</hi> in a lesser section, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a right angle, by the 14 e x v j. Because that which is in the opposite section, is lesser than a right angle.</p>
               <p>The seventh is thus. The angle <hi>e a o,</hi> is lesser than a right-angle: Because it is part of a right angle, to wit of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter angle, if <hi>i a,</hi> be drawne out at length</p>
               <p>And thus much of the angles of a circle, of all which the most effectuall and of greater power and use is the angle in a semicircle, and therefore it is not without cause so often mentioned of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> This Geometry therefore of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> let us somewhat more fully open and declare. For from hence doe arise many things.</p>
               <p>Therefore</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>If two right lines jointly bounded with the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of a circle, be jointly bounded in the periphery, they doe make a right angle.</hi>

               <p>As let the unequall secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be <hi>e i o,</hi> and <hi>e a o</hi>: the tangent let it be <hi>u e y</hi>: And the angles in the opposite sections, <hi>e a o,</hi> and <hi>e i o.</hi> I say they are equall in the alterne angles of the secant and touch line <hi>o e y,</hi> and <hi>o e u.</hi> First that which is at <hi>a,</hi> is equall to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne <hi>o e y:</hi> Because also three angles <hi>o e y, o e a,</hi> and <hi>a e u,</hi> are equall to two right angles, by the 14 e v.

               <head>Of <hi>Geometry</hi> the seventeenth Booke, Of the Adscription of a Circle and Triangle.</head>
               <p>HItherto we have spoken of the Geometry of Rectili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall plaines, and of a circle: Now followeth the Adscription of both: This was generally defined in the first book 12 e. Now the periphery of a circle is the bound therof. Therefore a rectilineall is inscribed into a circle, when the periphery doth touch the angles of it 3 d iiij. It is circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed when it is touched of every side by the periphery; 4 d iij.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If a rectilineall ascribed unto a circle be an equilater, it is equiangle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the inscript it is manifest; And that of a Triangle by it selfe: Because if it be equilater, it is equiangle, by the 19 e vj. But in a Triangulate the matter is to be prooved by demonstration. As here, if the inscripts <hi>o u,</hi> and <hi>s y,</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, then doe they subtend equall peripheries, by the 32
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8774:120"/>
e x v. Then if you doe omit the
<figure/>
periphery in the middest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them hoth, as here <hi>u y,</hi> and shalt adde <hi>o i e s</hi> the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to each of them, the whole <hi>o i e s y,</hi> subtended to the angle at <hi>u</hi>: And <hi>u o i e s,</hi> subtended to the angle at <hi>y,</hi> shall be equall. Therefore the angles in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphery, insisting upon equall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripheries are equall.</p>
               <p>Of the circumscript it is likewise true, if the circumscript be understood to be a circle. For the perpendiculars from the center <hi>a,</hi> unto the sides of the circumscript, by the 9e xij, shal make triangles on each side equilaters, &amp; equiangls, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the semidiameters unto the corners, as in the same exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is equall to a triangle of equall base to the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, but of heighth to the perpendicular from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the side.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:8774:120"/>As here is manifest, by the 8 e vij. For there are in one triangle, three triangles of equall heighth.</p>
               <p>The same will fall out in a Triangulate, as here in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate: For here shal be made foure triangles of equall height.</p>
               <p>Lastly every equilater rectilineall ascribed to a circle, shall be equall to a triangle, of base equall to the perimeter of the adscript. Because the perimeter conteineth the bases of the triangles, into the which the rectilineall is resolved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Like rectilinealls inscribed into circles, are one to another as the quadrates of their diameters,</hi> 1 <hi>p.</hi> x i j.</p>
               <p>Because by the 1 e vj, like plains have a doubled reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their homologall sides. But in rectilineals inscribed the diameters are the homologall sides, or they are proportionall to their homologall sides. As let the like rectangled triangles be <hi>a e i,</hi> and <hi>o u y</hi>; Here because <hi>a e</hi> and <hi>o u,</hi> are the diameters, the
<figure/>
matter appeareth to be plaine at the first sight. But in the Obliquangled triangles, <hi>s e i,</hi> and <hi>r u y,</hi> alike also, the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are proportionall to their homologall sides, to wit, <hi>e i</hi> and <hi>u y.</hi> For by the grant, as <hi>s e</hi> is to <hi>r u</hi>: so is <hi>e i</hi> to <hi>u y,</hi> And therefore, by the former, <hi>a s</hi> the diameter <hi>e a</hi> and <hi>u o.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like Triangulates, seeing by the 4 e x, they may be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into like triangles, the same will fall out.</p>
               <p>Therefore</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:8774:121"/>4. <hi>If it be as the diameter of the circle is unto the side of rectilineall inscribed, so the diameter of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond circle be unto the side of the second rectilineall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and the severall triangles of the inscripts be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and likely situate, the rectilinealls inscribed shall be alike and likely situate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Euclide</hi> did thus assume at the 2 p xij, and indeed as it seemeth out of the 18 p vj. Both which are conteined in the 23 e iiij. And therefore we also have assumed it.</p>
               <p>Adscription of a Circle is with any triangle: But with a triangulate it is with that onely which is ordinate: And indeed adscription of a Circle is common <hi>to all.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>If two right lines doe cut into two equall parts two angles of an assigned rectilineall, the circle of the ray from their meeting perpendicular unto the side, shall be inscribed unto the assigned rectilineall.</hi> 4 <hi>and</hi> 8. <hi>p. iiij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in the
<figure/>
Triangle <hi>a e i,</hi> let the right lines <hi>a o,</hi> and <hi>e u,</hi> halfe the angles <hi>a</hi> and <hi>e:</hi> And from <hi>y,</hi> their meeting, let the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars unto the sides be <hi>y o, y u, y s</hi>; I say that the center <hi>y,</hi> with the ray <hi>y o,</hi> or <hi>y a,</hi> or <hi>y s,</hi> is the circle inscribed, by the 17 e x v. Because the halfing lines with the perpendiculars shall make equilater triangles, by the 2 e vij. And therefore the three perpendiculars, which are the bases of the equila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, shall be equall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:8774:121"/>The same argument shall serve in a Triangulate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If two right lines do right anglewise cut into two equall parts two sides of an assigned rectilineall, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the ray from their meeting unto the angle, shall be circumscribed unto the assigned rectilineall.</hi> 5 <hi>p iiij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in the former figures. The demonstration is the same with the former. For the three rayes, by the 2 e vij, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall: And the meeting of them, by the 17 ex, is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And thus is the common adscription of a circle: The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of a rectilineall followeth, and first of a Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>If two inscripts, from the touch point of a right line and a periphery, doe make two angles on each side e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to two angles of the triangle assigned be knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they shall inscribe a triangle into the circle given, equiangular to the triangle given è</hi> 2 <hi>p iiij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Triangle <hi>a e i</hi> be given: And the circle <hi>o,</hi> into which a Triangle equiangular to the triangle given, is to be inscribed. Therefore let the

               <p>The circumscription here is also speciall.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Let there be a Triangle, and in it the outter angles <hi>a e i,</hi> and <hi>a o u</hi>: The Circle let it be <hi>y s r</hi>; And in the center <hi>l,</hi> let the angles <hi>y l r,</hi> and <hi>s l r</hi>; at the common side <hi>l r,</hi> bee made equall to the said outter angles <hi>a e i,</hi> and <hi>a o u.</hi> I say the angles

               <p>OVt of the Adscription of a Circle and a Rectilineall is drawne the Geodesy of ordinate Multangles, and first of the Circle it selfe. For the meeting of two right lines e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, dividing two angles is the center of the circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Circle: From the center unto the angle is the ray: And then if the quadrate of halfe the side be taken out of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate of the ray, the side of the remainder shall be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, by the 9 e xij. Therefore a speciall theoreme is here thus make:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A plaine made of the perpendicular from the center unto the side, and of halfe the perimeter, is the content of an ordinate multangle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As here; The quadrate of 10, the ray is 100. The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate of 6, the halfe of the side 12, is 36: And 100. 36 is 64, the quadrate of the Perpendicular, whose side 8, is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular it selfe. Now the
<figure/>
whole periphery of the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quangle, is 60. The halfe thereof therefore is 30. And the product of 30, by 8, is 240, for the content of the sayd quinquangle.</p>
               <p>The Demonstration here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is of the certaine antecedent cause thereof. For of five tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles in a quinquangle, the plaine of the perpendicular, and of halfe the base is one of them, as in the former hath beene taught: Therefore five
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8774:128"/>
such doe make the whole quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quangle.
<figure/>
But that multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a multiplication of the Perpendicular by the Perimeter or bout-line.</p>
               <p>In an ordinate Sexangle also the ray, by the 9 e xviij, is knowne by the side of the sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> As here, the quadrate of 6, the ray is 36. The quadrate of 3, the halfe of the side, is 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> And 36—9. are 27, for the quadrate of the Perpendicular, whose side 5 12/11 is the perpendicular it selfe. Now the whole perimeter, as you see, is 36. Therefore the halfe is 18. And the product of 18 by 5 2/11 is 93 3/11 for the content of the sexangle given.</p>
               <p>Lastly in all ordinate Multangles this theoreme shall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The periphery is the triple of the diameter and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most one seav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Or the Periphery conteineth the diameter three times and almost one seventh of the same diameter. That it is the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it, sixe raies, (that is three
<figure/>
diameters) about which the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery, by the 9 e xviij, is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed doth plainely shew: And therefore the continent is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But the excesse is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so much as one seventh part. For there doth want an unity of one seventh: And yet is the same excesse farre greater than one eighth part. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the difference was neerer to one seventh, than it was to one eighth, therefore one seventh was taken, as neerest unto the truth, for the truth it selfe.</p>
               <p>Therefore</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:8774:129"/>3. <hi>The plaine of the ray, and of halfe the periphery is the content of the circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For here 7, the ray, of halfe the diameter 14, Multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 22, the halfe of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphery
<figure/>
44, maketh the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long 154, for the content of the circle. In the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two opposite sides, and likewise in the perime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the two other opposite sides of the rectangle are contemed. Therefore the halfes of those two are taken, of the which the rectangle is comprehended.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>As</hi> 14 <hi>is unto</hi> 11, <hi>so is the quadrate of the diameter unto the Circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For here 3 bounds of the proportion are given in <hi>potentia</hi>: The fourth is found by the multiplication of the third by the second, and by the Division of the product by the first: As here the Quadrate of the diameter 14, is 196. The product of 196 by 11 is 2156. Lastly 2156 divided by 14, the first bound, giveth in the Quotient 154, for the content of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle sought. This ariseth by an analysis out of the quadrate and Circle measured. For the reason of 196, unto a 154; is the reason of 14 unto 11, as will appeare by the reduction of the bounds.</p>
               <p>This is the second manner of squaring of a circle taught by <hi>Euclide</hi> as <hi>Hero</hi> telleth us, but otherwise layd downe, namely after this manner. <hi>If from the quadrate of the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you shall take away</hi> 3/14 <hi>parts of the same, the remainder shall be the content of the Circle.</hi> As if 196, the quadrate be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by 14, the quotient likewise shall be 14. Now thrise 14, are 42: And 196—42, are 154, the quadrate equall to the circle.</p>
               <p>Out of that same reason or rate of the pheriphery and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8774:129"/>
ariseth the manner of measuring of the Parts of a circle, as of a Semicircle, a Sector, a Section, both greater and lesser.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The plaine of the ray and one quarter of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphery, is the content of the semicircle.</hi>

               <p>As here thou seest: For
<figure/>
the product of 7, the halfe of the diameter, multiplyed by 11, the quarter of the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery, doth make 77, for the content of the semicircle.</p>
               <p>This may also be done by taking of the halfe of the circle now measured.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The plaine made of the ray and halfe the base, is the content of the Sector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are three sectours, <hi>a e</hi> the base of 12 foote: And <hi>e i</hi> in like manner of 12 foote. The

other or remainder <hi>i a</hi> of 7 <hi>f.</hi> and 3/7 of one foote. The diameter is 10 foote. Multiply therefore 5, halfe of the diameter, by 6 halfe of the base, and the product 30, shall be the content of the first sector. The same shall also be for the second sectour. Againe multiply the same ray or semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters 5, by 3 5/7, the halfe of 7 3/7, the product 18 4/7 shall be the content of the third sector. Lastly, 30—30—18 4/7 are 78 4/7, the content of the whole circle.</p>
               <p>And</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the former figure the greater section is <hi>a e i:</hi> The lesser is <hi>a i.</hi> The base of them both is as you see, 6. The perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular from the toppe of the triangle, or his heighth is 4. Therefore the content of the triangle is 12. Wherefore 30—30—12, that is 72, is the content of the greater section <hi>a e i.</hi> And the lesser sectour, as in the former was taught, is 184/7.

               <p>So the plaine made of the diameter 14. and of 44. the

greatest periphery, which is 616. is the sphericall surface. So before the content of a circle was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by a rectangle both of the halfe diameter, and periphery. But here, by the whole periphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and whole diameter, there is made a rectangle for the measure of the sphericall, foure times so great as was that other: Because by the 1 e vj. like plaines (such as here are conceived to be made of both halfe the diameter, and halfe the periphery, and both of the whole diameter and whole periphery) are in a doubled reason of their homologall sides.</p>

Therefore there one single circle is made, here the quadruple of that. This is, therefore the analogy of a circle and sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall; from whence ariseth the hemispherical, the greater and the lesser section.</p>

               <p>As in the example, the part of

the third ray, that is, of 3/7, is from the center: such like part of the hemispherical 308, is 132. (For the 7, part of 308. is 44. And three times 44. is 132.)

The base of a pyramis was but one: Of a Prisma, they are two, and they opposite one against another, First equall; Then like: Next parallell. The other are parallelogramme.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As in the example a prisma pentaedrum is cut into three equall pryramides. For the first consisting
<figure/>
of the plaines <hi>a e i, a e o, a o i, e i o</hi>; is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the second consisting of the plaines <hi>a o i, a o u, a i u, a u y,</hi> by the 10 e vij. Because it is equall to it both in common base and heighth. Therefore the first and second are equall. And the same second is equall to it selfe, seeing the base is <hi>i o u,</hi> and the toppe <hi>a.</hi> Then also it is equall to the third consisting of the plaines <hi>a i u, a i y, u i y, a u y.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three are equall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:8774:141"/>If the base be triangular, the Prisma may be resolved into prisma's of triangular bases, and the theoreme shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as afore.</p>
               <p>Therefore</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The plaine made of the base and the third part of the heighth is the solidity of a pyramis of equall base and heighth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The heighth of a pyramis shall be found, if you shall take the square of the ray of the base out of the quadrate of the side: for the side of the remainder, by the 9 e xij, shall be the altitude or heighth, as in the

example following.</p>
               <p>Here the content of the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle by the 18 e xij, is found to be 62 44/125 for the base of the pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis. The altitude is 9 15/19: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the 6 e xviij, the side is of treble power to the ray. But if from 144, the quadrate of 12 the side, you take the subtriple <hi>i.</hi> 48, the remainder 96, by the 9 e x ij, shall be the square of the heighth. And the side of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate shall be 9 15/19. Now the third part
<figure/>
of 9 15/19 is 3 5/19. And the plaine of 62 44/125 and 3 5/19, shall be 203 1103/2375 for the soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the pyramis.</p>
               <p>So in the example following, Let 36, the quadrate of 6 the ray, be taken out of 292 9/1156 the quadrate of the side 17 3/34 the side 16 3/34 of 256 9/1156 the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shall be the height, whose third part is 5 37/102; the plaine of which by the base 72 ¼ shall be 387 11/24 for the solidity of the pyramis given.</p>
               <p>If the pyramis be unperfit, first measure the whole, and then that part which is wanting: Lastly from the whole
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8774:141"/>
subtract that which was wanting, and the remaine shall be the solidity of the unperfect pyramis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<figure/>
As here, let <hi>a o,</hi> the side of the whole be 16 5/12: <hi>e o,</hi> the side of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular be 8 1/16. Therefore the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the whole <hi>o u,</hi> shall be 15 5/32: Whose third part is 5 5/96: Of which, and the base 93 3/11 the plaine shall be 471 134/1056 for the whole pyramis. But in the lesser pyramis, 9 the square of the ray 3, taken out of 65 1/256 the quadrate of the side 8 1/16 the remaine shall be 56 1/256; whose side is almost 7 ½ for the heighth. The third part of which is 2 ½. The base likewise is almost 22. The plaine of which two is 55, for the solidity of the lesser pyramis: And 471—55 is 416, for the imperfect pyramis.</p>
               <p>After this manner you may measure an imperfect Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:</p>

               <p>The reason is, because they consist equally of like number

               <p>As for example, the side 12, let it be cut into two seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments 10 and 2.

Let therefore a cube be made of three equall sides, 12, 12, and 12: And first of all let the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond side be multiplied by the first, after this manner: And not adding the severall figures of the same degree, as was taught in multiplication, but multiply againe every one of them by the other side; and lastly, add the figures of the same degrees severally, thus:

               </p>
               <p>In that equation therefore of foure solids with one solid, thou shalt consider a peculiar making and composition: First that the last cube be made of the last segment 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus much of the Cube: Of other sorts of parallele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipedes, as of the Oblong, the Rhombe, the Rhomboides, and of the Trapezium, and many flatted pentaedra's there is no

peculiar stereometry. The measuring of a Prisma hath in the former beene generally declared, and is now onely farther be made more plaine by speciall examples; as here:
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>The plaine of the perimeter of the base 20, and the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 5 is 100. This added to 25 and 25, both the bases that is to 50, maketh 150, for the whole surface. Now the plaine of 25 the base, and the heighth 5 is 125, for the whole solidity.</p>
               <p>So in the Oblong, the plaine of the base's perimeter 20, and the heighth 11, is 220, which added to the bases 24 and 24, that is 48, maketh 268, for the whole surface. But the plaine of the base 24, and the height 11, is 264, for the solidity.</p>
               <p>The same also Geodesie or manner of measuring is used in the measuring of rectangled walls or gates and doores, which have either any window, or any hollow

The thickenesse is 3 foote; the breadth 12, the heighth 11. Therefore the whole solidity is 396. Now the Gate way is of thickenesse 3 foote, of breadth 4: of heighth 6. And therefore the whole solidity of the Gate is 72 foote. But 396—72 are 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the second example, the length is 10. The breadth 8, the heighth 7. Therefore the whole body if it were found, were 560 foote. But there is an hollow in it, whose length is 6, breadth 4, heighth 7. Therefore the cavity or hollow

place is 168. Now 560 — 168 is 492, for the solidity of the rest of the sound body.</p>
               <p>Thus are such kinde of walls whether of mudde, bricke, or stone, of most large houses to bee measured. The same manner of Geodesy is also to be used in the measuring of a Rhombe, Rhomboides, Trapezium or mensall, and any kinde of multangled body. The base is first to be measured, as in the former: Then out of that and the heighth the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity shall be manifested: As in the Rhombe the base is 24, the heighth 4. Therefore the solidity is 96.</p>
               <p>In the Rhomboides, the base is 64 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Archimides,</hi> maketh mention of such kinde of Sectours, in his 1 booke of the Spheare. From hence also is the geodesy following drawne. And here also is there a certaine analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with a circular sectour.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>A plaine made of the diameter, and sixth part of the greater, or lesser sphearicall, is the greater or lesser sector.</hi>

                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:8774:161"/>As here of the Diameter 14,

and of 73 ⅓ and 4 ⅔ (which is the one sixth part of the greater sphearicall) the plaine is 1026 ⅔ for the solidity of the greater sectour, so of the same diameter 14, and 29 ⅓ which is the ⅙ part of 176, the lesser sphaericall, the plaine is 410 ⅔ for the solidity of the lesser sectour.</p>
               <p>And from hence lastly doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise the solidity of the section, by addition and subduction.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>If the greater sectour be increased with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cone, the whole shall be the greater section: If the lesser be diminished by it, the remaine shall be the lesser section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As here the inner cone measured is 126 4/63. The greater sectour, by the former was 1026 ⅔. And 126 ⅔— 126 4/63 doe make 1152 46/63.</p>
               <p>Againe the lesser sectour, by the next precedent, was 410 ⅔: And here the inner cone is 126 4/63 And therefore 410 2/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
