            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>¶How be it good reders what one thynge or twayne specyally moued

            <p>¶As soone as myne apologye was ones come out abrode, anone herde I worde that some were very wrothe therwyth. And yet in my mynde had there no man cause, neyther precher, nor pacyfyer, no nor none heretyke neyther. For I hadde but spoken for my selfe, and for good folke, and for the catholyke fayth / without reproch or reprofe to any mannes person, or wyllyng any man any harme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were wyllyng to mende. And who so were wyllyng to be nought styll, had cause to be wroth wyth hym self you wote well and not with me.</p>

            <p>¶But in good fayth I coulde but laugh at that. For as for that pyece, I was very sure that the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nyngest man that coulde come therto, neyther in tenne shetys nor in tenne querys neyther, wryte as nere as he coulde, sholde neuer answere it well.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10575:9"/>¶Now where this good man decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth what thynge an Apologye ys, and sayth that yt is an answere or a defence / for whych cause he the more meruaileth, that I wold in that boke wryte agaynste any treatyse of hys, who neuer hadde any thynge wryten against any worke of myn / as though that therfore my wrytynge agaynste his worke wold in no wise agre with the name of my boke: I myghte an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere hym that the touchynge of his boke, was but an incident as I shew in the .100. lefe of my sayde boke, and not my pryncypall mater / and therfore of many noughty thynges I touche there but a fewe, and suche as were in no wyse to be dissembled.</p>

               <p>&amp;And where he goeth about nowe for to confute yt: there ys not in all the remanaunt of hys answere one pyece that any thyng appeyreth any poynte of myne Apologye. How be yt of trouthe in thys poynte he goeth moste nere me. For thys an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere hathe he made in suche maner wyse, that I shall haue nowe myche more a do then I than hadde, to make any wyse man wene that euer hym selfe ment well.</p>

               <p>¶And the more the man denieth that thynge hym selfe: the more he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth yt lykely to be trew. For when in the thynges that so playne appere so nought, he rather taketh the mater all whole vppon hym, then suffreth any parte to be layed from hym, but if the man haue an importune pryde, as by goddes grace he hath not: elles is yt a sure sygne and a good token, that he is suche a good symple soule as soone may be deceyued / while we se that his wit serueth hym no better, but that he wolde rather appere ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lycyouse then vnwyse.</p>
               <p>¶But nowe that I haue proued hym that the name of Apologye, may serue very well for euery pyece of my boke: nowe wyll I somwhat

se how the maters of his boke agree well wyth the name therof. I mean not here hys boke of dyuysyon.

And therin of an hundred and syx leues (for so many be in the boke) there are scante fully fyftene, that any thynge agree wyth the name.</p>
               <p>¶Nowe yf he wyll saye that the communycacyon betwene Salem and Bizance, ys but a bye mater besyde, and that all the remanaunt bytwene theyre talkynges, ys the very boke: thanne ys yt worse / for then hathe hys booke neuer a name at all.</p>

               <p>¶I lyke also meruelousely well, that suche poyntes of the catholyke fayth as heretykes nowe labour to

But the better opynyon that I haue of his owne person therin, the more sory am I to se, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his bookes are by some shrewde counsayle handeled in such wyse, as if they were folowed / wolde make the faythe decaye and peryshe in many other folke. Thys is the greate thynge that in his bokes greueth me.</p>
               <p>¶For as for the poynt that he spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of in the lefe. 91, of that that the prestes shold eate no flesshe fro quin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quagesime to Easter: I take it for a mater as small as he dothe I.

But the lesse that the weyghte of the mater was / the more cause this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue me to speke therof. For the more was he to blame to put that and other suche smal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as that is, for causes of so great a diuisyon, as he surmyseth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is. This was lo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause that made me to speke therof. whych cause this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue hym selfe / and therfore nedeth not to meruayle as he doth, wherfore I spake therof.</p>
               <p>¶And therfore thus haue I good readers now replyed to euery chapy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of his boke by row, saue onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last thre which go about a good viage

<pb facs="tcp:10575:280"/>
And what is hys owne irrefragable reason that he layth agaynst all this? Surely no more as you se, but that by those lawes an innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme take wrong. Agaynste this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we lay hym, that yf this reason sholde stande, than agaynst malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours there could no law stande.

               <p>¶To thys answereth he, that he wyll not answere that.
