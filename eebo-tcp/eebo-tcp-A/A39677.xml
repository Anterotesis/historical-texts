            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N our last Letter we gave you an account of our first and second waiting on the King, we writ to you then, that his Majesty commanded us to attend him yesterday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thursday, to heare what he said to the Gentlemen, which a little before the meeting he seconded by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Message. Being come thither, his Majesty caused the severall Messages between him and the Parliament, mentioned in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed paper printed to be read.</p>
            <p>This was done with much humming and applause of the Kings Messages, by some persons who had placed themselves neere about where the King stood. But when any thing from the Parliament came to be read, with so much hissing and reviling the Parliament, that though in respect and duty to the Kings person we could not resent it, as otherwise we should have done; yet have since expostulated, and complained of it to his Majesty. Some were so bold as to say openly, That the Parliament-men should set their houses in order, for many of them should shortly have their heads off: One of which (as since we are credibly informed) was one <hi>Hurst,</hi> a servant to one Master <hi>William Crofts.</hi> In this which was said by the King, you will see what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we had to vindicate our selves, and therefore we immediately repayred to the Deanes house with all the other Gentlemen, and there we took notice of the rough usage we had received; We told them that it was neither indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion nor disobedience in us (as his Majesty was pleased to call it) to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Parliaments Message, or to stay here though commanded to the contrary, since we conceived no man needed to be satisfied in so cleare a case as this. That every Member of each House ought to obey their commands, when they were pleased to employ them. But since his Majesty thought fit to bid them take heed of us, not knowing what doctrine of disobedience we might preach to them, under colour of obeying the Parliament; we apppea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to every man, whether we had in word or deed, in publick or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, done any thing that became not honest men, and persons employed from the Parliament. That we had communicated our Instructions to his Majesty, being that we would avow all our actions, and that we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it would not be said we had transgressed them. This was very well taken and justified by the Countrey. Yesterday there came divers thousands of Freeholders to this City, though none but the Gentry were summoned, but
<pb facs="tcp:109867:2"/>
receiving a command from the King not to come to Court, they forbore, and stayed in the Castle yard, yet sent this Petition enclosed to his Majesty, and received the Answere annexed thereunto. There was likewise a Committee of twelve Gentlemen appointed yesternight to consider of drawing up an Answer to the Kings proposition concerning a Guard: but nothing could be then done, because it was past 3. a clock, before the Gentleman were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King. This morning the Freeholders assembled again in the Castle yard, and there they made this Protestation enclosed, of their right of voting in what concerneth the Peace of the country, as having their interest therein.</p>
            <p>When we all met all this morning againe at the Deans house, we who are your Committees received this Message by Sir <hi>Edward Stanhope,</hi> That hee came from his Majesty to command us, that wee should depart from this meeting; and if we did stay, his Majesty would judge us guilty of that hee spake of yesterday, which was, <hi>Tampering.</hi> Notwithstanding which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, we read the fourth Article of our Instructions to the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that being pertinent to the businesse wee were then upon; and desired them to consider, whether the Parliament had not expressed therein such a care of the Kings safety, that there would be little need of Guards: Wee told them that we had a good right of being there as Free-holders of the County, but that in obedience to the King we would depart for this time; but whensoever there should be occasion of our being there, in pursuance of our Instructions and Commands from the Parliament, we should be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The whole Company received great satisfaction, and desired a Copy of that instruction; which we gave them. We were the more willing at that time to goe from thence, because we should not onely give obedience to the Kings command, which otherwise he would have said wee constantly disobeyed; but because the Committee of Twelve appointed ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternight were then to withdraw; so that there was nothing for the present for us to do: We immediately went to the King, and besought him that since we were continually so discountenanced by him, in the face of our Country, that he would be pleased to let us know in particular wherein we had given the occasion; for we otherwise conceived we were deprived of that Liberty, which was our due in respect of that Interest we had here. His Majesty was pleased to tell us, that if we would lay aside that Condition of Committees from the Parliament, he would not hinder us to be there as Gentlemen of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Countrey: We humbly replyed, That we could not lay that downe, nor could we be absent from any meeting where our presence was required, for the service as Committees from the Parliament: To which his Majesty said, That indeed he thought we could not lay it down, neither that it was reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable we should have Votes, and be in a double capacity. The Committee hath been here most part of this day, but not agreeing, sixe of them have
<pb facs="tcp:109867:3"/>
drawn up this Answer enclosed, which they have communicated to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Freeholders: The greater part of the Gentlemen, and all the Free-holders have agreed to, and subscribed it. The other sixe have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon this other Answer, consenting to a guard of Horse; but this we do not heare they have gotten many names to, nor can we get a Copie of those names as yet, though these be very few, yet whether they can bring in any Horse or no, we cannot yet judge. The King hath received both these reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which with his Answers to them you shall likewise have here inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. His Majesty had declared himselfe yesterday, that he would raise that Regiment which was Sir <hi>Robert Stricklands,</hi> for his foot guard: But he hath now laid aside that resolution. The Free-holders of the County are now newly summoned to attend his Majesty about a week hence, the three Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings upon three severall dayes; but for what service we know not.</p>
            <p>Sir, you have here a large Narrative of the passages at this Meeting, what dangers this poore Countrey lies under. We humbly refer it to you to judge, not taking upon us to deliver any opinion. The businesse lasted so long, that is hindered us from giving a more speedy account. Sir, this is what at this time is sent from</p>

            <p>That he doth totally discover proceedings complained in of the Petition, and expects that you and all other his loyal Subjects shall rest satisfied with his severall Gracious Declarations and constant peaceable practice towards his people to the contrary, and for further assurance upon just proofe made against any man who hath committed any violence in words or actions (without just provocation) full reparation shall be given to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties injured. As for the rest of this Petition, his Majesty saith that it is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused that he doth not well know what positive Answer to give it. And the rather because it is grounded upon misinformation, both of his Majesties proceedings and intentions, as in particular, his Majesty saith he never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have you to be judges betwixt him and his Parliament. And for the other part of this Petition hee referres to his Messages, Declarations, and Answers, whereby it will clearely appeare that his desire and intention is onely the preserving of the true protestant profession, the lawes of the land, the Libertie of his people, the peace of the Kingdome: And the peace of this County in particular.</p>
