         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Would it had bin PERCEVALS hap, to haue com to the beginning of a friendly feast, or to the latter ending of so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a fraye. And I thought I had bin faire for it at the first: for plodding through Alders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, all armed as I was, with a quarter Ashe
<pb facs="tcp:4053:3"/>
staffe on my shoulder, and an emptie belly vnder my northern belt, I spied me, a large P. with a wide mouth like a porradge pott, and being quicksented thrust forward on the trale, and found it was Papp. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, what the goodere came into my minde, but somewhat it was, that persuaded me to trie before I tasted, and looke before I licked: And though my sharpset-stomach would haue straight fell into acquaintance, by reason of some auncient familiaritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a western fellow, and a whitpot: yet bearing a braine as well as a belly, I stood sauntring ouer it, like a whelp that had scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his mouth with lapping vp hotte water Grewell: till I found that it was no meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for PERCEVALL, but rather a bone for MARTIN to digest, if his stomach wold serue him: for though the first ladlefull had a smacke as soft as pap, the next morsell, a taste as sweet as a fig, and so forth: yet I see he that was Cooke and Cater, thought to feed MARTIN with these nunchio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, as men feed Apes: with a bit &amp; a boxe on the eare.
<pb facs="tcp:4053:3"/>
Why but soft maisters, faire plaie and no snatching: is your feasting turned to a fray? put vp, put vp your weapons, and be some wiser then some. They were neuer tall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of their hands that were such hacksters in the street: nor euer prooued old wringers indeed, that sell out at their belly mettall. Go to MARTIN, go to: I know a man is a man, though he haue but a hose on his head (&amp; thou hast a close house on thine) but the greatest quarrellers meet often with their ouer-match. Putcase thou hadst a good cause (as alas I am a plaine fellow and not giuen to swearing) yet a couple of these late Roysters would marre ten MARTINS, at the cracking of a stage Iest. They haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guy Clubfists, the one with his Counter-Cuffe, the other with his Country Cuffe, would quickly make a blew MARTIN. And you on the other side: what neede all this stir? this banding of kilcowes to fight with a shadow? If I were at home, within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctes of mine owne domination, I would charge you in Gods name and the Queens,
<pb facs="tcp:4053:4"/>
to put vp your whinyards, you are men inough, able to deale one to one at handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gripes, come cut and long taile: why should you offer to take the adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tage of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ground? Truly, truly, I will present you at the law day for a ryot, though I be neither side man for this Meridian, nor Warden, but to ward my selfe as I walke. There is more danger in breaking the Queenes Maiesties peace, then you are aware of. That mad companion MARTIN, you know, plaies least in sight, and serues you, as Aeneas ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Turnus, to make him fight with a mist in steed of a man: he doth but send his picture, to make triall of your affection towards him, as (my boy at home saies) Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus did, to search the humors of the Roman Senate. If you had vsed his Image somwhat more gentlie, within this space, hee would haue appeared in his likenes, incarnated or incased in some knaues skin or other I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you: beare with one grosse terme, so as I make no custome of it. Come on therfore MARTIN and the rest, house your selues
<pb facs="tcp:4053:4"/>
in the next Tauerne, I will set my selfe (not a knaue betweene two honest men) but as a good fellow, betwixt the shadow of MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIN, and the naturall shape of your selues, to trie whether I can stint this, Hold my dagger from your throat, or no.</p>

Such copsmates would be examined, if it were but for Alcumist: &amp; such a kind hart Chronicled, if it were but for a foole.</p>
            <p>All this wind shakes none of my Corne, quoth <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceuall,</hi> whereupon Gossip Reason the chiefe actor in the pageant of my braine, and high speaker in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament of my deuise, began this motherly, and well powdered tale.

stufe to k√©epe a man from crossing the bowling Alley, for feare of a broken shin. Or it moues me as much as <note place="margin">Two ancient standers, that Senior and the post.</note> the fatherly rebuke of an old stander, moude that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity post, which s√©emed to take the wall of a Senior. I cannot though you should bind me to such a stubborn post, as that graue student met with in the darke, but carry one bucket of water, when I heare the bels ring backward, and the fire runne forward. They were in a fault, where the fire first began': but first and last, helpe, quench all; or else these high flying sparks will light on the heads of vs all, and kindle in our bedstraw, if other folkes lodging be no better then mine. Well fare London yet, for a policie besides water (which they put in practise too lately, the more was the pitty:) pull downe the houses burning, lest they catch hold on their neighbors. I, but you talke of cost, and commission. That tricke would aske a long pole and a hoke, and my quarter stafe is too short, except a man stood on tiptoe. But now I remember my selfe, neuer will I ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine my strength, nor play at hand ouer head so high, but where I may f√©ele sure footing.</p>
            <p>Giue me my spectacles, that I may s√©e whether I dreame, or whether these sights be all in good sadnes, which I behold, sometime these madcaps be at a fray: sometimes at a feast: it makes no matter whether it be plaine dealing or iugling, take them at the best, and sit downe to their banket. And sith <hi>Martin</hi> and his brood hath furnished the first course, with sundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, &amp; saweed them throughly: and againe his heauie frinds <hi>Pasquill, Marforius,</hi> and the fresh Cater of late, haue counter coursd him, with messes somewhat hoat of the spice: (for the Pay had corns of long Pepper as big as a hatchet:) I follow like a plaine dunstable Groome, with salt and spoones on a trencher. Ind√©ede you say true, <hi>Sal sapit omnia:</hi> and seruice without salt,

Make brine for your bull biefe, that it may sucke out those swelling corrupt affections that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine some what rancke in the flesh. As for my spoons, those I brought, that I &amp; my companions might haue one slap at the Spoone meat, wherein <hi>Martin</hi> boasted <note place="margin">Martin cald his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments spoon meat in his protest.</note> his Cookery: and the other set out their skill. They had n√©ede be large long Spoons (say you) if I come to f√©ed with such whipsters. Let me alone, for my actiuity, at the dish meat, and a long arme, though my scoope be the shorter. <hi>Perceuall,</hi> you are somewhat a mery man, as well as the rest, according to your homely Countrey fashion. Mary sir, there is somewhat in it beside true working, and a Gods name, quoth the good-man, that checkt his wife, for hopping about the house, and telling what the schollers of Oxford paid for their good cheare: when he no sooner stept ouer the threshold, but fell into the same tune and taking; <hi>and about they went.</hi> My Masters be ware of <hi>Martins</hi> circle, for if his frinds or his foes chop into it vnawares, they are like to daunce after his pipe, and set themselues vpon a miry pinne, (for so doth he) till his vnderpinning will faile him, I doubt.</p>
            <p>Come on <hi>Martin,</hi> put out (as the passenger said to the Miller) not a knaues head, no k√©epe in, thou art wiser then so, yet if wind doe not faile th√©e, thy late Customers, which play more sacks to the mill, haue brought greists or iests at least wise to be ground. If thy mill stones be not worne too blunt, for want of pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, there is picking meat for th√©e: make meale of it, and take large tole to the enriching of the <hi>Tolbot</hi> thou talkest off.</p>
            <p>

either thou art well set en worke, or else, thou hast wind at will to thy sailes.</p>
            <p>I pray th√©e make once an <hi>auricular confession,</hi> tell me in mine eare: is the desire of <hi>Reformation</hi> so d√©ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted in thine hart, as the terme is often prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thy papers? Is it conscience or lucre, that spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals thy hackney pen, to force it take so high a hedge, as thou leapest at? I haue s√©ene as mad a trick as this, when a Rancke rider hath put his horse to a hedge, and lay in the ditch for his labor. Thy foming mealy mouth betokeneth stomacke, and yoong vnbridled fits, for all that fatherly countenance, &amp; graue vizard which sometimes thou vsest to plead the cause of thy <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> vnder. No no, you vse the nostrils too much, and to many vnseasoned frumps, to come of that raze, that sincerely in time of superstition required <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Whow? I go about to disgrace th√©e? No no I come but by the way of intreaty, as it were with a becke to admonish th√©e, that thou putst the wrong foote before, and therefore pull backe. Yet beare with me, if I doubt whether all be gold that glistereth, sith <hi>Saint Martins</hi> rings be but Copper within, though they be gilt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, sayes the Goldsmith.

Wel <hi>Martin, Sustine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunc,</hi> stand by a trice, but looke you depart not the court, in paine of mine Indignation. Thou shalt perceiue that like a good sempster, I can cut euen by a thr√©ed, and part this quarrell without partiality. If I vse indifferency, call me not <hi>Iohn Indifferent</hi> now, for my good will: or if I lay my helping hand, to the cure of such a broile, without breach of peace, or danger of riot; say not thou as an olde <hi>Pasquill</hi> said being in a traunce of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse and modest <hi>Clarke Erasmus,</hi> that I hang houe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the mid way betwixt heauen and hell: He no doubt, misused, for fancie sake the memory of a good man deceased: and thou in so saying shouldst mistake the good meaning of one wel <hi>Disposed.</hi> Stand by I say, till thy turne comes about againe,</p>

Well then, let a poore mans tale be hard amongst you. <hi>Martin</hi> is the man and the marke you shoot your forked arrowes at: if you strike his face, you can raise no skin, for his forhead is brasse: nor fetch vp his blood, bicause he is giuen to blush no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> my black dog at home: welfare a faire face vpon an ill paire of shoulders yet: if you pearce his hart, you can doo him little harme, for he is liude like a Cat: strike his toong, the biternes of the same, will trace out the Author of the wound, like the fish <hi>Torpedo,</hi> which being towchd, sends her venime alongst line and angle rod, till it cease on the finger, and so mar a fisher for euer. Fie, fie, will you vpon a spl√©en, run vpon a Christen body, with full cry and open mouth? Though ind√©ed I cannot blame you, sith his proc√©edings were so vnchristianlike, if you tooke him for a Monster, or a Maddog: and so went about to worme him: but I am afraide such a carelesse curre, is cureles: wormes√©ede and reasons will doo him no good: and for other remedies that might come by insicion, his wormeaten Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>science refuseth, (as <hi>Dionysius</hi> did the hands of his Barbar, for feare lest mistaking his beard, he would haue cut his throat) and therefore k√©eps him out of your Clutches.

I wish that we had none of these toong-tide Curs, that cannot barke, nor say buffe to a woulfes shadow: if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But you that most cry out against them, why haue you brought them vp no better? Why haue you not taught some of those Puppes their lerrie? I will take it vpon the credit of my selfe, an vpstantiall yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that they most part of these mute shepheards are hatchd vp vnder the wing of those which beate most vpon the remoouing of dumbe dogs. I could giue you some examples in Bedfordshire: a whole rablement at least. A Preacher, if his conceipt be any thing swift, that he can rolle it in the pulpit, must haue his reader at his elbow, to fauor his voice. A Minister that hath any thing a fat benefice, and a full belly, will haue his Co-brother to assist him. And what must he be but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an halfe-peny boy, or an idle craftsman, that shall serue for meate, drinke and cloth, a little tutoring in Diuinitie, &amp; the reuersion of a benefice, when it fauls, where his godfathers commendatorie letters may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. I could well like that men of some desert and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment should haue their assistants, so they were Preachers, but you shall not take them in that fault.
