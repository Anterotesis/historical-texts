            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know not what pleaſure you could take in beſtowing your commands ſo unprofitably, unleſs it be that for which Nature ſometimes cheriſhes and allows Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, The love of Variety. This only delight you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by turning over this rude and unpoliſht Copy, and comparing it with my excellent Patterns, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> By this you will ſee how much a noble Subject is chang'd and disfigured by an ill hand, and what reaſon <hi>Alexander</hi> had to forbid his Picture to be drawn but by ſome celebrated Pencil. In <hi>Greek Thucydides</hi> ſo well and ſo lively expreſſes it, that I know not which is more a Poem, his deſcription, or that of <hi>Lucretius.</hi> Though it muſt be ſaid, that the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> had a vaſt advantage over the <hi>Poet</hi>; He having been preſent on the place, and aſſaulted by the diſeaſe himſelf, had the horror familiar to his Eyes, and all the ſhapes of the <hi>miſery</hi> ſtill remaining on his mind, which muſt needs make a great impreſſion on his Pen and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
<pb facs="tcp:48692:4"/>
Whereas the <hi>Poet</hi> was forced to allow his foot-ſteps, and onely work on that matter he allow'd him. This I ſpeak, becauſe it may in ſome meaſure too excuſe my own defects: For being ſo far remov'd from the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſeaſe acted his Tragedy; and time having denied us many of the circumſtances, cuſtomes of the Countrey, and other ſmall things which would be of great uſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one who did intend to be perfect on the ſubject; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides only writing by an <hi>Idaea</hi> of that which I never yet ſaw, nor care to feel, (being not of the humor of the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> who thruſt himſelf into the midſt of a Fight, that he might the better delineate it.) Having, I ſay, all theſe diſadvantages, and many more, for which I muſt onely blame my ſelf, it cannot be expected that I ſhould come near equalling him, in whom none of the contrary advantages were wanting. Thus then, Sir, by emboldning me to this raſh attempt, you have given op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> to Triumph over our <hi>Mother tongue.</hi> Yet I would not have the honour of the Countries or Languages engaged in the compariſon, but that the inequality ſhould reach no farther than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. But I have much reaſon to fear the juſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that excellent Perſon, (the preſent Ornament and Honour of our Nation) whoſe way of writing I imitate: for he may think himſelf as much injured by my follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, as were the Heavens by that bold man's counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the ſacred and unimitable noiſe of Thunder by the
<pb facs="tcp:48692:4"/>
ſound of Braſs and Horſes hoofs. I ſhall only ſay for my ſelf, that I took <hi>Cicero</hi>'s advice, who bids us in imitation propoſe the Nobleſt pattern to our thoughts; for ſo we may be ſure to be raiſed above the common Level, though we come infinitely ſhort of what we aim at. Yet I hope that renowned Poet will have none of my crimes any way reflect on himſelf; for it was not any fault in the excellent Muſician, that the weak Bird, indeavouring by ſtraining its throat, to follow his Notes, deſtroyed her ſelf in the Attempt. Well, Sir, by this, that I have choſen rather to expoſe my ſelf than be diſobedient, you may gheſs with what zeal and hazard I ſtrive to approve my ſelf,</p>

            <p>IN the very beginning of Summer, the <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> and their <hi>Confederates,</hi> with two thirds of their forces, as before invaded <hi>Attica,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Archidamus,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zeuxidamas,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> and after they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped themſelves, waſted the Countrey about them.</p>
            <p>They had not been many dayes in <hi>Attica,</hi> when the Plague firſt began amongſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſaid alſo to have ſeized formerly on divers other parts, as about <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and elſewhere; but ſo great a Plague, and Mortality of Men, was never remembred to have hapned in any place before. For at firſt, neither were the Phyſicians able to cure it, through ignorance of what it was, but died faſteſt themſelves, as being the men that moſt approach'd the ſick, nor any other art of man availed whatſoever. All ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the <hi>Gods,</hi> and enquiries of <hi>Oracles,</hi> and whatſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means they uſed of that kind, proved all unprofitable; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as ſubdued with the greatneſs of the evil, they gave them all over. It began (by report) firſt, in that part of <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> that lieth upon <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and thence fell down into <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Afrique,</hi> and into the greateſt part of the Territories of the <hi>King.</hi> It invaded <hi>Athens</hi> on a ſudden, and touched firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48692:6"/>
on thoſe that dwelt in <hi>Pyraeus,</hi> inſomuch as they reported that the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> had caſt poyſon into their Wells; for Springs there were not any in that place. But afterwards it came up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the high City, and then they died a great deal faſter. Now let every man, Phyſician, or other, concerning the ground of this ſickneſs, whence it ſprung, and what cauſes he thinks able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for great an alteration, ſpeak according to his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for my own part, I will deliver but the manner of it, and lay open only ſuch things, as one may take his Mark by, to diſcover the ſame if it come again, having been both ſick of it my ſelf, and ſeen others ſick of the ſame. This year, by confeſsion of all men, was of all other, for other Diſeaſes, moſt free and healthful. If any man were ſick before, his diſeaſe turned to this; if not, yet ſuddenly, without any apparent cauſe preceding, and being in perfect health, they were taken firſt with an extream ache in their Heads, redneſs and inflamation of the Eyes; and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly their Throats and Tongues grew preſently bloody, and their breath noyſome and unſavory. Upon this followed a ſnee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and hoarſneſs, and not long after, the pain, together with a mighty cough, came down into the breſt. And when once it was ſetled in the Stomach, it cauſed vomit, and with great torment came up all manner of bilious purgation that Phyſicians ever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Moſt of them had alſo the Hickeyexe, which brought with it a ſtrong Convulſion, and in ſome ceaſed quickly, but in others was long before it gave over. Their bodies outwardly to the touch, were neither very hot, nor pale, but reddiſh, livid, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred with little pimples and whelks; but ſo burned inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48692:6"/>
as not to endure any the lighteſt cloaths or linnen garment to be upon them, nor any thing but meer nakedneſs, but rather, moſt willingly to have caſt themſelves into the cold water. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them that were not looked to, poſſeſſed with inſatiate thirſt, ran unto the Wells; and to drink much, or little, was indifferent, being ſtill from eaſe and power to ſleep as far as ever. As long as the diſeaſe was at the height, their bodies waſted not, but reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the torment beyond all expectation, inſomuch as the moſt of them either died of their inward burning in 9 or 7 dayes, whileſt they had yet ſtrength, or if they eſcaped that, then the diſeaſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down into their bellies, and cauſing there great exulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and immoderate looſneſs, they died many of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards through weakneſs: For the diſeaſe (which took firſt the head) began above, and came down, and paſsed through the whole body; and he that overcame the worſt of it, was yet mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the loſs of his extreme parts; for breaking out both at their Privy-members; and at their Fingers and Toes, many with the loſs of theſe eſcaped. There were alſo ſome that loſt there Eyes, &amp; many that preſently upon their recovery were taken with ſuch an oblivion of all things whatſoever, as they neither knew themſelves nor their acquaintance. For this was a kind of ſickneſs which far ſurmounted all expreſsion of words, and both exceeded Humane Nature, in the cruelty wherewith it handled each one, and appeared alſo otherwiſe to be none of thoſe diſeaſes that are bred amongſt us, and that eſpecially by this. For all, both Birds and Beaſts, that uſe to feed on Humane fleſh, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men lay abroad unburied, either came not at them, or taſting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48692:7"/>
periſhed. An Argument whereof as touching the <hi>Birds,</hi> is the manifeſt defect of ſuch Fowl, which were not then ſeen, neither about the Carcaſſes, or any where elſe; but by the Dogs, becauſe they are familiar with Men, this effect was ſeen much clearer. So that this diſeaſe (to paſs over many ſtrange particulars of the accidents that ſome had differently from others) was in general ſuch as I have ſhewn; and for other uſual ſickneſſes, at that time, no man was troubled with any. Now they died, ſome for want of attendance, and ſome again with all the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>Phyſick</hi> that could be uſed. Nor was there any, to ſay, certain Medicine, that applied muſt have helped them; for it did good to one, it did harm to another; nor any difference of <hi>Body</hi> for ſtrength or weakneſs that was able to reſiſt it; but it carried all away what Phyſick ſoever was adminiſtred. But the greateſt miſery of all was the dejection of Mind, in ſuch as found themſelves beginning to be ſick, (for they grew preſently deſperate, and gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over without making any reſiſtance) as alſo their dying thus like <hi>Sheep,</hi> infected by mutual viſitation: For if men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to viſit them for fear, then they dyed forlorn, whereby many Families became empty, for want of ſuch as ſhould take care of them. If they forbore not, then they died themſelves, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the honeſteſt men. For out of ſhame, they would not ſpare themſelves, but went in unto their friends, eſpecially after it was come to this paſs, that even their Domeſticks, wearied with the lamentations of them that died, and overcome with the greatneſs of the calamity, were no longer moved therewith. But thoſe that were recovered, had much compaſsion both on them that died, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48692:7"/>
on them that lay ſick, as having both known the miſery themſelves and now no more ſubject to the like danger: For this diſeaſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took any man the ſecond time ſo as to be mortal. And theſe men were both by others counted happy, and they alſo themſelves, through exceſs of preſent joy, conceived a kind of light hope, never to die of any other ſickneſs hereafter. Beſides the preſent affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the reception of the Countrey people, and of their ſubſtance into the City, oppreſſed both them, and much more the people themſelves that ſo came in. For having no Houſes, but dwelling at that time of the year in ſtifling Booths, the Mortality was now without all form; and dying men lay tumbling one upon another in the ſtreets, and men half dead about every Conduit through deſire of water. The <hi>Temples</hi> alſo where they dwelt in <hi>Tents,</hi> were all full of the dead that died within them; for oppreſſed with the violence of the Calamity, and not knowing what to do, Men grew careleſs, both of <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> things alike. And the Laws which they formerly uſed touching <hi>Funerals,</hi> were all now broken; every one burying where he could find room. And many for want of things neceſſary, after ſo many deaths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were forced to become impudent in the <hi>Funerals</hi> of their <hi>Friends.</hi> For when one had made a <hi>Funeral Pile,</hi> another get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before him, would throw on his dead, and give it fire. And when one was in burning, another would come, and having caſt thereon him whom he carried, go his way again. And the great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, which alſo in other kinds was uſed in the City, began at firſt from this diſeaſe. For that which a man before would diſſemble, and not acknowledge to be done for voluptuouſneſs, he

durſt now do freely, ſeeing before his Eyes ſuch quick revolution, of the rich dying, and men worth nothing inheriting their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; inſomuch as they juſtified a ſpeedy fruition of their Goods, even for their pleaſure, as Men that thought they held their Lives but by the day. As for pains, no man was forward in any action of Honour, to take any, becauſe they thought it uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether they ſhould die or not, before they atchieved it. But what any man knew to be delightful, and to be profitable to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that was made both profitable and honourable. Neither the fear of the Gods, nor Laws of men, awed any man. Not the former, becauſe they concluded it was alike to worſhip or not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, from ſeeing that alike they all periſhed: nor the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man expected that lives would laſt, till he received pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his crimes by Judgements. But they thought there was now over their heads ſome far greater Judgement decreed againſt them; before which fell, they thought to enjoy ſome little part of their Lives.</p>
