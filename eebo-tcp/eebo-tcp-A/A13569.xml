         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus then it appeareth, that the wayes of God are vnſearchable.

Nor are we to wonder, when we ſhall behold that which oftentimes wee ſee to happen here vpon earth: That on the one ſide, a righteous man that is zealous of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, fighteth for the defence of Gods cauſe, and ſeeketh to aduance and further the ſame, is many times ſo much croſt and ouerth warted in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, that it ſeemeth that both heauen and

earth are bent againſt him, and is in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, that he knowes not which way to winde or turne himſelfe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was when the towne of <hi>Ziglag</hi> was ſpoyled, and his owne people conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. On the other ſide, that an vngodly man, that indureth no manner of aduerſitie, is an vtter enemy vnto God, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by all the meanes that the can, vtterly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate and roote out the memorie of his moſt holy name out of the earth, and yet is oftentimes ſo much holpen and ſeconded in his wickednes, that heauen and earth and all things therein ſeeme to hold with him, and hee bringeth his affaires vnto ſo happie and proſperous an end, that he is a terrour and feare to the miſerable and ſmall troopes of the righteous. Who can tell or finde out the true ground of theſe wayes of God?

ſcandalous and wicked actions, and which is more, leading many others with him into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and by his long life withholding and keeping others out of ſome neceſſarie places of ſeruice, who, were they imployed in the ſame would doe much good: Who can declare or tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine the ground of this proceeding? Doth it not oftentimes fall out, that an vngodly man is ſtricken with an apoplexie while hee is buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his wicked actions in ſome one kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and alſo that a righteous perſon is ſtricken by the hand of God, while hee laboureth about the furtherance and aduancement of Gods glory and is onely carefull thereof? That the Lord ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an vngodly <hi>Arrius,</hi> cauſing his bowels to burſt, and his guts to fall out of his belly, as hee ſitteth vpon the ſtoole to eaſe himſelfe, and ſo dieth; and that the ſame God bringeth a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man his aduerſary to the like death: who would not be abaſht thereat, to conſider of ſuch incomprehenſible wayes and workes of God?

that both liue in great wealth and worldly happineſſe; and two other vnrighteous men, that are vnhappy and indure great miſery. And there are two godly men of one calling, whereof the one proſpereth in all his affayres, the other is croſt and troubled. There are two vngodly men of one condition, whereof the one is croſt in his affayres, the other proſpereth. There is a godly and an vngodly man, who although they be both of one calling in worldly affayres; but yet differ much in their liues and conuerſations touching Gods ſeruice, that both liue in great proſperitie: And there is a godly and an vngodly man, of one condition for worldly matters, that both are croſt and indure much trouble and aduerſitie.

What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſſe of Gods workes are theſe? what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wayes of God are theſe?

And Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe ſayth, that <hi>God maketh his Sunne to riſe on the euill, and on the good, and ſendeth rayne on the iuſt and on the vniuſt,</hi> Math. 5. 45. When wee ſee therefore that the <hi>wrath of God is reuealed from heauen, againſt all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe and vnrighteouſneſſe of men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. we may thereupon certainely conclude, That there is ſomething wanting in men, and that for many cauſes man deſerueth puniſhment for ſin, which God diſliketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. and thereby we may further learne, that ſinne is the mother of all

miſeries, and that there is nothing in the world which we ſhould with more care &amp; caution, hate, ſhun, and abhor, then ſinne, as the onely thing that moueth our Creator to diſlike of vs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all vs that are his creatures abhominable in his ſight.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God in his word ſheweth vs, that he hath a care of thoſe that feare him, and of ſuch as are godly; and ſeeketh to do them good, but how any of vs are made godly and righteous, all of vs by nature being wicked and loſt ſheepe, <hi>Rom. 4. 3. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. Is not at this time to be ſpoken of; and on the contrarie, that he hateth the vngodly, and powreth out his wrath and indignation vpon them. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open to their cry; The face of the Lord is againſt them that doe euill, to cut off the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them from the earth,</hi> Pſal. 34. 15. 16. which he ſayth he will do when he thinketh good, when <hi>the dayes of viſitation, and of recompence are come,</hi> Hoſ. 9. 7.

And on the contrary, <hi>when the righteous call, the Lord heareth and deliuereth them out of all their trouble,</hi> Pſal. 18. 27. Thereby vnderſtanding, that hee deliuereth them, by taking them like a wiſe workeman, out of the furnace of aduerſitie, when they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently purified and clenſed; That is, <hi>in the time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 16.</p>

reſpect, when he ſendeth one and the like proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and aduerſitie, both on the godly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, hee doth it not for one ſelfe ſame intent, nor to one end. That which God himſelfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth vnto vs, on the one ſide, that whatſoeuer tribulation or miſery hee ſendeth to the godly man, it is for his good and great benefit, yea euen the croſſes themſelues are ſo; for God <hi>inlighteneth their darkeneſſe,</hi> Pſalm. 18. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo it falleth out, <hi>That all things worke for the beſt to them that loue God,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. So that the troubles of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are vnto them as an entrie into life euerlaſting, an earneſt penny, and as it were the firſt fruites of heauenly ioyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 6.

And in this manner all things are a bleſſing to the godly; <hi>For godlineſſe is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto all things, hauing the promiſes of this life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1.

               <p>On the other ſide, whatſoeuer the vngodly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, it is altogether a curſe vnto them, for <hi>God carſeth their bleſsings, Matt.</hi> 2. 2. So that whether it bee proſperitie or aduerſitie, it happeneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, it falleth out amiſſe with them: <hi>for all things are vncleane vnto them; becauſe their mindes and conſciences are vncleane,</hi> Tit. 1. 14 Deut. 8. 15. The aduerſity then of the vngodly is a feeling of, &amp; a preparatiue to euerlaſting condemnation, an earneſt penny, and the firſt fruits of the paines of hell, <hi>Iud.</hi> 5. 7. and their proſperitie is like a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned

drinke vnto them, for by their wickednes, the more they abuſe their proſperitie, the more they ſpoyle their owne ſoules, and ſo it become a powerfull meanes to carrie them vnto hell, and to the kingdome of darkeneſſe, <hi>Apcc.</hi> 18. 7. This God openeth vnto vs plainly in his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may openly learne and vnderſtand that the ſtate of the vngodly, whether it bee aduerſitie or proſperitie, is altogether miſerable; and on the contrarie, that the aduerſitie or proſperitie of the godly, is a happines vnto them. For it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if the vngodly man doth not in time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend his life, at the laſt hee ſhall bee ſure of after condemnation, and the godly man of euerlaſting ioy and felicitie, as wee haue a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt example thereof in the ſtate of the rich man, and of poore <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16. 19. And who ſeeth not, that the rich man for all his wealth and worldly proſperitie, was an accurſed wretch, and that poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his greateſt miſerie was happie and bleſſed? what man is hee, that would not rather chooſe, looking into the end of them both, to liue in this world in the ſtate of poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> then in that of the rich glutton?</p>
               <p>So you ſee, that from theſe different affections of God, both vnto the godly and the vngodly, which hee hath ſhewed vnto vs in his word, and by their laſt ends which thereupon enſue, the grounds of the hope and comfort that the godly haue and receiue in the midſt of their aduerſitie and troubles: And the grounds of the feares and miſeries, which the vngodly are like to fall vnto,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18898:16"/>
whiles they poſſeſſe worldly proſperity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But hearken yet further, what the Lord himſelfe ſaith vnto his ſeruants and meſſengers touching them both: <hi>Say vnto the righteous that it ſhall bee well with him, for they ſhall eate the fruite of their doings: Woe vnto the wicked it ſhall bee ill with him, for the reward of his handes ſhall be giuen him,</hi> Eſa. 3. 10. 11. Now if wee conſider this well, and take good heed, and earneſtly marke the end, both of the godly and of the vngodly, we ſhall be throughly perſwaded, from the doubtfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite that wee haue in our mindes, touching the workes of God done here vpon earth among men, when we oftentimes behold and ſee the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to proſper ſo much in this world, and the godly liue in pouertie and aduerſitie, which for that it is a matter of great importance, in the next Chapter I will more at large open the ſame vnto you.</p>

               <p>The word of God therefore aduiſeth vs, to caſt off all doubts and feares touching the workes of God, and to rid vs thereof, willeth vs not to looke onely vpon the outward end of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, and to conſider of nothing elſe, but the courſe of this preſent world, euen as the ſtate of the rich glutton, and of poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is ſet downe and declared vnto vs by Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. So the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> warneth vs, ſaying; <hi>Remember thoſe that haue the rule ouer you, who haue ſpoken vnto you the word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their conuerſation,</hi> Heb. 13. 7. And to the ſame end Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth, <hi>Behold wee count them happy which indure; you haue heard of the patience of</hi> Iob, <hi>and haue ſeene the end of the Lord; for the Lord is very pittifull, and of tender mercy,</hi> Iames 5. 11.</p>
               <p>Touching the proſperity of the vngodly, who would be grieued thereat, when wee marke and thinke vpon their endes; they ſtand vpon ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ground and ſoone fall downe: and then comes in the hard and heauie reckonings which they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18898:18"/>
muſt make at the latter day, ſee the 49. <hi>Pſalme;</hi> What is hee that grudgeth at the good that men doe to thoſe that are condemned to die, or at the friendſhip that is ſhewed vnto them by ſome, when they are led to execution to be broken on wheeles? or who would not chuſe to paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a troubleſome and durtie way, to inioy a great inheritance, then thorough a faire and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant way to goe to execution? doe not many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt houſholders, diſlike of ſwaggering compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that dayly and hourely haunt the beſt Innes and Tauernes in the Citie, and conſume their wealth in banket after banket, as long as their credits laſt? and doe they not thinke them men of little wiſedome or conſideration? and is it not found to bee ſo when they make vp their recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings at home in their houſes? So it ſtands with the proſperitie of the vngodly many times here in this world, they haue great wealth and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: but they ſpend vpon their owne ſtockes, and a hard reckoning followeth after it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary godly men, that in this world are kept ſhort and ſpend vpon their fathers purſe, whether it be ſuperfluouſly or otherwiſe, as their father thinkes it good, haue no feare of an after reckoning, all is freely forgiuen them: Thus their ends differ much one from another. This when the Pſalmiſt conſidered, although before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this point of the workes of God, how the vngodly proſper, and the godly liue poore and miſerably, hee was ſomewhat troubled, and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred thereat, yet at laſt hee was perſwaded, as hee

himſelfe witneſſeth, ſaying; <hi>When I thought to know this it was too painefull for mee, vntill I went into the Sanctuary of God, then vnderſtood I their end,</hi> Pſalm. 73. 16. 17.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, we muſt needes confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that theſe are moſt profound wayes of God, but the Lord alſo in his holy word hath giuen vs to vnderſtand, what the meaning is of theſe his moſt wonderfull workes, and telleth vs that he hath reaſon ſo to doe, both in reſpect of the godly, and the vngodly, and of his people, and their enemies; and firſt giueth vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that in theſe occurrents hee is patient, and long ſuffering, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 7.

downe. Thus he witneſſeth, that for the ſame cauſe he ſuffereth his people of Iſraell to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that afterward he might aduance them, and that ſo all the world might ſee that it was neither their policie, wiſedome, nor power, but his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that had releiued, and rayſed them vp, <hi>Deut,</hi> 8. 9.</p>
               <p>Here what the Lord to this end ſayth by the Prophet; <hi>The earth mourneth and languiſheth, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon is aſhamed and hewen downe, Sharon is like a wilderneſſe, and Baſan and Carmell ſhake off their fruits; now will I riſe ſayth the Lord, ſeeing</hi> my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſo much confounded, and euery man thinketh, that they are wholy ouerthrowne, <hi>now will I be exalted, now will I lift vp my ſelfe,</hi> Eſa. 33. 9. 10. <hi>I haue a long time houlden my peace,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>I haue beene ſtill and refrayned my ſelfe, now will I cry like a trauelling woman, I will deſtroy and deuoure at once,</hi> Eſa. 42. 14. the enemies of my people. This is Gods purpoſe when he ſuffereth his people for a time to be ouer-run and maſtred by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: which if we conſider well, we will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bee abaſhed thereat, nor ſtumble at Gods workes, though things goe neuer ſo croſſe for a time with Gods owne people, and that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Goſpell thereby ſeeme to growe ſtrong.</p>
               <p>When we reade of the proſperitie of <hi>Hammon</hi> the cruell and ſworne enemy of Gods people, and vnderſtand that he proceeded ſo farre, that all the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> were iudged to die, and that hee being their greateſt and bittereſt enemie, had the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18898:20"/>
execution thereof committed to him, would not men therby conclude, looking vpon the outward vntoward proceedings, that the Lord had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and forſaken his people of <hi>Iſraell;</hi> yet we know in the end, that the higher that <hi>Hammon</hi> the enemie of Gods people did clime, the neerer the deſtruction of the Children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> ſeemed to be, and the more the enemies of Gods people being diſappointed of their purpoſes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, the more honor the Lord did then reap vnto himſelfe, by the deliuerance of his people. So wonderfull is God the Lord in his workes: wherby it appeareth, that euen then when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the cauſe of his people in a manner to fall vnto the ground, he ſtill houldeth the rudder in his hand, and hath an eye on them, and a care that they ſhall not altogether be ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>And ſo all the miſ-vnderſtanding, wrong iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, miſ-conſtruing &amp; ſtumblings at Gods workes conſiſts herein, that we onely looke vpon exterior things, and neuer remember to goe into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of God, to looke into the end of his wayes, and what his ſecret meaning is therein. Marke what I ſay. Queene <hi>Eſter</hi> that was a great friend to the people of God, and ſought what meanes ſhe could to deliuer the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> from that danger, and to bring <hi>Hammon</hi> to confuſion, what courſe did ſhee take. Shee inuited the King and <hi>Hammon</hi> with him to be her gueſts, ſhee receiued and intertained him friendly, and <hi>Hammon</hi> could perceiue no other but that he was very welcome to the Queene, and boaſted thereof to his friends;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18898:20"/>
And yet that was not enough, <hi>Heſter</hi> bad him to be her gueſt the ſecond time, and ſhewed him a fayre countenance from time to time. Now what might the Iewes that knew not Queene <hi>Heſters</hi> meaning, haue conceiued and iudged hereof? might not they haue thought, that <hi>Heſter</hi> alſo conſented with <hi>Hammon</hi> to helpe to root out and confound the Iewes? But the meaning was cleane contrary: ſhee ſought to bring <hi>Hammon</hi> to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to deliuer the Iewes from death; the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thereof ſheweth it plainely, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord our God many times worketh with the enemies of his people, hee ſeemeth for a while to draw them on, and to leaue his owne people, to make them the more confounded and aſhamed, when vnexpectedly hee ouerthroweth them, and deliuereth his people from them. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe wayes of God therefore wee muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Gods pleaſure, and in the meane time pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expect his leiſure. And this God declareth vnto vs in his Word touching his ſtrange work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings aforeſayd, which to men ſeeme ſo offenſiue, yea, which is more, our good God ſheweth vs yet more ſpeciall and waightier cauſes, wherefore at ſometimes he ſuffereth his owne people to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by their enemies, and letteth them fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great miſeries and troubles, whereof ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, the enemies of Gods people, others Gods people themſelues. Touching his owne people, ſomtimes he ſuffereth them to fall into the hands of their enemies, and by that meanes ladeth them with a heauie yoake; becauſe they did not ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18898:21"/>
themſelues wiſely, and as it became them, to beare his Fatherly yoake on their necks. Heare what the Lord to that end ſayth to his people: <hi>Becauſe that thou ſerueſt not the Lord thy God with ioyfulneſſe, and with gladneſſe of heart, for the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things; therefore ſhalt thou ſerue thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which the Lord ſhall ſend againſt thee, in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in thirſt, and in nakedneſſe, and in want of all things, and he ſhall put a yoake of iron vpon thy necke, and all this the Lord doth,</hi> as hee himſelfe alſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, that his people might know what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betweene ſeruing of him, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Kingdomes of his enemies, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12. 8. Therefore for that his people by the ſubtiltie of Sathan, the temptations of the world, imbecilitie and careleſneſſe ſometimes eſteeme not of the ſweete yoake of Chriſt, and calme running water of <hi>Shilo</hi> as they ſhould doe, the Lord layeth a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie yoake vpon them, and bringeth them into deepe, and many waters of oppreſſion; wherein what ſtrange thing doth the Lord? What doth he I ſay, that ſhould moue men in any manner to diſlike? When we vſe to do the ſame (and thinke and perſwade our ſelues that we doe wiſely) with our owne Children; that ſometimes wee put to hard Schoole-maiſters, and cruell teachers for a tyme, that they might learne and know how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a yoake they beare on their ſhoulders in their Fathers houſes, which yet when we doe, it is out of meere loue, and for the good and profit of our Children.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, touching the enemies of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18898:21"/>
Gods people, although then they ſeeme ſpecially to bee happie and bleſſed, when in that manner they get the vpper hand of Gods people, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure them like bread; yet the truth is, that no greater plague can happen vnto them, then when they are permitted to oppreſſe and wrong the people of God, and to waſh their hands in their bloud; which the Lord in his great wrath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permitteth to be done, when hee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſuffer them to fill vp the meaſure of their wickedneſſe, and to haſten their Iudgement, and vtter deſtruction. Euen then when they ouercome and ſpoyle the people of God, and lead them Captiues away with them as a prey, They doe nothing els but in a manner heap vp a great deale of wood, ſtubble, and ſtraw, with coles of fire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, which at the laſt burnes them all vp. For ſo the Lord himſelfe witneſſeth, ſaying; <hi>In that day will I make the wilderneſſe of Iudah like a harth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a bundle of ſtraw,</hi> Zach. 12. 6. And againe, <hi>And in that day will I make</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>a burthenſom ſtone for all people; all that burthen themſelues with it ſhall bee cut in peeces, though all the people of the earth bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together againſt it,</hi> Zach. 12. 3. Hearken what the Lord in this reſpect againe and againe commaundeth, and oftentimes willeth his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to ſhew to the world: <hi>Thou Son of man</hi> ſayth he, <hi>Propheſie to the mountaines of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>and ſay; Ye Mountaines of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>heare the word of the Lord; Thus ſayth the Lord; Becauſe the enemie had ſayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, Aha, euen the auncient high places are ours</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18898:22"/>
                  <hi>in poſseſſion, Therefore propheſie and ſay; Thus ſayth the Lord God; Becauſe they haue made you deſolate, and ſwallowed you vp on euery ſide, that you might be a poſſeſsion vnto the reſidue of the Heathen, and yee are taken vp in the lips of talkers, and are an infamie of the people, Therefore yee Mountaines of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>heare the word of the Lord God; Thus ſayth the Lord God to the mountaines, and to the hills, to the riuers, and to the valleyes, to the deſolate waſts, and to the Citties that are forſaken, which are become a prey and deriſion to the reſidue of the Heathen, that are round about. Therefore thus ſayth the Lord, ſurely in the zeale of my ielouſie I haue ſpoken againſt the reſidue of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and againſt all</hi> Idumea, <hi>which haue appoynted my Land into their poſſeſsions, with the ioy of all their heart, with diſpitefull minds, to caſt it out for a prey, Propheſie therefore concerning the Land of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>and ſay vnto the mountaines, and to the hils, and to the riuers, and to the valleyes; Thus ſayth the Lord God, Behold I haue ſpoken in my ielouſie, and in my fury, becauſe you haue borne the ſhame of the heathen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſayth the Lord God, I haue lifted vp mine hand, ſurely the heathen that are about you they ſhall beare their ſhame. But yee O Mountaines of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>you ſhall ſhoot forth your branches, and yeeld your fruit to my people of</hi> Iſraell, <hi>for they are at hand to come,</hi> Ezech. 36. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. And for that the Lord intendeth to deale in this manner with his owne people, and with their enemies when they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and oppreſſe them; he pronounceth a woe vnto <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Eſay;</hi> &amp; that for this cauſe, becauſe they were to ouer-run and oppreſſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18898:22"/>
the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> for a tyme, like durt in the ſtreete; ſaying, <hi>O Aſſyrians the rod of mine anger, and the ſtaffe in their hand is mine indignation. I will ſend him againſt an hypocriticall Nation, and againſt the people of my wrath,</hi> (where hee vnderſtandeth his owne people, that becauſe of their ſinnes had a long tyme ſore offended him) <hi>I will giue him a charge to take the ſpoyle, and to take the prey, and to tread them downe like the mire in the ſtreets,</hi> Eſa: 10. 5. 6. To this end alſo the Lord witneſſeth, that hee delayed to take reuenge for the bloud of his Children, vntill more of them were ſlaine for his truth ſake, that at one time he might viſite the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his truth in their owne houſes &amp; make a iuſt reckoning with them, <hi>Apo.</hi> 6. 9 10. 11. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifeſtly to be ſeene, That the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the enemies of the truth ſomtimes to haue the vpper hand, becauſe that alreadie by reaſon of their great ſinnes and offences committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, they haue in ſuch manner offended him, that in his wrath he thinketh it fit to ſlacke the bridle vnto them, and to ſuffer them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from bad actions to worſe, for their heauier iudgement and condemnation.</p>
               <p>This alſo muſt be vnderſtood and conceiued in matters of leſſe moment, wherein the Children of the world without reaſon and lawfull ground, get the vpper hand ouer the Children of God, as when they meete together in battaile in the field, or in any towne, or in prayer, or at a marriage, or ſuch like, and there are ſlaine, murthered or ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp; in all other ſuch like occurrents. And thus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18898:23"/>
the Lord findeth occaſion both in regard of his owne people, and of their enemies, now and then to make his people the foote and not the head, that he ſuffreth them to lie vnder feete, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the truth to tread vpon them; which whoſoeuer well waigheth and conſidereth with an vnderſtanding heart, hee ſhall ſoone perceiue &amp; ſee, that there is no cauſe of doubt to be made, or ſcandall to be found in theſe workes of the Lord.</p>

               <p>That the light of the Goſpell hath long tyme ſhone moſt clearly in this age, as thoſe that know any thing as they ought to doe, can tell; and that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18898:23"/>
the ſame hath beene ſleightly regarded, both by friendes and foes, all thoſe plainely ſee it, that haue receiued any light at all from the Lord our God. Many both great and ſmall, both mightie Potentates and meane men, long ſince and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with all their mights, haue ſtrouen againſt the ſame, and ſought vtterly to dam and ſmother it vp, by all the meanes they could; eſteeming that to be a falſe light, which is only able to lead and guide them to the way of ſaluation. Others, that in ſome ſort had a liking thereunto, haue made no great account nor eſtimation thereof, but haue ſuffered it in ſuch ſort to ſhine, and ſo ſerued their turnes therewith, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to liue where it was, and ſometimes to come where it ſhoane, without making any reckoning to accept, or, to make profeſſion thereof. And amongſt thoſe that proceeded ſo farre, that they haue accepted thereof as a rule of their faith, and an order of liuing well; there are many found that haue no care orderly, and as they ought to doe, to walke in the light thereof: ſo that on this ſide alſo many lamentable offences haue beene mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and doubts beene raiſed to cauſe controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and errours.</p>
               <p>This the Lord God, the Father of lights hath ſeene and beheld from the higheſt heauens, the place of his holy habitation; and it grieued him much to ſee and perceiue, ſuch great vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and ingratitude for ſo excellent a gift, then the which (next vnto ſaluation it ſelfe) no better hath beene giuen by God vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18898:24"/>
of men: For which cauſe hee hath ſuffered the vnthankefull world, and that would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the loue of the truth, to fall into ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and great doubts, whereby they tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to cleaue vnto and beleeue lies. So that in this our age, wee haue ſeene in the reformed countries of the world, many great and very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſputations to ariſe, and controuerſies to grow touching religion: whereby many men, that looke no further then vpon the outward ſhew and face thereof, were ſo much amazed and abaſhed thereat, that they began more and more to diſlike it, and to leaue it: Theſe are deepe wayes of God, which therefore ought to haue mooued all Chriſtian hearts to ſearch into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of God; and withall to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhake off the aforeſaid vnſauoury ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to bend their mindes vnto a more wholeſome courſe of obedience. But this hath beene practiſed by very few, and at this day is yet too much neglected.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe the wrath of God hath beene more and more kindled, and his out ſtretched arme hath not holden backe; but in his anger he is gone foorth, and hath ſuffered the vngodly world that hardeneth it ſelfe, to fall into more hardneſſe and deluſion; as euery man knoweth how much the blind world now hardneth and imboldneth it ſelfe, each one in his errours, vpon occaſion of the preſent troubles that daily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the people of God in theſe dayes: for the enemies of the Goſpel, thereby take occaſion to

               <p>But theſe things the Lord ſometimes ſuffereth, to fall vpon and come againſt his owne people, to cleanſe them, to try their faiths, &amp; to the end that thoſe that remaine obſtinate might haue that which they haue deſerued. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 19.

                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 7. And thus it falleth out that ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men, that glorie and take moſt delight, to behold the troubles &amp; perſecutions of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that boaſt off and perſeuer in their enmitie and peruerſe proceedings, are thoſe certainely that are moſt plagued thereby; for that by ſuch meanes they are hardened in their errors and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, which lead them into perdition. Can greater plagues then theſe bee any wayes bee thought on? and all this alſo is iuſt and righteous with God, that thoſe that receiued not the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued, might fall into ſtrong deluſions and beleeue lies, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. 11. And that thoſe that are the cauſes of reuolting and doubts raiſed, and ſometimes ſtrongly mainetaine them, ſhould haue the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure mett vnto them, and thereby fall into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>Thus it fares with them (by the wonderfull prouidence of God) as the Pſalmiſt ſaith; <hi>As they loued curſing</hi> (for they delighted in errour) <hi>ſo let it come vnto them,</hi> Pſalm. 109. 17. Beſides all the curſes that yet hang ouer their heads, for the oppreſſion, ſhame, diſgrace, and wrongs by them done vnto the children of God in their troubles and aduerſities: for it is moſt true and certaine, that although the Lord God ſuffer his people for a while to bee oppreſſed by their enemies, when he hath once finiſhed all his workes vpon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſufficiently puniſhed his people, he will goe to viſite their enemies in their owne houſes, and caſt the rodde of his anger into the fire, Eſa.

10. 12. Behold how excellently the Pſalmiſt ſetteth this forth, ſaying, <hi>When God heard this</hi> (that is, that his children many times rebelled againſt him,) <hi>hee was wrath and greatly abhorred</hi> Iſrael; <hi>ſo that he forſooke the Tabernacle of</hi> Shiloh, <hi>the tent that he had placed among men, and deliuered his ſtrength into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, and his glory into the enemies hand, he gaue his people ouer alſo vnto the ſword, and was wrath with his inheritance. The fire conſumed their young men, and their maidens was not giuen to marriage, their Prieſts fell by the ſword, and their widdowes made no lamentation.</hi> Thus farre it went on Gods enemies ſide, as we read, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. but marke what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Then the Lord awaked as one out of ſleepe, and like a mightie man that ſhooteth by reaſon of wine: and he ſmote the enemies in the hinder parts, hee put them to a perpetuall reproch,</hi> Pſalme 75. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. which alſo wee read in the firſt of <hi>Samuel</hi> the fifth, <hi>This is the heritage of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the Lord, and their righteouſneſſe is of mee, ſayth the Lord,</hi> Eſa. 54. 17.

Theſſ. 1. 67. euen <hi>in the time of need,</hi> Heb. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. And thus it appeareth alwayes, that although the Lord ſeemeth to haue forſaken his people for a while, and to hold with their enemies, yet in truth, and certaintie this ſtandes firmely, That <hi>God will not caſt away righteous man, neither will hee helpe the euill doers,</hi> Iob 8. 20. how much ſoeuer he ſeemeth to ſtand againſt his owne people, and to ſtrengthen the hand of the vngodly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:18898:26"/>Theſe are the wonderfull wayes of our God and this is the certaintie of his workes done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of men, which mooued the Pſalmiſt, that had a ſpirituall eie in ſome meaſure, to looke into the waies of God, and to ſet downe the truth thereof, to breake out into this ſpeech and ſay; <hi>O Lord how great are thy workes, and thy thoughts are verie deepe, a brutiſh man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, neither doth a foole vnderſtand this,</hi> Pſalm. 92. 5. 6.</p>

And alſo by experience in the common courſe of the world, it is found that many of the deare children of God, are perſecuted and euilly dealt withall, onely becauſe they take Gods cauſe in hand, are iealous of God honour, ſeeke the ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad of the Goſpel, and the proſperitie of his people, and that it oftentimes fareth ſo with them, that they are oppreſſed and loſe their

Could a iuſt and an vpright Prince endure that his truſtie ſeruants and officers, ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled, perſecuted, and ſlaine by his ſubiects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeeke to mainetaine and vphold his lawfull commandements, and to ſee them execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without taking their cauſes in hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging their blood, and puniſhing the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours as they had deſerued? Much leſſe, will the Lord ſuffer the hard dealing with, and handling of his children that are ſlaine and murthered in this world, to goe vnreuenged.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if there were no other reaſons then that onely, for which God ſhould make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reckoning with the children of men at the latter day, yet were this cauſe enough for it. So the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the neceſſitie of the laſt day of iudgement, to conſiſt vpon this; That the godly are here oftentimes ſo cruelly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the vngodly, and ſaith to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:18898:27"/>
that <hi>it is a manifeſt token of the righteous Iudgement of God, that yee may be counted worthie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, for which yee alſo ſuffer, ſeeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled, reſt with vs, when the Lord Ieſus ſhall bee reuealed from heauen with his mightie Angells,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 5. 6. 7. Then alſo it ſhall be made manifeſt, though it bee neuer ſo much forgotten here in the world, and how little regard or knowledg ſoeuer ſeemes to be taken of the godly, and thoſe that are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, That <hi>God harkened, and heard it, and a booke of remembrance was layd before him, for them that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lord, and thought vpon his name, and</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it ſhall then alſo be knowne, what <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betweene the righteous and the wicked, betweene him that ſerueth the Lord, and him that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him not,</hi> Mala. 3. 16. 17. 18. Herewith the godly alſo muſt comfort themſelues, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet alſo witneſſeth; and take heede, that they partake not with the vngodly, of whom <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſonnes of men is fully ſet in them to doe euill,</hi> Eccl: 8. 11. But they muſt rather, ſeeing God here in this world permitteth things to paſſe in ſuch manner, bee thereby more certainely aſſured, that hereafter there ſhall come a great day of judgement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all things ſhall be made right, and ſet ſtraight, and <hi>euery one ſhall be rewarded according as hee hath done, whether it be good or euill,</hi> Act. 3. 21. and 2 Cor. 5. 10. And accordingly the more croſſely
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18898:28"/>
and confuſedly we ſee things done and executed here in this world, the more muſt wee learne to make reckoning of the great day of Iudgement, make full account thereof, and prepare our ſelues for it, holding for certaine, as <hi>Salomon</hi> alſo in the aforeſaid place witneſſeth, <hi>That though a ſinner doe euill an hundred tymes, and his dayes be prolonged, yet ſurely I know, it ſhall be well</hi> (not with the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but) <hi>with them that feare God, which feare before him,</hi> Eccl. 8. 12.</p>
               <p>This therefore ſhould moue all the godly to long for the laſt day, &amp; the comming of the Lord, when we ſhall not onely be <hi>reuenged for all their hard ſpeeches which vngodly ſinners haue ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him,</hi> Iude 15: And <hi>all inſtruments that are formed againſt vs ſhall not proſper,</hi> Eſa. 54. 17. But beſides that all the partes and pieces of that great worke of the prouidence of God ouer the things of this world, that here are ſo confuſedly caſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vpon a heape, ſhall be ſeene to be laid very orderly, by the wiſe and powerfull hand of our God, and from them wee ſhall ſee a moſt notable peece of worke to bee framed and brought forth, wherein the vngodly with their wicked workes, ſhall ſerue as ſhadowes, <hi>Eccl:</hi> 8. 13. to ſet more beautie and luſter vpon the great glory of the Children of God, who ſhall then gliſter like the Sunne. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 34.</p>
               <p>As alſo the godly are to expect the ſame for this cauſe, that howſoeuer they cannot here conceiue why this or that thing comes ſo to paſſe, yet they may aſſure themſelues, when the Lord ſhall come

to Iudgement, to make all ſtraight, and to <hi>bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in his Saints,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 10.

Many a man hath ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired, and alſo obtained that which in the end was his ouerthrow. So that it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the wealth and proſperitie of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly is nothing elſe, but as it were a paſturing of Beaſtes for the day of ſlaughter. This God taught <hi>Ieremie,</hi> when touching the proſperitie of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18898:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the vngodly hee looked into and ſearched the wayes of God; <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, when I plead with thee, yet let me talke with thee of thy Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper? Wherefore are all they happie that deale very treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly? Thou haſt planted them, yea, they haue taken roote, they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit, thou art neere in their mouth, and farre from their reines. But thou O Lord knoweſt me, thou haſt ſeene me and tryed mine heart towardes thee. Put them out like ſheepe for the ſlaughter, and prepare them for the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Iere. 12. 1. 2. 3. This is the cauſe why thoſe that proſper in this world reioyce, though they are vngodly, they glory in themſelues becauſe all things goe well with them, and are perſwaded, that it ſhall alwaies be ſo with them, yea, and that God fauoureth and liketh them, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not ſo. The Lord often times in this life giueth great wealth and proſperitie, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they wiſh or deſire, vnto thoſe, to whom after this life he will giue hell and vtter damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their reward: Gods wayes in theſe thinges are not like the wayes of men: to thoſe that men hate and cannot abide, they wiſh no good, no not ſo much as may continue the twinckling of an eye. But it is not ſo with our God, hee endureth the veſſels of wrath with great patience, &amp; beares long with the vngodly, to ſee if they will once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turne from their wicked waies, and feare that good God, from whom they haue receiued ſo many good things, which if they doe not, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

ſuch is the caſe of the vngodly, that the more wealth and proſperitie they haue in this world, the more hated and accurſed of God they are. For this is moſt certaine, that there can come no greater plague in the world then this to the Children of men, when doing euill it falleth out well, as they imagine with them: for thereby they imbolden themſelues in their wicked wayes, and take ſuch a courſe that they ſhun no wickedneſſe, and then that draweth more vnto them, which the Pſalmiſt ſayth, <hi>When the wicked ſpring like the graſſe, and when all the workers of iniquitie flouriſh, it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for euer,</hi> Pſal. 92. 7. Therefore the Prophet cryeth out againſt the Children of this world, in this manner; ſaying, <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they vnderſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end,</hi> Deut. 32. 29. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce not then, you Children of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you flouriſh and proſper here, for behold and ſee that it ſtandeth thus with you, as long as you feare not the Lord, for you can finde nothing to make for you out of any place in the word of God, but that Gods intent and meaning is, to feed you in this fatt paſture for the day of ſlaughter, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 3.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y all that hath beene ſaid and ſhewed before, it plainely appeareth, that in this world it fareth (for the moſt part) alike, both with the godly and vngodly: from whence it followeth vndoubtedly, and cannot be denied; that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meaſure the ſtate of men, in regard of God, by that which happeneth vnto them here on earth. <hi>Iobs</hi> friends may imagine, becauſe hee was ſo ſore plagued, that certainely hee was a very wicked man, and hated of God. And men by nature are much addicted by outward appearance, to iudge of the ſtate of a man in regard of GOD, looke touching this, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 4. 5. 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 1. 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. 20.

Since that wee haue now ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhewed, that the Lord oftentimes in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſendeth men proſperitie, and in his fauour aduerſitie. Muſt we, may ſome ſay, make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at all of that which happeneth vnto the children of men here in this world be it proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or aduerſitie, but paſſe it ouer as it is, I anſwer; no, we muſt haue a due reſpect and regard to that which befalleth men, and marke what proſperitie or aduerſitie happeneth vnto them, and how it fareth both with them and vs; yet not to this end, by the exteriour accurrents of this life, to iudge what the ſtate of man is towards God: but on the contrary, by the aduerſitie or proſperitie of men, to know what we are to conceiue of the worke of God wrought amongſt men, and by the knowledge of the ſeuerall accidents of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or aduerſitie, that happen vnto the children of men, in what manner ſoeuer they bee laid vpon them, or receiued by them, learne to know Gods affection, intent, purpoſe, and ſpeciall marke whereat he aymeth in ſending proſperitie or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie: As for example, ſome great croſſe and tribulation befalleth a godly man, by which yet wee muſt not iudge that he himſelfe, or his cauſe is bad, but that the ſame trouble which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18898:33"/>
vnto him, is ſent for a further triall and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. 7. Tribulation alſo falleth vpon an vngodly man, that therein hardeneth his heart towards Gods puniſhments: herevpon wee muſt conclude, that the trouble that falleth vpon ſuch a man (as farre as we can iudge) is as it were a conſuming fire, and ſmoke of the eternall fire, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. and Chapter 4. Againe, ſome godly man hath much ioy and proſperitie; this when we behold, we muſt conceiue that it is a bleſſing that God beſtoweth vpon him, to incourage him the more to goe forward in the way of godlineſſe, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 1 18. and ſome other man that is vngodly, hath great wealth and much pleaſure, and yet hee is rather worſe and more wicked then he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. Wherevpon we may conclude, that his proſperity (as farre as we can coniecture) is a meanes of fatting him for the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Ier. 12. 3.</p>
               <p>In like manner, when the people of God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forget themſelues, touching their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in their good courſe of religion; by meanes whereof, many times they doe not follow the ſame ſo earneſtly as they ſhould, and is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be done, and that as they march in battaile againſt their enemies, they are not warie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counſell of the Lord, to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from euery wicked thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 9. it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that God, who is more ſpecially iealous ouer his people, and is wont to viſit their offences home in their houſes, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. For that cauſe, many times ſuffereth them to be ouerthrowne in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18898:33"/>
a cauſe which otherwiſe is good; as it happened twiſe to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> fighting againſt the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> Iudg. 20. Now when any ſuch thing happeneth, the people of God vpon that occaſion muſt not doubt of, or call their religion into queſtion, but they muſt looke into their own proceedings in that action touching the defence of their religion in a good cauſe, and thereby take occaſion to inquire, what thing either in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or particular, hath beene done among them in their proceedings, that might diſpleaſe God; in regard whereof hee hath ſo croſt them, and hauing found it out, humble themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and amend their faults. And if in that caſe, they cannot finde any thing, which they may conceiue to be the cauſe of their ouerthrow, then they muſt aſcribe the ſame vnto Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull prouidence, which is not to bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by vs, but muſt by euery man, with all humilitie and ſubmiſſion bee accepted and well thought of, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 23. 24. <hi>Iob</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Thus the word of God teacheth vs, how to iudge of thoſe tribulations and that proſperitie that befalleth the ſonnes of men, which if ſome worldly wiſe men would looke well into, they would not ſo vnaduiſedly ſcoffe at the actions of Gods children; who, when they haue had a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victorie ouer their enemies, therevpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, not that their cauſe was good (which the other in their wrong iudgement doubt of) but that God hath graciouſly holpen them in their good cauſe; and hauing receiued any ouerthrow,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18898:34"/>
thence conclude; that the Lord for their ſinnes, thereby humbleth them, and that by ſuch hard blowes he would awake and rouze them vp: not to make them imagine that their good cauſe is bad, but to mooue them to amend their ſinfull liues, that they may not thereby hinder their good cauſe, and to cauſe them in all occurrents to depend vpon the truth, and when they proſper, to giue God the Lord the honour and glory, and when they are ouerthrowne and puniſhed, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the fault thereof to themſelues: this, I ſay, no worldling would ſcoffe at, as they vnaduiſedly doe, if they had learned this infallible truth of God. Which neuertheleſſe is true, that is, that by the knowledge of the ſeuerall chances, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto the children of men, wee muſt meaſure the meaning and intent of God, in ſending pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie and aduerſitie vnto men: for it is true, that Gods children, as wee finde in the holy word of God, alwayes praiſed the Lord, when they had the victorie ouer their enemies, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; <hi>Lord, I know that thou loueſt mee, in that thou haſt not deliuered me into the handes of mine enemies; nor giuen them occaſion to triumph ouer me.</hi> Pſal. 41. 11. And againe, humbled themſelues for their ſins, when they were ouerthrowne, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 39. not once in regard thereof making any doubt of their religion, or imagining that Idolatry had iuſtly gotten the vpper hand, againſt the true ſeruice of God. Beſides this, we muſt further know, that the thinges of this world haue not their iſſue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, alwayes according to their owne nature and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18898:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
properties, but as the Lord (who ruleth them all) pleaſeth to order them. By meanes whereof it falleth out, that aduerſitie (which of it ſelfe is hurtfull) yet procureth great good to the godly, and that proſperitie (which of it ſelfe is pleaſing) doth yet bring great hurt to the vngodly. And hereby it commeth to paſſe, that <hi>all things worke together for the good of them that feare God,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. And on the other ſide, that all things worke together for the worſt to them that hate God; in regard that <hi>their mindes and conſciences alſo are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and accurſed,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. Let an vngodly man be aduanced, and ſet aboue all his other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; he will become proud and inſolent, and ouer-throw himſelfe thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe, let a godly man haue any tribulation befall him; hee will humble himſelfe and become better thereby; and ſo <hi>to the pure all things are pure, but vnto them that are defiled, nothing is pure, or profitable,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. And this proceedeth from hence, that the godly on the one ſide, are a godly plant, and a heauenly branch, hauing ſo great and admirable a power in it, that the man that is godly is ſo framed by Gods grace, that whatſoeuer hapneth vnto him, or is layd vpon him, how troubleſome, aduerſe, hurtfull, or miſchieuous ſoeuer it be of it ſelfe by nature, is turned to the beſt vnto him, and to his good and proſperitie; for, <hi>Godlineſſe is profitable to all things, hauing promiſes of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 8. And on the other ſide, the vngodly being a plant of he Deuill, and a branch of hell, hath ſo venimous a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18898:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtalke, and ſo poyſonfull a nature, that the man who is rooted therein, and will not be brought to leaue and abandon it, but ſtill keepeth it by him, it is certaine, that whatſoeuer happeneth vnto him, how good, profitable, and beneficiall ſoeuer it be by nature it turneth to his hurt and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſuch manner, that euen the pleaſing and ſweet ſauour thereof, is contrary vnto him, and is with him <hi>the ſauour of death vnto death.</hi> And whereas the godly, ſauour life euerlaſting in Chriſt, and eternall ſaluation: The vngodly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour nothing but death in Chriſt, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting condemnation, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 16.</p>
               <p>Hence it euidently appeareth, that by outward things which happen vnto men, wee muſt not by any meanes meaſure, nor iudge their ſtate to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the firſt daſh; but on the contrary by their ſtate to God-wardes iudge, what we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the outward thinges that happen vnto, and fall vpon them.</p>
               <p>By this that hath beene ſaid, may many men learne to reforme their erronious opinions: and not thoſe only of whom we ſpake in the eleuenth Chapter, who are wont to take occaſion by their outward proſperitie, to boaſt themſelues of their actions, and are perſwaded that both they and their actions pleaſe God well, becauſe outwardly they haue wealth and proſperitie, whereas they ſhould not iudge their ſtate in regard of God, by their outward proſperitie, but their proſperitie by their ſtate.</p>
               <p>But others alſo, that are perſwaded and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18898:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that all men, when ſoeuer any trouble or ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſitie falleth on them, and that they are many wayes moleſted, as ſtricken ſicke on their beds, or troubled by their enemies, are wont thereupon to flatter, and ſooth vp themſelues, and to grow thereby into ſome good perſwaſion, that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſhall fare the better for the ſame, becauſe they haue endured ſo much here in this world, and that it be certainely concluded thence, that they are Gods Children, &amp; that God loueth them well, becauſe they are troubled, and much tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation here befall them. But this is no certaine token that God liketh well of vs, becauſe he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs trouble and aduerſitie, for hee doth the ſame to the vngodly, as wee haue alreadie decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And therefore wee muſt not by outward things, which happen vnto men, either our ſelues or others, iudge or cenſure our owne or their ſtate to God-ward; but on the contrary, by our ſtate to God-ward, we muſt iudge the ſtate of ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, whether they bee ſent vnto vs as ſignes of Gods grace, or of his wrath.</p>
               <p>It behooueth all thoſe then whom God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to fall into any tribulation, or miſery, to be certainely perſwaded, that by the ſame (as the godly vſe to doe) they ought to become better and better, and to be purged and cleanſed, that doing ſo they may bee certainely perſwaded in their conſciences, that they are puniſhed by God in loue. To which purpoſe our heartie wiſh and prayer vnto God is, that all thoſe that beare the name of Gods people, would take occaſion by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18898:36"/>
the viſitation which the Lord God ſendeth vpon his people in theſe our dayes, to weigh well, and conſider ſeriouſly their owne preſent eſtate, and to looke diligently into themſelues, that they might find out their owne ſinnes and miſdeedes, for it is moſt certaine, that no man can haue any true comfort from the ground of Gods word in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulation, that falleth vpon the people of God, but he who findeth himſelfe to be thereby ſo affected, that he doth not onely grieue for the common miſery of Ieruſalem, but is alſo ſtirred vp to amend his owne life in whatſoeuer he findes amiſſe in himſelfe, for ſo it is written, that we ſhall then know, &amp; be certainely perſwaded, that God puniſheth vs out of his loue, when by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God we become better, and more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous towardes him. <hi>As many as I loue I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore and repent,</hi> Apoc: 3. 19. And this we muſt bee ſo much the more perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of, for that although the Lord vſeth ſo to deale with his people, that he ſendeth them ſome reliefe, and in part eaſeth them of their troubles, when they are fallne into them, and in them call vpon him; yet that <hi>his arme is ſtill ſtretched forth, and his wrath is not aſſwaged,</hi> vntill his people put away from them, and cleane caſt off that which diſpleaſeth and diſliketh him, and for which hee doth viſite them. Which with all our hearts wee wiſh might by euery one bee well and earneſtly thought vpon. It is not to be doubted, but that all the troubles which in our tymes haue fallne vpon the people of God, haue had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18898:36"/>
from hence, that we haue not ſo thankefully (as we ought to haue done) receiued the holy Goſpell, and the truth of Gods word. For we haue many tymes begun to neglect the light of Gods truth, which hath grieued the Lord, and for the ſame he hath viſited vs at home, which wee haue alſo in part begun to obſerue and acknowledge, and haue thereupon made a ſhew as if wee would amend and reforme it, and haue humbled our ſelues before God with faſting &amp; prayer, making diuers faire ſhews and promiſes, as if we meant to become better and better, and to earry our ſelues with more obedient hearts towardes God then formerly we had done. Whereupon the Lord our God, who is good and long-ſuffring towards vs, hath againe begun to bleſſe vs, done great things for vs, and according to our hearts deſire filled vs with great hope and expectation, that he would more and more lift vp our heads, and giue vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things. But in all theſe things wee doe not once remember, or thinke on our promiſes and vowes that we made ſo ſolemnely vnto him, both in the beginning of our troubles, and now alſo in theſe latter dayes, while we were in trouble and neceſſitie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 14. For what I pray you hath ſince that time beene amended? Who hath ſince begun to be more zealous for the honour of God? Who hath begun to put forth his hand for reformation of the notable abuſes that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt vs, which euery man noteth, which euery man complaineth of, which euery man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liketh, and yet no man amendeth? and yet wee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18898:37"/>
made promiſe and vowed vnto God euery man for his particular, to looke vnto it. Now while the dayes of our faſting and humiliation laſted, and brought ſuch ſolemne power and promiſes with them, by meanes of thoſe promiſes and vowes, for a tyme we procured the threatning hand of God to hold vp, and a beginning of ſuch great matters appeared. But ſince that wee haue not performed thoſe promiſes made vnto God, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue come any thing neere vnto the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them, as at this day it appeareth, what wonder is it now, when wee are not true of our word; when we ſuffer all things to run at ſix and ſeuens, and as they will, and doe not as we ſhould, begin to pay our vowes and promiſes vnto the moſt high God, and euery man to amend that which is amiſſe with him, from the particular houſe-houlder, and ſo vpward to thoſe of higheſt degree: what wonder, I ſay, now is it, that God hath begun to lift vp his threatning hand againe, and that he ſuffereth vs to fayle of that we hoped and expected, and ſends vnto vs hard meſſages, that may againe warne vs in Gods name to pay our vowes, and keepe our promiſes with God, or that els he will execute his Iudgment vpon vs, &amp; thruſt vs out of all that we haue, as one that is our creditor, and with long patience hath borne with vs, whom we haue ſtill payd with faire words, but haue not once beene moued in our hearts to find the meanes to keepe our promiſes, and to moue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And if in any wiſe I ſhould doubt of theſe things to come, yet the ſame are of ſo great waight and conſequence, that it behooueth euery man ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to thinke on them, and to haue a care to make ſure worke thereof, ſeeing that wiſedome teacheth vs, not to prepare onely for difficult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, which wee know certainely will come, but to bee carefull alſo to preuent ſuch as may come vpon vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rather cauſe to ſeeke to attaine vnto theſe outward things that I deſire
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18898:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by godly meanes, for that by following godlines in true faith, without feare of any aduerſitie, my meate will not be leſſe ſauory, nor my ſleepe leſſe ſweete, yea, all my actions will thereby bring and procure more fruit and comfort vnto mee; and how much more, ſince that then I ſhall liue without feare of death and hell, and in an aſſured hope of heauen, and eternall ſaluation? In regard hereof therefore I am fully determined to leaue and aband on all vngodlineſſe, and to follow god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and to deny my ſelfe, and to giue my mind wholly to ſerue the Lord my God, and no longer to fullfill the deſires of the fleſh, whereon ſo many miſeries do depend, but to follow the will of God, (which onely is good) during my mortall dayes, that hereafter I may alwaies liue eternally in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. In this manner, or the like by thinking vpon the things before declared, ſhould we ſet our harts vpon the way of godlineſſe and the feare of God, &amp; ſo caſt our lot into the lap of the godly, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without doubt it ſhall goe well with ſuch men. And to the end that wee may bee enduced and enabled the more diligently to follow godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by meanes of Gods workes done here vnto vs and others, which he bringeth to paſſe in this world, wee will endeuour further to declare and ſhow how, and in what manner wee muſt prepare our ſelues, to know, learne, and reape ſome good out of Gods workes, for the furtherance of the feare of God and godlineſſe in vs, and what ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fruits we may reape thereby.</p>

For this cauſe as many learned men, that are well read in the letter of the holy Scriptures, yet many times can not well iudge of the actions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of men, becauſe they haue not vſed to compare that which God hath ſpoken in his worde, with that which dayly by his hand hee bringeth to paſſe in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the world, ſo it is certaine that thoſe that are not accuſtomed to reade &amp; peruſe the holy Scriptures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know them not, can not with any ſpirituall vnderſtanding or profit, marke Gods works here on earth among the ſonnes of men.</p>

This the vngodly vſe not to doe: they doe not once marke the finger of God in any thing that hapneth vnto the Children of men; but their manner is, to aſcribe it to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and neareſt cauſes, and to depend wholy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, looking no higher, nor further then the gates of the Towne wherein they dwell, vnleſſe it be a thing that is vnaccuſtomed, and ſuch as doth not vſually fall out; and then it may be they will ſuppoſe, that it proceedeth from God, as the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18898:46"/>
of Egypt, marked the finger of God to be in the lice that <hi>Moſes</hi> brought vpon the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe they could conceiue no naturall cauſe whereby it might be effected, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 17. 18. 19. but ſuch as are godly and know Gods word, note the finger of God in all things, as that which is moſt neceſſary to bee conſidered, they thereby may obſerue the workes of God, to fall out according to his word, and may draw and reape conuenient fruits from the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that we accuſtome our ſelues when any thing worth the noting falleth out in the courſe of our liues, that is, againſt our ſelues, or others, whether they bee particular perſons, or whole Nations, to quicken our witts thereby, and to ſtirre vp our memories, to call to mind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, whether there be no one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that witneſſeth ſomething touching the ſame, whereby it is foretold, or whereunto it may be likened: as for example, we ſee a man run vp and downe about his worldly affayres vpon the Sabboth day, and when he hath done, we ſee all that he did was in vaine; heare ſhould we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what is ſayd vnto vs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 27. to wit, <hi>And it came to paſſe that there went ſome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the Sabboth day</hi> (which was the reſt of the Lord) <hi>for to gather Manna, and they found none.</hi> This was the practiſe of Chriſts Diſciples, and God gaue them vnderſtanding thereby: ſee <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 16. 17. 22. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
               <p>Now to finde conuenient places of Scripture, touching theſe thinges that may bee compared
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18898:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with that that hapneth in the world, wee muſt in that that is done diligently conſider what the ſpeciall cauſes were why thoſe things fell out and came ſo to paſſe as they did, as namely, why ſuch and ſuch things hapned ſo well or ſo ill; and wherein they finde themſelues to haue a part in the gracious promiſes of the Lord, and the Lord hath promiſed ſuch good to come to them, as they then finde, or wherein they feele and know themſelues culpable of the threatnings of God, whereby things haue ſo happened vnto them as they haue fallen out. And if we can finde no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpeciall cauſe thereof, but the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then we muſt, as in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, aſcribe the event to the mighty power of God, and accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues therein.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the ſeuerall fruites that ſpring from the ſearching into and finding out of Gods truth, and certaintie declared vnto vs, in his word, and in his workes.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fourth and the laſt of the foure neceſſary points required hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that by the workes of God done among the ſonnes of men, we may be enduced to lay more hold vpon the feare of God, and godlineſſe is, that wee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently note and conſider the ſeuerall fruites that are hereby reaped, and which by finding out
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18898:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gods truth, and the certaintie thereof, are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs in his Word, which muſt be earneſtly and well conſidered of, becauſe this is the ende, ſcope, and ſpeciall marke whereunto all tendeth, that hath formerly beene deliuered.</p>
               <p>Now the fruites that ſpring from the aforeſaid conſiderations are notable, both many and great, whereof ſome (that we may orderly place them in certaine ranckes) concerne the holy Scriptures themſelues; by the light whereof wee may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proue and to iuſtifie all the aforeſayd argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and declarations, other ſome concerne Gods workes, and a third ſort our obedience, which wee are to yeelde and ſhew vnto the word of God and the holy Scriptures. Touching the firſt ſort of fruites concerning the holy Scriptures they are three.</p>
               <p>For in the firſt place, wee learne out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde conſiderations, the truth of the holy Scriptures, that the ſame is moſt certaine and immutable, and that it ſhall neuer faile in any one tittle thereof, therein contained.</p>
               <p>And heereby are wee confirmed and aſſured in our conſciences, as by experience we find, that what ſoeuer the Lord hath ſpoken, by his owne mouth in his worde, that with his hand hee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth and bringeth the ſame to paſſe in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde. Now this is a moſt notable fruit; for vntill ſuch time as that wee doe dewly and truly marke how true Gods word is, and how truely God performeth &amp; bringeth that to paſſe continually in the gouerning of the world, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18898:47"/>
in his word hee hath promiſed and threatned to doe, wee ſhall neuer eſteeme of feare, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues vnto Gods worde, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when by our owne dilligent obſeruation, wee find out and are perſwaded of the truth and certaintie of Gods worde, wee are thereby at all times led and induced to the loue of Gods word, and incouraged to beleeue it, and to eſteeme well thereof, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 12. It is ſayd that the worde of God, is <hi>quicke and powerfull and ſharper then any two edged ſword.</hi> Heb. 4 12. Now no man doth eaſily beleeue this, but hee that by feare of the word of God is moued therunto in his heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24. 25. and he that is ſo affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doubteth no more thereof, then hee doth that the Sunne is bright and cleare; and he that hath this feeling of the worde, working in his ſoule, hath vndoubtedly already made a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the way to Gods kingdome, for this is moſt certaine and ſure, that all the ſinnes and miſdemeanours which thoſe men commit that withſtand the written worde which is the liuely truth of God, proceede from this, that they do not beleeue that the ſame word is ſo true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as it is.</p>
               <p>The ſecond fruit is, that wee learne by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd declarations, the abundant largeneſſe and copiouſnes of the holy Scriptures, <hi>pſal.</hi> 119. 96. It is not to be ſpoken (if wee woulde apply our minds earneſtly and as wee ought to find out places in the Scriptures, that may bee applyed to thoſe things that happen and are done in this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18898:48"/>
world) what a rich mine of gold wee ſhould find the Scriptures to bee, and ſhould hardly, after we had once conuerſed therein, fayle of ſome one fitt place or other therein that might bee apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the thinges that while wee liue we ſhould haue neede of, or are to be done by vs, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. which if the Papiſts had done, they would ſoone haue perceaued and knowne that there was no neede nor neceſſitie, to finde out and invent many new Lawes and Rules for the ordering of mens liues, thereby to bring men to ſaluation, as they haue done, whereby the holy Scriptures are by them brought into contempt, and in a manner abandoned and thruſt wholy out of vſe.</p>
               <p>The third is, that we are by the aforeſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations holpen and better furthered in the vnderſtanding of the holy Scriptures. It is not to be expreſſed nor ſpoken how the earneſt and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous marking of Gods proceedings with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, and with our owne ſoules, giueth a ſingular great light to the true vnderſtanding of many places of holy Scriptures, whereof other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, thoſe that haue no experience nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things touching and concerning a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, can neuer conceiue any thing, as may appeare in many places of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe cannot ſo well bee conceiued how they hang and depend one vpon another; we can true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſe, that ſometimes from the mouthes of ſimple plaine men, wee haue receiued a verie fit and conuenient ſence and interpretation of ſome places, which otherwiſe were very intricare,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18898:48"/>
which they by their owne obſeruations haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and found out, to be ſo and in ſuch manner vnderſtood: and it falleth out often times that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of that which we haue heard &amp; ſeene to happen among men, we were aduertiſed, and haue beene taught the meaning of diuers places of Scriptures, which touched vpon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whereof before we could not finde out the true meaning. This is expreſſely taught in the proceedings of Chriſts Diſciples, of whom it is ſayd, that notwithſtanding that Chriſt ſpake plainely of his death &amp; reſurrection, yet that they could not vnderſtand it, nor diue into the depth thereof, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 33. 34. but that afterwardes by obſeruing the event of things, they vnderſtood it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 22. And thus a godly heart that is wont to looke into Gods workes, becommeth an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretor to it ſelfe of many places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond ſort of Benefits concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods workes, we reape hence this ſpeciall fruite, in that we learne by the declaration afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, not to become ſo peruerſe, nor reſolute concerning many things &amp; actions that are done and happen in the world, whereas many ſimple men, that haue not buſied their braynes about looking into the word of God, nor in marking of the courſe of Gods workes, become obſtinate thereby, and grow careleſſe and ſlacke to regard the ſpirituall life, in regard of the proſperitie of the vngodly, and the aduerſitie of the godly, which at the firſt they could not vnderſtand, nor
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18898:49"/>
conceiue; and therefore gaue a wrong interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, becauſe they entred not into the ſanctuary of the Lord, which now is his worde, for when wee wholy relie vpon the word of God in all worldly accidents, wee attayne vnto the right vnderſtanding of things that belong vnto God, and are not thereby hardened, but rather inſtructed and made better; <hi>pſal. 92. 6. 7. pſal. 73. Iob.</hi> 17. 8. 9.</p>
               <p>Touching the third ſorte of fruits concerning the manner of our obedience, which according vnto the word of God, wee owe vnto him, there are three fruites. In the firſt place wee are by the aforeſayd declaration, inſtructed to diſcerne our owne and other mens ouerſights, and are therby aduertiſed both how ſinne on the one ſide, by careleſneſſe of liuing, the pleaſures of the worlde and all maner of wicked actions doth oftentimes procure diuers inconueniences and perplexeties, vnto thoſe that are adicted thereunto, and in all occurrents, makes their proſperitie a curſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which putteth vs in great feare &amp; doubt to enter into that way, that is ſo full of danger &amp; ſo troubleſome as that we our ſelues by our own experience can ſay vnto our ſoules; <hi>Oh my ſoule enter not into this way, I haue ſeene many fall therein I my ſelfe haue often beene hardly beſied therein, and ſo long as wee will goe into this way, our proſperitie will become a curſe vnto vs, and be a meanes to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw vs,</hi> and if wee can ſay thus much by our owne experience to our ſoules, it will be a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to diuert vs from the way of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18898:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and againe on the other ſide, when by the aforeſayd declaration, wee finde and ſee that the feare of God, conſtancie, righteouſneſſe, good workes and godlineſſe, for certaine haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this life and the life to come, yea and that thoſe that are indued therewith, haue great peace of conſcience, and are preſerued from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſchances whereinto wickedneſſe and ſinne draw men, and that in all dangers and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are comforted and imboldened, we can not but be therby ſtrongly prouoked and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawne to the practiſe of godlines, ſo that we can ſay vnto our ſoules, <hi>Surely this is a good way, it hath beene proſperous vnto the end, to all thoſe that followed it, and all thoſe that enter into it ſhall endure vnto the end:</hi> Heb. 13. 7. <hi>and if any aduerſitie or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation happeneth vnto vs, yet wee ſhall bee of good comfort and imboldned: for God will then be with vs, his Rod and his Staffe ſhall comfort vs,</hi> Pſal. 23 4. 5.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that wee are alſo by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd conſiderations made very prouident, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and wiſe, for that by thoſe thinges that are paſt, and which wee haue well conſidered of and beheld how they were done, we learne to know and find out what will follow vpon, and proceed from ſuch &amp; ſuch the like actions, and what good or euill we are to expect, if we doe ſuch and ſuch things, and ſo we obtaine the gift of <hi>Approbation,</hi> Phil. 1. 9. and become wiſe as the children of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> were (to counſell our ſelues and others what at other times is beſt to bee done, or not to be done. 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 12. 33. as for example, wee haue in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18898:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times found that vppon Maſſe dayes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſticall feaſt dayes, much hurt hath beene done, by drunkenneſſe, fighting, quarelling, and other mildemeanors, which for the time to come we thereby learne to be warie of, and are warned to ſhunne them vpon other maſſe dayes, and to withdraw our ſelues and others from them, wee are alſo taught, that the healths which are drunke in ſigne o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> loue, haue cauſed much trouble at feaſts and banquets, and induced great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and therefore we learne to ſhunne them, and as horne Beaſts, to baniſh them out of our feaſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 28. 29. 30. And thus by meanes of the aforeſaid declarations (Gods grace help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs) we learne how to guide and carrie our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues in theſe wicked and dangerous dayes, that are ſo full of inducements, ſtopps, ſtumbling blockes, and offences, holily and ſafely into the way of peace, and therby daily fit and further our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues in our iourney towardes Gods kingdome in heauen, the place that we aſpire vnto.</p>
               <p>The third is, that we are likewiſe by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid conſiderations made alwayes prompt and readie in all the things aforeſaid, and in all other things that belong to a ſpirituall life, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the moſt high God, to direct our ſelues, &amp; to goe forward therein with all boldneſſe, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſpirituall ſtrength. For touching bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and courage, when by experience with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> we haue found, that Gods word and workes agree ſo well together, ſtrengthen ſo much one the other, and keepe ſo friendly and faſt the one
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18898:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the other, <hi>We are not affraid to ſpeake thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings and Princes</hi> when neede requireth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 46. Yea, then with all boldneſſe we will vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, defend, and aduance Gods cauſe, being well aſſured, that maintaining the ſame wee ſhall not be aſhamed thereby. Secondly, we ſhall alſo doe it with confidence of heart, not as thoſe that heare of it onely by report, but that by our owne experience and good knowledge ſpeake and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which we doe. The Apoſtle witneſſeth, that being confident in the feare of the Lord, hee moued many to the like confidence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. And it is ſtrange to conſider, how certainly they haue ſpoken of heauen, of hell, of the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, of guiltineſſe of Conſcience, of the joy of the godly, and of the helliſh liues of the vngodly, that haue noted and marked ſuch things, and haue found them true by experience in themſelues, or in others: laſtly, wee ſhall alſo doe all this with ſtrength, and that not in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard onely, becauſe doing it with boldneſſe and confidence, we ſhall thereby the more forciblie worke vpon mens mindes; but further alſo in that being holpen by the aforeſaid experience, we ſhal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>be able the more fitly to apply the places of holy Scripture to the vnderſtanding of thoſe wee ſhall haue occaſion to deale with, whereby they may the better perceiue and know, that God ſpeaketh by vs, and may thereby be moued to fall downe on their knees, and honor God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24. 25.</p>

For by that which we haue before ſhewed, wee may plainely ſee and perceiue that wee are not wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to rule and gouerne our ſelues, that wee haue not earneſtly ſought the ſame, but refuſed it, which we now wiſh that wee had obtained, yea, that often times with might and maine wee haue ſought to put that from vs which afterward wee haue found to be very needfull and neceſſary for vs, and might haue done vs much good, and that the Lord our God hath alwayes much better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected our cauſe, then we could either deuiſe, or had power to conceiue, yea, and that in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt troubles a bleſſing hath beene caſt thereupon, and that wee haue beene ſo careleſſe and heedles thereof, that it was our owne faults that wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it no ſooner, but rather that our hearts for

a tyme haue in a manner beene ouercome with griefe and heauineſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, thus may we be alſo comforted in all tribulations, and aduerſities, when by our owne experience our ſoules are able to ſet before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the gracious care which our Lord God hath alwayes had of thoſe that are his people, in all their neceſſities, and although matters ſeeme to be prolonged, and our deliuerance to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, yet we muſt not doubt thereof, for we haue learned by the former conſiderations, that the Lord is wont oftentimes to goe round about, and to fetch matters a farre off, in the comforting and helping of his people, that ſo hee may haue the more honour, and may miniſter more cauſe of comfort to his Children, when vnexpectedly hee helpeth them, and by one meanes or other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for, procureth their deliuerance, as it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared in the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> cauſe in <hi>Hammons</hi> tyme, as alſo in <hi>Ioſephs, Dauids,</hi> and others cauſes, whom he intended to exalt; and yet daily in many accidents that befall Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in this age, yea, and in our owne affayres, for how often haue wee alſo before this tyme beene layd in the mire to the very knees and ell-bowes, and trod vnder feete by proud perſons, and yet at the laſt hath the Lord lifted vp our heads, and hath made vs a free people, as at this day it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; So that in this reſpect when it ſeemeth to goe againſt vs, wee may ſpeake of the Lord our God, vnto our ſoules, as <hi>Naomi</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ruth</hi> of <hi>Boaz, Sit ſtill my daughter vntill thou know how</hi>

                  <hi>the matter will fall out, for the Lord will not be at reſt vntill he haue brought it to a good end,</hi> Ruth 3. 18. And we muſt learne with all patience and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde to commend all our affayres to God, as we ſee that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt did, who in the greateſt dangers, and thoſe that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be moſt preiudiciall to Gods cauſe, was ſtill and quiet, and <hi>committed the matter vnto God, that iudgeth righteouſly,</hi> as when he was tolde that <hi>Herod</hi> the King had cut of the head of <hi>Iohn</hi> his forerunner, a cruell deed, and ſuch a one as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meed to be very preiudiciall to Gods cauſe, he put it vp peaceably, ſuffered it to goe on, tooke care for himſelfe and his Diſciples, and the better to ſecure them, &amp; to get out of cruell <hi>Herods</hi> handes, went apart into another place, but proceeded ſtill in his vocation, and the worke which his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father had appoynted him to doe.</p>
               <p>And thus beeing holpen by the conſideration aforeſayde, and the experience which thereby wee haue reaped, to the comfort and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our heartes in all troubles and oppreſſions, wee may alwayes bee aſſured of this, that all the troubles that be fall the children of God, is vnto them as <hi>the trouble of Ioſeph,</hi> as the holy Scripture calleth it, that is, ſuch manner of trouble as whereby great ioy proſperitie and great promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is layd vp in ſtore for them.

of him, his bondage, his falſe accuſation, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery by <hi>Potiphers</hi> wife impoſed on him, and his wrongfull impriſonment that followed there upon, that all theſe things did altogether worke for and procure <hi>Ioſephs</hi> good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. and did altogether ſtrengthen him, and was a great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of his promotion and aduancement, as wee may reade in <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 39 40. 41. 42. And of the like nature are all the troubles and miſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which Gods people and his Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for a time, which in the end therefore ſhall turne to their good, and are nothing meane while, but as a preparatiue to their future aduancement.
