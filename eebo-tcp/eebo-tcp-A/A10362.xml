         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was not perhaps, intended by the renowned
<pb facs="tcp:26168:3"/>
Author, that these Instructions shold be made publique: they were directed to his Sonne, who doth make iust &amp; due use of them. But such is the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre of Wisedome, that it cannot be hidden. Men may
<pb facs="tcp:26168:3"/>
bequeath their Wealth to their Children in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but their Wisedome was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for more generall Good-<hi>Virgil</hi> willed that his deathlesse <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis</hi> should not live; but Great
<pb facs="tcp:26168:4"/>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> chose herein rather to violate his Will, then to bury such Treasure. Wee neede not such an Authority nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for this Publication: it is sufficient that it is a communicable
<pb facs="tcp:26168:4"/>
Good. Could his noble Sonne bee hereby any way impaired, He shold still have impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated it. But now He shall gain thus much; The World shall see that the most secret Counsels of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:26168:5"/>
were Iust and religious, and hath good cause to hope that a Sonne so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed can be no otherwise.</p>
            <p>Suppose (<hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) that thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might or shold have given thee such Advice; so
<pb facs="tcp:26168:5"/>

               <p>THere is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming a wise man
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:26168:8"/>
then to make choice of Freinds; for by them thou shalt bee judged what thou art; let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be wise and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and none of those that follow thee for gaine, but make election rather of thy Betters then thy Inferiors, shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alwayes such as are poore &amp; nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26168:8"/>
for if thou giuest twenty guifts, and refuse to doe the like but once, all that thou hast done will bee lost, and such men will become thy mortall Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; take also es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall care, that thou neuer trust any Friend, or Soruane, with any matter that may endanger thine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26168:9"/>
estate, for so shalt thou make thy selfe a bond-slaue to him that thou trustest, and leaue thy selfe alwayes to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and be sure of this, thou shalt neuer find a freind in these thy young yeares, whose conditions, and qualities will please the after thou commest to more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26168:9"/>
discretion; and then all thou giuest is lost, and all wherein thou shalt trust such an one, wilbe disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered; such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as are thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors will follow thee, but to eate thee vp, and when thou leauest to feed them, they will hate thee; and such kinde of men, if thou preserue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26168:10"/>
thy estate; will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be had; and if thy Friends bee of better qualitie then thy selfe, thou maist been sure of two things, that they wil be more carefull to keepe thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, because they haue more to loose then thou. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they esteeme thee not, because thou
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26168:10"/>
doest possesse, but for thy selfe; but if thou bee subject to any great vanitie, or ill, which I hope God will blesse thee from, then therein trust no man; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans folly ought to be his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test secret. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I perswade thee to associate thy selfe with thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26168:11"/>
at least Peeres; yet remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that thou venter not thy estate with any of those great ones, that shall attempt vnlawfull things, for such men labour for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and not for thee; thou shalt be sure to part with them in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but not in their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26168:11"/>
honour; and to venture a true estate in present, in hope of a better in future, is meere madnes; and great men forget such as haue done them seruice, when they haue obtained what they would; and will rather hate thee for saying, thou hast beene a meanes of their preferment,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26168:12"/>
then acknowledge it. I could giue a thousand examples, &amp; my selfe knowes it, who haue tasted it, in all the course of my life; So that I need not in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so knowne, giue instance in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Let thy loue therefore bee, to loue God, thy Country, thy Prince, and

thine owne estate before all others: for the Fancies of men change, and hee that loues to day, hateth to morrow; but let Reason bee thy Schoolmistris which shall guide thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>

               <p>THe next, and greatest care in this life, ought to be in choice of thy Wife, and the onely danger therein is Beautie, by which all men in all Ages, wise, and foolish, haue beene betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And though I

know it vaine to vse Reasons, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to dismay thee, from being captiuated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, there being few that euer resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Witcherie; yet I cannot omit to warne thee, as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which may bee thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time. It is true,

that euery man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his fantasie in that Appetite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other worldlie deserts, leauing the care of Honour, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and safetie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect thereof; yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, though these afflictions doe not last, yet the bonds of Marriage, dureth to the end of the life. Nor giue thy

humour libertie, in accompaning light Women; for though that humour may change in thee againe, yet the blot it leaues on thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Remember secondly, that if thou marrie for Beautie, thou bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy selfe for all thy life, for that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26168:15"/>
which perchance will neither last nor please thee one yere; and when thou hast it, it will be vnto thee of no price at all, for the desire dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when it is attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perisheth, when it is satisfied. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when thou wert a sucking Child, thou diddest

love thy Nurse, and that thou wert fond of her, after a Child thou didst love thy dry Nurse, and didst forget the other, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that thou didst al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so despise her, so will it be in thy liking in elder yeares; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though thou canst not forbeare to love, yet forbeare to linke, and after a

while thou shalt find an alteration in thy selfe, and see an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other far more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing then the first, second, or third love: yet I wish thee above all the rest, have care thou doest not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an uncomely Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for any respect, comelinesse in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is riches, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else bee left

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26168:17"/>
not with want; for shee is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of plentie, for I never knew yet a poore Woman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeding faire, that was not made disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest by one or other in the end.
