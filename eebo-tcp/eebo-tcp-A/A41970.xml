            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus by this great Divine, living in the miſtieſt time of <hi>Popery,</hi> it may plainly appear, that it was a received Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the total deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> and the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſhould conclude the end of the World: There was alſo another Propheſie of the Times found in writing in the Church of St. <hi>Dennis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by the Sexton of that Pariſh, as he was digging in a place to erect a Monument, or Fabrick, for the Lord <hi>Teligni:</hi> He gave it unto the Popes Nuncio, who rewarded him with 200 <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> for his pains: From him, it was ſent to the Cardinal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> who preſented it unto the young King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. It was written in Parchment, and wrapt in Lead in the form of an Heart Numerical Figures are placed on the ſide, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying in what year of our Lord every Accident ſhould come to paſs.</p>

By this Propheſie, great Troubles muſt ariſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> within this ſmall time, cruel Wars afflicting every State thereof, which muſt be preparations to the utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chief City of <hi>Rome,</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf can never be deſtroyed, unleſs <hi>Proteſtants</hi> lay aſide their unneceſſary civil Contentions, which may come to them, againſt their wills, in the year 1665. After which, great commotions are like to ariſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> until a Noble Chriſtian Hero [of Royal Blood] ariſe, who ſhall quench thoſe evils, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying Chriſtians in Martial exerciſes againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And about this time, Two hundred thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> are in the Field, with an intent to invade <hi>Germany;</hi> they have already ſome part of <hi>Hungaria</hi> in poſſeſsion, of which you ſhall hear more largely hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now there hath been, and is yet, continual contentions and maſſacres amongſt the Turks, the Jannizaries eluding and deſpiſing the young and weak Emperour, which terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>Muſtiva</hi> and the <hi>Baſſas</hi> ſore, becauſe they had this Propheſie. <hi>That as a</hi> Mahomet <hi>did win</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>ſo a</hi> Mahomet <hi>ſhould loſe it again to the Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However things go for the preſent, yet in the year 1658, will be fatal both unto the Turk and the Pope, utter ruines, and the beginning of the comparative felicity of the Church of God, as may be further manifeſted by another Authentique Propheſie, which was found in the Study of <hi>Juſtus Lipſius,</hi> wherein was thus written:</p>

            <p>In order to a beginning of this great work, we hear, that there is now lately a great defeat given to the <hi>Turks,</hi> by His Majeſties Navy, the manner whereof was thus:</p>
            <p>As the Lord General <hi>Montague</hi> was ſailing with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fleet on thoſe Seas, he was by a ſudden and violent ſtorm driven to Harbour: By that time he had remained there the ſpace of an hour, the ſtorm ceaſed, and knowing where he was, immediately endeavoured to find entrance into the Port of <hi>Guienne,</hi> in which place lay a great number of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galleys, who very reſolutely reſiſted him: But after a tedious and cruel conflict between both parties, and a great number of <hi>Turks</hi> ſlain, General <hi>Montague</hi> took the afore-ſaid Port, with the loſs of two Ships, of which moſt of the Men were ſaved, having ſunk and fired of the enemy to the number of 80 Galleys, and hath ſince taken <hi>Agria,</hi> a ſtrong hold in <hi>Hungaria;</hi> to the ſtrengthning and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of which, divers of the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> are come to aſſiſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with whom are joyned great Armies of <hi>Greecians, Venecians,</hi> and <hi>Hungarians:</hi> Time will ſoon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt their proceedings.</p>
            <q>The conſideration of this may teach Men Humility in Proſperity, carefulneſs to know God, and keep his Commandements; ſeeing every Plant he hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhall be pluckt up, and nothing can be permanent but by his favour and protection.</q>
