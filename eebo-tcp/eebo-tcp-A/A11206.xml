            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And how sower and bytter is the vnpure and dysceyuable loue of the worlde. Charyte scorneth the glory of this worlde / it dysdayne and reproue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> toylynge and besynes therof. And sheweth what folisshnes it is to haue confidence and trust in these thynges that passen awaye so lyghtly / it merueyleth at the blyndenes of men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> louen so this erthely thinges / it wondereth why they do not vtterly contempne them. Charyte thynketh that thynge to be swete vnto all men that sauoureth well vnto her selfe / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

thynge to please them that she loueth / it thynketh that thyng that she knoweth to be manyfest vnto all. And thus it discouereth it selfe where it is / for it wyll not abyde onely withinforth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyll / but it must go withoutforth by shewyng of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes in outwarde conuersacion. O charyte I haue praysed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> as ferre as I can / and yet I caste in my mynde yf there maye be sayd ony more excellente prayse vnto thy laude. I can not saye whether it be more to call the god: or to saye that thou dyddest ouercome god that / that is more yf ony be more / that gladly and boldely wolde I saye of the / thus prayseth Hugo myn ymage. Take it therfore and set it fast vpon the aulter of your herte / alwaye lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge vpon it / consyder the goodnes of it / remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre the vertue &amp; power of it / se the many folde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylouse effectes. It caused god to make man / it drewe hym from heuen to erth for to redeme hym agayne frome seruitude of the deuyll / it Ioyned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moost hye and pure nature to the moost lowe and vyle nature wherin it wrought merueylouse thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / in resynge deed men / helynge lypers / and all maner dyseases. And at the last it wounded cryst full bytterly / and slewe hym full pyteously / for to quycke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our soules full mercyfully / and resyd hym agayne full gloryously / vs for to Iustefy / it lyfte hym vp agayn to heuen ful Ioyously / there man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde to gloryfye / it drewe vp steue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vyctoryously / and crowned hym eternally. It conuerted sodenly saynt Paule and fixed hym so fast vnto Iesu / <note place="margin">Ro. viij.</note> that nother trybulacyon ne anguysh persecucyon hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger pouerte to go naked sworde ne other parelles / 
<pb facs="tcp:11205:26"/>
coude not dysseuer hym frome the loue of cryst / ye and it made Paule so stronge that he sayd more of hymselfe and his folowers. I trust sayth he that nother dethe ne lyfe / nor none of all the aungelles in heuen nor in hell / ne nothynge good nor yll that is present or for to come / no strong violence nor hye power ne depe wytte / nor ony other creature / can seperate vs frome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charyte of god / that is in our lorde Iesu cryste / and after them this loue made innumerable people to loue &amp; cast away al wordly thynges / and to ronne after cryst not sparyng nor ferynge / fyre / sworde / payne / ne no maner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / but gladly toke them with grete desyre / it was but a smalle thynge to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to forsake theyr frendes for the loue of Ihesu. And thus not onely in stronge men / but also in women and chyldren weyke and frayle / and in yonge tender vyrgyns y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were made by loue more stronge than all tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes that fered nother kynge nor Emperour / and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them both in wysdome and in strength / for to suffre more paynes than theyr tormentoures coude put them to / and vtterly confounded them. O good charyte O dere charyte / yf I vnworthy defyled wretche haue presumed to prayse the and to shewe thyn ymage thus rudely / where so many holy and noble men haue praised and commended the / but yet nothynge as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> arte worthy / as they wytnes themselfe. I cry the mercy and them also besechynge the to come in to my soule for to kyndle it in loue / to lyghten it with grace / to dilate myne hert / to stretche out my desyre / to open y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bosome of my mynde / to enlarge &amp; stablysshe thy dwellynge

place in my soule. ¶That it maye receyue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good lorde. Father / sone / and holy ghost / moost hye cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte in to my reason wyll and memory / for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynuall dweller in me. And lykewyse in you good ladyes perpetually. AMEN</p>
