            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Our friends in the Common-Councell are brave and eſpecially our beſt Ingineers, the two Aldermen, the one for Logicke and ſolid Reaſon, the other for ſweete Rhetoricke excels all the City, and gaines many a fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Common-Councell Man to his party.</p>

               <hi>Iohn Pennington</hi> leſt in his hands which he concealed, and ſo became a Delinquent himſelfe) he was by the Ordinance to pay it double: and the Houſe gave him over and above 3000l. this was ſo partiall and groſſ:, that our very friends cry ſhame of it: and it is a great ſcandall to our party: for Alderman <hi>Atkins,</hi> he is ridiculous and the ſcorn and by word, and cliped Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>We have diſcovered that the Apprentices have their ſeverall Agitators, ſo have the Saylors, Watermen, Carmen, Porters, Butchers: and the Ringleaders of all theſe are the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does. I could here wiſh our friends in the Army had not ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inſiſted to the Parliament to have them put out of <hi>London</hi> by Ordinance: for ſome of them ſaid openly, the Army are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of us, therefore we will continue in the City: Beſides for our obedience to the Parliament, and relinquiſhing the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mutineers, we are called deſertors of the Army, and are voted to be disbanded; and one day (ſay they) the Houſe was ready to vote down Sir <hi>Thoma's</hi> Commiſſion and Declaration, and the reſt of thoſe Officers Traitors which ſummoned the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and afterwards the caſe was altered, aud the ſame Traytors accuſed the 11 Members.</p>
            <p>The Reformadoes laugh at our charge againſt the 11. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for (ſay they) it is againſt law for an Army to accuſe any man, becauſe they cannot make reparation in caſe their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prove falſe. But we have intelligence that the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does and ſome others will bring in a Charge againſt 6. Lords, and 30 Comminers: and that they wil not proceed in generals, but in particulars, and the proſecutors intend to proceed le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally and ſet their names to the charge; ſome they will accuſe of high Treaſon, others of high crimes: and the leaſt crimes are that they have given the publike treaſure to themſelves being feoffees in truſt for the publike, contrary to the fundamentall lawes of the Realme: whereby the ſouldery is unpaid, and the publike faith unſatisfied, contrary to their ſeverall Declarations and Ordinances; and no doubt but this will pay all the arrears of the Commanders and Souldiers about the towne. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve never to leave the Houſes, till ſome be ſequeſtred as ſoone
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97021:3"/>
as prooffe is made: and they are for purging the Houſe as well as we, and will put out many (as they brag) by the ſame votes they will make it ſerve as a trap to catch our own party. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I like not their oth <hi>ex officio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for it is againſt our principles the liberty of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>They are reſolved to inforce the Houſe to revoake Sir <hi>Thoma's</hi> Commiſſion, and to ſend immediately for the King (otherwiſe we ſuſpect from ſome extraordinary intelligencer we have) that they will get ſome of our beſt friends of both Houſes into the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and to guard it with Reformadoes, Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, Seamen, Watermen, Porters, &amp;c. And for certaine they are all linck'd together by a damnable covenant. They ſay wee are all for our ſelves, and to that end keep up an Army to inſlave the kingdome, and have forced both Houſes the 60000l. a moneth, which was intended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and converted to their own uſe, and will make the King as Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and and make 31. of themſelves Grandies and Conſervators of the Peace. <hi>I</hi> am ſorry our friends have iſſued their deſignes ſo faſt,</p>
            <p>And they ſcorne at our Colonells, and ſay all the Army can make is not 2000l. Land <hi>per annum.</hi> And that each Regiment, will be worth 1000l. <hi>per annum.</hi> As <hi>Pride</hi> the Dray-man, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> the poore Shomaker, <hi>Okey</hi> the Brewers Clark, <hi>Whaley</hi> not worth a groat before theſe times. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> an Atturnies boy the other day, <hi>Rich</hi> a Coward, <hi>Fleetwood</hi> a Coward, <hi>L. G. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> a notorious Coward. Theſe are great ſcandals, and I pray get them amended.</p>
            <p>They ſay alſo that Colonell <hi>Tho. Hammond, Rainſburough Lilburn,</hi> Sir <hi>Hardres Waller,</hi> were poore, and turned <hi>Jndepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> to pleaſe <hi>Crumwell; Ireton</hi> they ſay was a <hi>Parſons</hi> ſon, that he is proud, wilfull, and revengfull. For our <hi>Atlas,</hi> brave <hi>Crum.</hi> they ſay he was a Brewers ſon at <hi>Ely,</hi> and called the <hi>Town Bull,</hi> and he is much talked of for Colo. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> wife: I would our freind <hi>Lilburn</hi> would leave his ſcurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perſonating, it becomes not our profeſſion which is ſanctity and gravity, and his freedome of writing, cauſes all theſe aſpertions. And now the <hi>Presbiterians</hi> are vext, they ſpit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97021:3"/>
and skratch like ſomany gib Cats. We heare there are divers Lawyers of their Counſell, and that the Presbiterian Citizens makes a generall purſe to carry on the forenamed Charge with Gravity. They intend to fall foule one my LORD <hi>Say</hi> for the loſſe at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and leaving the plate there, and ſending mony to the King, and correſpondency at <hi>Oxford</hi> with <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and ſome others. They will revive the buſineſſe of the loſſe of <hi>Briſtow</hi> and <hi>Banbury</hi> by <hi>Nathaniel</hi> and <hi>John Fines.</hi> In a word, either they will force the <hi>Parliament</hi> to riſe confuſedly, then where are we? or it they adjourne, they are but a Committee that can conclude nothing. We heare the Soliceter, our wiſe <hi>L. G. Crumwell, Jreton,</hi> and young Sr. <hi>Henry Vaine, Eveling</hi> of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and 4 Lords are for joyning with the King. And ſome great ones of the Kings party have undertaken it; but we fear the Queen, the French Embaſſador, and the Scots. And wee have intelligence ſome Citizens meet often with them, and that they promiſe if they will make good <hi>London,</hi> they have an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 20000 foote. 6000 horſes, and 2000 Dragones which are ready, and that <hi>Montroſſe, Kilketto,</hi> the <hi>Stewards,</hi> the <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> and all the Kings party will riſe as one man, and will bee content (ſo they be pardoned for what is paſt, which is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that they will take and fight for the endes of the Covenant eſpecially to eſtabliſh the King on his Throne, according to the Apprentices Petition.</p>
            <p>Wee find the Kings party generally falls from us, becauſe (ſay they) you do nothing for the King but carry him up and down like a vagabond farther from us, and they ſuſpect you will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon him in <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle: you muſt do ſome popular thing ſpeedily, offer the King his own conditions, I meane ſuch as are for ſafety. We heare the Agitators grow peremtory, and claſh with the Counſell of War. That they are all for parity and a Republick, and that they give out the <hi>Counſell</hi> of war is above them.</p>
            <p>Take heed you intertain not too many Souldiers from <hi>London,</hi> nor of the Kings party, for they will deceave you: and beware of that beggerly Scot, Maſter <hi>Walter Steward,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Oradiell Carnewayh,</hi> they will ſell you at the laſt to thoſe which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97021:4"/>
will bid moſt, and if the Scots comes, they will bee as ſo many ſpies upon you.</p>
            <p>The Scotts are very Iocuand, and tis thought (by ſome who have good Intelligence) that the King hath ſigned a Declaration under hand, wherein he declares himſelfe a Priſoner, and that his Parliament is in the like condition: that the Army is the Gaoler, that he will declare the firſt opportunity that is offered, for a free Parliament. In a word we are in a ſtraight: for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>I</hi> was certainly informed that the Presbyterian faction will ſecure the principall Members of both Houſes and of our beſt friends in the Tower, and there they ſhall remaine as Hoſtiges untill the King be at ſafety at his houſe at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> Commiſſion ſhall be voted downe, and if he doe not obey, that a Declaration be ſet forth to the Kingdome, to proclaime him and his Officers which ſhall not obey Traytors: and that the ſeverall Counties give no free Quarter, nor pay no Taxes. And that they reſolve to pay the common Souldiers all there Arreares both Horſe and foot, and eaſe the Kingdom of all burdens, eſpecially Committees.</p>
            <p>That the five Members of the Army ſhall bee proclaimed Traytors, and have Articles drawne up by all againſt them.</p>
            <p>Tis whiſpered the Lawyers will make all thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at <hi>Ioyoes</hi> plundering the King Traitors.</p>
            <p>We heare that the City hath Agitators in all the Counties to aſſociate with them, and that they ſend to all their friends, the leaders of the Declaration: <hi>Kent</hi> are much troubled their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee is going down, it will be a great blow to out party. You muſt be couragious and ſtorme <hi>London</hi> preſently, otherwiſe we are all undone: And threaten to plunder the Rich, which will worke more upon them then Reaſon.</p>
            <p>All my hope is they dare not defend their owne, nor run ſuch a haſſard: and in your Declaration ſet forth, that all that are neutrall ſhall not be plundered, hope and feare are the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Paſſions of the rich. What you doe you muſt doe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and give out you are bringing the King to <hi>London:</hi> and counterfeit the Kings hand to a Declaration.</p>

            <p>They jeere and give out that all our Commanders will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſacred Perſons, eſpecially <hi>Crumwell</hi> and <hi>Jreton,</hi> they are wiſe and fitter for direction, the brave <hi>Hardy</hi> Generall muſt fight himſelfe as he did at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> and <hi>Crumwell</hi> muſt direct, and look to the Reare, and the laſt Reſerve. We want brave <hi>Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter,</hi> I heare he is too much of the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> faction. Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the beſt, and that cannot but make our Cauſe good: but wee are much ſcandoliſed with covetouſneſſe, ambition and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but theſe are but the infirmities of perticular men, not of the godly party of the Army.</p>
            <p>We are much murmured at by the people, that wee ſend not reliefe for <hi>Ireland,</hi> being in ſuch extremity: I wiſh well to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but I love the Welth of <hi>England</hi> better, we have been very neere to have all <hi>England</hi> in our poſſeſſion. This baſe Irreligious City hath been a rub in our way: but I hope they ſhall pay for it with Intereſt: for I hope you will inrich the poore Saints (which is there proper inheritance) with the Treaſure of Vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and cheating Citizens. Let mee heare at large and often from you, and twiſe a week you ſhall have an anſwer. Farewell deare Brother.</p>
            <p>You muſt proſper, for you have the Prayers of the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints.</hi>
