            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS nothing can be preſented to the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the World of greater value, then the Labours of Famous <hi>Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,</hi> who deſcribe to the life the Examples of ſuch Eminent Perſonages as were tranſcendent in preceding Ages; and may in their
<pb facs="tcp:53025:3"/>
Succeſſours beget both Emulation and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: ſo ſhall I not need to apprehend that this Hiſtory (which in all humility I preſent unto Your Highneſs) will prove unacceptable, ſince therein You may encounter with ſuch a Model of all kinde of Vertues and Perfections, as I hope may take a deeper impreſſion in Your Highneſſes Breaſt, in regard that it will be found, that Art herein is ſeconded by Nature. And whereas I am under the laſh of a ſevere Caſtigation for my preſumption, in profering this Hiſtory to Your Review, as I acknowledge, when I ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how You have attracted to Your Self that lively Pourtraiture of his Great Soul, that You appear the true Embleme both of his Vertues and Majeſty.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe Your moſt Serene Highneſs, I cannot chuſe but addreſs this preſent Oblation as to Your Self, ſo in other Languages, to the reſt of the Princes and Potentates of the Earth, I bequeath it unto poſterity, very humbly craving the favourable Protection of Your Highneſſes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. Nor durſt I publiſh ſo glorious a Work to the World, before I had craved Your Highneſſes pardon for my Raſhneſs, in adventuring to trace thoſe Vigorous Lineaments in the <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom Your Highneſs ſo well reſembleth, and in whom your Highneſs beareth ſo great a part. Moreover, as a ſole <hi>Apelles</hi> could onely be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo great an Enterprize, ſo it will be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unneceſſary for me to endeavour the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that Pourtraiture, which ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb facs="tcp:53025:3"/>
is manifeſted to all the World, both in Your Highneſſes Perſon and Actions: Wherefore, my Lord, I muſt needs confeſs, that Your Highneſs is the true Original, and mine onely relating to the Out-ſide of ſo Great and unalterable an Albioniſt. The truth is, I finde not in my ſelf ability to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Real Worth of His Accompliſhments, and Hardy Features, accompanied with that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity and Luſtre, which ſecret Myſtery lyeth onely in the Hand of that great Maſter of Nature, and Extant in that very Perſonage, whoſe Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile is hardly this Day to be found in the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, except in Your Inimitable Self. Nor doth Art or Humane frailty allow ſo much to be in the Poſſeſſion of the beſt men. Therefore thoſe who go about to Pourtraict ſuch like Incomparable Perſonages, cannot avoid one of thoſe extremities, which Painters run into when they go about to repreſent the Sun; who either place themſelves at ſo great a diſtance, as that they can onely diſcover an ineffications and feeble Reflections of its Beams; or approach ſo neer unto it, as that being dazled with its Reſplendency, and overcome with its Heat, they are bereaved of their Senſes, and retain onely their Hearts at liberty to adore and admire that powerful Hand, which formed ſo glorious a Creature. To the like <hi>Non plus</hi> am I reduced, who raſhly aſcend to the very ſummit of the Throne of Honour, thence to contemplate his late Highneſs Perſon, ſurrounded by ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Reſplendency as no eyes are able to behold, nor to be comprehended by the mindes of men; ſo
<pb facs="tcp:53025:4"/>
that I muſt needs ſink under the burthen, and content my ſelf with the Poets Expreſſion,
<q>
                  <l>—Inopem me copia fecit.</l>
               </q>
In which extaſie all my Senſes being ſurprized, my Heart is onely left free to admire, and my Tongue to plead Excuſes, and offer up good Wiſhes, which I moſt humbly Dedicate and Devote unto Your moſt Serene Highneſs. Nor could the Heavens have ever eſtabliſhed a more fitting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, to bear a ſhare in, or inclination unto this Work, then Your Highneſs, as well as to defend it from Envy it ſelf. And if ſo be Hiſtory be a ſecond Life, Your Highneſs may judge by the black Attempts which threatned Your Glorious Father, how this Work will be aſſailed; and how many Enemies its Authour muſt reſolve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Liſts withall: their Rage being thereby renewed and augmented, by their percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Tomb hath onely bereaved us of the leaſt part of this Great Heroe. And how malicious ſoever their Envy may appear in ſuch Stories which poſſibly may be written in Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction hereof; it will onely publiſh from Truth it ſelf, to the World, their inveterate Spleen, which can never pierce through the bright Rayes of his Innocent and Glorious Actions.</p>
            <p>Moreover, whereas the Divine Providence hath ſo often and miraculouſly preſerved the firſt life of his late Highneſs, againſt the Attempts both of men and monſters; Your moſt Serene High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is alſo engaged, as well by Imitation, as by the Intereſt of Your Care and Royal Dignity,
<pb facs="tcp:53025:4"/>
to watch over the Preſervation of his ſecond Life, which is in Your Highneſs by ſo Lawful a Succeſſion, as is devolved upon Your Self. The Glorious Courſe whereof I reſolve to trace from this very moment; that I may the better publiſh the Illuſtrious Tranſactions thereof in five other Languages, which during my Travels I have acquired. In which alſo I intend to publiſh this preſent Hiſtory, the French being already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and fit for the Preſs: His great Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting proportionable Honours to its Dignity; and his vaſte Minde requiring number leſs Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, which may remain as ſo many living Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not to be defaced by Times Violence nor Envy. But I preſs this Subject too home to Your Highneſs, ſince You bear ſo great a ſhare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and my ſelf dare attribute ſo little of it to my own incapacity, of compaſſing ſo great an undertaking.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I ſhall onely hereby endeavour to attract others, and to ſhew them the Borders and Coaſt of that vaſte Sea into which they ought to lanch: ſo that like to a Forelorn Hope, I ſhall onely firſt mount the Breach, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Languages animate all the Trumpets of Fame, to Celebrate the Glory of his late High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in thoſe parts of the World, where I have converſed for the ſpace of ſixteen or eighteen years paſt. Hoping for the future to write the Heroick Actions of this Nation in unexpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Characters, to leave unto Poſterity (as an eye witneſs) the Rehearſal of thoſe Victories
<pb facs="tcp:53025:5"/>
which Heaven ſhall beſtow on <hi>England,</hi> under Your Glorious Government; that ſo I may the better ſatisfie my Zeal and Fidelity to Your Highneſs, and approve my ſelf to be</p>

            <p>THat which I do here intend to preſent you with all, is, the Life and Death of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> late Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of <hi>England;</hi> that Grand Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, whoſe Conduct and Fortune all the world doth admire; and who in the ſpace of ten years time, did accompliſh the work of a whole Age: nay more, he perfected the work of future Ages; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſettled <hi>England</hi> on ſuch good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that if ſhe continues to build thereon, ſhe may expect to produce ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Edwards,</hi> and ſecond <hi>Henries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Illuſtrious Perſonages life is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto you in three ſeveral Scenes; Firſt, you will finde him Dormant, like unto <hi>David</hi> midſt his Flocks, untill the Troubles of his Countrey awake him.
<pb facs="tcp:53025:6"/>
And that the Almighty was pleaſed to call upon him to appeaſe them, as well as to en creaſe his glory, you may reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the courſe and progreſs of his valour; by which being elevated almoſt to the ſublimeſt pitch of his Grandeur, he was left to act more abſolutely according to his own prudence, and was enforced to lay hands on the Reins of the moſt confuſed State that ever was.</p>
            <p>Where you will finde his late High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs demeaning himſelf like unto a well reſolved skillful Pilot in a Veſſel toſſed and tumbled by a tempeſt, beſtirring himſelf amidſt the contrarieſt of Winds, and wiſely and dexterouſly avoiding thoſe Rocks, Shelves, and Quickſands, which threatned <hi>England</hi> with a ſecond Shipwrack. This his ſage conduct being the more to be admired, in that as then he had but a limited Power, although the whole was due to his dexterity and prudence; yet each one thought they had as great a ſhare as himſelf in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power, which as they ſuppoſed they had acquired by the Pen or the Sword; either in the Army or in the Parliament: ſo that all this great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician
<pb facs="tcp:53025:6"/>
could as then do, was to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile thoſe ſeveral Opinions then in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to ſuffer himſelf to be ſwayed by the current of thoſe windes and ſtreams which he was neither willing nor well able to withſtand at that time.</p>
            <p>Now as there is nothing more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in States then great and ſudden changes, ſo nothing more difficult to be managed; and this being the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece which a Politician hath to act, this enſuing Hiſtory will diſcover unto us the chief and ſeveral Motions, Turnings, Windings, and Settling of the ſame.</p>
            <p>His late Highneſs like unto an expert Phyſician, was firſt put to read the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perment of <hi>England,</hi> her former way and manner of actings, before the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of her Humors, and the Symptomes of all the Evils and Malignities which threatned her. He likewiſe reflected on the Body Politick, which he found as well as the Humane had its Repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Evacuations, and Criſis; and then obſerved that as well in the one as the other, thoſe ſudedn changes which happen are either Deſtructive or Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He obſerved that theſe Bodies nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed

Choller as well as other Humors; and thence deemed War to be the beſt <hi>Rubarb</hi> to purge them, leaſt otherwiſe they might evacuate of themſelves. Moreover, he obſerved theſe Humors were ſubject to grow ſharp and to rebell, and that they oftentimes cauſed ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and hot fits, as that without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of an expert and accompliſhed Phyſician, death was like to enſue; or which is worſt, moſt violent languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intollerable diſeaſes. So that the thing which is moſt to be admired at in the conduct of this grand Politician, is, that he could governe a People, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a perfect Union and Tranquillity amidſt three Nations, whoſe mindes were agitated by ſeveral Opinions, and whereby they are continually ſtirred againſt each other; no motion tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting men more impetuouſly towards civil Diſſentions, then thoſe which ariſe from the ſeveral Profeſſions in Religion. For beſides the chief Religions profeſt in theſe three Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Proteſtant, the Epiſcopal, and ſome Roman Catholicks, there are ſprung up throughout all <hi>England,</hi> an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

of other Sectaries, which like unto ſo many <hi>Hidra's,</hi> did ſeem to iſſue forth from each others neck; and whereby the mindes of men were ſo diſcompoſed and hurried away into ſuch violent Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmes, as they ſtood in need of a good Guide to conduct and refrain them from a total precipitation. And as it would be a difficult task to give you the ſeveral Denominations, Derivations, and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings of all theſe ſeveral Schiſmaticks, I ſhall therefore paſs them by as being numberleſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if we acknowledge as it is moſt aſſuredly true, that Religion is the chief principal part which doth moſt of all contribute to the well ordering, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and peaceable ſettling and Governing of a People; we may eaſily judge that his late Highneſs the Lord Protector ſtood in need of more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sagacity, Prudence, and Conduct, to procure that Tranquillity, Plenty, and Splendour to <hi>England,</hi> wherein he left it; and the which without example, is hardly to be found in all the other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53025:11"/>
Soul comprehended all thoſe Seeds and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of ſuch Vertues, as do uſually render a Perſon capable to govern others.</p>

Two of the Parliaments Armies, the one commanded by the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the other by the Lord <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> being united to the Scotch Army
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53025:14"/>
their Confederates, Commanded by the Earl of <hi>Livin,</hi> had joyntly beſieged the City of <hi>York,</hi> the Metropolis of that County, and whereof the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was Governour for the King, who over and above his Gariſon which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, had alſo a brave and gallant Army, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was ſent by the King to raiſe that Siege, with ſuch conſiderable Forces, as being joyned to thoſe of the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> did well nigh equallize the Parliaments in number. The three Parliament Generals did immediatly raiſe the Siege to encounter Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> drew forth alſo his Forces out of the Town, and both Armies being drawn up in Battell-Array upon <hi>Marſton</hi> Moore,<note place="margin">The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Marſton</hi> Moor.</note> they  both fought with a great deal of Fury, Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and hopes of Victory, which at firſt ſeemed to incline to the Kings Part, the right Wing of the Parliaments Forces Commanded by the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> having the diſadvantage of the Ground, was over-whelmed by the left Wing of the Kings Party, who routed and defeated it: But his late Highneſs (who as then was ſtiled but a Colonel) whoſe after Appellations I ſhall obſerve by degrees, which Fortune advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to) who commanded the left Wing, and had not the leaſt advantage of the Ground, did ſo violently ſet upon the right Wing of the Kings Party, as that he brake in peeces Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> beſt Regiments, and forced them not only to give way, but to turn their Backs, and ſuffering only ſome part of his Men to purſue the Enemy, he with the reſt made half a turn about
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53025:15"/>
and charged the Enemies main Battell in the Rear ſo vigorouſly, as that putting Life again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord <hi>Fairfax's</hi> Souldiers, he conſtrained them to face about, and thereby ſo well reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Succeſs of the Battell, as that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Entire and compleat Victory. Two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the Enemies, and ſome of the beſt mounted of their Officers only making their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes by their Horſes good heels; and this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell was accounted the greateſt that ever was fought during theſe laſt Wars.</p>

with ſuch force and Courage, as that he made the Victory dubious, and ſo it continued for a good while, neither inclining to the one ſide, not the other, till at laſt the Kings Horſe falling a running, left their Foot to ſhift for themſelves, which were all cut in pieces and taken Priſoners, all the Canon &amp; Baggage was likewiſe taken, of a conſiderable value; there was alſo found a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of the Kings with his Papers of great Importance: The royall Standard, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Colours beſide were brought off, and his late Highneſs having purſed the Kings Horſe as long as he liſted, at length returned to the Camp with a great number of Priſoners.

There was no time ſpent in the framing of a Siege, or in the opening of Approaches, but each one minded the beating of the Iron whilſt it was hot, and concluded that the Confederates ought not to be ſuffered to rally themſelves, nor to unite in a Body again, wherefore a ſlight Breach being made, the Orders were given out for a generall Aſſault, but the Walls were lined with ſo many and ſo good Men chiefly in thoſe places where the Aſſault was to be given, as that the ſolidſt and graveſt Officers of the Army did repreſent unto his Excellency the General, that there was no appearance at all to carry the place by force, but that it would be better to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53025:17"/>
tyre and weary out the beſieged by the length of a ſiege, during which the breach might be made the larger. But Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whoſe prudence (as we have already obſerved) ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his valour, did briskly anſwer them that he would goe and open the breach for them, and placing himſelfe at the head of his Troops, cauſed the aſſault to be given, rendring this example of wiſdome to all great Perſonages, that in Actions of important conſequence nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Age, nor great Commands, or high Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ought to hinder a General to be the firſt man to goe on upon an aſſault, ſince it muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the moſt conſiderable, and raiſe them up to the higheſt pitch of honour and eſteem.</p>
            <p>Finally, after a ſharp and bloody conteſt hand to hand, moſt obſtinately maintained on all ſides, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> forced their entrance, and the General went into the place pell mell with his Souldiers, at which time the ardour and heat of the victory did appear to correſpond with his prudence, for though his generoſity did oblige him to give quarter to thoſe who had ſo well defended themſelves, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, deeming it fitting to make that place an example of terror unto the reſt of the Towns which were garriſoned, and which might coſt him too dear ſhould they ſtand out as ſturdily and obſtinately as theſe did, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all thoſe to be put to the ſword who were found to be in Arms, &amp; thus he ſacrificed 3000

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53025:18"/>
incredible. That ſo populous a Nation, ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo well diſciplined, ſo active and dexterous, ſhould not ſo much as lift up a hand to defend themſelves: But as the ſame writer ſaith, it is apparent that they were not accuſtomed to our manner or wayes of warring, nor to defend themſelves againſt ſuch kinde of weapons as were then uſed; however, if the Conqueſt was eaſie, the preſervation was not found to be ſo, and coſt farre dearer. True it is, that this laſt Conqueſt of that Nation was not ſo ſuddenly archieved, but thoſe means which have been uſed to aſſure and preſerve it, will give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto our nephewes,—that this preſent age hath much profited by the faults and omiſſions of our Anceſtors. Moreover, that fire which the Civil Warres had kindled: in the <hi>Britannick</hi> Iſlands, was ſo violent, as that all the Sea which ſeparates the Old World from the New, was not capable to hinder the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof even to their Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> for <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Carybde</hi> Iſlands refuſed to acknowledge the power of the Common-wealth, all thoſe who inclined thereunto were either baniſhed or executed, and deſpoyled of their goods, and however thoſe Collonies could not ſubſiſt but by the Commerce of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that this Revolt did bring along with it their ruine, yet their obſtinacy was ſuch, as that they would neither yield to their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt nor Reaſon. Till at length the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth ſent a Fleet thither, under the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53025:19"/>
Command of Sir <hi>George Askue,</hi> who delivered them out of their miſeries, by ranging them under the obedience of the Parliament. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while the Royalliſts Forces were very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable at Sea, for Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had a Fleet of nine great Ships which ſerved to ſhelter ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ſmall ones, whereby the trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was much impeded and incommodated, which obliged the Parliament to put forth a moſt puiſſant Naval Army to Sea, fitted with good Mariners, and all kinde of neceſſary war-like Ammunitions. The ſole brute of this Fleet made all the Enemies Ships to run into their ſeveral skulking holes like unto ſo many Conies, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> being not ſtrong enough to encounter them, was forced to retire into <hi>Kingſale</hi> Haven in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately blocked up by the Parliaments Fleet, whileſt General <hi>Cromwell</hi> beſieged both the Port and Town by land, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to make a vertue of neceſſity, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bear the brunt of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, and ſo ſaved himſelf, leaving behinde him three Ships, which by that occaſion were taken, and finally after ſeveral turnings and turmoilings, be caſt anchor at <hi>Liſbone,</hi> where he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which cauſed the rupture betwixt this Common-wealth and that Crown, and all thoſe miſchiefs which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, as we hereafter ſhall rehearſe.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the Royalliſts in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſeeing the Parliament was buſied in <hi>Ireland,</hi> thought to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53025:19"/>
lay hold on a fit opportunity to play their game, and to that purpoſe the Earle of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſſe</hi> having landed in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with ſome Forces he had raiſed in <hi>Holland</hi> and other parts, aſſembled the old Souldiers who had formerly ſerved under him, and armed them with ſuch Arms as he had brought from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but before he could make a conſiderable body, he was defeated by the Presbyter Forces, taken, and hanged on a very high Gibbet, which is the laſt mark of infamy in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>Within a while after, there was a Treaty commenced at <hi>Breda,</hi> between the <hi>Scots</hi> and their King, to inſtall and re-eſtabliſh him in that Kingdome, and in the others, according as Fortune ſhould anſwer their deſigns and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; and to this end, they deputed Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors into <hi>Spain, Italy, Denmarke, Sweden, Ruſſia,</hi> and into <hi>Turkey,</hi> and finally throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> to demand relief, aid and aſſiſtance: But all their Embaſſies procured neither men nor money, only their Ambaſſadors were laden with Complements and good wiſhes in return, each others particular affairs not permitting them to do more.</p>
            <p>All which gave unto the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> not any great fears, but great jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, wherefore the better to be informed of the paſſages abroad, and the better to fortifie themſelves by foraign Leagues and Alliances, M. <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> a perſon full of knowledge and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53025:20"/>
conduct, was ſent in the quality of an Agent towards the States of the United Provinces, the chief drift of this Negotiation being to criment a good and firm underſtanding between the two Common-wealths: But ſcarce was he arrived at the <hi>Hague,</hi> when five or ſix diſguiſed perſons entred forcibly into his Chamber and maſſacred him. And whileſt it ſeemed all things were a profound Calm in <hi>England,</hi> or that at leaſt the courſe of the Enemies deſigns both at home and abroad, being ſufficiently known to the State, on a ſuddain there ſprang up the moſt formidable faction that ever was hatch'd ſince theſe laſt Warres: A certain number of perſons who called themſelves Levellers, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes were to render all mens goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions alike, and truely this was a very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible deſign, and might doubtleſſe have met with as many Abetters as there are men in the world, who have no other poſſeſſions or Revenues, but their good wills to obtaine them.</p>
            <p>The chief of theſe Levellers was one <hi>John Lilborn,</hi> a man of a dating and attempting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who could not remain quiet, but was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether invincible, not to be moved by threats nor gained by the favour or preſents of fortune, which were beneath the extent of his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a conſiderable part of the Army ſiding with their Leader, they augmented in numbers as faſt as the ſhortneſſe of the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, the confluence of ſuch men as flattered
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53025:20"/>
themſelves with ſuch fond hopes, and who promiſed themſelves a revenge, and and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment by a ſecond Revolution and change. But before all thoſe who intended to have ſided with them could come up to them and unite in one body, they were vigorouſly ſet upon by the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> at that time the Common-wealths General, who defeated them at a place called <hi>Burford</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where their Leader and the beſt part of his Souldiers were taken, ſome of which were put to death for example ſake, and ſome others were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, but the greateſt part were pardoned, and admitted into favour again.</p>
            <p>As for their Leader <hi>John Lilborne</hi> being brought up to <hi>London,</hi> he appeared before the chief Officers and Judges of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> the Lord Maior, Sheriffs, and divers others, where he was not only accuſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Martial Crimes, but alſo Politick ones, as having been the Author of ſeveral ſcandalous and defamatory. Libells againſt the State, which tended to render the Government odious, and to beget a Mutiny in the people; however, he ſo dexterouſly ſhifted himſelf of all theſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as that the Judges declared him Not guilty. Much about that very time Mr. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Aſcham</hi> a moſt judicious and accompliſhed Gentleman, was Deputed, and ſent over in the quality of an Agent to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and arrived at the Port of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> on the 5. of <hi>June,</hi> 1650. where being advertiſed but his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53025:21"/>
perſon was in danger, he was conſtrained to cauſe himſelf to be guarded to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the next day after his arrival, as he was at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſix men knocked at his Chamber doore, which was immediately opened unto them, and he riſing from the Table to receive them, the firſt of the ſaid parties ſtabbed him in the head with a Dagger, ſo that he fell down dead to the ground, and his Interpreter <hi>Signior Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> being not able to make his eſcape ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, was likewiſe ſtabbed in the belly; which being thus done, the Murderers would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadors houſe, who refuſed them protection, whence they retired themſelves into a Church, which in <hi>Spain</hi> is a Sanctuary which the Juſtice ought not to violate, whence however the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had them taken, and put into priſon, one only excepted, who made an eſcape. Hence there aroſe a great conteſt betwixt the King and the Clergy, who complain'd that their priviledges had been infringed, and demanded that the Priſoners might be returned unto them: and on the other ſide, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> preſſed hard to have juſtice done on them, and though meſſage upon meſſage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon inſtance were uſed therein, yet they took no effect. And leſt it may ſeem that all theſe foraign Negotiations which we have here inſerted, may be beyond my ſubject, however if they be conſidered as ſo many obſtacles which Fortune oppoſed unto the vertue and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53025:21"/>
greatneſs of his late Highneſs, you will find that the recitall of them will not be altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the rather ſince I have related them as ſuccinctly as poſſibly: Beſides, we may alſo look upon them as ſo many ſeeds ſowen, to beget thoſe warres which thereon enſued, and which were by the late Protector, rather by moſt glorious Treaties whereunto he was ſought, or by moſt ſignal Victories which were obtain'd, and brought to a happy period, by which the blood of theſe two Agents, ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly murdered, were retaliated with uſe. But to go on to our Hiſtory, the Treaty of <hi>Breda</hi> being abſolutely concluded, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great Antipathy and animoſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Royalliſts and the Presbyterians, all their jealouſies and grudges were ſeemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciſed, ſo that the <hi>Scotch</hi> wanted nothing to compleat their deſign, but to enjoy their Kings preſerce, who immediately coming to the <hi>Hague,</hi> went thence for <hi>Schevelinge,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued himſelf for <hi>Scotland</hi> notwithſtanding the dangers and perils of the Sea, which were very great, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships which had way-laid him to ſurprize him. As ſoon as he was landed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the firſt thing they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto their King was to take the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath, called the Covenant, that burning Torch which the Mother of <hi>Paris</hi> did ſee in her frenzies, that fatal fire which the <hi>Scotch</hi> believe deſcended from Heaven, and by which they at their pleaſures kindle thoſe warres where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53025:22"/>
they infeſt <hi>England,</hi> which Covenant as we know was only a ſuperſtitious and warlike Proreſtation made in the preſence of God and Men: <hi>To maintain the purity of the Religion, to preſerve the priviledges of Parliament, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to re-eſtabliſh the King in his Anceſtors Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which ſeemed ſomewhat harſh and rude to this Prince, was the terms wherein they cauſed him to take this Oath, quite contrary to Phyſitians, who dip their Pills in Syrrops or Sugar, to make them down the glibber, yet theſe Politicians when the whole lay at the ſtake, it ſeems, troubled themſelves not much with the wording of the thing; for amongſt real friends indeed, there needs not many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements nor much complacence to be uſed. Therefore the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> made their King ſwallow this reſtorative in the following Beverage, conſtraining him to proteſt, That he renounced the ſinnes of his Fathers and his own houſe, the Idolatry of his Mothers, and that he would adhere unto Gods cauſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Covenant, in the firm eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church Government, as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Directory, for that publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is to be rendred to God, contained in the Belief and Catechiſm: And this Cup he was forced to drink, that he might obtain his Fathers Kingdome, which formalities were more then requiſite for to eſtabliſh that Prince in the opinion of the prevailing party, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53025:22"/>
was only then in a condition to help him. <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth prepares to war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note>Howbeit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> knew very well to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh  between theſe Artificial fictions, and the truth, for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> being duely informed of the <hi>Scots,</hi> their deſigns and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thought it was high time to think of the beſt means to oppoſe them, and after ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations upon this buſineſſe, it was reſolved that the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſhould command the Army in chief, and with all ſpeed march toward the North of <hi>England.</hi> But he moſt humbly thanked the Parliament, and like unto a ſecond <hi>Cincinatus,</hi> retired himſelf from the Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to a Countrey-life, excuſing himſelf for not ſerving them in that Expedition, upon his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition at that time. <note place="margin">His late Highneſs made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo of the Common-wealths Armies.</note>The Renown of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Cromwells</hi> feats of Arms, both as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour  and Conqueror of <hi>Ireland,</hi> admitted of no leſſe Propoſals, then to make him Generaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo of the Common-wealths Armies, in the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> his ſtead: So that he came over again into <hi>England,</hi> whileſt his hands were as yet warm, and was ſent to give a check unto other Enemies in another Climate, and under another diſguiſe, after he had ſettled and aſſured all the Conqueſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had left the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and requiſite Orders, conducing to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid peace and eſtabliſhment of thoſe parts, with his ſonne-in-Law <hi>Henry Ireton,</hi> ſo that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thence laden with Palms and Laurels, as Trophies of his worthy Acts in thoſe parts.

Now the Scots, who by no means would make any outward ſhew of the grand deſigns which they were hatching, at the approach of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army on their Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, ſeemed to be very much aſtoniſhed, and the whole Countrey took the Allarum, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the better to colour this their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſeeming ſurprizal, they deputed a Meſſenger to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> as then Governour of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> upon the Borders of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to know the reaſon of that ſo ſuddain March of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Frontiers, whereunto they joyned ſeveral Manifeſto's, ſetting forth the Contents of the Leagues and ample Treaties of union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations, and ſeveral other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which ſerved only to gain time, and to make the better preparations to receive their Enemies.

before God; reflecting on the foregoing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, and the ſucceſſe which had followed them, not as the handy-work of Politick men, or of Humane force, but as the moſt eminent works of Providence, and the power of God, thereby to make his good will appear, and to ſhew his pleaſure concerning thoſe things which he had decreed in this world: That they were obliged, not to betray the cauſe wherein God had ſo evidently manifeſted himſelf, after which there was nothing more dear unto them then the preſervation of thoſe who feared the Lord, and who might greatly ſuffer either by being miſtaken, or by not being capable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the true tye of a Generall Calamity, of which their Chriſtian charity they hoped they had given ſufficient proofs, at the laſt time, when they were in <hi>Scotland</hi> with this very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of which God was pleaſed to make uſe, for to break in pieces the power of thoſe who oppreſſed the faithfull in thoſe parts. But that the acknowledgements of ſo ſignal a favour, did but little appear in the Engagement which they had lately made with their new King, and that they had not proceeded like unto good Chriſtians, in publiſhing that their Army was but an Army of Sectaries: However, that they doubted not, but that God would give them the grace to forgive them that calumny, and to that effect they beſeeched him to be ſo good unto them, as to ſeparate the Chaffe from the good Corn, concluding in like manner as they had
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53025:24"/>
begun by a moſt ſolemn and terrible Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſeeching that in teſtimony of the truth of all theſe particulars, the great God of Heaven, through his infinite mercy pardoning their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and weakneſſes, would judge betwixt them when they ſhould come to joyn in battle with their Enemies. This Manifeſto was ſent from the Generals quarters, as then at <hi>Barwick,</hi> to the Metropolitan of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by a Trumpet, whoſe eyes the <hi>Scots</hi> did blinde both going and coming. Meanwhile the Army advanced as farre as the Lord <hi>Mordingtons</hi> Caſtle, on the 22 of <hi>July,</hi> 1650. and refreſhed there three days, on the 25. they advanced towards <hi>Copperſpeth,</hi> and the 26. they arrived at <hi>Dunban</hi> where the Army received thoſe Ammunitions wherewith ſuch Ships were laden, as were come thither on purpoſe to obſerve the motions of the Army, by reaſon that the Peaſants had abandoned their dwellings, not leaving ſo much as any thing which might ſerve for refreſhing.

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being approached unto <hi>Muſcleborough</hi> with a reſolution to have ſet upon the Enemy in their works, found that it was a difficult matter to force their Line, and ſo were conſtrained to ſet down their Camp hard by that place all the day, to diſcover the countenance of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: But the deſire they had to fight was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated by a great ſhowre of rain, which continued all the day, and which did much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them, by reaſon they had no ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all.

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53025:25"/>
as that they put them into a kinde of diſorder, but ſome Squadrons of Horſe fronting in the Rear, and making good the ground, aſſured the March of the foot, and ſo vigorouſly continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their charge, as that they had like to have brought the buſineſſe to a general Combate; had not the Commander in chief of the Scots Army cauſed a retreat to be ſounded, that ſo they might bring their men into their Lines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whither the Engliſh purſued them, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the way with their Cavallry. In this Encounter, Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> ingaged ſo farre, as that he was hurt in the Arm with a Launce, and received another wound in the body, and once he was taken priſoner, but was reſcued again by Lieutenant <hi>Empſon</hi> of the Generals Regiment, there were but few <hi>Engliſh</hi> killed, but farre more of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> and amongſt them ſome perſons of quality, ſeveral priſoners of theirs were alſo taken, as a Lievtenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, a Major, and ſome Captains. By which means the <hi>Engliſh</hi> recovered <hi>Muſcleborough</hi> that night without being moleſted by the Enemy, but they were ſo diſheartened for want of ſleep, and ſo tyred by the dirty ſlabbery wayes, as that miſdoubting leaſt the enemy being aware thereof might give them an Alarum, that night they ſtood upon their guard, and accordingly they failed not betwixt three and four of the clock in the Morning, with fifteen Companies of choice Horſe, commanded by Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Straughton,</hi> to

fall into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> quarters with ſuch a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency as that they bare down the Guards, and put a whole Regiment of Horſe in diſorder, whereby the whole Army taking the Alarum, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> charged them ſo home as that they put them into a rout, and purſued them within half a League of <hi>Edinbourgh,</hi> killing them a ſufficient number both of Officers and Souldiers, and taking ſeveral priſoners: After which, the Scots being diſguſted at theſe their ill ſucceſſes, retired themſelves for a while within their intrenchments, where we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo leave them to their cloſer guards. In the meanwhile the Parliament interdicted the Commerce between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and cauſed their Ships to be adjudged good Prize, which contributed very much to their undoing and ruine: During which they wanted for no Partiſanes in <hi>England,</hi> who laboured to diſpoſe things toward the effecting of their grand deſign, and amongſt their chief Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Collonel <hi>Euſebius Andrewes</hi> being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and convinced, was alſo condemned and beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>

After which the whole Body of the Engliſh Army quitted the Mountains of <hi>Pencland,</hi> and encamped about <hi>Collington</hi> and <hi>Readhall,</hi> and the parts adjacent within one Mile of the Scotch Army; on the ſeven and twentieth both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies marched Flank to Flank, being only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated by a little Quagmire or Marſh-ground, which hindred their Conjuction, however the Canon played upon each other, and on the 28th the Engliſh Canon plyed the Scots hard, and endamaged them very much, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they neither quitted their Ground, nor would they come to a Reſolution to joyn in a cloſer Fight.

very fit to give Battel in, without that either Party would give or take advantage of the Ground, where the Engliſh having attended the Enemies a ſufficient ſpace of time, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they would not fight but upon an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they took their March towards <hi>Dunbar,</hi> whither the Scots followed them immediatly, and at a certain paſſage endeavoured to charge their Rearguard; But the Engliſh immediatly facing about, the Scots changed their reſolution and gained the Hills, where they thought they might with advantage cut off the Engliſh their paſſage to <hi>Coperſpeth:</hi> at which time the Engliſh Army was but in a very ill Condition, the Winter wch begins betimes in thoſe parts had ſo nipt them with Colds and great Rains, and the ill Victuals which they had beſides, cauſed a great deal of ſickneſs in the Army, Fluxes, Looſneſs, and other Diſeaſes, whereby many died, and were rendred uncapable of Service, being ſent and carried away to <hi>Barwick,</hi> and the adjoyning parts.</p>

And not to detain the Reader in any further ſuſpence, all the Regiments of the Army performing their parts, like reſolute gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant men, (For ſhould a man go about to praiſe one Squadron or Battallion of them in particular, he muſt of neceſſity derogate from the reſt) you might have obſerved as many Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as Officers, &amp; as many Officers as Soldiers, who being all of them animated, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by a ſupernaturall inſtinct of Valour, a man would have thought they had been invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or ſhot-free, and that a Hand from on high did defend them from the ſhowers of Lead and Launces, which were ready to overwhelme them, ſo that the violence and force wherewith they fought, did only permit the Scots to put by their Blows, as alſo it is worthy to be noted that in all this Fight the Engliſh loſt but forty men, whereas of the Scots there were foure thouſand killed upon the place, and that Army which was ſtronger then the Engliſh by two thirds, thinking to have overwhelmed them, did only by cloſing in upon them, force them to fight with the greater vigour; and you would

have imagined, that the little Army of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conſiſted only of one Body, which had but one only motion, and charged the Enemy on all ſides with ſo much Impetuoſity and Animoſity, as that you would have ſaid it had been and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Maſs, or Lump which only preſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, where the weight of Arms, or the force of Powder did tranſport it. Finally, after one whole hours diſpute, very hot Fight, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent furious Conteſts, the Scots gave way, and their Horſe being put to flight, endeavoured to ſave themſelves by the goodneſs of their heels, the Engliſh Cavalry purſuing them to <hi>Hadding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> all the Scotch Foot remained on the place, and that which rendred the ſlaughter of them the greater was, that the Engliſh Soldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred an Action which hapned the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in which thirty Soldiers of Colonel <hi>Prides</hi> Regiment being commanded to poſſeſs a Houſe ſcituate betwixt both Camps, and not being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, were over-powred by a greater number of the Scots, and ſo forced to deliver up the place again, notwithſtanding which, after they had promiſed quarter to the Engliſh, they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led three of them, and hurt all the reſt: There was no Engliſh Soldiers but had a Priſoner in this Battel, there being taken ten thouſand, moſt of all which, except the Officers, were ſuffered to ſteal away, amidſt which there was ten Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, twelve Lievetenant Colonels, nine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors, forty ſeven Captains, ſeventy two Livete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and eighty Enſigns, and amongſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners

And on the thirtieth the Engliſh with ſo much gallantry ſurprized one of their Bulwarks, as they carried thence three hundred Muskets, one Enſign, and ſeverall other Armes, without the loſs of one Man. On the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> the Beſieged began to make their

Salleys to hinder the working of the Miners, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom they fired inceſſantly with their great and ſmall Shot, yet however they continued their Sappinges. Upon the ſecond of the ſaid Month, upon notice that ſeverall Armes and Ammunitions of VVar were hidden in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church at <hi>Edinborough</hi> they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thence. VVhilſt the fortifying of <hi>Leith</hi> was carried on vigorouſly, as well as the Mines under the Caſtle of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> that no time might be loſt; his late Highneſs whoſe great Soul could not live without Action, and who was not to be taken up by one or two ſingle Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, marched off with part of the Army to go and view <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> which having done, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was not in a Condition to aſſail it at that time, he returned back to <hi>Edinborough;</hi> but by the way, he raſed two ſtrong Holds whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Moſs Troopers</hi> were accuſtomed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and ſhelter. And as the <hi>Scots</hi> had a puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enemy in the heart of their Country, ſo had they a far greater in their very Bowels, ſince its generally confeſt, That the greateſt of all Evils which can poſſibly happen to a State, Is the Diviſions which the different profeſſions in Religion, and the other particular Intereſts do beget: For in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there was a Party for the King, ſeperated from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in the VVeſt, there was a Party for the Church ſeperated from the King; ſo likewiſe there was a third Party more moderate, who held both for King and Church, and all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53025:33"/>
Diviſions were carryed on with ſuch a violent animoſity, as that they neglected the common good, and were even ready to cut each others throat: The laſt of theſe parties was the ſtrongeſt, being compoſed of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral States of the Kingdome, as then held at <hi>Sterling,</hi> who nevertheleſſe ſtood upon their Guards, as well as the ſeveral others did, they being afraid of each other. The Aſſembly of the Eſtates uſed their beſt endeavours to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe two parties, and to this purpoſe treated mainly with the Colonels <hi>Carre</hi> and <hi>Straughan,</hi> who ſeemed to be the chief Heads of the ſaid parties, but they could not prevail with them. His late Highneſſe who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes as politick as vigilant, endeavoured to make good uſe of their diſſentions, and ſo wrote both unto <hi>Carre</hi> and <hi>Straughan,</hi> but their particular quarrels hindred them not to joyn in their general animoſities againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom they reputed to be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy. But the ſaid proffers which were made unto them, having as little wrought upon them as the care of their own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Colonel <hi>Whaley</hi> was commanded with a good Squadron of the Army, to goe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to their obedience, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook not, however, before he had once more aſſayled to gain them by fair means, wherefore he ſent a Letter unto them both, repreſenting unto them in ſubſtance as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>viz.</hi>

That all the world knew how many ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable wayes and endeavours had been uſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſince their being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to hinder the effuſion of Chriſtian blood; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the ſaid undertakings had proved fruitleſſe, yet they ſtill harboured the ſame thoughts and reſolutions, continuing thus, that their arms were alwayes ready and open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace them, whenſoever it ſhould pleaſe God to inſpire them to meet them half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. That their deſign was not to rule over them, nor to intrench upon their liberties, far leſſe on their Church Government, or to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe their goods and fortunes, their drift being only to advance the Lords work: But if they periſhed in their blindneſſe, and would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to harbour frivolous and vain hopes, they muſt continue to be their enemies to their reſts, and declared unto them, that all the miſeries which ſhould befall them hereafter, either by the ſword or famine, would fall very heavy on their own accompt.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Carr</hi> ſent an anſwer to this Letter quite in another ſtrain then it might have been expected from perſons who profeſſed to deſire nothing ſo much as an accommodation; and this Anſwer was returned to Commiſſary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Whaley,</hi> at his being at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour following, or very nigh the ſame: That although they were not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reſiſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their unjuſt Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet that they had ſtrength enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe

it, and that by their actions and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they would ſubmit themſelves to the will of God, untill the time of their deliverance ſhould come: That in caſe they ſhould have the happineſſe to periſh in doing of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it would be too much grace that God would do unto them, that they doubted not but when their miſeries ſhould be arrived at the full pitch, their Fortune would then change, adding that they thought it very ſtrange, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ſhould mention a ceſſation of Arms at the ſame time when they laded their Subjects with Irons, when they took their Towns, when they impriſoned their Miniſters, and by this means bereaved their flocks (now going aſtray) of the only and beſt comforts which they had left unto them amidſt their greateſt miſeries: Concluding thus, That if they would voluntarily deſert and relinquiſh <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards enter upon a Treaty in ſuch a manner as becommeth Chriſtians to doe, it would be a reciprocal grace and favour they would doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both Nations. But theſe Interparlies having proved thus unprofitable, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began to fall to work again, and Major <hi>Brown</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf of a ſtrong place called <hi>Ball-houſe,</hi> and afterwards took the Caſtle of <hi>Dorlington,</hi> in which there were great ſtore of Ammunitions of warre found, and in this laſt ſome Moſſe-Troopers, ſome of which were put to death. Collonel <hi>Monke</hi> likewiſe with a party both of Horſe and Foot, marched towards the Caſtle
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53025:34"/>
of <hi>Rozellar</hi> within ſeven miles of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> which was alſo ſurrendred after ſome Granado Shells were fired into it: Immediately after which Colonel <hi>Lambert</hi> marched with 2000 Horſe towards <hi>Dumfreez,</hi> in queſt of Colonel <hi>Carre</hi> who was about <hi>Peblies,</hi> and likewiſe Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> who commanded a Squadron of that partie, took <hi>Dalkeith</hi> on his march, which meerly ſurrendred upon the threats which he ſent in unto thoſe who defended it, although the walls of the ſaid Caſtle were 13 foot thick, and that they were well ſtored with Canon, Arms, and all kinde of warlike Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and proviſions of victuals. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while Colonel <hi>Lambert</hi> having with much difficulty paſſed the River <hi>Hamilton,</hi> encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there that night, whereof Colonel <hi>Carre</hi> having notice, did endeavour to ſurprize him the next morning at the very break of day, which he likewiſe did very briskly, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having opportunely taken the Alarum, and being unwilling that any of the Enemies forces ſhould eſcape out of their hands, did ſurround them in ſuch a manner, as that they found themſelves at one and the ſelf ſame time ſet upon on all ſides. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> in a trice killed them 100 men, and took as many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: Not could the Scotch Horſe eſcape their clutches, ſo that they diſmounted 400.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53025:35"/>
follow the Run-awayes, and ſo contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to take the moſt conſiderable perſons: They chaſed the Scots as farre as <hi>Aire</hi> Town: Colonel <hi>Carre</hi> himſelf was wounded and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner, together with his Captain-Leiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, as well as his Lievtenant-Colonel and Major <hi>Straughon:</hi> as for Captain <hi>Giffin,</hi> and ſeveral other chief Officers of their party, they came and voluntarily ſurrendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to Major Generall <hi>Lambert,</hi> who brought them all with him to the Head quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>Edinborough.</hi> During all which, the approaches againſt <hi>Edinborough</hi> Caſtle, were continued, but to ſpeak the truth, with little or no effect, till the Moneth of <hi>December,</hi> when as all the Troops which were diſperſed up and down the Countrey, were aſſembled and brought together, by reaſon of the ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſharp ſeaſon, which would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them any longer to keep the field, and then they fell to work in earneſt towards the reducing of the ſaid Caſtle, which is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt conſiderable of all that Countrey, againſt which a Plat-form was raiſed to place the Morter-pieces and the great Guns on, but thoſe within relyed ſo much on the ſtrength and goodneſſe of the place, that they hung out a Flagge of defiance; but not long after they were glad to take it in again, whereby it was conceived that the Morter-ſhells had done ſome execution, and that thereby they were conſtrained to change their tune; ſo that in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53025:35"/>
lieu of their former Flagge, they were glad to hang out a white one, betokening Peace, and likewiſe they ſent out a Drummer to propound, That they were reſolved to yield, if ſo be they might be permitted to ſend to the Deputy of the States, which being refuſed them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to parley, and ſo delivered up the place. Moreover one of the moſt remarkable and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts of his Highneſſe life, was his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in making choice of capable perſonages, fit to ſerve the State as well by their Councels, as for the managing of the wars, and indeed herein the Parliament alwayes preferred his opinion and ſence beyond all others, having found by experience, that his advice and counſells were accompanyed with a good fortune, as his valour conſtrayned her to Crown his actions.</p>

            <p>After which, the Lords States being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the ſaid Lords Ambaſſadors follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were daily moleſted and affronted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Royalliſts, and other perſons, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in <hi>Holland,</hi> they cauſed a Proclamation to be drawn up, which they ſent unto the Lords Ambaſſadors, to know of them whether it was penned in the due terms, according to their good liking, whereby on pain of death they prohibited, that no man ſhould either by words or deeds, offend or moleſt any of the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors followers or retainers. Three months time was already elapſed in their Negotiation at a vaſt expenſe, and with a farre greater pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, without that the leaſt ſatisfaction in the world could be obtained at the hands of Juſtice, for thoſe daily affronts &amp; injuries which were put upon the Lords Ambaſſadors Retinue &amp; Servants, and the ſcorns and diſgraces offered to their own perſons, even to ſuch a pitch, as that the Common people and Raſcality would aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves at the Gates of their houſe, and belch out injurious language, and ſet upon, and

The Engliſh in this fight took about fifty Merchant-men and nine men of War, they ſunk ſeveral beſides thoſe the Enemies themſelves ſunk to ſave their men; their Ships having been ſorely ſhattered upon the Coaſt of <hi>France;</hi> there were above two thouſand of their dead bodies found floating, and there were above fifteen hundred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners brought up to <hi>London.</hi> General <hi>Blake</hi> was hurt in this encounter, having done as much as could be expected from a gallant Sea-man; and likewiſe ſeveral of his Officers and perſons of Mark, who behaved themſelves couragiouſly, were both hurt and killed on this occaſion. It is hard juſtly to deſcribe the loſs which the Hollanders ſuſtained in this burnt, by reaſon that parties frequently endeavour to ſilence their diſgraces, and that the Sea doth uſually better ſwallow up and hide the events and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſuch bloody Sea-fights then the Land. The Hollander by this prodigious and vaſt loſs, being touched to the quick, did ſend a Letter to the Parliament, to endeavour to mediate a means to terminate theſe Differences, but the ſaid letter being ſigned onely by States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Weſt Freizland,</hi> the Parliament made anſwer unto by a letter, witneſſing their earneſt deſires to accommodate things in an amicable way, and ſo to ſtop the current of ſo bloody a War, but the ſaid Negociation produced not the expected effect.</p>

            <p>It is a thing worthy of obſervation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration both together, that our Protectors Anceſtors did alwayes bear this Motto in their Arms, <hi>Pax quoeritur Bello:</hi> which ſeemeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to belong to Soveraign Princes, as if by a prophetical chance, or elſe rather by a Divine Providence, this Family, which as it ſeems was deſigned to bear the Scepter, and to reſtore and give peace unto <hi>England</hi> after ſo bloody a Civil War, and ſo many other forreign broyls, had received this glorious Motto as an earneſt of its future <hi>Grandeur;</hi> which ſaid Motto doth in ſubſtance contain all the myſtery of the Politicks, and comprehend the two powers which God doth give to thoſe whom he eſtabliſheth his Lievetenants upon Earth. In effect, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that peace which ſeemed to have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our incomparable <hi>Oliver,</hi> and as it were to have been incorporated with him, hath ever ſince grown up with him, until ſuch time as its powerful branches, which encreaſed and grew up to an infinite height, had ſpread it felf ſo far,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53025:70"/>
as that this dutiful Daughter of Heaven whoſe growth is limitted by God, being not able to follow him no longer, was conſtrained onely to fix her ſelf to the body of the tree, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the branches to extend themſelves to the other ſides of the Sea-Coaſts, for to deprive that Nation of Peace which doth leaſt deſerve it, having extended the War and her Tyrannies throughout all the inhabitable parts of the World. For as ſoon as his late Highneſs, our dread Protector, had attained to the power (by the means and force of Arms) in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Peace immediately brake forth, and reſplendently ſhown throughout all thoſe parts, and ſtopt thoſe floods of Blood which could never have been ſtanched, but by the greateſt branches of our illuſtrious <hi>Oliver:</hi> and not ſooner had his Voice a tranſcendency in and over the Councels, but Peace continually accompanied his Oracles.

effects which have ſince been produced. However, the univerſal joy which was ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to be ſeen in all their countenances did not hinder, but that it was thought fitting for the better ſatisfaction of the generality, and of all men in particular, to publiſh the cauſes, the grounds and reaſons of the diſſolving of the Parliament, which was accordingly ordered by the General and by his Councel, conſiſting of the chief Officers of the Army, and was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted accordingly in a Declaration, whereof the following are the chief Heads.</p>
            <p> 
               <note place="margin">The Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Councells Manifeſt for the diſſolving the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> That after God was pleaſed marvellouſly to appear for his people, in reducing <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſo great a degree of peace, and <hi>England</hi> to perfect quiet, whereby the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had opportunity to give the people the harveſt of all their Labour, Blood, and Treaſure, and to ſettle a due liberty in reference to Civil and Spiritual things, whereunto they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by their duty, engagements, and thoſe great and wonderful things God had wrought for them; But they made ſo little progreſs, that it was matter of much grief to the good people of the Land, who thereupon applied themſelves to the Army, expecting redreſs by their means; who though unwilling to meddle with the Civil Authority, agreed that ſuch Officers as were members of Parliament, ſhould move them to proceed vigorouſly in reforming what was amiſs in the Common-wealth, and in ſettling it upon a Foundation of Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which being done, it was hoped the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53025:73"/>
would have anſwered their expectations. But finding the contrary, they renewed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires by an humble Petition in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1652. which produced no conſiderable effect, nor was any ſuch progreſs made therein, as might imploy their real intentions to accompliſh what was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for; but rather in averſneſs to the things themſelves, with much bitterneſs and averſion to the people of God, and his Spirit acting in them, inſomuch that the Godly party in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were rendred of no other uſe then to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the ends of a corrupt party for effecting their deſires, in perpetuating themſelves in the ſupreme Government. For the obviating of theſe evils, the Officers of the Army obtained ſeveral meetings with ſome of the Parliament, to conſider what remedy might be applied to prevent the ſame; but ſuch endeavours proving ineffectual, it became evident that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through the corruption of ſome, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of others, and the non-attendance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would never anſwer thoſe ends which God, his People, and the whole Nation expected from them; But that this Cauſe which God had ſo greatly bleſſed, muſt need languiſh under their hands, and by degrees be loſt; and the Lives, Liberties, and Comforts of his people be delivered into their Enemies hands: all which being ſadly and ſeriouſly conſidered by the honeſt people of the Nation, as well as by the Army, it ſeemed a duty incumbent upon us who had ſeen ſo much of the power and preſence of God, to conſider of ſome <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

whereby to eſtabliſh Righteouſneſs and Peace in theſe Nations. And after much debate it was judged neceſſary, That the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould be by the Parliament devolved upon known perſons, fearing God, and of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved integrity, for a time, as the moſt hopeful way to countenance all Gods people, reforme the Law, and adminiſter Juſtice impartially, hoping thereby the people might forget <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> and underſtand their true intereſt in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſucceſſive Parliaments; that ſo the Goverment might be ſettled upon a Right <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> without hazard to this glorious Cauſe, or neceſſitating to keep up Armies for the defence of the ſame. And being ſtill reſolved to uſe all means poſſible to avoid extraordinary courſes, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament to give us a Conference, with whom we plainly debated the neceſſity and juſtneſs of our propoſals; the which found no acceptance, but inſtead thereof, it was offered, that the way was to continue ſtill this Parliament, as being that from which we probably might expect all good things. This being vehemently inſiſted on, did much confirme us in our apprehenſions, that any love to a Repreſentative, but the making uſe thereof to recrute and ſo to perpetuate themſelves, was their aim in the Act they had then under conſideration. For preventing the conſumating whereof, and all the ſad and evil conſequences which upon the grounds aforeſaid muſt have enſued, and whereby at one blow the intereſt of all honeſt men, and of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

This Declaration and theſe proceedings of his late Highneſs, then General, and of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Officers of the Army, were backed by the conſent of the Generals at Sea, and by all the Captains of the Fleet, and in like manner by all the other Generals and Officers of the Land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both in <hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and the other Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.</p>

            <p>Theſe domeſtick revolutions did in a manner put a new life into the Dutch again, who thought that they would cauſe ſome eminent diſtractions and diſturbances as well on the Seas as by Land. But they were very much deceived, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratine Affairs of theſe Lands, on which either the good or bad fortune of <hi>England</hi> depended, were carryed on with ſo much dexterity, diligence, and vigour, as that they had reaſon to confeſs, that the change of the Pilot, and the entire obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is rendered to an abſolute Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who hath the ſole power in his hands, are but ill ſigns that the Veſſel ſhould be therefore the worſe guided and conducted. And to give you a proof of the truth, the Hollanders having at that time a vaſt number of Merchant-men in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53025:75"/>
their Harbours ready to ſet Sail, durſt not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard them through the Channel, although they had a Fleet of ninety Men of War to conduct them. But conducted them by North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to reach the Sound, where they met with another great Fleet of their Merchant-men, ſome coming from <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> ſome from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and others from <hi>France,</hi> all which they carryed home into <hi>Holland;</hi> after which, hearing that the Engliſh Fleet was ſteered Northward, inſtead of ſeeking them out, and to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Engliſh diviſions, as they had pretended and bragged, they amuzed themſelves in making ſeveral bravadoes in ſuch places where there was neither honour, glory, nor benefit to be acquired: at length they ſteered towards the Downs where they carried away two or three deſpicable Barks, and ſent ſome volleys of Cannon into <hi>Dover,</hi> their Hearts and their Sails being equally puffed up with theſe imaginary ſucceſſes, which ſavouring ſomething of their old Maſters Jack Spaniards Rodomontado's, they thought they could not better expreſs them then at that time, ſaying, That the Engliſh Fleet was to be cryed out by the ſound of Trumpets and Horns, as if ſhe had been loſt. But the Winde being as unconſtant as the Sea it ſelf, and as dangerous, quickly tacked about to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and the Old Proverb, <hi>That all the evil comes from the North,</hi> was made good to their coſt and charges.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Dutch put to flight.</note> Finally, the Hollanders ſeeing ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their ſhips ſunk and loſt, began to deſpair of the Victory; and the ſpirits of their men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drowned and fallen, they thought it not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to expoſe themſelves with the reſt of the Fleet, to the hazard of a general defeat and rout, they faced about, and began to bear away with all the poſſible ſail they could make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Texel.</hi> And the Engliſh not judging it expedient to engage too far upon the Dutch Coaſt by reaſon of the Flats, the Winde being alſo very uncertain and inconſtant at that time, and moreover their ſails and tackling being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently torn and rent, they reſolved at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of War, to ſet ſail with the whole Fleet to <hi>Soles-Bay,</hi> to diſpoſe of ſuch ſhips as were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,

            <p>This Naval Conflict being the moſt bloody and moſt famous Fight which happened between the Engliſh and the Hollander ſince the Wars began, did evidently manifeſt what a kinde of Martial genious it was, that had gotten ſuch a tranſcendency upon the deciding of a Victory; and how wiſe and vigorous a Pilot there was both at the Helm of the State and of the Fleet: So likewiſe the advantages which were obtained by this Victory were very conſiderable, during the conjuncture of Affairs at the preſent, juſt on

               <p>His Highneſs's Life-guard of Horſe marched in the firſt place, after which followed the chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army on Horſe-back, and ſome of his Councel of State: after them rode two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges bare headed in ſumptuous Apparel; after them came twelve Lackeys in velvet Caps and gray Liveries, with ſilk and ſilver Fringe; then followed his Highneſs ſeated in a Charet of State drawn by ſix beautiful Horſes richly trapped, which by their lofty gate ſeemed to glory in their drawing ſo victorious a <hi>Hercules,</hi> triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſo many Monſters: and his Highneſs who alwayes preferred the little ornaments of the Soul before thoſe of the Body, was onely clad in a dark coloured Suit and Cloak, the greateſt part of the other Nobility attending in their Coaches and ſix horſes.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> his Highneſs was met and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Lord Major and Aldermen; and the Recorder of the City ſaluted him with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Speech, containing ſeveral expreſſions of Joy, Fidelity, and Obeiſance, and of good Hopes of his proſperous and happy Government. His Highneſs having thanked him, alighted from his Chariot, and quitting his Cloak, put on a rich Riding Coat imbroidered with Gold, and got up on Horſe-back on a Palfrey richly trapped, and was followed by three other led Horſes of State. By which change of Garments, his

Highneſs teſtified unto them, that when as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the States-ſervice ſhould call upon him, he would deſcend from his Triumphal Chariot, where the glory of his Conqueſts had ſet him in reſt, and mounting his Horſe for Battel, would expoſe his Life as freely, as he formerly had done, for the peace and tranquility of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for the Liberty of <hi>England.</hi> The Lord Major rode all the way bare-headed, as alſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the City Sword drawn before his late High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Lord Protector.

               <p>The Streets were railed up, and the ſeveral Companies of the City in their Liveries ſate on both ſides of the way, with Streamers ſticking up to diſtinguiſh each Company.

In the ſhip that was burnt was the Marquis of <hi>Badex,</hi> his Wife, and one Daughter. In one of the ſhips taken, was the young Marquis his Brother, and another Siſter, who was ſet on ſhore in <hi>Spain.</hi> The two Brothers were brought to <hi>England</hi> with a great deal of wealth.</p>

               <p>Wherefore his late Highneſs who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed vertuous and magnanimous actions which bare praiſe, ſent a civil Letter of thanks to General <hi>Blake,</hi> with a Diamond Ring valued at five hundred pounds, and gave the Captain that brought the news one hundred pound for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Moreover, according to his accuſtomed Piety, be ordained a day of publick Prayer and Thanksgiving to be ſet apart, to return all Thanks, Acknowledgements, Praiſe, and Glory to the Almighty, for this ſo happy and ſignal a ſucceſs; and to ſupplicate his Divine Bounty to beſtow frequent and like Bleſſings upon the Engliſh Armadoes and Land Forces.</p>
               <p>But the Sea being a Theater or Stage too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable for ſo ſettled a valour and conſtant aFor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the traces and marks which ſhe receives of Combates and Victories are too ſoon worn out, and ſcare leave unto Hiſtory, and to the memory of men, wherewith to raiſe Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, erect Triumphs, and to tranſmit unto poſterity the truth of things; and although that vertue be the more glorious, by how much the greater dangers it aſſails and ſurmounts; yet
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53025:102"/>
however, as a flight is more eaſily made by Sea then by Land, where ſeldome men fight at hand-blows, we have reaſon to give the firſt praiſe and honour to that Element which firſt brought us forth, and whence we reap the moſt beneficial neceſſaries towards our ſubſiſtence.

               <p>The Engliſh Foot drawn up into four great Battalions, and led on by his Excellency the Lord Ambaſſador and General <hi>Lockhart,</hi> gave the firſt on-ſet upon five great Battalions of the Spaniſh Foot placed very advantagiouſly on three high and great Downs, feconded by <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> himſelf, and the beſt of the Spaniſh and Condean Forces, which they had purpoſely oppoſed unto the Engliſh, conceiving them to have been as yet Novices in the manner of waging War beyond Seas, and that for want of Diſcipline and Conduct they would ſoon have been routed and diſordered: But they were ſuddenly deceived in their expectations, and found that they had to deal with perſons of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and reſolution, who as well in the Military Diſcipline, as in the Art of Courtſhip, became perfect and abſolue Maſters even during their firſt years of Apprenticeſhip; wherefore it was not without reaſon the Ancients did alwayes joyn <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> together, ſince towards the doing of gallant Actions, it is ſufficient to be paſſionate and reſolute at the very entering into the Liſts of either of theſe Divinities. The

Engliſh therefore aſſailing the Spaniards in their advantageous ſtand as aforeſaid, in the high Downs, did themſelves alone ſeverall times charge them, and ſuſtained both the burnt of their Horſe and Foot, without ever being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded or relieved by the French; who were ſo confident of their Reſolution and Valour, as that they would not ſeem to intrench upon their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; beſides that, they were loath to change their Stands, leaſt thereby they might bring themſelves into a diſorder: <note place="margin">The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Engliſh and French</note> and finally, forcing the Spaniards to quit their ſtations, they put them to a total rout and confuſion.

               <p>The Spaniards had at firſt reſolved to have given no Engliſh man quarter, but the fortune of the day made them glad to ſeek to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for quarter themſelves; and it was well they could have it given them, although the Engliſh were generous enough to have ſpared their Lives, had not the zeal of overcoming, and their reſolutions to perfect the Victory, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up all their care and paſſions. Finally, the Spaniſh Foot being totally routed, and coming to ſurrender themſelves to the Engliſh in whole troops, the Engliſh miſtruſting they had ſome other intentions and ſtratagem thereby, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtanding their Language nor deſigne, continued charging them, and enforced them to ſeek quarter elſewhere, preferring the gaining of the Victory to their own particular intereſts; and ſo reaped an intire glory in their deſpiſing and rejecting ſeveral priſoners of quality, who profered themſelves to them, and for the which they might have had conſiderable ranſoms.</p>
               <p>And in the gaining of thoſe high Downs on which the Spaniards were placed, the Engliſh behaved themſelves with ſo much gallantry and reſolution, as that envy and malice raiſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port amidſt the jealous and their Corivals, that it ſavoured more of a piece of raſhneſs then of a true valour; as if Soldiers could poſſibly with too much zeal and readineſs performe thoſe Commands which are given them.</p>

But to return to our former ſubject again, as we have oft before alledged, the joyes of this World are alwayes for the moſt part mingled with ſome allayes of ſorrow; the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty being willing to keep us mindful that there are no perfect felicities to be enjoyed here on earth; and that its onely in heaven we are to expect an intire and perpetual Contentment and Bliſs. Wherefore the <hi>Laurels</hi> of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obtained againſt the Spaniards, and of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Town of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> were ſoon wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the joyes abated, by the interpoſing of the Cypreſs-tree which death planted upon the Tomb of the Illuſtrious and moſt generous Lady <hi>Cleypoll,</hi> ſecond Daughter to his late Highneſs; <note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Cleypolls</hi> death.</note> who departed this mortal life to a more glorious and eternal one on the ſixth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> this preſent year: a fatal prognoſtication of a more ſenſible enſuing loſs. For even as Branches of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53025:111"/>
trees being cut and lopped in an ill ſeaſon, do firſt draw away the ſap from the tree, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cauſe the body thereof to dry up and dye; In like manner, during the declining age of his late Highneſs, an ill ſeaſon, in which men uſually do as it were reap all their conſolation from the youth and vigor of their Children, wherein they ſeem to ruine by degrees as they draw near to their death, it unfortunately fell out, that this moſt illuſtrious Daughter, the true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative and lively Image of her Father, the Joy of his Heart, the Delight of his Eyes, and the Diſpenſer of his Clemency and Benignity, dyed in the flower of her age; which ſtruck more to his heart then all the heavy burthens of his Affairs, which were onely as a pleaſure and paſtime to his great Soul. So great a power hath Nature over the diſpoſitions of generous Men, when the tye of Blood is ſeconded by love and vertue. This generous and noble Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> therefore departed this World in deſpite of all the skill of Phyſicians, the Prayers of thoſe afflicted perſons whom ſhe had relieved, and the vows of all kinde of Artiſts whom ſhe cheriſhed: But ſhe dyed an Amazonian-like death, deſpiſing the Pomps of the Earth, and without any grief, ſave to leave an afflicted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perplex'd at her ſo ſudden being taken away; ſhe dyed with thoſe good Leſſons in her mouth, which ſhe had practiſed whileſt ſhe lived. And if there be any comfort left us in her death, it is the hope we have, That her good Example will raiſe up the like inclinations in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53025:112"/>
of her Siſters whom Heaven hath yet left us. I ſhall not at all ſpeak of her Funerals, for if I might have been credited, all the Muſes and their God <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſhould have made her an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedium,</hi> and ſhould have appeared in mourning, which ſhould have reached from the top of their Mount <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> to the bottom of the valley thereof. But if this illuſtrious Perſonages death received not the Funeral Rites which all great Wits were bound to pay it, at leaſt the Martial men did evidence, that the diſgrace lay not at their doors, but that they ought to reap all the glory, ſince they were not backward to continue to brave and affront dangers in the behalf of an illuſtrious and glorious Cauſe: wherefore the ſad tydings of this noble Perſonages death touched the gallant Engliſh to the heart, ſeeing they were bereaved of their Engliſh <hi>Pallas,</hi> and of their <hi>Jupiters</hi> Daughter; they therefore accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Deſtinies for intrenching upon their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and evidenced, that it appertained not alone unto them to diſpoſe of the lives of men. Their wrath therefore diſcharged it ſelf on the firſt Objects which preſented themſelves to their eyes: and the harmleſs Spaniards were ſo many Victims offered up to this <hi>Amazons</hi> ſhrine; and as if <hi>Graveling</hi> had been her ſtake, they were ſo eagerly bent to fire the Enemies out of the ſame, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Graveling</hi> taken by the French</note> as that the Spaniards were conſtrained to open their gates to give vent to the fire and flame which ſuffocated them, and ſurrendered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Conquering French Army; to whoſe ſhare that place fell, and by whoſe force it was ſolely gained.</p>

As Phyſicians do agree that extreme Joy cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Death as well as exceſſive Grief, ſo may we likewiſe ſay, That both theſe violent Paſſions united together, muſt needs deſtroy the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſon on earth; and that the Conflict which they produce in a Soul, is capable to turn the edge of the keeneſt weapons which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to their reſiſtance, and to make the faireſt champain Field become a parched barren plat of Ground. But what need we to ſeek external Cauſes in a Death which brought along ſuch violent ones with it, a Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who was one of the beſt Tempers and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world, did fall under the burthen of the Anxieties and Agitations of the Mind. The ſcabbard (as the Proverb ſaith) being worn out by the ſharpneſs of the blade, muſt of neceſſity finde a vent: And how could it otherwiſe chuſe, that a Man who for the ſpace of ten or twelve years together had oppoſed himſelf to all the Injuries both of Time and of War, ſhould not at length fall under the activeneſs of a ſoul which ſeldom gave him any reſt, which govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and directed the Reins of three reſtive King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, unaccuſtomed to the noble and famous Trappings of a Military Government; and who moreover was to direct and guide the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as well as the Bodies of Men, and their Reaſons as well as their Wills. It had not been conſiderable had the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> onely required that his Cares had been limitted within the Pales which the Sea preſcribes to her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts; But as the cauſe of the Diſeaſe was from
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53025:113"/>
abroad, and that from the Cloſets of the Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, the Spaniards had imployed their falſe Piety as well as their <hi>Peru</hi> Gold, to diſcover and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the repoſe of <hi>England;</hi> ſo fire and flame was to be applied without, and it was neceſſary to penetrate into the very ſecret cauſes of the evils. The People of the Cities of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent were to be diſabuſed, and the Soldiery were to be overcome in open field. The Mines of <hi>Mexico</hi> were to be looked into, and the extent of that Ambition was to be curtailed, which boaſts it ſelf both to ſee the Sun ſet and riſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe were vaſte imployments indeed of a large activity, to run through theſe underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, the fervor of them was ſcorching; and although the Heavens did ſecond theſe lawful Deſignes with all its Graces, yet it could not without a Miracle, and without deſtroying the ſecondary Cauſes, hinder the ſeparation of a Soul from a Body which it had ſo often employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo efficaciouſly ſeconded the grand Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs both of State and War for the Peace, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Tranquillity of three Nations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nature it ſelf did witneſs her grief ſome two or three dayes before, by an extraordinary Tempeſt and violent guſt of weather; inſomuch that it might have been ſuppoſed, that her ſelf had been ready to diſſolve; or that the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of Nature ſuffered a violent agitation. And as the Death of the Sun of Righteouſneſs was foretold by an Eclipſe of the Sun, which covered the ſurface of the whole Earth with Darkneſs: In like manner, at the death of the

               <p>And truly I had need of all <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> his art to ſweeten and mollifie the bitterneſs of this death, which cauſeth my pen to fall to the ground, and would caſt up my Muſe into a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſwound, did not all the reſt of the Muſes come to her aid, and ſprinkle her with ſome of that divine Water which nouriſheth her, to make her revive again, and to reſtore her to her ſtrength, to announce to poſterity the time, the day, and the manner when and how his late Highneſs our great <hi>Oliver</hi> breathed his laſt.</p>
               <p>After his late Highneſs had therefore been ſick about a fortnight of a Diſeaſe which at the beginning was but an Ague, on a Friday being the third of <hi>September</hi> 1658. in the Morning, he gave all the ſigns of a dying perſon, and for whom the Phyſicians had onely Vows and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53025:114"/>
in reſerve: However, he remained in that manner till about three of the Clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when as his Soul which had alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the upper hand of his Body, preſerved her Empire till the laſt moment; he had alwayes his wits about him, and his perfect and intire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and continued to deliver thoſe Oracles which were neceſſary to eſtabliſh, after ſo great a loſs, the Peace and Tranquility of <hi>England;</hi> and immediately to repair the ruines which ſo dangerous a diſſolution had threatned the State withall, and might cauſe in the mindes of every particular perſon.</p>
               <p>His greateſt and moſt important care was to name a <hi>Protector</hi> to be his ſucceſſor, which he did with Reaſons ſo little ſavouring of his own intereſts and worldly concernments, as that he teſtified, that being not content to have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed himſelf for the common good by the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his dayes, he was willing to conſecrate his Children thereunto, by the lading of them with the heavy burden of thoſe weighty myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which may well be termed a Royal and Gilt Servitude.</p>
               <p>Which ſucceſſion was ſo neceſſary to the Peace and Tranquility of the State, that the Common-wealth and the Elective Kingdoms are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to imitate it; and the ſucceſſive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies have oftentimes done more with a yong Prince in a Cradle, hung betwixt two Trees in the midſt of their Camp, then they would have done by the Orders and the Examples of the moſt expert Captains: But when as the Age,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53025:115"/>
Experience, and Deſerts of a Son do unite and combine in the Love and Memory of the vertues of a Father, what ſhall not betide ſo wiſe and worthy a choice? and what ſhall not be thence expected? For who can with more reaſon hope to be feared, loved, and obeyed by a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſave the worthy Heir of him, who hath rendred them ſo formidable, and who hath ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over, and governed them ſo tenderly and meekly? How ſhould unavoidable and ſtrange changes have been prevented, if domeſtick broils had not been ſhunned? and whom could we thave better met with the reſemblance of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who never had his equal in Prudence, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Valour, ſave in a Son?</p>
               <p>Politicians and Nature delight in the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their works; the one produceth few men alike, and the other delights in the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtroying of the deſigns of thoſe who have preceded them, to the end, that they may thereby ſhew their own good parts, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear Originals then Copies. After the giving of theſe and like Orders, and the ſettling of the moſt important Concernments of the State, this great Perſonage gave up the Ghoſt, juſt like a man that falls aſleep through the toil of a laborious task. The enſuing night was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and peaceful, like unto thoſe who diſplay their Sable Veil ſpangled with Stars, to deck and wrap up the Sun after its long and ſerious ardent Courſe.</p>
               <p>He died in the midſt of his Victories and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, after he had cauſed all the fair fruits
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53025:115"/>
which ſhall be reaped for ever by <hi>England,</hi> as well in the Continent, as within the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of its Iſles, to bud forth into Bloſſoms and Flowers. He dyed in a Bed of Bucklers, and on a Pillow of Caskets; and though the Wreaths of the Imperial <hi>Laurel</hi> which invironed his head did wither at the Groans of his Agony, it was onely to make place for a richer Diadem which was prepared for him in Heaven; and which muſt needs be more ſumptuous and reſplendent, in that it is ingrafted upon that Chriſtian humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity wherewith he did ſo conſtantly refuſe a temporal Crown, which was due unto his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and which was profered him ſeveral times by the People of <hi>England:</hi> and although he be dead, yet he is living, nay, triumphing, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Oracles to his very laſt Groans, moſt clear and intellegible Oracles; and as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the Spirit of the God of Truth, he dyed like a ſecond <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who even on his Death-bed continued to enlarge the Bounds of his Empire, and as long as he had breath, ceaſed not to diſpatch ſeveral Buſineſſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; anſwering the Phyſicians who repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, as the Emperour did, <hi>That an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ought to dye ſtanding.</hi> Truly it is a great comfort at the Article of death, to dye profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for Heaven, and for the good of ones Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>But before we cloſe his Eyes, let us once more reflect on the conſtancy wherewith he expects her laſt aſſaults, and with how much fear and trembling this inexorable one ſets upon him
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53025:116"/>
unarmed, and reſolved to yield to her; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe was accuſtomed to caſt her darts before him, yet ſhe is afraid, ſhe trembles and hides her treacherous ſythe, and never producing it till ſhe ſees her blow ſure. How oftentimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him in the heat of Battels, armed with deſpair and horrour, was ſhe conſtrained to turn her back, and to ſerve him for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Victory, whom ſhe was reſolved to have laid along? How often hath ſhe been ſeen to change colour, and to embrace the weaker party, to the end ſhe might ſhew her force, and cut down a greater number of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimes? Self-Intereſt is then made this inſenſible one grieve for thoſe which ſhe had raſhly ſlain on <hi>Olivers</hi> ſide, ſhe loſt by their not being, ſince her ſacrifices were there leſſened, and that <hi>Olivers</hi> Arm alone was forced often to ſupply the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his companions, or their ill fortunes. But as the love of this ſtep-dame was falſe, ſo likewiſe was it converted into rage as ſoon as his late Highneſs cauſed Peace to ſucceed War, and that he outvied this furious Hag by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage; as then ſhe brake off all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with force and horrour, and ſhe raiſed up from Hell all the malicious and ſubtil Furies, both Envy and Treaſon came to her relief and aid; and by a ſacrilegious Spell, ſhe hath ſought the Blood of Chriſt in the very Sacrament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to compoſe her Poyſon; and by abominable wit chcrafts ſhe ſowed ſedition in the Hearts of the People; ſhe bewitched the Wiſe, ſhe blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nobles, and finally ſhe therewith colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53025:116"/>
and cloaked all her moſt black and horrid Deſigns. But on <hi>Oliver</hi> his late Higneſs, ſhe could never faſten her baits, finding him alwayes armed with that Antidote which he renewed daily on the ſame Altars whence ſhe ſucked her venom. He alwayes oppoſed his Wiſdom to her Craft, his Juſtice to her Violence, his Prayers to her Impieties, and his Clemency to her Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy. The Tempeſt invironed him on all ſides, but he was in the Ark; his Enemies ſet upon him whileſt he was aſleep, but the Character of God which was imprinted in his Forehead, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Sword to fall out of their hands; and <hi>Goliah</hi> with his Legions of Philiſtines fell down at the ſole report of his Sling.</p>
               <p>Finally, God hath made him to paſs ſafe through the lifted up Waves of his Enemies, in which themſelves were drowned; and in caſe the Sea did prove Red, God be praiſed it was not by his Blood, nor by the ſtains of his Soul which abhorred all kinde of Cruelty. For if the Pardons which he granted were put in an equal balance with the Deaths which happened during the time wherein his Power was as yet but limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it would be found, that he did not alwayes give ear to the prudent Politician, to abandon himſelf from the meekneſs and generoſity of his natural inclinations. Thoſe who ſhall read the Hiſtories of ſuch like Revolutions as theſe, will finde that they never attained to ſo high a pitch of Grandor, by ſuch meek and merciful means, and ſo void of paſſion. Wherefore his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and natural Death hath been alſo a Reward
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53025:117"/>
for his ſo great a Moderation; nor can any one doubt but Heaven hath had a particular care of that life, which hath been ſo often attempted and ſo deſperately aſſaulted: Not but that he would happily have rather choſen to have dyed with his Sword in his hand, for the Glory of God and the Defence of his Countrey, as better befitting his Warlike humor and Men of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but Heaven had otherwiſe evidenced its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in his preſervation. Nor had our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion had the glory to have wreſtled with this powerful Enemy upon unequal terms, and in an eſtate wherein the imbecillity of the Spirit hath no other relief but that of Grace and Reaſon: This his preſervation was alſo an effect of his Prayers, which he had choſen with a great deal of prudence out of the holy Writs. He cauſed one of his Gentlemen often to read the tenth Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel; and twice a day himſelf rehearſed the 71. <hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which hath ſo near a relation to his Fortune and to his Affairs, as that one would believe it had been a Propheſie purpoſely dictated by the holy Ghoſt for him; or elſe that this great Perſonage was a Mortal Figure of that great Favourite of God, who hath done ſo many marvellous things with ſuch ſlender beginnings, paſſing through ſo many obſtacles, difficulties, and dangers: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was it very juſt, that he ſhould enter into the eternal Reſt on the like day wherein he had undergone ſuch great and glorious Labours and Dangers; and that he ſhould triumph over Death even in his weakneſs, at the like time
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53025:117"/>
wherein he had overcome her at her fulleſt ſtrength and greateſt advantages. This confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity happened unto him as well as to ſeveral other great Perſonages of the Earth, but by ſuch obſervable and reiterated notable actions, as that it is void of all doubt but the Heavens had foretold by the Stars (which are the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes and Rule of all famous Mens Lives) the Events of our glorious Protectors ſucceſſes. To inſtance in ſome, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was born on the ſixth day of <hi>April,</hi> on the like day the famous Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was burnt, preſaging that fire which this Conqueror ſhould kindle in <hi>Aſia.</hi> On a ſixth day of <hi>April</hi> he overcame <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> in a Battle; and on the like day he departed this life: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto there may be added, that his Birth was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a famous Victory which the Greeks his Subjects obtained on a ſixth day of <hi>April</hi> againſt the Perſians hard by <hi>Plutea,</hi> and by a Naval Combat which alſo happened the ſame day. So likewiſe <hi>Pompey</hi> was born and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a like day, to wit, the thirtieth of the Moneth of <hi>September. Charles</hi> the Fifth the Emperour had alſo ſuch like obſervable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters: he was born on a twenty fourth of <hi>February,</hi> and being twenty four years old, on the like day he obtained a great Victory, in which a great King was taken priſoner. And on a twenty fourth day of <hi>February,</hi> he was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emperour by the Pope.</p>
               <p>But not to look any further then our own Countrey, and into our own Hiſtories; It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

that his late Highneſs our preſent Lord Protector, <hi>Richard,</hi> was Inſtalled in his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorſhip on the like day, being a third day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> when as <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, that Famous King of <hi>England,</hi> ſo much ſpoken of in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by reaſon of his great Wit, Underſtanding, and Reſolution, began his Reign; an accident which cannot chooſe but promiſe a moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Omen and good Token.

            <head>THE CHARACTER of his late Serene Highneſs, OLIVER, Late Lord Protector: With ſeveral Reflections on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Hiſtory.</head>
            <p>SEeing Philoſophers are of opinion, that the Reſemblance of Children to their Parents, as well in their bodily ſhapes and features, as in the Inclinations of their Souls, is produced by one and the ſelf-ſame Cauſe; chiefly grounded upon this reaſon, That the one is the Repreſentative of the other. And ſeeing moreover; that we may not attribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a material Cauſe an immaterial Effect, ſuch as are all the operations of a Rational Soul; they reject the power of a forming vertue, the the Imaginary one, the Conſtellation of the Planets, and the qualities of the Seed. To fix
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53025:123"/>
upon a more ſublime myſtery, whereby God would have the Legitimateneſs of Children and Nephews to be manifeſted, rather by the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of man, which is the Soul, then by his Complexion, his Behaviour, his Speech, and the ſhape of his Body. And that ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſouls as are wrapt up as it were in the body, ſhould like unto a tranſparent ſun penetrate through thoſe thick clouds, and by that reſplendency which they infuſe through the whole body, ſhould attract the eſteem and veneration which they beget in men; either in the vulgar ſort, who are onely taken with the out-ſide, or in the malicious and envious, who endeavour to ſmoother thoſe Talents in others which they do not poſſeſs themſelves.</p>
            <p>Which truth, that we may the better make good, it will not be amiſs, having firſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto you ſome of his late Highneſs the Lord Protectors memorable Acts, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate unto you the greatneſs of his ſoul, and how well it was placed, whereby all its Heroical vertues may, as through a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal glaſs, appear unto the eyes of the whole world.</p>
            <p>In this wiſe all Hyſtoriographers have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, not onely in their deſcribing of the lives of Illuſtrious Perſonages, but alſo in ſubduing of Cities and Towns, Foretreſſes, and places of Conſequence, which no ſooner had received the Conquerours yoke, but the Origine and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations were narrowly pried into, the manner of their being fortified was deſcribed, the form of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53025:123"/>
their being beſieged, the aſſaults which they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined, and the glory which they acquired even by their ſurrendry upon honorable terms; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, inconſiderate ones are quite neglected, their appellations and reductions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce deemed worthy to be ſpecified in a Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>In like manner, ſince death after ſeveral vain attempts and ſucceſſeſs aſſaults hath at length bereaved us of our Illuſtrious late Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, we ſhall give you the <hi>Character</hi> of his perſon, to let you ſee how much he reſembled his glorious predeceſſors. And howbeit we may thereby ſomewhat diminiſh and detract from his glory, however ſo beautiful a ſoul as his was, accompanied by a body participating of all thoſe Organs which were ſucceptible of ſuch high and admirable operations, could not chooſe but produce the enſuing glorious effects?</p>
            <p>In his perſon he ſomewhat exceeded the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al middle ſtature, but was well proportioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, being of a becoming fatneſs, well ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, having a maſculine face, a ſparkling eye, both courteous and harſh at once, according as there was occaſion; hardy and fierce in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and reprehenſions, tempered in councels and meek, promiſing to the afflicted and ſuitors. He was of a ſtrong conſtitution, and of an active bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy well diſpoſed, an enemy both to eaſe and exceſs; and although in his youth he was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, yet he uſed not thoſe fair and bewitching pleaſures which a countrey (where idleneſs and wantonneſs did reign) doth afford to vigorous

            <p>His greateſt delight was to read men rather then books, and his Eloquence which was both Maſculine and Martial, was rather a natural gift then an effect of art, wherein he alwayes min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſome paſſages of the holy Writ, in which his piety had amply inſtructed him; to which moſt charming part as well as to his Sword, he owed moſt of his Conqueſts and Victories; being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accuſtomed to exhort and animate his Souldiers at the undertaking of any great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and before the giving of a battle, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe after he had gained the victory, he himſelf did expreſs unto God his thankfulneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements with ſo profound an humility, as that he attributed unto God alone all his good ſucceſs; and did conſtantly refuſe all thoſe triumphs which were prepared for, and profered to his valour.

He likewiſe was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Phiſionomer, and having once ſeriouſly conſidered any one, he was ſeldome deceived in the opinion he conceived of him.</p>
            <p>He married into the ancient and noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Bourchers,</hi> whence the Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> were deſcended; his marriage bed was bleſſed with many Children, none of which did ever degenerate from the eminent vertues of their moſt Illuſtrious Father.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53025:125"/>
and left by inheritance unto their youth (ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with marvellous hopes) that moſt exquiſite Quinteſſence of two great Talents, which he had acquired by his age and by his experience; ſo that the one of his ſons may be ſtiled the <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the other the <hi>Mars</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had four Daughters, all of them Ladies of a moſt eminent and vertuous diſpoſition: The Lady <hi>Bridget</hi> firſt married unto the Lord <hi>Ireton,</hi> in his life time Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage of ſublime worth; and afterwards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed unto the Lord <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> ſometimes Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at preſent Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all his Highneſs Forces.

            </p>
            <p>Nor did the change of his late Highneſs For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the leaſt decline or diminiſh the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and affection which he ever bare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the worthy Mother of ſo numerous and hopeful an iſſue; and that abſolute power which he had over all his Dominions, never gave him the leaſt deſire to captivate any heart, ſave that which God had given him in marriage. And that which is the moſt to be admired at, and ſeems to be the ſumme of all bliſs, is, that the Almighty lent his late Highneſs ſo much life as to ſee all his Children diſpoſed to the moſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53025:125"/>
perſonages, and allied to the moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Families of <hi>England;</hi> which are as ſo many props of his Fortune, and Fences againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viers of his Vertue.</p>
            <p>He was an enemy to vain gloriouſneſs &amp; oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and although he was all as it were fire, that is, of a paſſionate conſtitution; yet he had ſo overcome his paſſions, that he was ſeldome or never moved but when there was a great cauſe given: ſo likewiſe was he more ſubject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and keep in, then to give way to his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The actions of his body denoted thoſe of his minde, his actions were in a manner without motion, and without any forcings of the body; in like manner his minde was not at all agitated, nor his expreſſions precipitated; ſweetneſs and tranquillity accompanied his thoughts and his words; but when there was occaſion to carry a buſineſs, he expreſſed himſelf with ſo much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, as gave to underſtand, that he was not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be diſſwaded from the thing he had once reſolved.</p>
            <p>In like manner during the whole courſe of the War, he never harboured the leaſt thought of changing of parties. And as for Ambition, which is the onely paſſion whereof envy it ſelf ſeems to accuſe him, the effects thereof were ſo inconfide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unneceſſary unto him, nay, ſo unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and unwelcome; and which is more, he ſo often refuſed the pomps, delights, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours which were profered him, that all the world muſt needs confeſs, that where Nature could claim ſo ſmall an intereſt, the maſter and

Wherefore we may aver with a great deal of reaſon, That in caſe he hath hoorded and laid up Treaſures, it hath been in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of the Poor of all Sexes, and of all Nations, of all Profeſſions and Religions, both at home and abroad; inſomuch, that it hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, that out of his own private inſtinct par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Motions and pious Compaſſion, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed at leaſt forty thouſand pounds a year in Charitable Uſes, out of his own purſe, out of ſuch Moneys as the Commonwealth did allow him for his Domeſtique Expences, and for the maintenance of his State, and the Dignity of his Perſon, Family, and the keeping up the ſplendour of his Court.</p>

During which interval of time, Mr. <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> being a perſon endowed with a great deal of Courage, of a tranſcendent Wit, hardy in his undertakings, and a great Politician, had by theſe his good qualities gotten himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and credit at Court, and highly ingratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advanced himſelf to almoſt as high a pitch of Honour, in as ſhort a time, in a manner, as his late Highneſs did.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> therefore riding one day with a great train of Noble Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Kings Palace, chanced to eſpy on foot in the ſtreets <hi>Signior Freſcobald,</hi> the Italian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, in an ill plight: however, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alighting from his Horſe, embraced him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world, to the great aſtoniſhment of the beholders; and chid him, that at his very arrival he came not to viſit him. <hi>Freſcobald</hi> being aſtoniſhed at ſo unexpected an encounter, and receiving ſo ſignal a favor from a perſonage he could not call to minde he had ever known, was quite ſurprized; and my Lord <hi>Cromwells</hi> preſſing affairs at Court not permitting him the while to acquaint him further who he was, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged him to come and dine with him that day. <hi>Freſcobald</hi> full of amazement, enquired of the attendants who that great perſonage might be? And hearing his name, he began to call the Feature of his Face, and the Idea of his Perſon to mind; and ſo by degrees conceiving with himſelf it might happily be the ſame Mr. <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> whom he had harboured at
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53025:127"/>
               <hi>Florence;</hi> he enquired out his Lordſhips habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and attended his coming at Noon-tide, walking in his Court-yard. No ſooner was the Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi> entred the ſame, (attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral perſons of quality, and officers of the Crown) but ſpeedily alighting from his Horſe, he embraced his friend <hi>Freſcobald</hi> in the ſame manner he had done in the morning; and perceiving that the Lords which accompanied him were amazed at ſuch a diſproportioned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, he told them that he was more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>Freſcobald</hi> then to all the men in the world, owing unto him the making of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and ſo proceeded to relate unto them the whole ſtory which had befallen him at <hi>Florence.</hi> So great a delight do generous mindes take to recount their foregoing Misfortunes, when their Grandor hath elevated them to ſuch a pitch, as that they triumph over Shame, and are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Freſcobald</hi> was treated at Dinner with all the tenderneſs he could expect from ſo great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, and ſo good a friend; after which being carried up by the Lord <hi>T.

there were Moneys due to him, cauſed him to write down his Debters names; and by his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary ſummoned the ſeveral Merchants which were indebted to <hi>Freſcobald</hi> (upon pain of his diſpleaſure) to clear their Accounts with him, and to pay him within the ſpace of fifteen days; which was accordingly performed: onely <hi>Freſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobald</hi> freely forgave them the Uſe.</p>
            <p>Over and above all which, the Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> endeavoured to perſwade his friend <hi>Freſcobald</hi> to have remained in <hi>England</hi> the reſt of his Dayes, profering to lend him a ſtock of 60000. Duccats to trade withall: But <hi>Freſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> being over-charged with all thoſe grand obligations which the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him; having by his Lordſhips Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity acquired enough to keep him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſitated all his life time; and deeming that the trading in good Works was incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more ſure and gainful then in the richeſt Wares and Merchandizes, being reſolved to quit Trading, and to end the reſt of his dayes peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly, he obtained leave of the Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> to depart towards his own Countrey, freighted with ſo great obligations as cauſed in him a generous ſhame.</p>
            <p>But the Almighty doth not alwayes recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the fruits of good Works here on Earth, often repaying the greateſt with the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and Heaven delights in the exerciſing of its great Vertues, by the Vices which are thereunto oppoſite: and as the moſt nobleſt Creatures are the ſloweſt in the attaining to

            <p>Some while after troubles ariſing, and the King finding himſelf in a ſtrait for want of ſo faithful a Miniſter of State as the late Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Cromwel</hi> was, whoſe life he had ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately taken away; began to reflect on the loſs he had ſuſtained; and how requiſite it

And whereas by reaſon of the continuance of the Scotch Wars, his late Highneſs was at that time, as it were confined to the North, he wrote unto her Highneſs, the now Lady Protectoreſs Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, his wife, that ſhe ſhould receive and uſe <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> Mother, Siſter, and Allies, accordingly as ſhe praiſed the good offices of his deceaſed faithful ſervant, to whoſe cares, pains, and watchings he owed the preſervation of his own life; and that ſhe ſhould proportion that kindnes which during his abſence ſhe ſhould ſhow unto them, unto the love which ſhe bore unto him; inſomuch, that <hi>Durets</hi> Mother was by her Highneſs admitted into her own Family, and ſeated at her own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; his Siſter was placed in the rank and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Maid of Honour to her Highneſs; and his two Nephews were admitted to be her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Pages; whereby the Almighty Crowned <hi>Durets</hi> good and faithful ſervices towards his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53025:131"/>
Maſter, and his piety and obſervance towards his Mother and Siſter, whoſe onely ſupport he was in his life time, with the rich Flowers of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and with the Fruits of Fortune; advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them as faſt as the ſad deſtiny did his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated death.</p>
            <p>And no ſooner was his late Highneſs returned into <hi>England</hi> after the conqueſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the glorious Victory he had obtained at <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> full freighted with the reſplendency of his noble atchievements; but he deſired to ſee <hi>Durets</hi> Mother, Siſter, and Nephews, enquiring how they had been received, and treated; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were well pleaſed to be in <hi>England;</hi> and as ſoon as they appeared in his preſence, he could not retain his generous tears for the loſs of <hi>Duret;</hi> nor could he ceaſe to teſtifie his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grief for him, comforting the good old Gentlewoman Mrs. <hi>Duret,</hi> by the mouth of his Children who ſpake French, telling her, <hi>She had not loſt her ſon, although dead; for that himſelf would be her ſon, ſince the preſervation of his life had its being from her entralls; that both her and his</hi> Duret <hi>was with a better Maſter; a Maſter, who was his Maſter alſo; and whoſe recompences and rewards were for greater and more aſſured then theſe worldly ones.</hi> And that the great thoughts of his heart might not loſe their force and energy, by his imploying of anothers tongue to expreſs them; this great Perſonage who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made uſe of the French language to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Ambaſſador of Kings and Princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, did put himſelf to the trouble of learning
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53025:132"/>
ſome French words, with which he alwayes was uſed to chear up and comfort the good old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whenſoever he met her: and he that was wont to ſwim in the blood of his enemies, and could look with an undiſcompoſed brow on thouſands of men, and of his friends, lying dead on the Field after a battle, had ſo much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the loſs of one of his domeſtique Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as that he could not refrain from tears when he beheld any of <hi>Durets</hi> relations. Nor need we to wonder hereat, ſince his late High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes general ſpirit contained as well private as publique Vertues. And his Reaſon which was alwayes miſtreſs of his Paſſions, knew full well how to imploy them on ſuch occaſions, and at ſuch times as they were moſt requiſite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: to let us ſee, That the Dignity of a General and a Protector, had not made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the quality of a Man; and that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes and Reaſons of State had forced ſeveral things from him, which were abſolutely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his natural inclinations. Beſides, this great Politician knew, that the greateſt part of Famous Men, which Fortune had elevated to the top of her Wheel, were for the moſt part come to untimely ends by the corruption of their domeſtique Servants, or the treachery of their intimateſt Friends and boſom Favourites: in regard whereof, his late Highneſs lamented the more the loſs of this his Faithful Servant.</p>
            <p>Nor need we to wonder hereat, ſince For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had heaped all the perfections of Vertues in his great Soul, which he evidently manifeſted,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53025:132"/>
by his ſo orderly, and peaceably re-uniting, and as it were, matching together the Vertues both of War and Peace; the ruffneſs and harſhneſs of War, with the tenderneſs of Nature; their Licentiouſneſs with Piety; Confuſion with good Order; and ſo reſplendent an eminent Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſuch inconſiderate, abject, and humble domeſtique conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this Nation may account it ſelf thrice happy, in enjoying ſuch ſublime riſing Powers to govern it, who are able to diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil; and who ſuffer not themſelves to be puffed up ſo high, as that they ſcorn and diſdain to look downwards, and ſo ſtand not in need (as the waters poured far from the Ocean) of a borrowed and corroſive ſalt, to preſerve things from corruption.</p>
            <p>Thus as I have already given you rather a Glimpſe then a Character of his late Highneſs his Perſon, I ſhall now render you ſome other conſiderable Remarks of his Affairs.</p>
            <p>After the diſcoveries of an hundred Plots and Deſigns laid open and fruſtrated, the defeating of many jealous parties all of them convinced; and finally, ſundry Forreign Negotiations and Treaties, which hath given you occaſion as well to admire his Judgement as his Valour, whence you have found as bold undertakings to have proceeded from his late Highneſs, as ever were commented; and as admirable Conqueſts on the Continent, as may well anſwer the ancient (though long time dormatick) Valour of the Engliſh Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:53025:133"/>
To conſider how he joyned the Piety and good Order of <hi>Numa</hi> with the Vigour and Force of <hi>Romulus,</hi> in thoſe foundations which he laid of this new and Warlike Empire; which although they ſcarce budded forth of the earth, are never the leſs ſubſtantial enough to bear up a ſolid building; and do ſufficiently diſcover all the ſeveral beautiful Repartitions of the ſame in a moſt exquiſite manner, and in a goodly ground plot.</p>
            <p>Firſt, his late Highneſs ſettled ſuch a Military Diſcipline, as partaking of the Vertues of the three firſt Roman Founders, did ſtrike a terrour into the moſt ambitious Monarchs of the earth; and doth give Inſtructions, or rather read Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures on both the Chriſtian and Moral Vertues unto that Nation which pretends to be the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and moſt Religious of all the world. <note place="margin">See Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed.</note> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if a Croyſade had armed all the Prieſts and Religious Men, there would not be ſo ſtrict an order obſerved in their Chriſtian Military Diſcipline, as that which we now ſee is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England,</hi> where Sobriety flouriſheth amidſt abundance, in a Countrey where formerly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery was accounted as a Gallantry, and converted into a cuſtom; where Modeſty is wedded to Cruelty, Juſtice with the extremity of Power, Meekneſs with the ſtubborneſs of Arms, War with Piety, Valour with Fear and Obedience. And ſince we ſpeak of the Piety of this Engliſh <hi>Pompilius,</hi> may we not ſay that the Goddeſs <hi>Ageria</hi> did nightly in his ſolitudes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53025:133"/>
Nor need we to ſay that he made uſe of fire and flames by a barbarous and unchriſtian-like Zeal to eſtabliſh the truth of the Goſpel. Nor did he ſend millions of Pagans to Hell, thereby to be ſtrong enough to force five hundred againſt their wills into Heaven: The Piety of this our Common Father was void of Envy and Cruelty. He hath defied the Tyrants over mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Clemency and Charity, and hath cauſed thoſe who profeſs thoſe two Vertues before all others (which are more ſublime though leſs profitable to our neighbours, and conſequently of leſs concernment) to doubt, whether or no the Quality of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> is not far better then that of the <hi>Catholique.</hi> All which being maturely conſidered, we may ſay when a State erreth both in the Eccleſiaſtique and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Government, he that is inveſted with the Sovereign Power, far from being reputed a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, is accountable before God if he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſame, and if he lets that Talent remain uſeleſs which may otherwiſe be advantageous to the whole world.</p>
            <p>To ſay more of his Generoſity, this Vertue he highly recommended above all others unto his Miniſters of State, and unto his Ambaſſadors, and unto his Children; and whereof that noble Lady <hi>Cleypoll,</hi> his Daughter of worthy memory, did give ſo many evidences during her life, and even at the Article of her Death, as that ſhe thereby did beget tears in the moſt obſtinate and hardieſt enemies of this State. A worthy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo famous a Father, whom Heaven too
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53025:134"/>
ſoon ſnatched away both from the Vertuous and from the Miſerable; and whoſe ſoul did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably correſpond with her Fortune, and the Majeſty of her Comportment. How many of the Royaliſt priſoners got ſhe not freed? How many did ſhe not ſave from Death whom the Laws had condemned? How many perſecuted Chriſtians hath ſhe not ſnatcht out of the hands of the tormenters; quite contrary unto that <hi>Herodias</hi> who could do any thing with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She imployed her Prayers even with Tears to ſpare ſuch men whoſe ill fortune had deſigned them to ſuffer: when as this grand Heroe being tranſported as it were, and even raviſhed to ſee his own Image ſo lively deſcribed in thoſe love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and charming Features of that winning Sex, could refuſe her nothing; inſomuch, that when his Clemency and Juſtice did balance the pardon of a poor Criminal, this moſt charming Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate knew ſo skilfully to diſarm him, that his Sword falling out of his hands, his arms onely ſerved to lift her up from thoſe knees on which ſhe had caſt her ſelf, to wipe off her tears, and to imbrace her. So likewiſe it is believed, that this illuſtrious Princeſs precipitated death, did not a little contribute to his late Highneſſes ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; all whoſe noble parts were found to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſound and whole, onely his Heart, which ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row had ſeized and dryed up. Nor did he long out-live her, ſince it was impoſſible he ſhould ſurvive the love of ſo generous a diſpencer of his Clemency and Generoſity.</p>
            <p>For brevity, I ſhall make choice of one of the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53025:134"/>
Ambaſſadours of this Commonwealth, to denote the ſplendor of the glorious Miniſters of this generous Prince; he being in ſuch a place where he hath more occaſion then any of the reſt, to give far ampler marks of the moſt Heroical Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which acquires more glory to the victorious then the victory it ſelf, and which is the moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Character of a true Chriſtian, his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Lord <hi>Lockhart,</hi> Ambaſſador in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> General of his Highneſs Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Governour of the Town of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> who is eſpouſed to that moſt renowned Lady one of his late Highneſs's Neeces. In both which noble Perſonages we may behold at once ſhining forth thoſe two happy and glorious Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which moſt of all render perſons of their Birth and Quality recommendable and famous. His perſon ſeems onely to have been ſent into <hi>France</hi> to charm the whole Nation, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and accumulate graces; and did he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to ſo many dangers and hazards in the Wars, men might eaſily believe that after he had long born Arms in <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and ten years ſpace for the late King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he onely ranged himſelf on the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſides to ſave the Kings Party, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtate them in their Lands and Goods.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Generoſity, Courteſie, and Affability of his late Highneſs did ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound, as that no one perſon ever departed from his preſence unſatisfied; for he received the Petitions of all men, he heard their Grievances, and his charitable memory was ſo retentive, as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53025:135"/>
that he never forgot their requeſts, but made it his chief object to bear them in minde, and moſt tenderly to provide for them. He eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe he had overcome, and took a delight to pardon them, and to make them ſharers of his good Fortune; provided that they would give over to make themſelves unfortunate, by their obſtinacy. He was uſed to ſay, that Hearts were as well to be overcome as Fortreſſes, and that the one were no more to be demoliſhed then the other, becauſe they had belonged to other Maſters; inſomuch, that he eſteemed it a great Conqueſt to have gained a gallant Man to his party. And as for thoſe who have been put to death in his time, they may be ſaid to have been their own Judges, and their own exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners. And however Politicians hold, that in the changing of a Government, all things ought likewiſe to be changed if poſſible, even the very Religion it ſelf, (were men prophane enough to meddle therewith) and that Cruelty ought wholly to baniſh Clemency, yet all men know, that as to the point of Religion, he did leave things as he found them; and that he ſaved more lives by thouſands, then obſtinacy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair did cauſe to periſh. Nay, he did even wiſh when he came to have a more abſolute power towards the latter end of his dayes, that thoſe which had been put to death were yet alive; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting ſolemnly, that if he could not change their hearts he would have changed their Dooms, and convert their deaths into a baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is eaſily to be believed, by the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53025:135"/>
goodneſs which he hath exerciſed towards the children of ſuch as were put to death, even thoſe who were his moſt implacable enemies; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in poſſeſſion both of their Goods and Titles; and whoſe loſſes he hath recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch civillities as doth evidence, he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his Politicks in <hi>Machiavils</hi> School; <note place="margin">See Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Policy re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viewed.</note> who teacheth, that the children and all the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were to be exterminated together with their Fathers: ſo that many men wiſhed that his Highneſſes power had been as abſolute ten years ſince as it was ſome years before his death.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe thoſe Alliances which he made, and thoſe Wars which he undertook, had all of them motives of Generoſity, and were founded on Equity and Reaſon; if ſo be we conſider the very firſt whereinto he onely ſtept by the degree of a Captain, and which may be termed a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary evil and an inevitable one, begotten by the remiſſneſs of the Political Body, and by the corruption of the Clergy; I do finde that two high injuſtices were the primitive cauſes thereof, the firſt was the uſurpations of the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normanns;</hi> the ſecond was the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful humor and diſpoſitions of King <hi>James,</hi> and the idleneſs and ſloathfulneſs of the Nobility, who conſtrained their younger brethren to ſerve them, or to learn Trades, by taking away from them the means to ſubſiſt by the way of Arms; which is a priviledge more then legitimate, due by the elder brother to the younger, and by Princes to ſuch Martial Spirits as live in their Dominions; if the <hi>Saxons</hi> and other Uſurpers or
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53025:136"/>
Conquerors of <hi>England</hi> did by force of Arms become Maſters of the Countrey, and did caſt out the right Poſſeſſours thereof, and by ſucceſs of time falling from a Forreign Injuſtice into a Domeſtick Injuſtice, they reduced their younger Brothers to Mecannick profeſſions.</p>
            <p>At preſent they demand that they may be permitted to expoſe their bloods and their lives for the preſervation of their Brethrens: That the exerciſe of Arms may be aboliſhed in ſo Populous and Warlike a State: that the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory which formerly with ſo much Pomp reigned in <hi>England</hi> may be reſtored again.</p>
            <p>And as for the War which his late Highneſs declared againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> that is ſo generous, that a man may averre, that glory was the onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereof; and that thereby he eſpouſed the Intereſt of all the people which were oppreſſed, and of all the Princes which the Ambition of <hi>Spain</hi> had deſpoyled of their States and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And the two moſt unfortunate people of the earth were the firſt objects of his Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thoſe which were the moſt of all aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, were the firſt that felt the effects of that Arm which ſtretched it ſelf forth to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; <note place="margin">Which you may ſee in two Books, <hi>viz.</hi> Teats of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and the other, <hi>America</hi> Painted to the life.</note> To wit, the poor Indians, thoſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlaves, who behold no other faces ſave thoſe of their tormentors; and who were made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that periſhing in the Mines of <hi>Peru,</hi> they thereby did raiſe to themſelves Thrones of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven, ſince thereby they furniſhed <hi>Spain</hi> wherewithal to adorne and inrich Altars throughout the whole world. In theſe torrid
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53025:136"/>
Climates the gallant Engliſh went to revenge the death of ſeveral Merchants, and many brave Sea-men of all Nations, which the Spaniards did ſurprize in thoſe Seas; and who they did decoy and attract by ſpecious promiſes, that they would not miſchief them: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Law of Nations, and the Faith which they had plighted, they ſeized their ſhips; and having tyed the men alive to trees, placed this Superſcription on their Breaſts, <hi>Who ſent for you into this Countrey?</hi> And let them there ſtarve to death, whileſt the Birds of the Air did feed upon their fleſh as they were yet alive.</p>
            <p>And alſo <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Sea whereof like unto a ſharp humour, did alwayes nouriſh the wounds and incurable evils, ſhe never was in ſo fair a way to recover her perfect health by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly refreſhments which <hi>England</hi> at preſent doth profer unto her, and the freſh Air which <hi>France</hi> would alſo have her enjoy. Nor was the French letting her blood ſufficient to cure her, for ſhe needed an Engliſh Phyſician who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to cure and treat incurable bodies; ſo that in caſe this unfortunate fair one will in the leaſt conform her ſelf to thoſe Remedies which are profered unto her, and the which will be no violenter then ſhe her ſelf pleaſeth; ſhe may be rendred plump and well liking, as the freſh Air and Bloſſoms of <hi>France</hi> can make her, and as the Sweets and Delicacies of <hi>England</hi> can procure unto her.</p>
            <p>In like manner, it was a high point of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53025:137"/>
in the Engliſh, ſince they cauſed <hi>France</hi> to loſe <hi>Graveling</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to help <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to re-take ſuch places in thoſe parts as might repay them with uſe, and elſewhere alſo, ſuch as might ſtand them in as great ſtead; as <hi>Montmedy,</hi> which was the firſt conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced place after this happy Alliance, and the which crowned the ſame.</p>
            <p>And truly here we may conſider the Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his late Highneſs, in its moſt perfect dye or luſter; for without having regard to thoſe Advantages which <hi>Spain</hi> might render him as to the Commerce, the places of Hoſtage which ſhe profered to put into his hands for ſecure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, as <hi>Graveling, Dunkirk,</hi> and others; he was ſwayed by thoſe Reſentments which the Engliſh Nation ought to have harboured for the ſeveral and innumerable injuries and wrongs ſuſtained by that Nation; as the Spaniſh intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Invaſion with their great Fleet in 88. Their Tyranny in the Indies, and the Cruelties and Barbariſmes which they inflict upon all thoſe who will not acquieſs unto, and follow their Maximes and Opinions. His late Highneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preferred the Alliance and League with <hi>France</hi> becauſe it was more Chriſtian-like, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all men to make uſe of that Liberty of Conſcience and Freedom, which Jeſus Chriſt hath acquired unto them by his Blood; and gaining them by meekneſs and courteouſneſs to his Divine example, and not by Cruelties and Oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:53025:137"/>
His late Highneſs ſided with <hi>France</hi> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe ſhe hath undertaken the Defence of all oppreſſed people, as well Princes as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And to alledge all in one word, and ſo to compleat the height of Generoſity it ſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>France</hi> at that time was the weakeſt, as being abandoned by ſome of her ancient Allies, and as it were quite diſordered by an inteſtine War, which had moſt violently ſhaken her bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; ſo likewiſe muſt <hi>France</hi> needs confeſs, that without the aſſiſtance of <hi>England,</hi> her Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was totally ruined; the Pyrats of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> having blocked up all her Sea Ports, in ſo much, that Merchandizes were brought in as it were by ſtealth; and <hi>France</hi> might have been forced to have kept but a lean <hi>Lent,</hi> all their Farms and Farmers being deſtroyed; their Butter, Cheeſe, and all kinde of Spices and other Wares of that nature, being ſet at ſuch rates as the Common people were not able to pay for them: So that had not the Engliſh ſcoured their Seas, and driven away and chaſed thoſe Pyrats which lay lurking in ſuch neighbouring Ports, <hi>France</hi> had been in a ſad condition; whereas now by the means of the Engliſh, all Forreign Nations come freely into the French Ports with their Ships and Goods. And for to increaſe the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of the Engliſh yet more to <hi>France,</hi> by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the French the labour, charges, and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of going to the Indies, they thence bring home unto their doors, in Exchange of their Linnen and Wines, all the good things and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53025:138"/>
which not onely the New World, but the reſt of the World plentifully and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affords.</p>
