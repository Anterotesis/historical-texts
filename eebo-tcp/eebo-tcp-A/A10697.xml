            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What honor is it for a prince, to go farre beyonde the common ſorte in preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, beaten gold, coulloured ſilcks, and great traines of ſeruantes, when he ſhall be inferiour to all in vertues and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of life: For to inſtructe his people by precepts, is a longe and difficult way, but to teach them by example, is very ſhorte, and of greater efficacy, for where they ſhall ſée vertue after a liuelie ſorte imprinted in a viſible paterne, and that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces life is ſuche an example, they become wiſe of their one accord, then is force, conſtraint or threatning, néedleſſe to bring them to their dutie: O conſider my ſonne the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen a vertuous king and a vitious prince, the one ſtriueth to

(my Lord <hi>Bruſanus</hi>) ſince you tooke the firſt frutes of my body, ſith which time I haue remained altogether at your diſpoſition, ſo often as it pleaſed your ſelfe to commaund, yet not without great infamye and ſlaunder to my perſon, beeing diſcredited through the whole Citie, by your continuall recourſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre to my houſe, and although I muſt confeſſe you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed of me many liberall rewardes, and from time to time haue gratified me with rich and coſtly preſentes, yet ſir when you ſhall conſider well of your peny worthes, I haue greateſt cauſe to complaine of my market, when the bargaine hath coſt me the price of my maidenhead, my payne of pleaſaunt yeares ſpent at your deuotion, with my name and reputation for euer infamed: where otherwiſe my beautie might haue proued a bayte to haue intangeled ſome amorous gentleman or other rich marchant, that might haue maintained me and made mée his wife, where nowe that hope were more then vaine to looke for: what reſteth then for poore <hi>Petrona</hi> but to hold that ſhee hath, and to make account of no more, then what ſhe doth all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſſe. <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> who all this while had liſtened to hee ſpeaches, was not a little pinched to heare her concluſion, but minding to make no other replye, imbraſing her in his armes he gaue her a frendly buſſe, adding theſe fewe words as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth: I perceiue my <hi>Petrona,</hi> the old prouerbe muſt be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly veryfied, which ſaith, <hi>that pouertie will part good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> thou knoweſt I haue loued thée, and now I muſt leaue thée, but if thou thinkeſt I haue bought thy chaffer to cheape, blame but my fortune, which hath rather conducted me to craue new credite, then to paye old debts: with this hee gaue her an other frendly kiſſe, making ſemblaunce as though he would haue taken his leaue, thinking that for a farewell <hi>Petrona</hi> at the leaſt would haue relieued him with ſome fiue hundered crownes, who had beſtowed of her (at ſeuerall times) a great manye thouſandes, but ſhee more lauiſhe of her lippes, then ſhee was of her purſe, to ſhift him off by a prettyer meane replied in this manner.

This noble prince vpon a priuate conceipt to him ſelfe, diſguiſed in the habite of a marchant, had ſecretly left his courte, and trauelling through many partes of his owne dominions (being not other-wiſe taken then for a marchant) called him ſelfe by the name of <hi>Corynus,</hi> the which name (becauſe I perceiue hee was other wiſe loath to bee knowne) I will therefore vſe for the time. <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> who in the meane ſpace had iurnied many daies towards <hi>Epirus</hi> was now come to the confines, and taking his directe courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the famous citie of <hi>Doretta</hi> (where the court was ſtill reſidente) he fortuned (in the way) to ouer-take this kinglye marchante <hi>Corynus:</hi> and after friendly ſalutations paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, <hi>Corynus</hi> taking a through vewe of this gallant yonge prince, was wonderfully delighted in his comely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, in his amiable countenance, and in his modeſt regards: and perceiuing by his apparell that hee was a ſtranger, to breake of their vnneceſſarie ſilence he ſaide.

Sir, my country is <hi>Hungaria,</hi> my name <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> by byrthe a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by fortune a traueller, and the cauſe ſtanding of ſuch nice poyntes, as peraduenture your grauity may hardly brooke: let this ſuffice, my yonge yeares (as you ſée) ſubiecte to ſundry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, at the laſt haue taken holdfaſt in trauelling to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne citties, led by this reſolution, that in ſéeing manye thinges, I ſhould learne ſome thing, and intiſed by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reporte of the rare vertues, the maieſticall gouernmente, and moſt renowned demeanure of <hi>Leonarchus,</hi> who holdeth

The court here of <hi>Epirus,</hi> being ſo renowned (as you would make it) by the king that now holdeth the ſcepter, as it is repleniſhed with men of diuerſe calling, ſo it is frequented by men of as ſundry diſpoſitions.

<hi>Doreſtus</hi> willing a ſeat to be prepared, cauſed <hi>Bruſanus</hi> to ſit downe next vnto himſelfe: and being thus ſetteled: <hi>Dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> mindinge to procéede in iuſtice, deliuered theſe woordes: The Office of a good Prince is to defende the common wealth, to helpe the innocent, to aide the ſimple, to correct the offender, to relieue the poore, to honour the vertuous, to puniſhe the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, to bridell the ambitious, and by iuſtice to geue euery one his owne: and common wealthes are not loſt, for that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces liue in pleaſure, but becauſe they haue no care of iuſtice, neither do people murmure, when the Prince doth recreate his perſon, but when he is ſlacke to redreſſe wrongs. O that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did know what it were to take charge of a kingdome, hee ſhould find that to be iuſt in himſelfe, were honour to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to miniſter iuſtice, is profite to the whole common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: it is not therefore inough for him to be vertuous in his owne perſon, but he is alſo bound to root al vices from amongſt his people: But what profite is it for a prince himſelfe to bee honeſt, and thoſe that ſhould adminiſter iuſtice vnder him to be diſſolute, For a prince to bee true, and his officers falſe, for a prince to be gentle and his officers cruell: And hath it not ben often knowen, that where the prince himſelfe hath bene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, thoſe that he hath put moſt in truſt, haue bene negligent: I will for a time diſſemble ſome thinge of mine owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when we ſhall néede no other preſident at this time, then the complainte of this poore man <hi>Caſtus,</hi> in redreſſe of whoſe cauſe I do héere decrée, that <hi>Orlando</hi> ſhall ſpéedily reſtore him

               <p>I doe further ordaine, that the Lawyers which haue taken his money, and not ending his cauſe, ſhall repay it double: the magiſtrate likewiſe that denied him iuſtice, I doe heere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him from bearing office, and for the ſmall regarde that hee hath had to the complaint of the poore, I doe ceaze him at fiue hundred pound fine, to bee diſtributed to the reliefe of the poore.

I will that from hence forward thou be attendant about me, my ſelfe allowing thee a ſufficient ſtipend for thy maintenaunce: thy office ſhall be to giue me counſaile in all my affaires, and to aduertiſe me of ſuch faults and imperfections as thou ſhalt ſee to appeare in me, and if thou ſhalt ſee me to neglect my fathers proceedings, I will that thou ſhalt reprooue me: and although there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, by whome I am counſailed by, yet amongeſt them

By my traueile in the Countrey I haue bettered my experience, to learne the follies of mine owne Court, and omitting to ſpeake of many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I will but onely glaunce at the ſuperfluitie of this our preſent age, wherein al kind of exceſſe, riot, weltering in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, curioſitie in apparell, perfumes, friſling of haire, not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much amongſt women, as practiſed daily amongſt vaine men.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1723:24"/> gathered by this ſouldier <hi>Martianus,</hi> (in a diſcourſe that hee made, before wee came to this place) Princes that are conſtrained to relye on other mennes reportes, muſt vſe greate diligence, to diſcerne flatterers, and diſguiſers of matters, and muſt likewiſe vſe no leſſe circumſpection, in beſtowing of offices, and giuing rewardes: Princes many times giues preferment to their frendes to recompence their frendſhip, other whiles to their ſeruantes to requite their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, and although it might bee ſaid that many Princes doe erre in diſtributing their offices, yet they doe not erre, for that they would erre, yea, and many times it is ſeene in caſes of promotion, high offices and dignities are rather bought with money, then deſerued by vertue: where in time paſt, there was no man areared to honour, but hee that deſerued it: In former adges, men ofſcience were ſearched for in ſtrang coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but now, though they knocke at our gates, they are not ſuffered to enter, no our corruption and cuſtome drawes vs to other delightes: This court in elder adge was counted a receptacle of wiſe men, but nowe the common harbour for paraſites and flatterers, but as no vermine breedes where they find no warmth, no vultures ſtoope where they ſmell no pray, no flies ſwarme where they ſée no fleſhe, no pilgrime creepes where there is no croſſe, ſo there is no paraſit will lurke where hee findes no gaine, and therefore doe flatterers praiſe vs, bycauſe they would price vs, but I wonder that theſe great men that haue authority in the courtes of Princes ſhould bee ſo generally ſeduced by flatterers, and ſo vſually carried awaye, by theſe creeping paraſites: But beinge inſtructed as I am, I doubte not but ere manye daies paſt, I will ſo ſcoure that rable from out of this courte, that they ſhal be glad to ſeeeke a newe haunte: Pretermitting many other follies entertained in the courte, I will conclude with this example vſed by <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> as a cauiat to courtiers.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1723:31"/> either wil bring forth il ſucceſſe, or no ſucceſſe: ſo conclude, loue is in nothing more conſtant, then in tormenting his profeſſors.O reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber your ſelfe then <hi>Doreſtus,</hi> if not for my ſake that am ſory to ſée your paſſions, yet for your owne ſake, that euen now remains in ieoperdy: purge your head of this infection, weaue not the webbe of your own woe, ſpinne not the thread of your owne thraldome, it is better to beware by others miſhappes, then by repentaunce of your owne follies: hazard not at that which cannot be had without harme, ſtretch not too farre, wade not too deepe, vſe beauty but ſerue it not, taſt wine but ſurfeit not, warme thée by the fire but burne thée not. Take héed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and dwell nor long in this temptation, when it is neither conuenient for your honour, your body, nor your profite. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtus</hi> that was ſtrucken in a dumpe with theſe admonitions, anſwered againe. You handle me <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> as a crabbed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that when her childe hath caught a fall, ſhee whippes the taile to make amendes, but if you finde your ſelfe an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata</hi> to loue, or that you haue diſplaied the flagge of defiance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fancie: can you not vſe your liberty to your ſelfe, but you muſt vſe it, as if you would vantingly martch ouer your frends miſerie: O <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> things are ſone promiſed, but not ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelie perfourmed, it is eaſie to ſound the victorie, but very hard to obtaine the conqueſt: all can ſay we would ouer-come, but few or none returne with triumph. Loue is a God and will be obaid, and lookes to command, not to be conquered, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cannot be reſiſted: dare reaſon abide the brunt, wher beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bids the battell, can wiſedome winne the fielde, where loue commaunds as captaine? O no, no: loue is without lawe, and therefore aboue all lawe: honoured in heauen, feared in earth, and a very terrour to infernal ghoſts. Lord how wiſe you be
(anſwered <hi>Bruſanus</hi>) in framing propoſitions to deceiue but your ſelfe: if loue be lawleſſe (as you infer) it is lewd: if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limites, laſciuious: if contained within no bounds, beaſtlie: if obſerued with no order, odious: ſo that lawleſſe loue without reaſon, is the very loadſtone to ruth and ruine. Howe can you then imagine the effect to bee good, when the ſubiect is naught, or howe canne you ſo clearkely defend your deſperate motion, proceeding from ſuche a fond and fooliſhe occaſion: But you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1723:32"/> will ſaye it was the perfection of her comelye perſon, her exquiſite feature and rare beauty that kynd led your deſire. But remember <hi>Doreſtus,</hi> beauty no ſoner ſloriſheth, but it as quickly fadeth, it is not fully ripe, before it begin to rot: it is no ſoner out of the budde, but it withereth in the bloſſome. If then beauty be ſo fading, ſo fickle, ſo momentarie, ſo withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſo wauing, ſone paſſed and ſoe ſone parched, is this the Iewell that you make ſoe deare off, is this the Iemme that you would purchaſe with ſo great daunger, conſider againe, al beautifull thinges are not precious, <hi>Mercury</hi> is milke white, but deadly poyſon: the gloworme, is bright in the hedge, but blacke in the hande, the Panther hath a painted ſkin, but a deuouring paunche: the Serpent is pleaſing to the eye, but peſtilent to al our other partes: and he that taketh to much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to gaze on beauty, ſhall ſometimes bee gauled with to much griefe. Yet I ſay not nay, but that loue may haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine childiſhe vehemency: but if louers were not charmed with ſome ſecret inchauntment, they would be able either to kéepe their fancies for being inflamed, or elſe to coole deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alreadie blinded: for the daies they ſpende in thoughtes the nightes in dreames, both in griefes, either beguylinge them of that they had, and promiſing, that they are neuer like to finde: their heades fraught with fantiſies, fixed with ieloſies, troubled with both: yea ſo many inconueniences waite vpon loue, as were infinit to recken them all, and to much intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(for a reſonable man) to taſt but one: being alwaies begun with griefe, continued with ſorrowe, and ended with deathe: and albeit the pleaſure paſſeth away in a triſe, no ſoner done but forgotten, and the puniſhmente is permanent, yet ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull is the preſent ſwéete, that they neuer remember the following ſoure. The time is yet to com wherein many thorns are not founde amidſt the roſes of mariage. <hi>Marius</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> aſked <hi>Metellus</hi> why he would not take his daughter to wife, ſéeing ſhe was beautifull in body, ſtaide in countenance, eloquent in ſpeach, noble by race, riche in doury, happy in good name and adorned with ſundry vertues: to whome the other replide that he knew all this to be true, yet (quoth he) I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee mine owne then hers. An other good fellowe on a

I ſe <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> that loue and beautye are little beholding to you but that eye that loatheth to behold beauty, is vnworthy to contemplate the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: what appetite more earneſtly to be ſought after then beauty, which conceiueth no blemiſh and concerneth the light of the body. But fortune I now moſt humbly thanke thee, for the recomforting mee with the delightfull remembrance of the beauty of my miſtris, making me pertaker of that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation which is heauenly: the memorie whereof is a preſent reſtoritiue to all incumbrances that you haue hetherto feared me with, and a ſufficient defenſatiue, to any misfortune, that can heere-after befall me: but it is againſt reaſon <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> ſo vncharitably to exclaime againſt thoſe, without whome our life though neuer ſo luckie ſhould ſéeme moſt loathſome, and ſo preiudicially to contemne thoſe heuenly creatures, whoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſight is a ſalue againſt all helliſhe ſorrowes: If thou dideſt knowe <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> the ioy, the comforte, and recreation that is conuerſante with beautye, thou wouldeſt doe pennance and marter thy ſelfe, for abuſing ſo high an eſtate as <hi>Cupid</hi> is. Truely (quoth <hi>Bruſanus</hi>) thou art worthy <hi>Doreſtus</hi> to be a chapman, that will bid ſo well for thy chaffer: But I would mine owne experience had neuer ſerued me to iudge ſo well of wemens manners, that ſomtimes adicted my ſelfe wholy to their ſeruice, and ſpent my life in the lappes of Ladies, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my goods to maintaine their brauery, and my wit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their folly.

               <p>I Perceiue (<hi>Doreſtus</hi>) that between vs the olde ſaying is like to bee verified, which is, that one fable draweth on another. And heere I cannot a little woonder to thinke, what humour ſhould draw <hi>Doreſtus</hi> to praiſe thoſe for the onely paragons of the world, that in truth are the very out-caſtes of nature, who ſith their firſt creation to this preſent, there was neuer anie man (of vpright iudgement) that durſt be ſo fooliſh-hardy, as once to beſtow of them a generall commendacion: thoſe onelie excepted, whoſe fooliſh affections drowned in the ſeas of folly, are thereby made partiall, in the behalfe of their miſtres: but where blind men muſt iudge of colours, there is ill painting, &amp; where louers dare ſpeake in the behalfe of wemen, there rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is enforſt to play banckrout.

I haue heard of many that were madde for loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I neuer hearde of any that were wiſe in loue, I haue knowen the wiſe haue bene beſotted by fancie, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew fancie that made a wiſe man: for it is no more poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that loue ſhould be without paſſion, then the Sunne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, fire without heat, or water without moiſture, whoſe pleaſant motions are mixt with wonderfull diſquiet, his little pleaſure with piles of ſorrow, his ſmall brookes of tranſitorie ioy, with great riuers of extreame anguiſh: In loue, what ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eie? laſciuiouſnes: what heareth the eare? laſciuiouſnes: what inureth the body? laſciuiouſnes: the badge of loue idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the beſt reſt corrupt delights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the finall ende repentaunce.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1723:41"/> as it may be tearmed lawleſſe luſt, ſuch as is practiſed with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mercenarie woman: but take loue when it is lawfullie ment, wherin it is beſt to be admitted, and vſe wemen in their pureſt kinde, whereunto they were firſt created, and you ſhall finde, that there is not ſo much care in the one, but there is as great combre in the other: and that the one bredeth not ſo much wracke, but the other bringeth as much woe: and where they both doe but promiſe vs a dramme of delight they will ſurelie pay vs with a pound of deſpight. For the inſtitution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, I confeſſe it to be good: nay further, I acknowledge it to be honourable, and it was firſt ordained to a moſt godly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which was to kéepe men from that filthy ſinne of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but what men, ſuche as were not able to containe their fleſhly deſires within the limites and bounds of chaſtity, for as it is ſaid, chaſtity is the beauty of mans ſouls, and it is further affirmed, that the firſt degree of chaſtity is pure virginity, the ſecond honeſt matrimony, ſo that marriage hath heere but a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place: now by this wee may conclude, that marriage was ordained but as a meane or medicine, wherewith to allay our fleſhly luſts: and like as in all other our naturall infirmities, when they oppreſſe vs, we by and by ſeeke the Phiſition, who to purge the humour, miniſtreth vnto vs but an Apothecaries drugge, the which by artificiall meanes may well bee made pleaſant in the receipt, but in operation and woorking, it ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempereth euery part of our body, as we ſhall neuer finde reſt nor quiet, ſo long as there is any parcell of it remaining with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs: ſo hee that is infected with the ſicknes of loathſome luſt, he may wel ſeeke Phiſicke, that is, he may take a wife to allay the rage of his fleſhly deſires, but he ſhall find her but an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries drugge: for though ſhe ſeeme pleaſant in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, yet in the winding vp, ſhe prooueth a continuall torment, and his haſtye attempt is euer rewarded with a gnawing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Marriage is tearmed by the name of a yoake, by other-ſome it is called a bondage: and mee thinkes that theſe very names might perſwade vs, that there is no great felicity to be ſought for in his fruite. I can moſt fitly compare louers to hunters, that likes better of the ſporte, then they doe of the game it ſelfe when they haue it: or like him that would needs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1723:42"/> goe a fiſhing, though hee caught but a frogge: and my louer in the time of his wooing, thinkes there is no greater bliſſe, but hauing once attained the height of his deſire, his affections ſtraight begins to decline. Thus you may perceiue, that in mariages there is not ſuch ſwéet, but it is ſauced with too much ſowre, in loue ſuch gouernment, which ſauoureth not of follie, nor in affection ſuche fore-ſight, which is not repented with great heart-breake. O fooliſh therefore, that will ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee conquered by a woman, whome God at the firſt created but as an inſtrument to mans neceſſity: But it is their beauty that be witcheth vs, for with a pearce of their ein, there is harboured ſuch power, that with the nature of the <hi>Baſilike,</hi> they ſo inuenome euerye part of vs, that no art will ſerue to purge it. Truely, the folly of affection is woonderfull, yet are the errours of beauty more admirable, when of herſelfe ſhee is but a painted ſepulchre, and in her actions, the diminiſher of all naturall and morall reaſon: we praiſe beautie, what more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we honour beautie, what more corrupt: wee ſorrowe for beauty, what more fooliſhe. In greene graſſe you ſhall finde biting ſerpents, in glorious ſepulchers, rotten bones, in paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pots, deadly poyſon: in faire wemen, falſe hearts. Their immodeſt boldnes many times makes them aduenture of that which is both expreſly forbidden them, and alſo is moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and contrary vnto nature, as <hi>Myrrha,</hi> to fall in loue with her father. <hi>Phedra,</hi> with her ſonne. <hi>Biblis,</hi> with her brother.

They would be ſeene to haue many ſeruants to ſue vnto them, for that in their owne fancy, is the cheefeſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their beautye, and they haue cunning to imbrace euerye one with a perticuler affection, and that with ſuch ſlight as the wiſeſt ſhall be lead in hope of their good wils. They haue with the Iugler chaunge of entertainement for euery company, to perſwade one with ſpeach, to court an other with lookes, to be familiar with a third by ſigns, to allure a fourth by falſe trains of cloaked honeſty, feeding them all with vncertaine hope, and him ſhee makes the Aſſe to beare the burthen, that beares her moſt affection.

They loue aboue all things to bee ſolicited with great importunity, accounting him for a meacocke, that wil be repulſed with a firſt deniall, affirming that a woman muſt ſay nay and take it: and yet the more ſhe ſeeth you plagued in paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her, the leſſe careful is ſhe of your countenaunce, but the more you grow cold in your loue, the greater increaſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heat of her affections, like a diſeaſe, whoſe cure comes by contrarie medicin: ſuch is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> violence of their ſpite, that with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

For your large exhortatorie, I let it paſſe as friuolous: but we muſt not doe wemen that wrong, to condemne them for a little fooliſh Philoſophy: for as the Philoſophers were men, ſo they had many faults: ther were ſome of them Paraſites, ſom Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, ſome Ieſters, ſome railers, ſome inſected with pride, ſome with couetouſnes, but moſt laſcinious: and it is a cuſtome of ill men, to defame wemen openlye, when they haue abuſed them ſecretly. Such a one was your great <hi>Emperour,</hi> and worthy Philoſopher <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> whome you ſo muche account of: but who more diſſolute in the company of wemen, yet who more prodigall in defaming of wemen: in the diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red demeanure of his owne wife, <hi>Fauſtine</hi> did many times ſo diſquiet him, that he was not able to moderate himſelfe, no not withall his precepts of Philoſophie. I doe not ſpeake this to confirme <hi>Bruſanus</hi> in his opinion, that wemen were thus able to martir the minds of theſe learned Philoſophers, but I ſpeak it aſwell to confute thoſe bitter inuectiues pronounced by the Philoſophers, (peraduenture in a furie) as alſo to confound their actions, that notwithſtanding their pretended knowledg, would ſuffer themſelues to bee ſeduced, not onely by wemen that liue in ſuſpect, but ſome of them moſt notoriouſly known, as namely <hi>Layis</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> whome <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſo nicely cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to whome <hi>Demoſtines</hi> came to cheapen, but her ware was too hie prized. <hi>Periander,</hi> chiefe Philoſopher in Gréece at the inſtaunt of a ſtrumpet, ſlewe his honeſt wife. <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> was ſo bewitched on his Curtiſan <hi>Ielaua,</hi> that he ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her in his knowledge of Philoſophy, that on a time while he lay ſicke, ſhe ſupplied his place of reading in the ſchoole. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obulus,</hi> when hee was 60. yeares olde, and had read Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy

               <p>But <hi>Bruſanus,</hi> me thinke you ſkip a little beyond your ſkil thus to quarrell with beautie, is the ſunne to be miſliked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is bright, the diamond to be refuſed becauſe it is cleare, the pearle to be condemned becauſe it is orient, or wemen to be diſpiſed becauſe they be beautiful, when it is the onely doury it hath pleaſed God to beſtowe amongeſt them, the more to ſhew the maieſtie of his handy worke: But you inferre it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth men to doat, and to whom do you impute the fault, would you haue wemen to eclipſe that perfection which them ſelues cannot hide, without preiudice to their creator: but hee that ſtandeth to néere the fire, let him blame but himſelfe, if he bee ſcorcht with the flame: <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> wrighting to the lady
<hi>Lidia,</hi> proueth by his Philoſophy, that it is a token of greate ſimplicity, not to deſcry the perfection of beautie, and an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of greater folly, not to deſire it: Now you begin to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with wemens apparrell, but you are in this matter either not well informed or elſe to forward in iudgment, ſéeing this curioſitie (as you terme it) is alowed to wemen, with more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie then you thinke, for wemen being onely created for the pleſure of man, why might it not be thought, that God him ſelfe ſturres that opinion in her, to giue contentment to the eies of him, for whoſe ſake ſhe was created: <hi>Licurgus</hi> in his common wealth, preciſlye ordained that maidens ſhould goe bare faced, to the end they might be ſéene and deſired, and by the ſame meanes, the married wiues laboureth to pleaſe (not the populer ſort as <hi>Bruſanus</hi> imagineth) but her husband to whom ſhe is married, as it is written of the daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who on a day being attired aboue her wonted cuſtome of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, where at her father taking no greate delight yet for the preſent, gouerning his iudgmente by ſilence, but another time finding her in habit more conuenient to his liking, Oh (ſaith he) howe farre more ſéemelye is this attire for the daughter of

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1723:80"/> with a newe tormente, not knowing howe to ſalue the ſore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he had already chafed: for he thought with him ſelfe, that if he ſhould make peace with <hi>Myletto,</hi> letting him vnderſtand the loue he bare to his daughter, that he woulde not except of it, either for the greate domage that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done him, or for the band where with he was bound to <hi>Cariſto</hi> the Prince of <hi>Piemount,</hi> thinking it woulde be a thing neither reſonable, nor yet agréeing to his honour, in liew of the Princes paines which he had taken to com from his countrie, accompanied with ſo puiſſaunt an army in his defence, and in regarde of the death which he ther receiued in his ſeruice, to become a friend to his foe, and to giue his daughter (before eſpouſed to the Prince) vnto the moſt deadly foe that the Prince had.</p>
               <p>Theſe things (I ſay) did ſo trouble <hi>Doreſtus,</hi> that though he euery daye coyned a newe deuiſe, yet knew not at night where on to reſolue.</p>
               <p>By this time they were come before the Cittie, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citizens iſſuing forth with ſmall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies exployted many ſeruices to their greate commendations, but their forces were to féeble, they were ſtil ouer-matched with numbers, and were therefore driuen to retire into the Cittie: <hi>Aſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi> ſetteled himſelfe before the walles, and in ſhort time ſo gyrdeled in the Cittie with a trench, that they could neither ſally forth of the towne, nor receiue any newe ſupplies, that ſhould come in their reliefe.</p>
               <p>It were here tedious to let you vnderſtand, the ſeuerall ſtrategems practiſed by <hi>Aſtulpho,</hi> and ſtill preuented, and the Cittie defended in diſpight of all his enterpriſes: But
<hi>Aſtulpho</hi> finding his deuiſes to ſorte out to ſoe little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, brought a ſtronge batterie againſt the walles, which deliuered ſuch continuall and terrible vollies: that a maine breach was made aſſaultable, and a great parte of the wale beſides ſo ſhaken, that it was readie to fall: <hi>Aſtulpho</hi> cauſed the breach immediatly to be fearcely aſſaulted, &amp; it was by the Cittiezens as brauelye defended, the aſſaylantes after

               <p>
                  <hi>Myletto</hi> verye ioyfull to heare of this tenne daies truce, hoping in the meane time by ſome meanes to relieue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or at the leaſt to reedifie his ſhaken walles, that were euery houre readie to fall, he confirmed the peace during the foreſaid time as well vnder his hand writing, as vnder his oath ſolemnely giuen, requiring the like of <hi>Aſtulpho,</hi> who accordingly proteſted, both vnder his hand &amp; oath, to kéepe true peace for tenne daies: The truce thus agreed vppon,
<hi>Aſtulpho</hi> premeditating what courſe he might followe for the accompliſhment of his intended purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Myletto</hi> on the other ſide minding to take oportunitie, the verye next dayt brought labourers to that parte of the wall that had béene before ſo ſhaken with ſhot, and threwe
