         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But of this mans praiſes I will ſay nothing, not becauſe I doe feare that ſmall credence ſhall be given to the teſtimony that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of a friends mouth: but becauſe his vertue and learning be greater, and of more excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then that I am able to praiſe them: and alſo in all places ſo famous and ſo perfectly well knowne, that they need not, nor ought not of me to be praiſed, unleſſe I would ſeem to ſhew and ſet forth the brightneſſe of the Sunne with a Candle, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſaith.

He ſhould haue beene very welcome to me, ſaid I, for your ſake. Nay (quoth he) for his owne ſake, if you knew him: for there is no man this day living, that can tell you of ſo many ſtrange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne peoples, and Countries, as this man can. And I know well that you be very deſirous to heare of ſuch newes. Then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured not farre amiſſe (quoth I) for even at the firſt ſight, I judged him to be a Marriner. Nay (quoth he) there ye were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived: he hath ſayled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not as the Mariner <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,</hi> but as the expert &amp; prudent Prince VLYSSES: Yea, rather

For he made ſuch meanes and ſhift, what by intreatance, and what by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſuite, that he got licence of Maſter <hi>Americke</hi> (though it were ſore againſt his will) to be one of the twenty foure, which in the end of the laſt voyage were left in the Country of <hi>Gulicke.</hi> He was therefore left behind for his mind-ſake, as one that tooke more thought and care for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, then dying; having cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomably in his mouth theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: <hi>He that bath no grave, is covered with the skie; and, The way to heaven, out of all places, is of like length and diſtance.</hi> Which fantaſie of his, (if God had not beene his better friend) he had ſurely bought full deere.

All this when PETER had told me, I thanked him for his gentle kindneſſe: that he had vouchſafed to bring me to the ſpeech of that man, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, he thought ſhould be to me pleaſant, and acceptable. And therewith I turned me to <hi>Raphael:</hi> And when we had hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed each other, and had ſpoke theſe commune words, that he cuſtomably ſpoke at the firſt meeting, and acquaintance of ſtrangers, we went thence to my houſe, and there in my Garden, vpon a bench covered with greene turves, we ſate downe tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together. There he told us, how that after the departing of <hi>Veſpuce,</hi> he and his fellowes that tarried behind in <hi>Gulicke,</hi> began by little and little, through farre
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13209:7"/>
and gentle ſpeech, to winne the love and favour of the people of that Country; inſomuch, that within ſhort ſpace, they did dwell among them, not onely harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but alſo occupying with them familiarly. He told vs alſo, that they were in high reputation and favour with a certaine great man (whoſe name and Countrey is now quite out of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) which of his meere libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, did beare the coſts and charges of him and his fiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. And beſides that, gaue them a truſty guide to conduct them in their journey (which by water was in Boats, and by land in Wagons) and to bring them to other Princes with very friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commendations.</p>
            <p>Thus after many dayes jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, he ſaid, they found Townes, and Cities, and Weale publiques, full of people, governed by good and wholſome Lawes: for under the line Equinoctiall, and on

Whereof in another place (as I ſaid) I will intreat.

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:13209:9"/>
But firſt I will reſpect our former communication by the occaſion, and (as I might ſay) the drift whereof he was brought into the mention of the Weale Publique: For when <hi>Raphael</hi> had very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently touched divers things that be amiſſe, ſome here, and ſome there; Yea, very many on both parts; and againe had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſuch wiſe Lawes, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Decrees, as be eſtabliſhed and uſed, both here among vs, and alſo among them; as a man ſo perfect, and expert in the Lawes, and Cuſtomes of every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Country, as though into what place ſoever he came gheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there he had led all his life: then PETER much marvailing at the man; Surely Maſter <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> (quoth he) I wonder great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why you get you not into ſome Kings Court: For I am ſure, there is no Prince living, that would not be very glad of you, as a man not only able high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13209:10"/>
to delight him with your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found learning, and this your knowledge of Countries, and peoples, but alſo meet to inſtruct him with examples, and helpe him with counſell. And thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſhall bring your ſelfe in a very good caſe, and alſo be of ability to helpe all your friends and kinsfolke. As concerning my friends and kinsfolke (quoth he) I paſſe not greatly for them: For I thinke I haue ſufficiently done my part towards them already. For theſe things, that other men doe not depart from, vntill they be old and ſicke; yea, which they be then very loath to leaue, when they can no longer keepe, thoſe very ſame things did I being not onely luſty, and in good health, but alſo in the flowre of my youth, devide among my friends and kinsfolkes. Which I thinke with this my liberality ought to hold them contented, and not to require not to looke that beſides
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13209:10"/>
this, I ſhould for their ſakes giue my ſelfe in bondage unto Kings. Nay, God forbid that (quoth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) it is not my mind that you ſhould be in bondage to Kings, but as a retainer to them at your pleaſure. Which ſurely I thinke is the nigheſt way that you can deviſe how to beſtow your time fruitfully, not onely for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate commodity of your friends, and for the generall profite of all ſorts of people, but alſo for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of your ſelfe to a much wealthier ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then you be now in. To a wealthier condition (quoth <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>) by that meanes, that my mind ſtandeth cleane againſt? Now I liue at liberty after mine owne mind and pleaſure, which I thinke very few of theſe great States, and Peeres of Realmes can ſay. Yea, and there be enough of them that ſue for great mens friendſhips: and therefore thinke it no great hurt, if they haue not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13209:11"/>
me, nor third or fourth ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as I am. Well, I perceiue plainly friend <hi>Raphael</hi> (quoth I) that you be deſirous neither of riches, nor of power. And truly I haue in no leſſe reverence and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation a man of your mind, then any of them all that be ſo high in power and authority: But you ſhall doe as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth you; yea, and according to this wiſedome, to this high and free courage of yours, if you can find in your heart, ſo to appoint and diſpoſe your ſelfe, that you may apply your wit and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the profite of the Weale publique, though it be ſomewhat to your owne paine and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And this ſhall you never ſo well doe, nor with ſo great profit performe, as if you be of ſome great Princes counſell, and put into his head (as I doubt not but you will) honeſt opinions, and vertuous perſwaſions: For from the Prince, as from a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13209:11"/>
well-ſpring, commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people the floud of all that is good or evill. But in you is ſo perfect learning, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any experience, and againe, ſo great experience that without any learning you may well be any Kings Counſellour. You be twiſe deceived Maſter <hi>More</hi> (quoth he) firſt in mee, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the thing it ſelfe: For neither is in me the ability that you force vpon me, and if it were never ſo much, yet in diſquieting mine owne quietneſſe I ſhould nothing further the Weale pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. For firſt of all, the moſt part of all Princes haue more delight in warlike matters, and feates of Chivalry (the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I neither haue nor deſire) then in the good feates of peace: and imploy much more ſtudy, how by right or by wrong to enlarge their Dominions, then how well and peaceable to rule, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne that they haue already.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13209:12"/>
Moreover, they that be Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to Kings, every one of them either is of himſelfe ſo wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that he needeth not, or elſe he thinketh himſelfe ſo wiſe, that he will not alow another mans counſell, ſaving that they doe ſhamefully, and flatteringly, giue aſſent to the fond and fooliſh ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of certaine great men: whoſe favours, becauſe they be in high authority with their Prince, by aſſentation and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they labour to obtaine. And verily it is naturally given to all men to eſteeme their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions beſt: So both the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the Ape thinke their owne young ones faireſt. Then if a man in ſuch a company, where ſome diſdaine and haue deſpight at other mens inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, and ſome count their owne beſt, if among ſuch men (I ſay) a man ſhould bring forth any thing, that he hath reade done in times paſt, or that he hath ſeene done
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13209:12"/>
in other places; there the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, fare as though the whole exiſtimation of their wiſedome were in jeopardy to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and that ever after they ſhould be counted for very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, unleſſe they could in other mens inventions picke out mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reprehend, and find a fault at. If all other poore helpes faile: then this is their extreame refuge. Theſe things (ſay they) pleaſed our forefathers and anceſtors: would God we could be ſo wiſe as they were: and as though they had wittily concluded the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with this anſwere ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped every mans mouth, they ſit downe againe. As who ſhould ſay, it were a very dangerous matter, if a man in any point ſhould bee found wiſer then his fore-fathers were. And yet be we content to ſuffer the beſt and wittieſt of their Decrees to lye unexecuted: but if in any thing a better order might haue beene
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13209:13"/>
taken, then by them was, there we take faſt hold, finding there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults. Many times haue I<note place="margin">Partiall judgement.</note> chanced vpon ſuch proud, lewd, over-thwart, and way-ward judgements; yea (and once in <hi>England:</hi> I pray you Sir (quoth I) haue you beene in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?

Againe, he perceived the ſame ſtocke of money to be too little and vnſufficient to encourage and enable him wrongfully to take away other mens goods: which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe cauſe why y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> law was made.

I vtterly deny that it can whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be taken away: For if there were a Statute made, that no man ſhould haue in his ſtocke aboue a preſcript and appointed ſumme of money: if it were by certaine Lawes decreed, that neither the King ſhould bee of too great power, neither the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too haughty and wealthy; and that Offices ſhould not by inordinate ſute, or by bribes and guifts: that they ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee bought nor ſold; nor that it ſhould be needfull for the Officers, to be at any coſt or charge in their Offices: For ſo occaſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13209:48"/>
to be kept and botched up for a time: ſo theſe evils alſo may be lightned and mitigated. But that they may be perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, brought to a good and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſtate, it is not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, whiles every man is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his owne to himſelfe. Yea, and whiles you goe about to doe your cure of one part, you ſhall make bigger the ſore of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part, ſo the helpe of one cauſeth anothers harme: for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as nothing can be given to any one unleſſe it be taken from another.</p>
            <p>But I am of a contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (quoth I) for me thinketh that men ſhall never there live wealthy, where all things bee common: For how can there be abundance of goods, or of any thing, where every man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his hand from labour? Whom the regard of his owne gaines driveth not to worke, but the hope that he hath in other
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13209:49"/>
mens travailes maketh him ſloathfull.</p>
            <p>Then when they be pricked with poverty, and yet no man can by any law or right defend that for his owne, which he hath gotten with the labor of his own hands, ſhall not there of neceſſity be continuall ſedition and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? Specially the authority and reverence of Magiſtrates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, which, what place it may have with ſuch men among whom is no difference, I cannot deviſe. I marvaile not (quoth he) that you be of this opinion. For you conceiue in your mind either none at all, or elſe a very falſe Image and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of this thing. But if you had beene with me in <hi>Vtopia,</hi> and had preſently ſeene their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions and lawes, as I did, which lived there fiue yeares, and more, &amp; wold never haue come thence, but onely to make that new land
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13209:49"/>
knowne heere: Then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you would grant, that you never ſaw people well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but onely there. Surely (quorh Maſter PETER) it ſhall be hard for you to make me beleeve, that there is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order in that New Land, then is here in the Countries that we know. For good wits be as well here as there: and I thinke our Common-wealths be ancienter then theirs; wherein long vſe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath found out many things commodious for mans life; beſides that many things here among vs have beene found by chance, which no wit could ever have deviſed. As touching the ancientneſſe (quoth he) of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, then, you might better judge if you had read the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Chronicles of that land, which, if we may beleeue,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13209:50"/>
Cities were there, before men were heere.</p>
            <p>Now what thing ſoever hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto by wit hath beene deviſed, or found by chance, that might be as well there as heere. But I thinke verily, though it were ſo that we did paſſe them in wit: yet in ſtudy, in trauell, and in labourſome endevour, they farre paſſe vs: For (as their Chroni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles teſtifie) before our arrivall there they never heard any thing of vs, whom they call the <hi>Vltra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equinoctialles:</hi> ſaving that once about 1200 yeares agoe, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ship was loſt by the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Marke now what profit they tooke of this one occaſion through diligence and earneſt trauaile. There was no craft nor ſcience within the Empire of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13209:50"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> whereof any profit could riſe, but they either learned it of theſe ſtrangers, or elſe of them, taking occaſion to ſearch for it, found it out. So great profit was it to them that ever any went thither, from hence. But if any like chance before this hath brought any man from thence hither, that is as quite out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, as this alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in time to come ſhall be forgotten, that ever I was there. And like as they quickly almoſt at the firſt meeting, made their owne, whatſoever is among us wealthily deviſed: So I ſuppoſe it would be long before we ſhould receive any thing, that among them is better inſtituted then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
            <p>And this I ſuppoſe is the chiefe cauſe why their common-wealths be wiſelyer governed, and doe flouriſh in more wealth then ours, though wee neither in wit nor riches be their inferiours.

Therefore gentle Maſter <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> (quoth I) I pray you and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you deſcribe vnto us the Iland. And ſtudy not to bee ſhort: but declare largely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Grounds, their Rivers, their Cities, their People, their Manners, their Ordinances, their Lawes, and to bee ſhort, all things that you ſhall thinke us deſirous to know.

Sometimes pleaſure riſeth exhibiting to any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing that it deſireth, nor taking from it any paine that it feeleth, which nevertheleſſe tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and moveth our ſences with a certaine ſecret efficacie, but with a manifeſt motion turneth them to it. As is that which commeth of Muſicke. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of bodily pleaſure they<note place="margin">Bodily health.</note> ſay, is that which conſiſteth and reſteth in the quiet and upright ſtate of the body. And that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is every mans owne proper health, intermingled and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with no griefe. For this, if they be not letted nor aſſaulted with no griefe, is delectable of it ſelfe, though it be moved with no externall or outward pleaſure. For though it be not ſo plaine and manifeſt to the ſence, as the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13209:96"/>

All the <hi>Vtopians</hi> grant it to be a right ſoveraigne pleaſure, and as you would ſay the foundation and ground of all pleaſures, as which even alone is able to make the ſtate and condition of life delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and pleaſant.

But of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, now they agree almoſt
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13209:96"/>
all in this, that health is a moſt ſoveraigne pleaſure. For ſeeing that in ſickneſſe (ſay they) is griefe, which is a mortall enemy to pleaſure, even as ſickneſſe is to health, why ſhould not then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be in the quietnes of health? For they ſay it maketh nothing to this matter, whether you ſay that ſickneſſe is a griefe, or that in ſickneſſe is griefe for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to one purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For whether health be a pleaſure it ſelfe, or a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſe of pleaſure, as fire is of heat, truly both wayes it followeth, that they cannot be without pleaſure, that be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health. Furthermore whiles we eate (ſay they) then health, which began to be appaired, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by the helpe of food a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hunger.

the wonted ſtrength, miniſtreth that pleaſure, whereby we be ſo refreſhed. Health therefore, which in the conflict is joyfull, ſhall it not be merry, when it hath gotten the victory? But as ſoone as it hath recovered the priſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtrength, which thing only in all the ſight it coveted, ſhall it incontinent be aſtonied? Nor ſhall it not know nor imbrace the owne wealth and goodneſſe? For where it is ſaid, health cannot be felt, this they thinke is nothing true.

them they count the chiefeſt and moſt principall of all. The chiefe part of them they thinke doth come of the exerciſe of vertue, and conſcience of good life. Of theſe pleaſures that the body mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth, they give the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to health. For the delight of eating and drinking, and whatſoever hath any like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe, they determine to be pleaſures much to be deſired, but no otherwayes then for healths ſake. For ſuch things of their owne proper nature be not ſo pleaſant, but in that they reſiſt ſickneſſe privily ſtealing on: Therefore, like as it is a wiſemans part, rather to avoid ſickneſſe, then to wiſh for medicines, and rather to drive away and put to flight carefull griefes, then to call for comfort: ſo it is much better not to need this kind of pleaſure, then thereby to be eaſed of the contrary griefe. The which kind of pleaſure, if any
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:13209:98"/>
man take for his felicity, that man muſt needs grant, that then he ſhall be in moſt felicity, if he live that life, which is lead in continuall hunger, thirſt, itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eating, drinking, ſcratching, and rubbing. The which life, how not onely foule and unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but alſo how miſerable and wretched it is, who perceiveth not? Theſe doubtleſſe be the baſeſt pleaſures of all, as unpure and unperfect. For they never come but accompanied with their contrary griefes.

For it beginneth before the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and endeth not untill the pleaſure die with it.

And though at the firſt it proved not all of the beſt, yet by often aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, they ſhortly got the feare of both. And have ſo brought the matter about, that if they had copies of Greeke au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, they could lack no Bookes.

For they thruſt no man forth into warre againſt his will: becauſe they beleeve, if any man be fearefull and faint-hearted of nature, he will not onely doe no manfull and hardy act himſelfe, but alſo be occaſion of cowardneſſe to his fellowes.

               <p>This manner may they eaſily obſerue, becauſe they haue ſo few Prieſts, and doe chooſe them with ſuch circumſpection. For it ſcarcely euer chanceth, that the moſt vertuous among vertuous, which in reſpect only of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is advanced to ſo high a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, can fall to vice &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And if it ſhould chance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as mans nature is mutable and fraile) yet by reaſon they be ſo few, and promoted to no might nor

power, but onely to honour, it were not to be feared that any great dammage by them ſhould happen &amp; enſue to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. They haue ſo rare and few Prieſts, leaſt if the honour were communicated to many, the dignity of the order, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them now is ſo highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtetmed, ſhould run in contempt. Specially becauſe they thinke it hard to find many ſo good, as to be meete for that dignity, to the execution and diſcharge wherof, it is not ſufficient to be indued with meane vertues.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, theſe Prieſts be not more eſteemed of their owne Countrey men, then they be of forreigne and ſtrange Countries. Which thing may hereby plainly appeare. And I thinke alſo that this is the cauſe of it. For whiles the armies be fighting together in open field, they a little beſide not farre off kneele vpon their knees in their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:13209:140"/>
hallowed veſtments, holding vp their hands to heaven: praying firſt of all for peace, next for victory of their owne part, but to neither part a bloudy victory. If their Hoſt get the vpper hand, they runne into the maine Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and reſtraine their owne men from ſlaying and cruelly purſuing their vanquiſhed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Which enemies, if they doe but ſee them and ſpeake to them, it is enough for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of their lives. And the touching of their cloathes defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ſaveth all their goods from ravine and ſpoile. This thing hath advanced them to ſo great worſhip and true Majeſty among all Nations, that many times they have as well preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their owne Citizens from the cruell force of their enemies, as they have their enemies from the furious rage of their owne men. For it is well knowne, that when their owne Army hath recoiled
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:13209:140"/>
and in deſpaire turned backe, and runne away, their enemies fiercely purſuing with ſlaughter and ſpoile, then the Prieſts comming betweene have ſtayed the murder, and parted both the hoaſts. So that peace hath beene made and concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both parts vpon equall and indifferent conditions. For there was never any Nation, ſo fierce, ſo cruell, and rude, but they had them in ſuch reverence, that they counted their bodies hallowed and ſanctified, and therefore not to be violently and unreverently touched.</p>

Becauſe they thought that overmuch light doth diſperſe mens cogitations, whereas in dimme and doubtfull light they be gathered together, and more earneſtly fixed vpon religion and devotion: which becauſe it is not there of one ſort among all men, and yet all the kinds and faſhions of it, though they be ſundry and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, agree together in the honor of divine nature, as going divers wayes to one end: therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:13209:141"/>
is ſeene or heard in the Churches, but that ſeemeth to agree indifferently with them all. If there be a diſtinct kind of Sacrifice peculiar to any ſeverall ſect, that they execute at home in their owne houſes. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſacrifices be ſo ordered, that they be no derogation nor preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any of the private ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and religions. Therefore no Image of any GOD is ſeene in the Church, to the intent it may be free for every man to conceiue GOD by their religion after what likeneſſe and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude they will. They call vpon no peculiar name of GOD but onely <hi>Mythra.</hi> In the which word they all agree together in one nature of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty whatſoever it be. No prayers be vſed ſuch as every man may boldly pronounce without the offending of any Sect. They come therefore to the Church, the laſt day of every
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:13209:142"/>
Moneth and yeare in the evening yet faſting, there to give thankes to GOD for that they have proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly paſſed over the yeare or Moneth, whereof that holiday is the laſt day.</p>
               <p>The next day they come to the Church earely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to pray to God that they may have good fortune and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe all the New yeare or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, which they doe vſe to begin of that ſame holy day.</p>
               <p>But in the holy dayes that be the laſt dayes of the Moneths and yeares, before they come to the Church, the wives fall downe proſtrate before their husbands feet at home, and the children before the feet of their parents, confeſſing and acknowledging themſelves offenders either by ſome actuall deed, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their duty, and deſire pardon for their offence. Thus if any cloud of priuy diſpleaſure was riſen at home, by this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:13209:142"/>
it is over-blowne, that they may be preſent at the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices with pure and charitable minds. For they be afraid to come there with troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Therefore if they know themſelves to beare any hatred or grudge towards any man, they preſume not to come to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, before they have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled themſelves and purged their conſciences, for feare of great vengeance and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment for their offence.</p>
               <p>When they be come thither, the men goe into the right ſide of the Church, and the women into the left ſide. There they place themſelves in ſuch order,<note place="margin">An order for place in the Church.</note> that all they which be of the male-kind in every houſhold, ſit before the good man of the houſe; and they of the female kind before the good wife. Thus it is fore-ſeene, that all their geſtures and behaviours be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and obſerved abroad of them,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:13209:143"/>
by whoſe authority and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline they be governed at home.

They kill no living beaſt in ſacrifice, nor they thinke not that the mercifull clemencie of GOD doth dwell in bloud and ſlaughter, which hath given life to beaſts to the intent they ſhould live.

The people weareth in the Church white ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. The Prieſt is cloathed in changeable colours, which in workmanſhip be excellent, but in ſtuffe not very precious. For their veſtments be neither imbrodered with gold, nor ſet with precious ſtones. But they be wrought ſo finely and cunningly with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers feathers of fowles, that the eſtimation of no earthly ſtuffe is able to countervaile the price of the work. Furthermore, in theſe birds feathers, and in the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, which is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their ſetting; they ſay, is contained certaine divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. The interpretation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of knowne, which is diligently taught by the Prieſts, they be out in remembrance of the

bountifull benefits of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and of the loue and honour which of their behalfe is due to God: and alſo of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties one toward another.</p>

For all their muſicke both that they play vpon inſtruments, and that they ſing with mans voice, doth ſo reſemble and expreſſe naturall affections, the ſound and tune is ſo applied and made agreeable to the thing, that whether it be a prayer, or elſe a duty of gladneſſe, of patience, of trouble, of mourning, or of anger: the faſhion of the melody doth ſo repreſent the meaning of the thing, that it doth wonderfully move, ſtirre, pierce, and enflame the hearers minds. At the laſt, the people and the Prieſt together, rehearſe ſolemne prayers in words, expreſſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, ſo made, that every man may privately apply to himſelfe that which is commonly ſpoken of all.</p>
               <p>In theſe prayers every man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſeth, and knowledgeth God to be his maker, his governor, and the principall cauſe of all other goodneſſe, thanking him for ſo
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13209:145"/>
many benefits received at his hand. But namely that through the favour of God he hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into that publike weale, which is moſt happy and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and hath choſen that religion which he hopeth to be moſt true. In the which thing if he doe any thing erre, or if there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better then either of them is, being more acceptable to God, he deſireth him that he will of his goodnes let him have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, as one that is ready to follow what way ſoever he will lead him. But if this forme and faſhion of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be beſt, and his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion moſt true and pefect, then he deſireth GOD to give him a conſtant ſtedfaſtneſſe in the ſame, and to bring all other people to the ſame order of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to the ſame opinion of God, unleſſe there be any thing that in this diverſity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth delight his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

pleaſure. To be ſhort, he prayeth him that after his death he may come to him. But how ſoone or late that he dare not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne nor determine. How beit, if it might ſtand with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties pleaſure, he would be much gladder to die a painfull death and ſo to goe to GOD, then by long living in worldly proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be away from him. When this prayer is ſaid, they fall down to the ground againe and a little after they riſe vp and goe to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And the reſidue of the day they paſſe over in playes, and exerciſe of chiualry.</p>
               <p>Now I haue declared and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto you as truely as I could, the forme and order of that Common-wealth, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in my judgement is not onely the beſt, but alſo that which alone of good right may claime and take vpon it the name of a Common-welth or publike weal. For in other places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>they
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13209:146"/>
ſpeake ſtill of the Common wealth. But every man procu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth his owne private gaine. Here where nothing is private, the common affaires be earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked vpon. And truly on both parts they have good cauſe ſo to doe as they doe. For in other Countries who knoweth not that he ſhall ſtarve for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, unleſſe he make ſome ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall proviſion for himſelfe, though the Common wealth flouriſh never ſo much in rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? And therefore he is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led even of very neceſſity to haue regard to himſelfe, rather then to the people, that is to ſay, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe, there where all things be common to every man, it is not to be doubted that any man ſhall lacke any thing neceſſary for his private vſes, ſo that the common ſtore houſes and barnes be ſufficiently ſtored. For there nothing is deſtributed
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13209:146"/>
after a niggiſh ſort, neither there is any poore man or begger. And though no man have any thing, yet every man is rich. For what can be more rich, then to live joyfull and merrily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all griefe and penſiveneſſe: Not caring for his owne living, nor vexed or troubled with his wifes importunate complaints, nor dreading poverty to his ſonne, nor ſorrowfull for his daughters dowry. Yea they take no care at all for the living and wealth of themſelves and all theirs, and their wives, their children, their nephewes, their childrens children, and all the ſucceſſion that ever ſhall follow in their poſterity. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, there is no leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for them that were once labourers, and be now weake and impotent, then for them that doe now labour and take paine. Here now would I ſee,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13209:147"/>
If any man dare be ſo bold as to compare with the equity, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of other Nations. Among whom, I forſake GOD, if I can find any ſigne or token of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and juſtice. For what juſtice is this, that a rich Gold-ſmith, or an Vſurer, or to be ſhort, any of them, which either doe nothing at all, or elſe that which they do is ſuch, that it is not very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Common-wealth, ſhould have a pleaſant and a wealthy living, either by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or by unneceſſary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: When in the meane time poore labourers, Carters, yron ſmiths, Carpenters, and plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by ſo great and continuall toyle, as drawing and bearing beaſts be ſcant able to ſuſtaine, and again ſo neceſſary toyle, that without it no Common-wealth were able to continue and endure one yeare, ſhould yet get ſo hard and poore a living, and live ſo wretched and miſerable a life,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:13209:147"/>
that the ſtate and condition of the labouring beaſt may ſeeme much better and wealthier? For they be not put to ſo continuall labour, nor their living is not much worſe: yea, to them much pleaſanter, taking no thought in the meane ſeaſon for the time to come. But theſe ſilly poore wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be preſently tormented with barraine and unfruitfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And the remembrance of their poore indigent and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly old age kille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Is not this an unjuſt, and an unkind Publique weale, which giveth great fees and rewards to Gentlemen, as they call them, and to Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, and to ſuch other,

And yet beſides this, the rich men not onely by private fraud, but alſo by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawes, doe every day plucke and ſnatch away from the poore, ſome part of their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:13209:148"/>
daily living. So whereas it ſeemed before unjuſt to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with unkindneſſe their paines, that they have beene beneficiall to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, now they have to their wrong and unjuſt dealing (which is yet a much worſe point) given the name of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, yea, and that by force of a Law. Therefore when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and weigh in my mind all theſe Common-wealths, which now a dayes any where do flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſo GOD helpe me, I can perceive nothing but a certaine conſpiracy of rich men procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their owne commodities, under the name and title of the Common-wealth. They invent and deviſe all meanes and crafts, firſt how to keepe ſafely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of looſing, that they have unjuſtly gathered together: and next how to hire and abuſe the worke and labour of the poore for as little money as
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13209:149"/>
may be. Theſe deviſes when the rich men have decreed to be kept and obſerved under colour of the communalty, that is to ſay, alſo of the poore people, then they be made lawes. But theſe moſt vicious and wicked men, when they have by their unſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able covetouſneſſe, devided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves all thoſe things which would have ſufficed all men, yet how farre be they from the wealth and felicity of the <hi>Vtopian</hi> Common-wealth? Out of the which, in that all the deſire<note place="margin">Contempt of money.</note> of money with the vſe thereof is vtterly ſecluded and baniſhed, how great a heape of cares is cut away? How great an occaſion of wickedneſſe and miſchiefe is pulled vp by the root? For who knoweth not that fraud, theft, ravine, brawling, quarrelling, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

refrained, doe die when money dyeth? And alſo that feare, griefe, care, labours, and watching, doe periſh even the very ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that money periſheth? Yet poverty it ſelfe, which onely ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to lacke money, if money were gone, it alſo would decreaſe and vaniſh away. And that you may perceiue this more plainly, conſider with your ſelves ſome barraine and unfruitfull yeare, wherein many thouſands of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſtarved for hunger: I dare be bold to ſay, that in the end of that penury, ſo much Corne or graine might have beene found in rich mens barnes, if they had beene ſearched, as being divided among them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> famine and peſtilence then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, no man at all ſhould have felt that plague and penury. So eaſily might men get their living if that ſame worthy Princeſſe Lady money did not alone

ſtoppe vp the way betweene vs and our living, which a Gods name was very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently deviſed and invented, that by her the way thereto ſhould be opened. I am ſure the rich men perceive this, nor they be not ignorant how much better it were to lacke no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thing, then to abound with overmuch ſuperfluity: to be rid out of innumerable cares and troubles, then to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and encombred with great riches.</p>

I am glad yet that it chanced to the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> which have followed thoſe inſtitutions of life, whereby they have laid ſuch foundations of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as ſhall continue and laſt not onely wealthy, but alſo as farre as mans wit may judge and conjecture, ſhall endure for ever. For ſeeing the chiefe cauſes of Ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſedition, with other vices, be plucked vp by the roots, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned at home there, can be no jeopardy of domeſticall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, which alone hath caſt underfoot and brought to naught the wel-fortified and ſtrongly defenced wealth and riches of many Cities. But for as much as perfect concord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, and wholſome lawes be executed at home, the envie of all forreigne Princes be not able to ſhake or moove the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, though they have many times long agoe gone about to

               <p>Thus when RAPHAEL had made an end of his tale, though many things came to my mind, which in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and lawes of that people, ſeemed to be inſtituted and founded of no good reaſon, but onely in the faſhion of their chiualry, and in their Sacrifices, and Religions, and in other of their Lawes; but alſo, yea and chiefly, in that which is the principall foundation of all their ordinances: that is to ſay, in the communalty of their life and living, without any occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying of money, by the which thing onely all nobility, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience, worſhip, honour, and majeſty, the true ornaments and honours, as the common opinion is, of a Common-wealth, vtterly be overthrowne and deſtroyed: yet becauſe I knew that he was weary of talking, and was not
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:13209:152"/>
ſure whether he could abide that any thing ſhould be ſaid againſt his mind: ſpecially remembring that he had reprehended this fault in other, which be affraid leaſt they ſhould ſeeme not to be wiſe enough, unleſſe they could find ſome fault in other mens inventions: therefore I praiſing both their inſtitutions and his communication, tooke him by the hand, and lead him into ſupper, ſaying that we would chooſe another time to weigh and examine the ſame matters, and to talke with him more at large therein. Which would GOD it might once come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, as I cannot agree and conſent to all things that he ſaid, being elſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt a man ſingularly well learned, and alſo in all wordly matter exactly and profoundly experienced: ſo muſt I needs confeſſe and grant, that many
