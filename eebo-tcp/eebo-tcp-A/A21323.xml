            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>An <hi>Injury</hi> is a voluntary offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of another man contrary to the Law.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:323:22"/>The causes of <hi>Voluntary</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Intemperance, and a Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposition concerning things Disirable.

                  <p>All Actions proceed either from the Doers disposition, or not.</p>

                  <p>With <hi>Indignation</hi> there is alwayes joyned a joy for the prosperity of a man worthy, as <hi>Pitty</hi> is alwayes with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the adversitie of them, that deserve it.</p>
                  <p>In wicked men the opposite of <hi>Pitty</hi> is</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>And for newly gotten power &amp; riches, rather than for antient, and especially if by these he has gotten other goods, as by Riches, Command. The reason why we conceive greater <hi>Indignation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst new then antient Riches, is, that the former seeme to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse that which is none of theirs, but the antient seeme to have but their owne. For with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, to have beene so long, is to be so by Right.</p>
                  <p>And for the bestowing of goods incongruously: as when the armes of the most valiant <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> were bestowed upon the most eloquent <hi>Vlysses.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Example</hi> is either an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample properly so called (as some Action past:) or a <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> (which also is called a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:) or a <hi>Fable</hi> (which containes some Action fained.)</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Example</hi> properly so called is this, <hi>Darius came not into</hi> Greece, <hi>till he had first subdued</hi> AEgypt.

                  <p>A <hi>Similitude,</hi> or <hi>Parable,</hi> is such as followeth. <hi>They who choose their Magistrates by Lot, are like them that choose for their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions those on whom the Lot shall fall, rather then those,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:323:64"/>
who have the greatest strength; and for their Pilot, not him that hath skill; but him whose name is drawne out of the Vrne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fable</hi> is in this manner. <hi>The Horse desiring to drive out the Stagge from their common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, tooke a man to assist him; and having received into his mouth a bridle, and a rider upon his backe, obtained his intent, but became subject to the Man.

                  </p>
                  <p>To finde out <hi>Examples,</hi> that is, Actions done that may serve our purpose, is therefore hard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

not in our power.</p>
                  <p>But to find <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi> is easier; because by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing in <hi>Philosophy</hi> a man may faine somewhat in nature like to the case in hand.</p>

                  <p>THe first, that <hi>Amplification</hi> and <hi>Extenuation</hi> are not <hi>Common Places,</hi> appeares by this, that <hi>Amplification,</hi> and <hi>Extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> doe prove a fact to be <hi>great,</hi> or <hi>little</hi>; and are therefore <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymemes,</hi> to be drawne from <hi>Common Places</hi>; and therefore are not the <hi>Places</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>The second, that <hi>Enthymemes,</hi> by which Arguments are answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are of the same kind with those, by which the matter in

question is proved, is manifest by this, that these inferre the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, of what was proved by the other.</p>
                  <p>The third, that an <hi>Objection</hi> is no <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> is apparent by this, that an <hi>Objection</hi> is no more, but an <hi>Opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Stage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Tragaedians</hi> were the first that invented such <hi>Action,</hi> and that but of late; and it consisteth in governing well the <hi>Magnitude, Tone,</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of the <hi>Voice</hi>; a thing lesse subject to <hi>Art,</hi> then is either <hi>Proofe,</hi> or <hi>Elocution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet there have beene Rules delivered concerning it, as farre forth as serves for <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Oratoricall Action</hi> has not beene hitherto reduced to <hi>Art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Orators</hi> in the beginning, when they saw that the <hi>Poets</hi> in barren and fayned Arguments, neverthelesse attained great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; supposing it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the choice, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of words, fell into a Stile, by imitation of them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to Verse, and made choice of words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:323:79"/>But when the <hi>Poets</hi> changed their Stile, and laid by all words that were not in common use, the <hi>Orators</hi> did the same, and lighted at last upon words, and a government of the Voice and Measure proper to themselves.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore <hi>Pronuntiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> are in some degree necessary also for an <hi>Orator,</hi> the Precepts thereof are to bee fetcht from the <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[In the meane time this may be one generall Rule. If the <hi>Words, Tone, Greatnesse</hi> of the Voice, <hi>Gesture</hi> of the body and Countenance, seeme to proceede all from one Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then 'tis well pronounced: Otherwise not.</p>
                  <p>For when there appeare more passions then one at once, the minde of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker appeares unnaturall and distracted. Otherwise, as the

                  <p>THe vertues of a <hi>Word</hi> are two; the first, that it be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous</hi>; the second, that it be <hi>decent</hi>; that is, neither <hi>above,</hi> nor <hi>below</hi> the thing signified; or neither too humble, nor too fine.</p>

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The reason why <hi>borrowed Words</hi> please is this. Men are

affected with <hi>Words,</hi> as they are with <hi>Men,</hi> admiring in both that which is <hi>forraigne</hi> and <hi>new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make a <hi>Poeme</hi> gracefull, many things helpe; but few an <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For to a <hi>Poet</hi> it sufficeth with what <hi>Words</hi> he can, to set out his <hi>Poeme</hi>: but an <hi>Orator</hi> must not onely doe that; but also seeme not to doe it: for else hee will be thought to speake unnaturally, and not as he thinkes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be the lesse beleeved; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Beleefe</hi> is the scope of his <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Words</hi> that an <hi>Orator</hi> ought to use are of three sorts. <hi>Proper</hi>; Such as are <hi>Received,</hi> and <hi>Metaphors.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. 8. Of two sorts of <hi>Stiles.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere be two sorts of <hi>Stiles.</hi> The one <hi>continued</hi> or to bee <hi>comprehended at once</hi>; the other <hi>divided,</hi> or <hi>distinguished</hi> by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.</p>
                  <p>The first sort was in use with ancient Writers; but is now out of date.</p>
                  <p>An example of this <hi>Stile</hi> is in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:323:86"/>
the History of <hi>Herodotus</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no Period till the end of the whole History.</p>
                  <p>In the other kind of <hi>Stile,</hi> that is distinguished by Periods, a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod</hi> is such a Part as is perfect in it selfe; and has such length, as may easily be comprehended by the understanding.</p>
                  <p>This latter kind is pleasant; the former unpleasant, because this appeares finite, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinite: in this the Hearer has alwayes somewhat set out, and terminated to him; in the other he foresees no end, and has nothing finished to him: this may easily be committed to memory, because of the measure and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (which is the cause that verses be easily remembred;) the other not.</p>
                  <p>Every sentence ought to end with the <hi>Period,</hi> and nothing to be interposed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:323:86"/>A <hi>Period</hi> is either <hi>simple,</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> into Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simple</hi> is that which is <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>; as, <hi>I wonder you feare not their ends, whose actions you imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Period divided,</hi> is that which not onely has perfection and length convenient for respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also <hi>Parts.</hi> As, <hi>I wonder you are not afraid of their ends, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you imitate their actions:</hi> where in these words, <hi>I wonder you are not afraid of their ends,</hi> is one <hi>Colon,</hi> or <hi>Part</hi>; and in these, <hi>Seeing you imitate their actions,</hi> another: and both together make the Period.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Members,</hi> and <hi>Periods</hi> of speech ought neither to be <hi>too long,</hi> nor <hi>too short.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Too long,</hi> are they, which are produced beyond the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Hearer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Too short,</hi> are they that end
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:323:87"/>
before hee expects it.</p>
                  <p>Those that be <hi>too long,</hi> leave the Hearer behind, like him that walking, goes beyond the usuall end of the walke, and thereby outgoes him that walkes with him.</p>
                  <p>They that be <hi>too short,</hi> make the Hearer stumble; for when he lookes farre before him, the end stoppes him before he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Period</hi> that is <hi>divided</hi> into <hi>Parts,</hi> is either <hi>divided only</hi>; or has also an <hi>opposition</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> one to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Divided onely</hi> is such as this; <hi>This the Senate knowes; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull sees; and yet the man lives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Period</hi> with <hi>opposition</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> called also <hi>Antithesis,</hi> and the parts <hi>Antitheta,</hi> is when <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Parts</hi> are put together; or also joyned by a third.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contrary parts</hi> are put together,

as here, <hi>The one has obtained glory, the other Riches; both by my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antitheta</hi> are therefore accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; because not onely the <hi>Parts</hi> appeare the better for the <hi>opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; but also for that they carry with them a certaine appearance of that kind of <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> which leades to <hi>impossibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of a <hi>Period</hi> are said to be <hi>equall,</hi> when they have altogether, or almost equall number of Syllables.</p>

                  <p>And therefore <hi>forraine Words</hi> are unpleasant, because <hi>Obscure</hi>; and <hi>Plaine Words,</hi> because <hi>too Manifest,</hi> making us learne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new: but <hi>Metaphors</hi> please; for they beget in us by the <hi>Genus</hi> or by some <hi>common thing</hi> to that with another, a kind of <hi>Science</hi>: as when an <hi>Old Man,</hi> is called <hi>Stubble</hi>; a man suddainely learnes

                  </p>
                  <p>Such <hi>Enthymemes</hi> are the most <hi>graceful</hi>; which neither are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently very Manifest, nor yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hard to be understood; but are comprehended, while they are uttering, or presently after, though not understood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <p>Of <hi>Antitheta,</hi> and <hi>Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> hath beene spoken in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Metaphors</hi> the most <hi>grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> is that which is drawne from <hi>Proportion.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:323:89"/>[<hi>Aristotle</hi> (in the 12.

                  <p>A Metaphor from Proportion is such as this, A <hi>State without Youth, is a Yeare without a Spring.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Animation</hi> is that expression which makes us seeme to see the thing before our eyes; as hee that said, <hi>The Athenians powred out their City into Sicily,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they sent thither the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Army they could make; and this is the greatest <hi>grace</hi> of an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>

the preparing of the way before one enter into it.</p>
                  <p>In some kinds of <hi>Orations</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles the <hi>Prelude</hi> of <hi>Musitians,</hi> who first Play what they list, and afterwards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In other kinds it resembles the <hi>Prologue</hi> of a <hi>Play,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proemes</hi> of the first sort, are most proper for <hi>Demonstrative Orations</hi>; in which a Man is free to foretell, or not, what Points he will insist upon; and for the most part 'tis better not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> because when a man has not obliged himselfe to a certaine matter, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression</hi> will seeme <hi>Variety</hi>: but if he have ingaged himselfe, <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> will be accounted <hi>Digression.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Demoustratives</hi> the matter of the <hi>Proeme</hi> consisteth in the <hi>Praise</hi> or <hi>Dispraise</hi> of some <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Custome,</hi> or in <hi>Exhortation,</hi> or
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:323:93"/>
                     <hi>Dehortation</hi>; or in something that serves to incline the Hearer to the purpose</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proemes</hi> of the second kind are most proper for <hi>Iudiciall Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For as the <hi>Prologue</hi> in a <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique,</hi> and the <hi>Exordium</hi> in an <hi>Epique</hi> Poeme, setteth first in few words the Argument of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme: so in a <hi>Iudiciall Oration,</hi> the <hi>Orator</hi> ought to exhibit a Modell of his <hi>Oration,</hi> that the mind of the Hearer may not bee suspended, and for want of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight erre or wander.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever else belongs to a <hi>Proeme,</hi> is drawne from one of these foure. From the <hi>Speaker.</hi> From the <hi>Adversary.</hi> From the <hi>Hearer,</hi> Or from the <hi>Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the <hi>speaker</hi> and <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> are drawne into <hi>Proemes</hi> such Criminations and Purgations as belong not to the cause.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Defendant</hi> 'tis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:323:94"/>
in the <hi>Proeme</hi> to answer to the accusations of his <hi>Adversary</hi>; that those being cleared, he may have a more favourable entrance to the rest of his <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to the <hi>Plaintife</hi> 'tis better to cast his Criminations all into the <hi>Epilogue,</hi> that the Iudge may the more easily remember them.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Hearer</hi> and from the <hi>Matter</hi> are drawne into the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme</hi> such things, as serve to make the <hi>Hearer</hi> favourable, or angry; attentive, or not attentive, as neede shall require.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Hearers</hi> use to bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to <hi>Persons</hi> that are reputed <hi>good</hi>; to <hi>things</hi> that are of <hi>great Consequence,</hi> or that <hi>concerne themselves,</hi> or that are <hi>strange,</hi> or that <hi>delight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to make the <hi>Hearer</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is not the part of the <hi>Proeme</hi> onely, but of any other part of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:323:94"/>
the <hi>Oration,</hi> &amp; rather of any other Part, then of the <hi>Proeme.</hi> For the <hi>Hearer</hi> is every where more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse then in the beginning. And therefore wheresoever there is neede, the <hi>Orator</hi> must make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare both the <hi>probitie</hi> of his owne <hi>person,</hi> and that the <hi>matter</hi> in hand is of <hi>great consequence</hi>; or that it <hi>concernes the Hearer</hi>; or that it is <hi>new</hi>; or that it is <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that will have the <hi>Hearer</hi> attentive to <hi>Him,</hi> but not to the <hi>Cause,</hi> must on the other side make it seeme that the <hi>matter</hi> is a <hi>trifle,</hi> without <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>Hearer, common,</hi> and <hi>tedious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Hearer</hi> may bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the <hi>Speaker,</hi> one of two things is required; that he <hi>love</hi> him, or that he <hi>pitty</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Demonstrative Orations,</hi> hee that <hi>Praises,</hi> shall have the <hi>Hearer</hi> favourable, if he thinke himselfe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:323:95"/>
or his owne manners, or course of life, or any thing hee loves, comprehended in the same <hi>Praise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, he that <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praises,</hi> shall be heard favourably, if the <hi>Hearer</hi> find his <hi>enemies,</hi> or <hi>their courses,</hi> or any thing he <hi>hates</hi> involv'd in the same <hi>dispraise.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Narration</hi> is not alwaies continued and of one Peece; but sometimes, as in <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> interrupted, and dispersed through the whole <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there being in an a <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> something that fals not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Art; as namely the Actions themselves, which the <hi>Orator</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth not; hee must therefore
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:323:97"/>
bring in the <hi>Narration</hi> of them, where he best may. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If being to praise a Man, you would make a <hi>Narration</hi> of all his Acts immediately from the beginning, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, you will finde it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary afterwards to repeate the same Acts againe, while from some of them you praise his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and from others his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; whereby your <hi>Oration</hi> shall have lesse variety, and shall lesse please.</p>
                  <p>Tis not necessary alwaies that the <hi>Narration</hi> be short. The true <hi>measure</hi> of it must be taken from the <hi>matter</hi> that is to be laid open.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Narration,</hi> as oft as may be, tis good to insert somewhat commendable in ones selfe, and blameable in ones Adversary: As I <hi>advised him, but hee would take no Counsell.</hi>

                     <hi>PRoofes</hi> are to be applied to some thing Controverted.</p>
                  <p>The Controversie in <hi>Iudiciall Orations</hi> is, <hi>Whether it has beene done; whether it has beene Hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; whether the matter be so great, and whether it be lust, or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a question of <hi>Fact,</hi> one of the Parties of necessity is faulty (for ignorance of the <hi>Fact</hi> is no excuse) and therefore the <hi>Fact</hi> is chiefely to be insisted on.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Demonstratives</hi> the <hi>Fact</hi> for the most part is supposed: but the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> of the <hi>Fact</hi> are to be <hi>Proved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Deliberatives</hi> the question is, Whether the thing be <hi>like to be, or likely to be so Great</hi>; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Iust</hi>; or whether it be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:323:112"/>
                     <hi>Profitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the application of the <hi>Proofes</hi> to the question, a man ought to observe, whether his Adversary have lyed in any point without the Cause. For tis a figne hee does the same in the Cause.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proofes</hi> themselves are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Examples</hi> or <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Deliberative Oration,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause tis of things to come, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rather <hi>Examples</hi> then <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a <hi>Iudiciall Orations,</hi> being of things past, which have a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity in them, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>Syllogistically,</hi> requireth rather <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Enthymemes</hi> ought not to come too thicke together: for they hinder one anothers force by confounding the Hearer.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought a man endeavour to <hi>porove</hi> every thing by <hi>Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:323:112"/>
lest like some <hi>Philosophers,</hi> he collect what is <hi>knowne,</hi> from what is <hi>lesse knowne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor ought a man to use <hi>Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memes</hi> when he would move the Hearer to some affection: for seeing divers motions doe mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally destroy or weaken one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will lose either the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymeme,</hi> or the <hi>affection</hi> that he would move.</p>
                  <p>For the same reason, a man ought not to vse <hi>Enthymemes</hi> when he would expresse <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether he would move <hi>affection,</hi> or insinuate his <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> he may with all use <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Deliberative Oration</hi> is more difficult then a <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> because tis of the <hi>future,</hi> whereas a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall</hi> is of that which is <hi>past,</hi> and that consequently may bee knowne; and because it has <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>

namely <hi>the Law</hi>; and it is easier to <hi>prove</hi> from <hi>Principles,</hi> then without.</p>
                  <p>Beesids, a <hi>Deliberative Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> wants those helpes of <hi>turning to the Adversary</hi>; of <hi>speaking of himselfe</hi>; of <hi>raising Passion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He therefore that wants mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a <hi>Deliberative Oration,</hi> let him bring in some <hi>Person</hi> to <hi>praise,</hi> or <hi>dispraise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in <hi>Demonstratives</hi> he that has nothing to say in <hi>commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>discommendation</hi> of the <hi>principall Party,</hi> let him <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise</hi> somebody else, as his <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>kinsman,</hi> or the very <hi>vertues</hi> or <hi>vices</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>He that wants not <hi>Proofes,</hi> let him not only <hi>proove</hi> strongly, but also insinuate his <hi>Manners</hi>: but he that has no <hi>Proofe,</hi> let him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse insinuate his <hi>manners.</hi> For a <hi>good man</hi> is as acceptable, as an exact <hi>Oration.</hi>

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:323:113"/>Of <hi>Proofes,</hi> those that <hi>lead to an absurdity</hi> please better then those that are <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>Ostensive</hi>; because from the comparison of Contraries, namely <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falsity,</hi> the force of the <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme</hi> does the better appeare.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>And he that speakes first, puts it after his owne <hi>Proofes,</hi> unlesse the Controversy containe many and different matters. And hee that speakes last puts it before.</p>
                  <p>For tis necessary to make way for his owne <hi>Oration,</hi> by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Objections of him that spake before. For the mind ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres both a <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that is damned before hand.</p>
                  <p>If a man desire his <hi>Manners</hi> should appeare well, (lest spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of himselfe he become odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or troublesome, or obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to obtrectation; or speaking

of another, he seeme contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or Scurrilous) let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce another Person.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, lest hee cloy his Hearer with <hi>Enthymemes,</hi> let him vary them sometimes with <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi>; but such as have the same force.
