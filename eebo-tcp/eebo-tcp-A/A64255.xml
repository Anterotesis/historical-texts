            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Necessary Questions &amp; Conclusions

for the Good of their own and the Peoples
Souls that are under them; for the
Lord is arisen to call all things
into Judgment.</head>
            <p>1. WHether any can be said to be true Gospel.
Ministers, who are not sent of Christ, as
Christ was sent of the Father, seeing Christ said, <hi>As
my Father hath sent me, even so send 1 you; for all Power is
given me in Heaven and Earth?</hi> Joh. 20. 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. 18.
Mat. 28. 18.</p>
            <p>2. Whether any can be justly blamed for not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or upholding such as are not thus sent of Christ,
seeing Christ said, <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
they will not follow, for they know not the Voice of a
Stranger,</hi> Joh. 10. 1 Joh. 4.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50674:3"/>
3. Whether it be not the greatest Presumption for
any, upon what Pretence soever, to take upon them
to be Embassadors for Christ (the great King) who
were never authorized or commissionated thereto by
Christ, as aforesaid, it being his proper Right to send
forth his own Labourers?</p>
            <p>4. Whether any who are not thus sent of Christ,
as Christ was sent of the Father, can profit the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at all, though they have never so much Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from Man, or be furnished with never so much O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory,
or Wisdom of Words, or Excellency of
Speech, according to Man, seeing the Scripture te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,
<hi>The World by Wisdom knew not God?</hi> 1 Cor. 1.</p>
            <p>And if any should say, <hi>How was Christ sent, or can
any be sent now as Christ was sent?</hi> I answer, Christ
was sent in the Wisdom, Power and Spirit of the
endless Love and Life of the Father, to preach the
Kingdom of God, and the everlasting Gospel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as it's said, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, for he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the
poor, &amp;c.</hi> and so were the true Ministers formerly sent
of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> the last 49. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.
28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6. And as in all
former Ages all the true Messengers and Ministers of
God and Christ were sent in the VVisdom, Power
and Spirit of God and Christ, and thereby directed
and guided in their Work, both when, to whom and
what to speak, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;c. Ex.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>&amp;c. Ames</hi> 7.
14. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 26, 27, 29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.
12, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 7, 8. Even so are Christ's true Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
and Ministers sent now, and alwayes must be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50674:3"/>
because without Christ they can do nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5.
and because no Man knows the Things of God,
but the Spirit of God; and therefore without that
Spirit it must needs be impossible for any, either
rightly to know or minister the Things of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. &amp;c. and so saith Christ, <hi>I am with you</hi> (not
some, but all my Servants) <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20, 21, 22. (not
for a time only, but alwayes) <hi>even to the End of the
World,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. And therefore faith the Apostle,
<hi>How can they preach, except they be sent</hi> (to wit, as
Christ was, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as is plain by the Apostle's
applying that in general to Christ's Ministers, which
the Prophet speaks in the singular number of Christ,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. compared with <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 7. Again, Christ
was sanctified and sent, so are also his Messengers and
Ministers sanctified, &amp; sent as Lambs among Wolves,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 16, 17, 18, 19. &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 7, 8. Let no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
man here shelter himself under <hi>Judas,</hi> who
was only for the turn of fulfilling the Scripture num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
amongst the twelve, but not at all for a Pattern
of true Gospel-Ministers. Again, Christ came not
to do his own Will, but the Will of him that sent
him; and so it is with every one that Christ sends,
and who abide in his Doctrine; and as Christ endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Contradiction of Sinners against himself with
all Patience, even so do all he sends, and who abide
in his Doctrine, not avenging themselves, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
their Cause to God, who is the Avenger of
all Wrongs done to his Servants: Also seeing Christ
said, <hi>The Tree is known by its Fruits,</hi> and by their Fruits
ye may know such as come to you in Sheeps Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50674:4"/>
but are inwardly ravening VVolves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15.
Therefore is is further asked of you,</p>
            <p>1. VVhether such as love to be called of men <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
which Christ forbad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 10, 11, 12. or
seek and affect other Titles of worldly Honour, and
to be great, and to exercise Lordship in the Earth, like
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> do not plainly manifest themselves to be
such as Christ is not with, seeing he said to his, <hi>It shall
not be so amongst you,</hi> Mark 10. 24. &amp;c. <hi>And how can
they believe</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>who receive Honour one of
another, and seek not that Honour which comes from God,
only?</hi> Joh. 5. 44.</p>
            <p>2. Whether such as make Merchandize of their
Words, even selling them as it were for Money, by
agreeing with the People for so much a Year, to settle
at a Place for preaching &amp;c. and yet will not settle
at a Place as Teachers, but where they know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
so much Hire or certain yearly Maintenance
provided for them, seconded with the worldly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to compel People to pay it them, or by Force to
take it from them, whether they will or no? I say,
is not this a manifest Token that such Ministers are
not sent of Christ, seeing he said to his, <hi>Freely ye have
received, freely give;</hi> and the Apostle said, <hi>We seek not
yours, but you?</hi> but if you say, the same Apostle also
said, <hi>If we have ministred to you spiritual Things, is it
a great Matter if we partake of your carnal Things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The I query (to let pass the Question here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
what you minister, whether it is spiritual or
carnal) whether ever the Apostle or any true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of God and Christ, either under the Law or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50674:4"/>
did ever use any other Means for that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them of God, but the Power of the VVord
only? Or did ever the Apostle, or any Minister of
Christ receive, much less compel by worldly Force,
any Maintenance for preaching from such as denyed
them to be true Ministers? And so such now as not
only compel Wages from their own Hearers, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from such as they do no Work for, do plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by their Fruits that they have run, &amp; God never
sent them, and are so far from being Successors of the
Apostles in their spiritual and heavenly Ministry, as
that they merit to be accounted of the Kind or old <hi>Eli</hi>'s
Sons, who by their Doings caused the Offerings of
the Lord to be abhorred, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 from ver. 12. to 18.</p>
            <p>4. Whether such as cannot content themselves
with the In-comes of one Parish, though it be sixty,
eighty or one Hundred Pounds a Year, but seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one or more Parishes or Places of Revenue besides,
are not out of Measure covetous, and so palpably out
of the Doctrine of Christ, and so Idolaters, seeing the
Apostle saith, <hi>Covetousness is Idolatry?</hi> Ephes. 5. 5.</p>
            <p>5. Whether did ever any Minister of Christ's send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preach up the Tenth of Peoples of Labour, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the Earth and earthly things, as a standing
Gospel-maintenance for his Ministers, seeing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
VVritings are wholely silent in the thing? And
now if any of you in your high Minds think much or
strange to be question'd concerning these things,
such may know that these are the latter Dayes,
spoken of by <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 23. 20, 21. wherein God
hath done and is doing great things for his People;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50674:5"/>
               <hi>And in the latter Dayes</hi> (saith the Prophet there) <hi>you
shall consider perfectly of the pouring forth of God's Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Indignation upon the false Prophets and Teachers, who
have run, and God never sent them,</hi> as also throughout
that whole 23d Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is to be seen:
also concerning the false Prophets and Teachers you
may read <hi>John</hi> 10. 1. <hi>&amp;c. Isa.</hi> 56. 9. <hi>&amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 34. 1. <hi>Mic</hi> 3.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. with divers other Scriptures, which speak of
the false Prophets and Teachers, also of the true ones;
from all which these few (amongst many plain &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Conclusions) following may be gathered, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The true Prophet, Messenger or Teacher is sent
of God (as before) in the Power and Spirit of God,
with the living VVord of God, which is as a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and a Fire, to break the hard Hearts in sunder,
and to burn up the Chaff and Dros in the Minds of
disobedient People, who know God's VVill, but do
it not, but hold the Truth in Unrighteousness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The false Prophet or Teacher,</hi> he runs in his own Will,
&amp; having stoll'n the Word from his Neighbour, useth his
Tongue to say, the Lord saith, when the Lord never sent him,
&amp; so with good Words &amp; fair Speeches deceives the Hearts
of the unwary Hearers, making glad the Hearts of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
&amp; crying Peace, when the Lord hath not spoken it.</p>
            <p>2. The true Prophet, Teacher or Minister, as he hath
received freely, so he ministers freely; but the false
Teacher, as he runs in his own VVill, so he ministers
for a Self-End, and if <hi>People put into his Month, he cryes
Peace but if otherwise, he prepares War against them, &amp; out
of his corrupt Heart cryes, Give, &amp; can never have enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The true Minister hath a Mouth alwayes open
for God, and against Sin and Evil in every Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it, without Respect of Persons, and like a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50674:5"/>
true Watcher gives notice of the Wolf's Approach,
and doth not flee when the Wolf comes, but opposes
him in the Loss of all, because Christ's Sheep are
dear to him: But the Hireling fleeth, because
he is a Hireling, and careth not for the Sheep; and
as concerning Sin, it may live in People forever for
him, for he cannot bark against Sin, he is so full of it
himself; for how can he that is an unclean, covetous,
proud Person himself (with a Face) stand against
such Sins in others; nay, nay, the barking of such
must needs be against such as do from the Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from Iniquity, and so separate from such as live
in it, according to the Call of the Lord.</p>
            <p>4. The true Prophet, Minister or Teacher fights
the good Fight of Faith, and his Weapons are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and not carnal, and so he fights not with Flesh
and Blood, to destroy Mens Persons, Liberties or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
but his War is with the wicked Devil (the
Power of Darkness in men) that separates mens
minds, Hearts and Souls from God, and brings them
into Sin's Captivity, and so under God's Wrath; and
so the true Minister's Work is to preach People out of
that woful Condition into the Liberty of the Sons of
God: But the false Teacher or Minister hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Weapons
are carnal, and he runs to the worldly Powers to
help him against such as oppose his evil Doctrine and
Practice, crying, <hi>Men of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. help;</hi> as the
<hi>Jews</hi> cryed out against <hi>Paul, Men of</hi> Israel <hi>help,</hi> and
so matter not though they weary the Magistrate, and
set all the World in an Uproar, to keep themselves
up in their high Places of Deceit, and so prove the
greatest Enemies against God's Truth and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of all other, as is abundantly to be seen in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50674:6"/>
concerning the Priests and their Confederates,
who persecuted Christ to Death, and raged against
his Followers, because of their holy Testimony for
God against their Soul-destroying Wayes.</p>
            <p>5. The true Messengers and Ministers of Jesus
Christ, as they are powerfully sent of God, so they
work effectually for God, for the edifying of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ, and perfecting of his People in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God: But the false Teacher, as he hath run
without God, so his Work is for strengthning that
Part in man (to wit, the Serpents Wisdom) which
is against God, and wars against the Simplicity of
Christ and Good of the Soul in all; and so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves out of that heavenly Power which
perfects the Soul to God, and gives it perfect Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over all Sin, they cry, <hi>No Perfection here, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Victory over Sin on this Side the Grave; and so they
lead about a People laden with Sin and Lust filly, as Woman
in the Transgression, ever learning, and never able by
their Means to come to the Knowledge of the Truth it self,
which sets the Soul free from all Sin;</hi> for how should
People ever come to the Knowledge of the Truth by
following such Teachers as are out of the Truth; <hi>for
if the Blind lead the Blind, must they not both fall into the
Ditch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also seeing you profess the Scripture, and not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
Traditions</hi> to be your Rule, and would have
people to believe, <hi>that what you do is according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
therefore it s demanded in a few Words further,</p>
            <p>1. What Scripture have you for your <hi>Sprinkling of
Infants,</hi> and <hi>Signing them with the Sign of the Cross,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50674:6"/>
and telling people, <hi>That thereby they are made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, Children of God, and Inheritors of the
Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> when in your own <hi>Catechism,</hi> in
Contradiction to your practice you teach, <hi>That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by Reason of their Infancy or tender Years then cannot
perform the Requests of Baptism, to wit, Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And what Scripture have you for your Sureties
(so called) which you most unscripturally call the
Childrens <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers,</hi> which you
pretend to make up the Defect in the Infants, by and
for putting these Pretended Sureties upon such bold
Undertakings and unadvised Promisings of that for
the Child which they never yet did for themselves,
nor indeed have Faith to believe that so great Works
can be done in any upon Earth, to wit, <hi>to forsake the
Devil and all his Works, &amp;c.</hi> seeing that such generally
hold, <hi>That none can live without Sin;</hi> Is not Sin the
Devil's Work? yea, yea; and is there any Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
for man to God-ward, but Christ? and was there
ever any Surety betwixt God and Man, but Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who saith, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing?</hi> so then
this evil Custom of your undertaking being deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to the Honour of Christ, who can say that God
hath required it at your Hands? but if you will yet
plead for it, shew us your Scripture for it, if you
would be esteemed to act as <hi>Protestants,</hi> and not as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
and to own Scripture above mens Inventions and
Traditions.</p>
            <p>3. Also what Scripture have you for your <hi>Surplice,
Canonical Coats, Typpets, &amp;c.</hi> and for wearing <hi>Black</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50674:7"/>
rather then other Colours, seeing the Apostle blamed
such as placed Religion in <hi>Dayes, Meats, and the like;</hi>
surely he would not agre with such as place their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in Garments and Colours; blessed be the Lord
whose Day is dawned, which makes all things mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
and none will hate the Light of it but Evil-doers.</p>
            <p>4. And what Scripture have you for your <hi>Tythes,
Easter-reckonings, Mortuaries,</hi> and the like, now under
the Gospel, and for your Laws, which you call spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
to compel the People to pay you them, seeing
Christ is come, the End of that Levitical Priesthood,
under which Tythes were payable by a Law?</p>
            <p>5. What Scripture have you, who profess your
selves to be <hi>Cbristians</hi> for your <hi>Swearing,</hi> swearing in
your Courts, (so called) swearing in your <hi>Spiritual
Courts,</hi> (so called)? the poor people called <hi>Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
groan under the Burden of this evil Custom;
O this is far from following Christ, who said and
saith unto his, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> but you are grown to
that pass, that you cannot trust one another without
Swearing, no not in your Church-matters; is not
this a Fruit of Apostacy, and departing from that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Faith which was once delivered to the Saints?</p>
            <p>6. And what Scripture have you forgiving <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Prayers, Prophecyings, Roarings, Quakings,
Tremblings and Confessions in <hi>Rhyme</hi> and <hi>Meeter</hi> to
the VVorld to sing, who are of another Spirit then
<hi>David</hi> was, and so utterly unacquainted with <hi>David</hi>'s
Conditions; and so instead of singing with the Spirit
and Understanding, as the ancient <hi>Christians</hi> did, you
sing in a Form without the Power, thereby not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50674:7"/>
but rather dishonouring the Lord, who is,
a Spirit, and will be worshipped in Spirit and Truth?</p>
            <p>7. And what Scripture have you for teaching Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to worship one another, and for your <hi>Ring</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
where you teach them to say (<hi>With this Ring I
theewed, and with my Body I thee worship</hi>) Is not God
alone to be worshipped? how then are such to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Christian Ministers, who abide not in his
Doctrine? 2 <hi>John</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>And lastly seeing you pretend to be Christ's Ministers, and
so God's Free men, I ask you these few plain Questions fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Why do you limit your selves, or suffer others to limit
you to such and such Forms of Words, and Gestures, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
as is in Use amongst you in all your Services? is it from
any Excellency you see in those Words or Forms more then in
any other? or is it because you are so weak of Judgment, or
brittle of Memory, as that you can do little without Book? or
is it not rather for filthy Lucre sake you are willing to be so ty'd,
because you know that without Conformity to the Wills of the
great Ones in this Matter, you can get no Power to compel
Peoples earthly things from them? O what will not the Love
of Money compel covetous minded People unto! 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.
10, 11.</p>
            <p>2. What is it that makes you go to the Bishop, rather then
any other Man or Men for Ordination? (as you call it) Is it
because you know or believe that he is more holy then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
or hath more Power to confer any spiritual Gift upon you
by Imposition of his Hands more then any other? If you say,
he hath, where had he it? and wherein doth it appear? or is
it not rather that you go now to the Bishop for Ordination, as
you or your Brethren went formerly to the <hi>Classical Presbytery</hi>
(so called) in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time, because this is the Way now, as the
other was formerly, to impower you to come into Parishes, &amp; be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50674:8"/>
their Teachers, and command their earthly things from them
by Force, whether you do any spiritual Work for them or no?
yea, from such as in the Lord's Light see you to be no Ministers
of the Spirit, and therefore not able to minister spiritual things
and therefore deny you: Oh that ever such a thing should be
among such as profess to be Gospel Ministers.</p>
            <p>3. Whether do you believe that all things in the Church
ought to be done and spoken in the alone Power and Spirit of
the Lord Jesus? and if so, then how can you expect but that
<hi>God will overturn, overturn all Things, until he (to wit, the
Lord Jesus Christ, to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth it
given) comes to rule in alland over all, to whom of Right it belongs:</hi>
So be it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what is the Cause that you are so dark in your Minds, as
concerning the Mystery of Christ's Kingdom, and the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
saving Power thereof, if it be not that mentioned in the third.
Chapter of</hi> Micah<hi>'s Prophecy, verse,</hi> 5, 6, 7. <hi>where it is written,</hi>
Thus saith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my People
err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace, and he that putteth
not into their Mouthes, they even prepare War against him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Night shall be unto you, that you shall not have a Vision, and
it shall be dark unto you, that you shall not divine, and the Sun
shall go down over the Prophets, and the Day shall be dark over
them; then shall the Seer she ashamed, and the Diviners be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded;
yea, they shall all cover their Lips, for there is no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of God.</p>
            <p>So be not proud, for the Lord hath spoken, but see in the
Dread and Fear of God how you can acquit your selves from the
Charge against false Prophets and Teachers mentioned in this
Paper, and more abundantly in the Scriptures; <hi>for if you be
found in their Sins, how can ye escape their Plagues,</hi> Rev. 18. 4.
<hi>For Wo will be to them that seek deep to hide their Counsel from the
Lord, and their Works are in the dark, and they say, who seeth
us, and who knoweth us;</hi> see <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. from ver. 10. to ver. 16.
Read, and consider, and be wise for your Souls.</p>
