            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1063:4"/>
controlment either of ill tongues, or mine owne conscience: to which purpose I both framed a short preface personall, before I entered the discourse, which might essuier and rubbe out all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion fore stalled; and abstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all bitternesse agaynst the person and action of the late Earle, least thereby I should exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate mindes not resolued; and compared euery speach of his, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by me, both with his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Lords, whose witnesse therein I humbly request, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereunto; and with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he had with vs, let my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates be iudges, which might satisfie any but euen indifferently affected.

Other, with more virulence, though with lesse violence for penall charge, frame matter of hard iudgement out of the discourse it selfe; first generall, that I haue broken the Canon both of religion and law, in reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a penitents confession, which was with remorse, and priuate. The cases wherein a Confessor may publish what he heares, are too many for this short preface, the learned and iudicious knowe them, to the peeueshly affected, it is but lost labour to name them. First, his confession was not auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but in the audience of three or foure. Secondly the crimes he confessed were notorious by his conuiction, and vnder his hand by subscription. Thirdly they were repeated and diuulged not
<pb facs="tcp:1063:5"/>
               <hi>ad scandalum, nec animo damnifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> as the scholemen speake, to scandalize or annoy him, but to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them who desired resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to glorifie God whose spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite had wrought this conuersion; and, as <hi>Doctor Montford</hi> knowes, it was promised by me, in both our names, that we would, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on serued, giue publike and open testimonie of that his penitence and detestation of his offence. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in particular, because in one parte of my preface I said, <hi>I was not a penny the richer, nor a steppe the higher for him, albeit I celebrated his glory at the crosse, for Caliz vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>: therefore hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that I now spake of the spleane, and preach for rewardes. Malice marres logike and charitie both: this inference hath no cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:1063:6"/>
with my wordes, if eyther the precedentes were obserued, which I made in answere to a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous obloquy, <hi>That I was a time seruer</hi>; or the consequents, <hi>That I neuer moued him to preferre me, nor yet left to loue him, and honour him one iot the lesse for it.</hi> But this makes that speach of <hi>Seneca</hi> true, <hi>Nec dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt qui te,</hi>

Doctor Stanhop</hi> knowes, I vsed all the meanes I could to auoide it, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging both the shortnesse of the time, but three dayes full; my late beeing in that place, scarce two monethes before: my youth and
<pb facs="tcp:1063:6"/>
vnexperience in those state mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and such other delayes, till as he knoweth, it was inioyned by a commaundement peremptory: did I, after it, presse the court, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Earle, affect any aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by him? God knowes that I lye not, he neuer saw me, till, halfe yeere after his returne from <hi>Caliz,</hi> he sent for me, about a matter of difference, in some pointes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wright.</hi>
               </note> betweene a Popish priest &amp; my selfe, to take knowledge of me: at which time he promised me honourably, and, I thinke, if I had vsed his meanes, his promise had beene payment. Now then my argument holdes thus, if I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to obserue so great a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, so fauoured, so able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre me, so willing by promise to do it, I was no <hi>time seruer nor prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb facs="tcp:1063:7"/>
for rewardes,</hi> And thus agayne it may be enforced, if I was belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; by the auditory applauded for my celebration of that victory, the circumstances and substance whereof I could deliuer but onely vpon report and intelligence: much more in this case am I to be credited and approued, hauing so certaine grounds for my relation. But from what spirit these obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceede, may soone be ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedat; which, a disposition, eyther at the crosse or in this epistle, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly eloquent, knowing what I know, would liuely describe to be that of <hi>Babell</hi> in the prophet, <hi>stand apart come not neare me, for I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier then thou</hi>:<note place="margin">Esa. 65.5.</note> but as in my sermon, so here I renounce all tart &amp; soure speach: but it makes me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that excellent sentence of

               <hi>MY Lordes, and you my Christian Brethren, who are to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of this my iust punishment, I confesse to the glory of God, that I am a most wretched sinner, and that my sinnes are more in number then the hayres of my head, I confesse that I haue bestowed my youth in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, lust, and vncleannesse, that I haue bene puffed vp with pride, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and loue of this worlds pleasures. And that notwithstanding diuerse good motions inspired into me from the spirit of God, The good which I would, I haue not done, and the euill which I would not, that haue I done. For all which I humblie beseech my Sauiour Christ to be a Mediatour to the eternall Maiestie for my pardon: especially for this my last sinne, this</hi> great, <hi>this</hi> bloudy, <hi>this</hi> crying, <hi>this</hi> infectious <hi>sinne, whereby so many
<pb facs="tcp:1063:37"/>
haue for loue to me beene drawne to offend God, to offend their Soueraigne to offend the world; I beseech God to forgiue it vs, and to forgiue it me most wretched of all; I beseech her Maiestie and the state and ministers thereof to forgiue it vs; and I beseech God to send her maiesty a prosperous raigne and a long, if it be his will: O Lord grant her a wise and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heart: O Lorde blesse her and the Nobles, and the ministers of the church and state. And I beseech you and the worlde to hould a charitable opinion of me for my intention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her Maiestie, whose death, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test I neuer meant, nor violence to her person. I neuer was I thanke God A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thist, not beleeuing the worde and scriptures, neither Papist trusting in my owne merites.

merites of my Sauiour Christ Iesus. This faith was I brought vp in, and herein I am now ready to die. Beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you all, to ioyne your soules with me in praier, that my soule may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted vp by faith aboue all earthlie things in my praier, for now I will giue my selfe to my priuate praier: yet, for that I beseech you to ioyne with me, I will speake that you may heare me.</hi> And heere, as he turned himselfe aside to put of his gowne, Doctor <hi>Montford</hi> requested him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pray to God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue all his enemies if he had any.
