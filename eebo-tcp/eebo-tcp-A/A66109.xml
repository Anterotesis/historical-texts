            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In behalf of the

            <p>THIS <hi>Appeal</hi> which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
it self to Others
for their <hi>Judgment,</hi>
Sues, with all Humility, to Your
<hi>Grace</hi> for Your <hi>Protection;</hi> and
that such, as, I conceive, is neither
Unfit for me to <hi>Ask,</hi> nor for Your
<hi>Grace</hi> to Afford. You will here
see what that true <hi>Agreement</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="tcp:59355:3"/>
the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
which our <hi>Laws</hi> have <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd;</hi>
our <hi>Convocations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd</hi>
of; and our Greatest <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men</hi>
hitherto <hi>defended;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Censure of Any, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
Enemies of our <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Constitution.</hi> But now a New
Sort of <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> are risen
up from within our selves, who
seem to comply with the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> much upon
the same account that Others do
with that of the <hi>State;</hi> not out of
<hi>Conscience</hi> to their <hi>Duty,</hi> or any
<hi>Love</hi> they have for it; but because
it is the <hi>Establish'd Church,</hi>
and they cannot keep their <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
without it. They hate our
<hi>Constitution,</hi> and <hi>Revile</hi> all such
as <hi>stand up</hi> in Good Earnest for
it: but, for all that, they resolve
to hold fast to it; and go on still to
<hi>Subscribe,</hi> and <hi>Rail.</hi>

IN Opposition either to the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
or <hi>Designs</hi> of these Men, the
Present <hi>Appeal</hi> bespeaks Your
<hi>Grace's Protection,</hi> not so much
for <hi>its self,</hi> as for the <hi>Articles</hi>
and <hi>Canons</hi> of our <hi>Church;</hi>
and for those Excellent Worthies
who, in their several Successions,
have appear'd in Defence of the
<hi>King's Supremacy</hi> over the <hi>State
Ecclesiastical,</hi> as by <hi>Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,</hi>
and <hi>Establish'd.</hi> That
you will vouchsafe still to Continue
to Own a Cause, in which not only
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but the
<hi>Church Catholick,</hi> ever since the
<hi>Civil Powers</hi> have become <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
is concern'd together with
her: The <hi>Authority</hi> we plead for
in behalf of our <hi>Kings,</hi> being no
Other than what the most famous
<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> have given to their <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59355:4"/>
and who, by consequence,
must All be involved in the same
Censure with our <hi>Parliaments</hi> and
<hi>Convocations.</hi> And they who
now Revile the <hi>One,</hi> would as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Condemn the <hi>Other,</hi> but that
they are sensible that many who are
well content with the <hi>Reproach</hi> of
King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and his <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
would not endure to hear the
like Charges made against <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
and <hi>Theodosius;</hi> and those
<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> which all
<hi>Christians,</hi> in all Ages, have
been wont to pay so Great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to.</p>
            <p>THIS, My <hi>LORD,</hi> is
the <hi>Cause</hi> which I here bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Your <hi>Grace:</hi> In the <hi>Defence</hi>
whereof I have Once already been
engaged, and shall, with God's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
again appear; when those
<pb facs="tcp:59355:4"/>
who now talk with such Confidence
against my former <hi>Allegations,</hi>
shall give me Occasion to shew how
just they were, and how little, in
Reality, there is to be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. In the mean time, I
was willing, for the better Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of these <hi>New-Reformers;</hi>
by this short, preliminany <hi>Treatise,</hi>
to draw aside the Curtain, and let
the World see whose <hi>Off-spring</hi>
they are, and from whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
both their <hi>Principles,</hi> and
their <hi>Animosities,</hi> against Us. I
cannot but hope, that by this I shall
awaken all the Sincere <hi>Members</hi>
of <hi>our Church</hi> to beware of them;
and not give Countenance to such
Attempts, as under a shew of <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi>
Our <hi>Constitution,</hi> do in
Reality tend to the <hi>Utter Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Defence of the
<hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> in
Answer to the <hi>Letter
to a Convocation Man,</hi> I was not so
little acquainted with the Tempers
and Designs, of a certain <hi>Party</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, as not to know that my
Undertaking would be likely to
displease Those, who think any the
least <hi>Authority</hi> that is given to his
<hi>present Maiesty,</hi> to be an Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
either upon their <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Rights.</hi> Nor was I unsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
what might possibly be reply'd
to the <hi>Arguments</hi> which I brought
in Proof of it: The knowledge I had
of what the <hi>Papists</hi> were wont to
return to the like Allegations of our
<hi>Writers</hi> against <hi>them,</hi> having, in some
measure, inform'd me what, upon
this Occasion, might probably be
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:59355:6"/>
said in Answer to <hi>Me.</hi> But to find
my self charged, as if in defending
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> I had
betray'd the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Pref.</note>
and appear'd in such a Cause as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
became my <hi>Function,</hi> nor had
any of our <hi>Clergy</hi> ever before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
themselves withall; this, I
confess, was a perfect Surprise to me,
and abundantly Convinces me that
some Mens <hi>Resentments</hi> are as much
beyond Modesty, as they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reason.</p>
            <p>It cannot be unknown to any,
who is not an utter stranger to the
History of our <hi>Reformation,</hi> upon
what <hi>Principles</hi> it was undertaken,
and at last happily setled among us.
How the <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Authority</hi> was both
the Means by which it was carry'd
on, and the Ground on which we
justify'd our selves in the doing of it.
And, indeed, at the first, none but
the <hi>Papists,</hi> (that is to say those
who had engrossed this <hi>Power</hi> into
their own Hands, and could neither
endure to part with it, nor to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Use which they saw we
intended to make of it;) complain'd
of what we did, in restoring the
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:59355:6"/>
               <hi>Prince</hi> to his antient, and <hi>undoubted
Right;</hi> or pretended to enter any
Process against us, upon the Account
of it. It is true, some time after,
another Party, (how opposite soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the <hi>Papists</hi> in other Matters,
yet in this too nearly Approaching
to Them) began to set up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and to claim the same <hi>Power</hi>
in behalf of their <hi>Kirk,</hi> that the
<hi>Romanists</hi> had pretended to in Right
of their <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Both these our <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Clergy</hi> continued firm and costant;
and were, by all impartial Judges,
allow'd to be as much Superiour to
them Both in their <hi>Arguments,</hi> as
they were in the <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi>
which they maintained.</p>
            <p>Thus stood this Controversy till
our Own times: Insomuch that I
hardly know any <hi>Author,</hi> professing
himself a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> who has either cast any
Aspersion upon our <hi>first Reformers,</hi>
for restoring the <hi>Crown</hi> to its <hi>Antient
Jurisdiction;</hi> or pretended that the
<hi>Divine Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> were
in any wise violated, or infringed
by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:59355:7"/>
But it seems the Case is very much
altered now: And it is, of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
become an Encroachment, not
to be endured by our <hi>New-Church-Patriots,</hi>
for the <hi>King</hi> to pretend to
lay any <hi>Restraint</hi> upon their <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;</hi>
and an Enterprise unbecoming
a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>

               </note> tho' by more
than one Obligation engaged so to

            </p>
            <p>It is indeed very strange to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
after what manner a certain
<hi>Writer</hi> has of late deliver'd his Sense
as to both these;<note place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Pref. pag. 2.</note> and such as will

so absolute in Eccesiasticals. had he
not procured before the <hi>Submission
of the Clergy.</hi> Nor could he have
compassed <hi>That,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> but by the Terrour
of a <hi>Praemunire</hi> under which they
had fallen, and upon which he was
resolved to follow his Blow, and
so to bend, or break them. And
yet this <hi>Act</hi> of a <hi>Popish, Vnreform'd,</hi>
and will nigh <hi>Outlaw'd Convocation,</hi>
Extorted for fear of Ruin, and thro'
Ignorance, and Non-suspicion of
the Acts consequent upon it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judges
more against <hi>our Liberties,</hi>
than all <hi>Secular Constitutions</hi> could
possibly have done without it. And
must we <hi>Now</hi> consecrate all these
Procedures, the Results of which
we feel in the <hi>total Ruin of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Christian Piety,</hi>
by Our voluntary <hi>Pleas,</hi> and <hi>Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations:</hi>
And to gratifie the Civil
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:59355:8"/>
Powers to an <hi>Arbitrary Vtmost,</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the most Important Truths of
Principles and Histories; treat the
Synods of the Church with Spite and
Contumely; and Recommend the
greatest Slavery of her to the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
of Civil Powers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a severe Charge, and a
Man had need have a very Good
Cause, or a very Impregnable Face,
who treats <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,
Convocations</hi> and <hi>Clergymen</hi> after such
a Rate. For, when all is done, it
cannot be denied but that what that
<hi>Convocation</hi> did, and that <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Parliament Enacted,</hi> was, after two
intermediate Reigns, <hi>again Repeated</hi> in
the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> is at this
day <hi>Approv'd</hi> of by the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>King
James</hi> the First; and allow'd of in the
<hi>Nine and thirty Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi>
to which this <hi>Author</hi> himself has more
than once <hi>Subscribed.</hi> And methinks
the consideration of that, if nothing
else, might have induced him to have
been more temperate in his Charge
against me; who have defended no
Other <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>Prince,</hi> than
what both <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> and every Other
<hi>Clergy-man</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:59355:8"/>
have solemnly declared our <hi>Assent</hi> to,<note place="margin">39th. Can.</note>
and are obliged <hi>to our Power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">First Can.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> does not intend to
leave this <hi>Point</hi> so easily; his <hi>Zeal</hi>
carries him yet farther in Opposition
to the <hi>King's Supremacy.</hi> To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his fresh <hi>Invectives</hi> against
that <hi>King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 107.</note> and that <hi>Convocation,</hi> which
first began to assert the <hi>Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
against the Invasions which had
so notoriously been made upon it:
<hi>Pag.</hi> 110. He affirms the <q>Authority
of the Church in the <hi>Convention,
Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Synods,</hi> to be
of <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
               </q> This he again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
upon, <hi>pag.</hi> 115. and in the next
Page calls them <q>
                  <hi>Divine Privileges,
given by God, and granted to Priests,
for the Conduct and Conservation of the
Church.</hi>
               </q> And in the same <hi>Page,</hi>
speaking of the Prince's breaking in
upon these supposed Rights, he says;
<q>
                  <hi>Not only the Romish Church, but all
Other Sectaries, and the Scotch Kirk
illustriously scorn to admit any Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
notwithstanding not only Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Protection, but Promotion: being
sensible that a Liberty of Religion, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Church-Discipline, is
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:59355:9"/>
more valuable than all worldly Wealth,
or Interest; and without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
apprehend any Protection to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or the Societies that Profess it.</hi>
               </q>
From which last Words I suppose I
shall not injure his Sense if I infer;
that then, according to his Notion,
the <hi>Church of England</hi> is really at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in a <hi>Persecuted State,</hi> and has been
so ever since the <hi>Reformation:</hi> And
cannot be look'd upon so much as a
<hi>Protected Church,</hi> till this <hi>Act</hi> of the
<hi>Submission of the Clergy</hi> shall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.
A strange <hi>Reflection</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!
and very Unbecoming those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Blessings our <hi>Church</hi> has enjoy'd
under its <hi>Reformed Princes;</hi> and does
at this time Enjoy under her Glorious
<hi>Preserver:</hi> Whose greatest Crime I
am afraid it is, in some Mens Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he has delivered us from that
<hi>Slavery</hi> into which we were running,
tho' such as our new <hi>Disciplinarians</hi>
seem to think the only way to a <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must transcribe a great part of his
<hi>Book,</hi> should I here Repeat all that
this <hi>Author</hi> has said, in the most spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
manner that he knew how to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it, against all that plead for, or
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:59355:9"/>
speak well of, this part of the <hi>King's
Supremacy.</hi> See how he Harangues
his Brethren of the <hi>Clergy</hi> upon this
Occasion,<note place="margin">Comp. p. 155.</note> P. 119. <q>
                  <hi>We, we only,</hi>
               </q> says
he, <q>
                  <hi>are the Poor, Tame, Dis-spirited,
Drowsie Body; that are in love with
our Own Fetters: And this is the only
<hi>Scandalous Part</hi> of our <hi>Passive
Obedience;</hi> to be not only Silent, but
Content, with an Oc—n of our P—rs,
which are not forfeited, nor forfeitable
to any Worldly Powers whatsoever.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It might perhaps be here no Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Question, to ask, what this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
means by so Warm an Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Whole Body of the <hi>Clergy?</hi>
Whether he would have them take
Heart upon the Matter, and having
so Redoubted a <hi>Champion</hi> to lead them
on, like true <hi>Missionaries,</hi> see what
they can do to raise up a <hi>Croisade</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these wicked <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who
so unwarrantably Usurp upon the
<hi>Churches</hi> neither, <hi>forfeited</hi> nor <hi>forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
Powers?</hi> At least thus far, 'tis plain,
he has gone towards it, that as he has
before shewn the <hi>Church</hi> to be out of
the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> so he will
by and by declare the <hi>Prince</hi> to be out
of the <hi>Bosom</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and by
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:59355:10"/>
               <hi>Both,</hi> authentically qualified for a
<hi>Holy War</hi> to be made upon Him. For
thus he goes on; p. 122. <q>
                  <hi>Can a
Claim of an <hi>Oppressive Supremacy</hi>
be deem'd a Glorious Jewel in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Crown, which if exercised, must
of <hi>necessity forfeit the King's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi>
And is it not a dangerous
complaisance in Priests, to fan such
an Ambition, as must End in the Ruin
of the Church, the Priesthood, and the
<hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> which the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Powers Hierarchical, were
design'd to Convert, Direct, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But still it may be doubted how far
he accounts the</hi> King's Supremacy <hi>to
be</hi> Oppressive? <hi>That the whole</hi> Act <hi>of
the</hi> Submission of the Clergy <hi>to King</hi>
Henry <hi>the VIIIth falls under this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
we have already seen. In short,
all that he thinks fit to be allow'd to
the</hi> Christian Prince,<note place="margin">Pag. 123, 124.</note> 
               <hi>is this:</hi> 
               <q>That
the Church be obliged to acquaint him
with her Desires, Reasons, Places, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Necessaries of Convening:
To petition his Leave and Favour;
his Inspection, Assistance, and Succour
<hi>to the</hi> Piety of her Designs: <hi>To</hi> secure
him of her Fidelity to all his <hi>Proper</hi>
                  <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:59355:10"/>
Honours and Interests: <hi>That</hi> they will
keep within Ecclesiastical Concerns; and
do all things Openly, to the Glory of
God, <hi>and the</hi> Good <hi>of</hi> Souls, in the
Vnity, Order, and Purity of the
Church, preserved by the Rules of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
<hi>and</hi> Canonical Communion;
<hi>and this under the</hi> Guard <hi>and</hi> Watch
<hi>of</hi> Temporal Powers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but what if the <hi>Prince</hi> shall
not <hi>approve</hi> of the <hi>Reasons</hi> that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to Him, for their <hi>Assembling;</hi>
nor think either the <hi>Time</hi> Convenient,
or the <hi>Place</hi> Proper; and shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
refuse Them the <hi>Leave</hi> they <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>
for? What if He shall think
their <hi>Designs</hi> not to be so <hi>Pious</hi> as they
pretend, but rather to have a great
Allay of Humane <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi>
in them? What if He shall differ
with them in His Notion of what is
his <hi>Proper Honour</hi> and <hi>Interest?</hi>
May he in such a Case <hi>forbid</hi> them to
<hi>Meet?</hi> May he <hi>Assign</hi> them some O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place?</hi> Or <hi>Command</hi>
them not to meddle with such <hi>Causes,</hi>
or <hi>Persons,</hi> as he shall judge his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
or <hi>Interest,</hi> to be Concern'd in?</p>
            <p>What if what they call <hi>Ecclesiastical
Concerns</hi> should chance to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:59355:11"/>
upon <hi>Civil Affairs?</hi> And that
instead of <hi>Preserving,</hi> they shall Act
so as to <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi>
May he, by the <hi>Temporal Power</hi> which
is still left to Him, put a <hi>stop</hi> to their
<hi>Proceedings;</hi> or <hi>Annul</hi> their <hi>Acts;</hi> or
<hi>Receive</hi> and <hi>Appeal</hi> from their <hi>Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi>
On the contrary, He flatly tells
us,<note place="margin">Pag. 109.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That all the Power of Calling;
Moderating</hi> at, and <hi>Dissolving Synods;</hi>
of <hi>Confirming their Acts, or Suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Sentences;</hi> is <hi>Negative of
those Liberties</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> of the
<hi>Church, which she once claim'd as of
<hi>Divine Right;</hi>
                  </hi>
               </q> and of which He
before affirm'd, that they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>forfeited, <hi>nor</hi> forfeitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here then we have a plain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Judgment of this <hi>Author</hi>
in the <hi>Case</hi> before Us. I was willing, the
rather, to put it together in this Place,
that so by comparing it with what is
said in the following <hi>Collection,</hi> the
<hi>Reader</hi> may be the better enabled to
judge, who has acted more sincerely
upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
I, in Asserting the <hi>King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi>
as by <hi>Law Establish'd;</hi> or He,
in his violent, and impetuous Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of it. Or, if this shall not be
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:59355:11"/>
thought enough to convince those,
who have been dissatisfied with my
Undertaking, how close I have kept
to our <hi>Churches Doctrine;</hi> let me then,
for a final Proof, desire this <hi>Author,</hi>
in his next Attempt, to satisfie the
World in these (3) Points. <hi>1st.</hi> Let
him shew wherein I have ascribed any
<hi>more,</hi> or <hi>Greater Power, to the Prince,</hi>
than our <hi>Laws</hi> have given Him; and
our <hi>Convocations,</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>expresly,</hi> or by a <hi>plain Consequence,</hi>
approved of, and <hi>declared</hi> to be his
<hi>Right? 2dly.</hi> Let him tell us, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Opinion,</hi> here advanced by Him,
<hi>differs</hi> from that of our <hi>Missionary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> who have written
against the <hi>Supremacy;</hi> and against
whom our <hi>Divines</hi> have so Learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintain'd the <hi>King's Prerogative?
3dly.</hi> Let him inform Us, Whether
any <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
since the passing of this <hi>Convocation
Act,</hi> have ever made any such <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi>
as he has here done, against
it; and charged it as <hi>Destructive</hi> of
the <hi>Divine Rights</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of the
<hi>Church:</hi> And who those <hi>Writers</hi> are?
and in what <hi>Books</hi> they have done
it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:59355:12"/>
This being done, if it shall appear
that in any thing I have run into an
undue Extreme, and, by that means,
derogated from the <hi>Churches Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
I shall then be ready to comply
with the Advice he has given Me,
and not only <hi>humble my self before God
for the Wrongs I have done the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 177.</note>
but publickly make a <hi>Reparation</hi> of
them. But if, upon the Enquiry, it
shall appear, that I have affirm'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what the <hi>Law Establishes;</hi>
our <hi>Convocations</hi> have <hi>Agreed</hi> to; and
our most Eminent <hi>Clergy Men</hi> have
constantly <hi>defended;</hi> I must then be
excused if I look upon my self to have
done no more than in <hi>Duty</hi> I was
bound to do; and, by Opposing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I take this <hi>Gentleman</hi> not only to
have acted contrary to the <hi>Laws</hi> of
the <hi>Land,</hi> and the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
of the <hi>Church;</hi>
               <note place="margin">By the 1, 2, and 12. Can.</note> but to have
actually incurr'd an <hi>Excommunication</hi>
for such his Offence.</p>
            <p>Having said thus much with respect
to the Subject of my late <hi>Treatise,</hi> I
shall add but little more concerning
the Design which is here laid for the
Answering of it. As this <hi>Author</hi> has
order'd the matter, it is become abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:59355:12"/>
Necessary for Him to Go on
with it. For having charged me with
<hi>Violating the most important Truths of
Principles and Histories;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface.</note> having told
the World that I have <hi>treated the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
of the Church with Spite and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely;
and Recommended the Greatest
Slavery of Her to the Appetite of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Powers;</hi> (and every part of which
Charge does, I conceive, Accuse Me
of no small Crime) the Weight of
this <hi>Accusation</hi> must fall very Heavy
either upon <hi>Him</hi> or <hi>Me;</hi> and I look
upon my self as concern'd to tell him,
that I do expect he should <hi>make it
Good,</hi> or Honestly own that he <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only for his own sake as well as
mine, and which is yet more, for
the Satisfaction of Those who shall
think fit to Interest themselves in this
Controversy; some few things there
are which I would here Recommend
to him; and they are such, as, in
my Apprehension, ought not to be
thought at all Unreasonable by Him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>1st.</hi> Since this <hi>Debate,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
managed, must be likely to Run
out into a considerable Length, I
would desire him not to Increase the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:59355:13"/>
necessary Bulk of it, by alledging <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi>
out of the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> to
prove that which Neither of Us make
any doubt of. Thus p. 160. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the Authority of <hi>Athanasius</hi> to
prove that the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> were
not <hi>constrain'd, by any force that was
laid upon them, to condemn</hi> Arius, <hi>but
did it freely, and of their Own Accord.</hi>
Now this I allow to be very true;
but cannot help thinking it to be, in
our present Case, very little to the
Purpose. And p. 162. He cites a
much larger Proof out of <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen,</hi>
the Appositeness of which
to our Debate I cannot yet imagine;
unless it be that He thinks all <hi>Greek</hi>
to be equally <hi>Pertinent</hi> to most <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
in which he is certainly in the
Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> I would intreat him not to
insist upon any Testimonies of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
which have been already alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again and again, by <hi>Harding</hi> and
<hi>Stapleton;</hi> by <hi>Saunders</hi> and <hi>Dorman,</hi>
and the Rest of our <hi>Popish Fugitives,</hi>
in their Treatises against the <hi>Oath of
Supremacy,</hi> and as often answer'd by
Our <hi>Writers;</hi> unless he shall think fit,
at the same time, to take Notice of
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:59355:13"/>
their <hi>Replys</hi> to them, and shew that
they do not destroy the force of His
<hi>Allegations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what purpose, for example,<note place="margin">P. 160.</note>
does he bring the Sayings of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
against the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Tyre;</hi> of
<hi>Osius</hi> against <hi>Constantius;</hi> of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
against <hi>Valentinian</hi> the <hi>Younger;</hi>
to us who know what has long
since been Return'd to them by

               <hi>Andrews;</hi> and the
rest of our <hi>Writers</hi> upon this Subject.
This may pass with those, who are
Ignorant of these Matters, for a <hi>shew</hi>
of <hi>Reading;</hi> and they may, for a
while, look with <hi>Wonder</hi> on the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

But when the <hi>Common place</hi> shall be
lay'd open, and they shall begin to

these <hi>Authorities</hi> are Transcribed;
and shall be convinced how often
they have already been both <hi>Alledged</hi>
and <hi>Answered;</hi> the most Charitable
<hi>Reader</hi> will be apt to shake his Head,

            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:59355:14"/>
And this I desire with relation to
other Mens Writings: As for my
own <hi>Book,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> I would request him, when
he <hi>cites</hi> my <hi>Words,</hi> but especially
when he does it with a Design of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting</hi>
upon them, that he would
take them as they lie; and not <hi>leave
out,</hi> or <hi>insert,</hi> any that may have an
Influence upon the <hi>Sense</hi> of what He
quotes. Of the <hi>former</hi> of these I take
my self to have some reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
in his References of p. 100. and
101. of his Book. But of the <hi>latter</hi>
yet more, p. 109. where He says,
that I give the <hi>Prince</hi> Power to <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend</hi>
not only the <hi>Sentences</hi> of <hi>Synods,</hi>
but their <hi>Canons</hi> too; And of which
I do assure the <hi>Reader</hi> he will not
find the least mention in the Passages
to which he is Referr'd.</p>
            <p>But <hi>4thly,</hi> And to go yet farther;
Would his design, or prejudices, give
him leave, I could wish he would
take care to distinguish a little better
between what I <hi>Relate</hi> as matter of
<hi>History,</hi> and what I deliver as my
<hi>own Sense.</hi> It being easie to imagine
that in a Work of such a Nature as
that is which he has undertaken to
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:59355:14"/>
Examine, many things may be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited</hi>
from <hi>Others,</hi> which a Man is
not bound <hi>himself</hi> to <hi>approve</hi> of. Had
he used this Precaution, he would
not have told his <hi>Reader,</hi> as he does,
p. 160. that I charge the <hi>Synod</hi> of
<hi>Ariminum</hi> with the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
for <hi>dissolving themselves</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Emperours</hi> leave: Whereas,
in Truth, I only give a sincere Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Matter of Fact, and
shew (from my <hi>Author</hi>) what those
<hi>Fathers</hi> did, and what <hi>Resentments</hi>
the <hi>Emperour</hi> had of it? What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
those Holy <hi>Bishops</hi> had for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to their <hi>Churches,</hi> after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Absence, tho' not <hi>Licensed</hi> by
<hi>Constantius</hi> so to do, it cannot be
thought we at this Distance should
be so well able to judge, as They,
at that time were. And if they were
Satisfied, that they had Reason so to
do; far be it from me to Condemn
them for preferring their <hi>Duty</hi> to
their <hi>Flocks,</hi> before the Satisfaction
of a <hi>Violent,</hi> and <hi>Heretical Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me to this add, <hi>5thly,</hi> As not
very different from what I have now
mentioned, such other <hi>Mistakes,</hi> as
either <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Care,</hi> or the Heat of
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:59355:15"/>
               <hi>Contention,</hi> has sometimes led him
into; and by reason of which, he
charges me with several things
which I am by no means concern'd
to admit of. Thus, for <hi>Example;</hi>
It is not less than <hi>four</hi> several times
that he Speaks of my <hi>Definition</hi> of a
<hi>Synod:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 6. 8. 49. 55.</note> And in one Place censures me
for the <hi>Vn-accuracy</hi> of it, p. 49. And
indeed a very loose <hi>Definition</hi> of a
<hi>Synod</hi> it is, tho' fit enough to keep
Company with that which Himself
gives of it, in the same Place. But
then it is a great Mistake, to say
that I had any thoughts of <hi>Defining</hi>
a <hi>Synod</hi> in the Place to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.
On the contrary I acknowledge
the very <hi>Meeting,</hi> of which I there
Speak, not to be what we <hi>properly
mean</hi> by a <hi>Synod.</hi> Only I shew both
from the <hi>Persons</hi> of which it <hi>consisted,</hi>
and from the <hi>Business</hi> which it <hi>met
about;</hi> that if the <hi>Prince</hi> has <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
over <hi>such</hi> an <hi>Assembly</hi> as that was,
there is no Reason why he should
not have an <hi>equal Authority</hi> over
<hi>Synods;</hi> which both <hi>consist</hi> of the
same <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>meet</hi> about
the <hi>like Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:59355:15"/>
But <hi>6thly,</hi> And to have done:
There is yet one Thing more which
I cannot but think to be worthy his
Regard, and it is this; That before
he draws up any more Charges of
<hi>Absurdities</hi> and <hi>Contradictions</hi> against
me, He would take some tollerable
Care to examine Matters thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and to advise with some clearer
Heads; and not charge That upon
<hi>my Words,</hi> which is really the <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune</hi>
of his <hi>own Vnderstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a strange Confusion, for
Example, is it, p. 166. because I
prove from the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> in
the <hi>first Ages</hi> after the <hi>Empire</hi> became
<hi>Christian;</hi> and from what was <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi>
and <hi>regularly</hi> done in those <hi>times</hi>
too, the <hi>Princes Supremacy;</hi> to fancy
that I had overthrown my own
Foundation, by saying that in the
<hi>Dreggs</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and when <hi>Princes</hi>
had lost their <hi>Antient</hi> and just <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
many things were done by
the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Synods</hi> very <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly;</hi>
and their bare <hi>doing</hi> of which
is by no means sufficient to prove
that they had <hi>a Right</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>Again, p. 167. Because I cite <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
for an Expression of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:59355:16"/>
that he was <hi>Bishop in things
without the Church;</hi> what strange
<hi>Logick</hi> is it from thence to conclude
that <hi>Princes</hi> have nothing to do in
the <hi>Affairs of Synods?</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Euseb. Vit. Const. l. 1. p. 352. Comp. p. 405.</note> Whereas it is
Notorious that those, above any thing,
were the very Matters of which he
Spake.</p>
            <p>So, p. 168. I quote <hi>Socrates</hi> for
saying, that the <hi>Greatest Synods</hi> were
called by the <hi>Emperors: Ergo,</hi> says
he, 'tis plain that the <hi>lesser Ones</hi> were
not?</p>
            <p>Again, p. 169. I affirm that in
peaceable Times, and under <hi>Princes</hi>
who take Care of the <hi>Church, Synods</hi>
ought not to <hi>meet</hi> but by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
or <hi>Allowance</hi> of the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</hi>
To this, he conceives it is
a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to say, as yet I do, that
in Cases of <hi>extreme Necessity,</hi> when
<hi>Princes</hi> shall so far abuse their <hi>Power,</hi>
as to render it absolutely needful for
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> by some <hi>extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi>
to provide for the <hi>Churches Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;</hi>
that <hi>Necessity</hi> will warrant their
taking of them.—And again; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I assert that in <hi>quiet Times,</hi> and
under a <hi>Pious, Christian Prince,</hi> the
<hi>Prince</hi> is to <hi>judge, when</hi> it is <hi>proper</hi> for
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:59355:16"/>
               <hi>Synods</hi> to meet: to this he fancys it
to be a Contradiction to allow, that
when the <hi>Danger</hi> is <hi>apparent,</hi> and
the <hi>Necessities</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> will not
bear the farther delay of Them, if
the <hi>Prince</hi> does refuse to let them
meet, they must rather venture his
Displeasure, and do it of themselves,
than be wanting, in such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
to the <hi>Churches Safety</hi> and
<hi>Preservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are some of those <hi>Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
which this <hi>Ingenious Writer</hi> has
been pleased to lay to my Charge.
Many more there are of the like
kind; and by which whether he
has more exposed <hi>my Weakness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 177.</note> or
<hi>his Own,</hi> I am very well Content to
leave it to any impartial <hi>Reader</hi> to
judge.</p>
            <p>It is one of the <hi>ill Effects</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attend <hi>Controversial Writings,</hi>
that it is very Difficult to manage
them either with that <hi>Temper</hi> and
<hi>Ingenuity</hi> that becomes <hi>Scholars,</hi> or
with that <hi>Charity</hi> that <hi>good Christians</hi>
ought to do. And 'tis this has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me almost as great a Disgust at
them, as ever <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
himself to have against <hi>Synods,</hi>
               <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:59355:17"/>
and that almost upon the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ill-Nature</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Domineer in them; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it so falls out that an <hi>Opponent</hi>
must be freely dealt with, or a <hi>good
Cause</hi> must suffer in the Opinion of
a great Many, who conclude that a
Man therefore only spares his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi>
because he could not get an
Advantage against him.</p>
            <p>How far I have fallen under this
Censure, in the Management of the
present Controversy, I must submit
it to others to judge; but do hope I
have not so far Transgress'd, as this
late <hi>Author</hi> charges me to have done.<note place="margin">Pag. 177.</note>
As for the <hi>Logick, Law,</hi> and <hi>History,</hi>
of the Person I had to deal with,
What <hi>it really is,</hi> I pretend not to say;
What <hi>it appear'd to me to be,</hi> my <hi>Book</hi>
has shewn: And if I have any where
fail'd in my <hi>Allegations</hi> against him,
this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> no doubt, will take
care to call me to Account for it.
But <hi>Honesty</hi> is a tender Point; and I
do not remember I have any where
touch'd upon it. 'Tis true I have
shewn, what was indeed too plain
to be deny'd, that whosoever he were
that Wrote that <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> he could
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:59355:17"/>
be no Friend to our <hi>present Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And this I am sure was to
my Purpose to observe, how little
so ever it was to his, to have it so
plainly Discover'd. However, if in
any thing I have been Mistaken in
my Judgment either of his <hi>Affections,</hi>
of his <hi>Abilities,</hi> I am heartily sorry
for it; and shall be ready to submit to
whatsoever <hi>Pennance</hi> his most <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
Logical, Historical</hi> Second,
shall, from his better skill in <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and the <hi>Laws</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> think
fit to lay upon me for it.</p>

for pretending to Vindicate the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>

Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> composed only
of such Persons as will disclaim all

from having any thing to do in

be of some Use to represent to such,
as have not yet lay'd aside all Regard

Church,</hi> in the <hi>Points</hi> under

I received the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which I have
asserted, in Vindication of the <hi>Kings
Supremacy.</hi> And having done this,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59355:21"/>
I cannot but hope that some of them
will consider; what is the true
Design of those who are so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to pull down, what our <hi>Wise</hi>
and <hi>Pious Ancestors,</hi> took so much
care to Build: And whether the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi>
we are now running so blindly
into, must not end either in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<hi>Popery,</hi> or <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> at the

               <p>When the Foundation was first
laid for a regular <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
among Us;<note place="margin">§ 3.</note> One of the first
things which those,<note place="margin">The Act of 25 H. VIII c. 19.</note> who carry'd on
that great Work, saw it needful to
do, was, to restore the <hi>Crown</hi> to that
<hi>Authority,</hi> which the Prevalence of
the <hi>Papal Power</hi> had so notoriously
deprived it of. In order hereunto,
the <hi>Convocation</hi> having agreed to
<hi>submit</hi> themselves to the <hi>King,</hi> an
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> was framed upon
that <hi>Submission,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26. H. VIII. c. 19.</note> in which, among O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
these four things were Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd.
<hi>1st.</hi> That the <hi>Convocation</hi>
should from thenceforth be <hi>Assembled</hi>
only by the <hi>Kings Writ. 2dly.</hi> That
it should <hi>make</hi> no <hi>Canons, or Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi>
but by Virtue of the <hi>Kings
Licence,</hi> first given them, so to do.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59355:21"/>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> That having <hi>agreed</hi> on any
<hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Constitutions,</hi> they should
yet neither <hi>Publish</hi> nor <hi>Execute</hi> them,
without the <hi>Kings Confirmation</hi> of
them: Nor, <hi>4thly;</hi> By his <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Execute</hi> any, but with these <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations;</hi>
That they be neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Kings Prerogative;</hi> nor
against any <hi>Common,</hi> or <hi>Statute Law;</hi>
nor, finally, in any other respect,
contrary to the <hi>Customs</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Act</hi> being thus pass'd,<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

her Reign ending within a few Years
after; One of the first things done,
by her <hi>Sister</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was
to Revive such <hi>Laws,</hi> made by those

for the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi>
and so this <hi>Statute</hi> was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

<hi>and</hi> Annex'd, <hi>to the</hi> Imperial

<hi>Subject</hi> of it shews, and<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz</hi> c. 1, Sect. 7.</note> the Words
of the <hi>Act</hi> it self, expressly declare,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59355:23"/>
to be <hi>for the better Observation and
Maintenance of that Statute;</hi> it must
follow, that the <hi>Supremacy</hi> which we
there <hi>Testify</hi> in our <hi>Conscience</hi> to
belong to our <hi>Princes,</hi> must be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by what that Act has U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
and Annex'd to the <hi>Crown;</hi> and
so comprehend All that <hi>Authority</hi>
of the <hi>King</hi> over his <hi>Convocation,</hi>
which in the <hi>25th. H.</hi> VIII was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
Restored to our <hi>Princes;</hi> and
which being again, by the Repeal
of that <hi>Act,</hi> recovered from them,
was by this present <hi>Statute,</hi> once
more, <hi>Re-setled</hi> in the <hi>Crown,</hi> as it
had been before.</p>
               <p>How those, who now appear so
Zealous in Opposition to this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
and have probably more than
Once,<note place="margin">Which all Persons in <hi>H.</hi> Orders, are, at their <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> obliged to do.</note> solemnly taken this <hi>Oath,</hi>
will acquit themselves either before
<hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> of a manifest Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of it, by their present Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
is past my skill to Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend:
Unless, because some part of
that <hi>Oath</hi> is now laid aside, they
should chance to think, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole <hi>Obligation</hi> of it is <hi>ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
even to those who have taken it
in its former Integrity. But indeed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59355:23"/>
should we allow that there were
some weight in this; yet since the
<hi>Laws</hi> made in Defence of the <hi>Kings
Supremacy,</hi> are still the same they
ever were; our <hi>Recognition</hi> of it must
be look'd upon to be the same too:
And in <hi>renouncing</hi> all <hi>Forreign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
in <hi>Causes Ecclesiastical,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See 1 of <hi>W.</hi> &amp; <hi>M.</hi> c. 8.</note> which
We still do; we must be accounted
as Effectually to <hi>acknowledge</hi> the <hi>Kings
Supremacy,</hi> according to the <hi>legal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of it, as when we the most ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>declared</hi> our <hi>Assent</hi> to it; tho' it
should be granted, that we do not
now so <hi>expressly Oblige</hi> our selves to
the <hi>Defence</hi> of it, as we were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
wont to do.</p>
               <p>And this I say with particular
Respect to the <hi>present State</hi> of this
<hi>Oath;</hi> for otherwise, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
Us of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> it cannot be
doubted but that Our <hi>Obligation,</hi> as
to the <hi>Substance</hi> of it, is still the same
it ever was: The <hi>Declaratory</hi> part
of this <hi>Oath</hi> being what we in Terms
<hi>subscribe</hi> to, in the <hi>first Article,</hi> of
the 39th <hi>Canon;</hi> and the <hi>Promissory,</hi>
no other than what is tied upon Us
in the 1st <hi>Canon,</hi> by an <hi>Authority</hi>
which Our Adversaries, I conceive.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59355:24"/>
will not presume to except against.
But not to insist upon the present <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi>
of this <hi>Oath;</hi> thus much, at
least, must be confess'd, (and that
is enough for my Purpose) that All
those who heretofore took the <hi>Oath</hi>
of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> as it was first drawn
up in the <hi>Statute</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1.</note>
did thereby, without Question, both
<hi>declare</hi> their <hi>Approbation</hi> of the <hi>Kings
Supremacy,</hi> as by that <hi>Act Establish'd,</hi>
and <hi>promise to their Power, to Assist
and Defend it.</hi> But now this <hi>All</hi> our
<hi>Clergy,</hi> and almost all Others who
were admitted to any Employ, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> did do:
And therefore it must be allow'd
that till within these last ten Years,
the <hi>Authority</hi> by me ascribed to the
<hi>King,</hi> was not only agreeable to the
<hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Laity,</hi> but to that of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> too; since every <hi>Clergy Man</hi>
in the <hi>Realm,</hi> till then, did upon
his <hi>Oath,</hi> both declare his <hi>Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of it, and <hi>Engage</hi> himself, to his
<hi>Power,</hi> to <hi>Defend</hi> it. And how that
<hi>Authority</hi> which was so Universally
<hi>received</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> by us,<note place="margin">—From the 1st of <hi>Eliz</hi> to the 1st of <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> above 130 Years.</note> for
so long a time, should now become
so <hi>Detestable</hi> in it self, and so <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59355:24"/>
of the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> I would desire these <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi>
if they can, to Inform Me.</p>
               <p>It was about four Years after the
<hi>Session</hi> of this <hi>Parliament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> and the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
of this <hi>Act,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Nine and Thirty Articles.</note> that the <hi>Nine and
Thirty Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> were <hi>agreed</hi>
upon in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and <hi>Publish'd</hi> by
the <hi>Queen's Authority.</hi> Of these the
37th relates to the <hi>Civil Magistrate;</hi>
and is drawn up so exactly according
to the <hi>Words,</hi> as well as <hi>Sense,</hi> of the
<hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> that we cannot
doubt but that the <hi>Convocation</hi> had a
particular Respect thereunto, in the
Framing of it. <q>
                     <hi>The</hi> Queen's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
<hi>hath the</hi>

the <hi>Queen,</hi> nor the <hi>Convocation,</hi>
had any Intention to depart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the</hi> Article <hi>goes on.</hi> 
                  <q>Where

we attribute to the <hi>Queen's Majesty</hi>
the <hi>Chief Government,</hi> by which <hi>Title</hi>
We understand the Minds of some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Folks to be Offended; We give
not our Princes the <hi>Ministring</hi> either
of God's <hi>Word,</hi> or of the <hi>Sacraments;</hi>
the which thing the <hi>Injunctions</hi> also,
set forth by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our Queen do
most plainly testifie: But that only
Prerogative, which we see to have been
given, always, to all <hi>Godly Princes,</hi>
in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> by God himself;
that they should <hi>Rule</hi> all <hi>Estates</hi> and
<hi>Degrees</hi> committed to their Charge by

               </p>
               <p>

<hi>of the</hi> Ecclesiastical Estate <hi>is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

the</hi> Article <hi>Referrs us will fully clear
it; Where having first denied, as the</hi>

<hi>of the</hi> Oath of Supremacy <hi>before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,</hi>
                  <q>the <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Queens</hi> of this

challenge <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Divine Service</hi> in the
<hi>Church;</hi> they declare, That Her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
neither doth, nor ever will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
any <hi>Authority</hi> than what was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59355:25"/>
challenged, and lately used, by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Kings of famous Memory, King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the VIII. and King <hi>Edward</hi> the
VI. which is, and was of Antient time
due to the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of this
<hi>Realm;</hi> that is, under God, to have
the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> over all
manner of Persons born within these
her Realms, Dominions and Countries,
of what <hi>Estate,</hi> either <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
or <hi>Temporal,</hi> soever they be.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Words of the <hi>Queens
Injunction,</hi> and agreeably whereunto,
it is manifest, the <hi>Convocation</hi> design'd
to frame <hi>this part</hi> of their <hi>Article,</hi> as
they took the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> for
their <hi>Pattern</hi> in the <hi>foregoing.</hi> And
in consequence whereof, as well as in
<hi>conformity</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi>
then Establish'd, we must conclude,
That this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the <hi>Convocation</hi> being one main
part of that <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> which was
declared by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<hi>Restored</hi> and <hi>Annex'd</hi> to it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
And having, as such, been <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged</hi>
and <hi>used</hi> both by King <hi>Henry</hi>
the VIII. and King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI.
is also a part of that <hi>Supremacy</hi> which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59355:26"/>
the <hi>Convocation</hi> here intended to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi>
to the <hi>Queen;</hi> as we are sure
the <hi>Queen</hi> must have understood it to
have been hereby ascribed to her.</p>
               <p>And of this I shall give a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Proof when I come to consider
the <hi>Notions</hi> which this <hi>Queen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and
her <hi>Clergy,</hi> had of her <hi>Authority</hi> as to
this Matter. In the mean time I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but desire this <hi>Late Writer,</hi> and
All Others, of the same Judgment with
him, who have in like manner <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed</hi>
these <hi>Articles,</hi> seriously to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
themselves with what Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
they did it; if they had in Good
earnest so ill an Opinion, as they now

For first, the <hi>Substance</hi> of what
we are to <hi>Subscribe</hi> to, is drawn up
into <hi>three Articles;</hi> whereof the <hi>first,</hi>
and <hi>third,</hi> are these. 1. <q>
                     <hi>That the
King's Majesty, under God, is the only
Supreme Governor of this Realm, and
of all other his Highness's Dominions
and Countries, as well in all Spiritual
or Ecclesiastical Things, or Causes, as
Temporal,</hi> &amp;c.</q>—Which being the
very <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi>
must be taken in the <hi>same Sense,</hi> that
I have before shewn, that <hi>Oath</hi> was
to be Understood in.—And, 3. <q>
                     <hi>That
we allow the Book of Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—and
acknowledge All and Every the
Articles therein contain'd—to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Word of God.</hi>
                  </q> And then,
to these <hi>Articles</hi> we <hi>subscribe</hi> in these
very Words; <q>
                     <hi>I,</hi> S. H. <hi>do willingly,
and</hi> ex animo, <hi>subscribe to these three
Articles above mentioned, and to All
things contained in them.</hi>
                  </q> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
who does this, either must <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59355:27"/>
to them against his Conscience;
or he must, <hi>thereby,</hi> be concluded to
profess this belief; That the <hi>Authority</hi>
given to the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Our Laws,</hi> and
<hi>approved</hi> of in these <hi>Articles,</hi> is <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Danger</hi> of <hi>Impugning</hi> any of
these <hi>Articles,</hi> is Great, and Unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
To <hi>affirm</hi> them, <hi>in any part, to
be Superstitious, or Erroneous</hi> (whether
he who does it be found out or no) is
by the <hi>Canons</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. v.</note> 
                  <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
ipso facto.</hi> And if the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender</hi>
be discover'd, and fortunes to
be a <hi>Clergy-Man,</hi> he is by the <hi>Statute
Law</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> to be <hi>convented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Bishop</hi> for it;<note place="margin">13 Eliz. c. 12.</note> and if he does
not presently Revoke his <hi>Error,</hi> is,
in the <hi>First</hi> Instance, to be <hi>Deprived
of All his Ecclesiastical Promotions;</hi> and,
in the <hi>Second,</hi> loses them without
more ado.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Law</hi> both of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and of the <hi>State,</hi> in the present Case:
And with what Conscience any <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-Man,
beneficed</hi> in such a <hi>Church,</hi> can
excuse himself for flying with so much
Virulence in the Face both of these
<hi>Laws,</hi> and of these <hi>Canons;</hi> I shall
leave it to any One, who has any
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59355:27"/>
                  <hi>Conscience</hi> himself, though never so
much prejudiced against the <hi>King's
Supremacy,</hi> to consider.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> set
forth by <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Canons of King <hi>James</hi> the First.</note> let us add
the next authentick Evidence of our
<hi>Church's Sense,</hi> in this particular, the
<hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> made by the
<hi>Convocation</hi> in the first Year of King
<hi>James</hi> I. Of these the very first is
design'd to assert the <q>
                     <hi>Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the King's Majesty over the
Church of</hi> England.</q> In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it ordains, <q>That <hi>All Persons</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
<hi>shall faithfully keep and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
and, as much as in them lieth,
shall cause to be observed, and kept of
Others, <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Singular Laws</hi> and
<hi>Statutes,</hi> made for Restoring to the</hi>
Crown <hi>of this Kingdom,</hi> the antient
Jurisdiction <hi>over the</hi> State Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical.</q>
Which last words being the
very <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> of the First of
<hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> we must conclude
the meaning of the <hi>Canon</hi> to be this;
That they shall <hi>faithfully Observe</hi> the
<hi>Laws</hi> referred to in that <hi>Statute,</hi> and
do what in them lies, to <hi>cause All O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
to Observe the same. Seeing
then that <hi>Act</hi> of the 25 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 19. is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59355:28"/>
One of those which is there expresly
Revived, it will follow, that it expresly
comes within the <hi>Words</hi> of this <hi>Canon;</hi>
and that the <hi>Powers</hi> therein annexed
to the Crown over the Convocation,
are hereby approv'd and allow'd of, as
part of that <hi>Antient Jurisdiction</hi> which
always, of <hi>Right,</hi> belong'd to our
<hi>Kings</hi> over the <hi>Estate Ecclesiastical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the next <hi>Canon</hi> is more express,
and will come more fully up to our
present purpose. Its design is to <q>
                     <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the</hi> Impugners <hi>of the</hi> King's
Supremacy <hi>over the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</q>
And thus it runs, in our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Version</hi> of it.<note place="margin">Comp. Munic. Eccles. pag. 165.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Whosoever shall
hereafter affirm that the</hi> King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
<hi>hath not the same</hi> Authority, <hi>in</hi>
Causes Ecclesiastical, <hi>that the Godly</hi>
Kings <hi>had amongst the</hi> Jews, <hi>and</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Emperors <hi>in the</hi> Primitive
Church; <hi>Or impeach any part of the</hi>
Regal Supremacy <hi>in the said Causes,</hi>
Restored <hi>to the</hi> Crown, <hi>and by the</hi>
Laws <hi>of this</hi> Realm <hi>therein</hi> Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>let him be</hi> Excommunicated ipso
facto, <hi>and not Restored but only by the</hi>
Archbishop, <hi>after his Repentance, and
Publick Revocation of those his Wicked</hi>
Errors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59355:28"/>
It is plain by comparing of these two
<hi>Canons</hi> together, that the design of the
<hi>Convocation</hi> was, in the First, to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</hi>
and <hi>Assert</hi> the <hi>King's Supremacy,</hi>
and to oblige the <hi>Clergy</hi> to a <hi>strict,</hi> and
<hi>diligent</hi> Observance of it: By the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
to <hi>Restrain all sorts of Persons,</hi>
from <hi>denying,</hi> or otherwise endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>hurt,</hi> or <hi>extenuate,</hi> the <hi>Legal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of it. And two things there are
which will deserve to be taken notice
of in this Second <hi>Canon;</hi> First, What
that <hi>Supremacy</hi> is which our <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was so careful to <hi>Assert,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend?</hi>
And Secondly, What it is to
<hi>Impugn</hi> this <hi>Supremacy,</hi> within the
meaning of this <hi>Canon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As for the former of these,
the <hi>Supremacy</hi> here meant; two <hi>Rules</hi>
there are delivered by this <hi>Canon,</hi>
whereby we may come to a Right
Understanding of it. First, It is that
<hi>Authority</hi> over the <hi>Estate Ecclesiastical,</hi>
which by the <hi>Statutes</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth, was Restored, and by the <hi>Act</hi>
of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> Confirm'd, as of
<hi>Right</hi> belonging, to the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi>
of this <hi>Realm.</hi> And, Secondly: It is
such a <hi>Power,</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59355:29"/>
as the <hi>Godly Kings</hi> had amongst the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Christian Emperors</hi> in the
<hi>Primitive Church.</hi> And from which,
by the way, it may be Observed,
what good Reason I had to enquire
into the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi>
in these <hi>Cases;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. chap. x. p. 126.</note> and to argue
from thence in behalf of that Power
which our <hi>Church</hi> ascribes to our Own
<hi>Princes,</hi> on the like Occasions; How
much soever some Men may slight
such Proofs, as being sensible that they
are not to be Answer'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>impugn</hi> this <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
within the meaning of this <hi>Canon;</hi>
is either, first, to <hi>deny Altogether,</hi>
this <hi>Authority;</hi> and affirm, that the
<hi>King</hi> either <hi>has not,</hi> or <hi>ought not</hi> to
have, any such <hi>Power:</hi> Or it is, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
By any other means to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach</hi>
(or, as the <hi>Latin Canon</hi> has it
more plainly) to <hi>Extenuate,</hi> or <hi>Hurt</hi>
this <hi>Supremacy:</hi> Which, I conceive, is
then done when Men Write and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
against it; when they Censure
the <hi>Laws</hi> for <hi>Establishing</hi> of it; and
<hi>Damn</hi> the <hi>Prince,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 122, 155, 176.</note> so long as he shall
continue to <hi>Exercise</hi> it, according to
those <hi>Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59355:29"/>
But these are not the only <hi>Canons</hi>
which justify what I have written in
Defence of the <hi>King's Supremacy,</hi> and
Condemn those who appear against
it. The Twelfth is yet more express
to my particular Case, and will shew
what the Sense of our Church is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those who <hi>Abet</hi> the, now so
much <hi>magnified, Opinion,</hi> on the other
side. <q>
                     <hi>Whosoever shall affirm that it
is lawful</hi> [Cuivis Ministrorum aut
Laicorum Ordini, vel Eorum alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utris
simul Congregatis;] <hi>for any
Sort, [Rank, or Degree] of Ministers,
or Laics, or for either of them Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together; to make Canons, Decrees,
or Constitutions concerning Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
things,</hi> without the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<hi>and shall submit themselves
to be Ruled and Govern'd by them, let
them be</hi> Excommunicated ipso facto;
<hi>and not be Restored until they Repent,
and publickly Revoke those their</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>and</hi> Anabaptistical <hi>Errors.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For if, in the Opinion of our Church,
it be necessary for the <hi>Clergy</hi> to have
<hi>Authority</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> to meet on
such Occasions; If to say that any
<hi>Persons,</hi> of what <hi>Order</hi> soever they be,
may without his <hi>Licence</hi> make any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59355:30"/>
                  <hi>Canons, Decrees</hi> or <hi>Constitutions Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical;</hi>
nay or but even <hi>submit</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be <hi>govern'd</hi> by such as shall
be so <hi>made,</hi> be a <hi>Wicked, Anabaptisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
Errour;</hi> and for which a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be cast out of the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of our <hi>Church;</hi> then it must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Question be allow'd, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> Establish'd
among Us, the <hi>Clergy</hi> can neither
<hi>Meet</hi> nor <hi>Act,</hi> but with the King's
<hi>Permission:</hi> Nor ought we to account
those Constitutions of any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which any Persons shall make
without his leave; or, as such <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
to them; how much soever they
may please to cry up their <hi>Divine
Powers,</hi> and <hi>Vnalienable Rights,</hi> to
justify their <hi>Irregular,</hi> and <hi>Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Proceedings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sentence</hi> of both these last
<hi>Canons</hi> is,<note place="margin">§ 10.</note> That they who Offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them are to be,<note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Ipso fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto.</note> 
                  <hi>ipso facto <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated:</hi>
                  </hi>
And concerning which
I shall only observe thus much; first,
that in such a Case there is no need
of any <hi>Admonition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 26. Ext. de Appellat.</note> as where the
<hi>Judge</hi> is to <hi>give Sentence;</hi> but every
One is to take <hi>notice</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> at his
<hi>Peril,</hi> and see that he be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59355:30"/>
by it. And, Secondly; That
there is no need of any <hi>Sentence</hi> to be
pronounced, Which the <hi>Canon</hi> it self
has <hi>pass'd;</hi> and which is by that Means
<hi>already Promulged</hi> upon every One, as
soon as he comes within the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of it. In other Cases, a Man
may do things worthy of Censure,
and yet behave himself so warily in
Them, as to escape the <hi>Punishment</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> for want of a <hi>legal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
to <hi>convict</hi> him. But, <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatio</hi>
Canonis, <hi>Ligat etiam Occulta
delicta:</hi> Where the <hi>Canon</hi> gives Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
there is no escaping; but the
<hi>Conscience</hi> of every Man becomes Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by it, as soon as ever he is Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that he has done that which
was forbidden under the Pain of <hi>such</hi>
an <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these <hi>Canons</hi> relating to the
<hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> I might add those
which speak of the <hi>Authority</hi> of our
<hi>Synods,</hi> and there again Expressly
provide for the <hi>Princes Rights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Can. 139. the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<hi>the Assembling of Synods, to be
by the Kings Authority.</hi> In the <hi>140th,</hi>
she acknowledges the <hi>Necessity of his
Licence,</hi> both for <hi>the Making and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59355:31"/>
of her Decrees, in Causes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical.</hi>
And Can. 141. Censures
such as shall, upon this Account, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
the <hi>Acts</hi> of our <hi>Synods,</hi> in
these Words: <q>
                     <hi>Whosoever shall affirm
that their Proceedings in making of
Canons and Constitutions, in Causes
Ecclesiastical, by the</hi> Kings Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>as aforesaid, ought to be Despised
and Contemned; the same being</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<hi>and</hi> Enjoyn'd, <hi>by the said</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Power, Supremacy <hi>and</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
<hi>let them be</hi> Excommunicated,
<hi>and not Restored untill they Repent,
and publickly Revoke that their wicked
Errour.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But in a Case so plain I shall not
need to insist on any more Proofs;
and therefore shall content my self
to observe, that the <hi>Title</hi> given by
<hi>publick Authority</hi> to these <hi>Canons,</hi> is this:
<q>
                     <hi>Constitutions or Canons Ecclesiastical;
by the Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>President of
the</hi> Synod <hi>for the Province of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,
<hi>and the rest of the</hi> Bishops
<hi>and</hi> Clergy <hi>of the same</hi> Province, <hi>by
the Kings Authority, <hi>Treated</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi>
                     </hi>
upon: <hi>In their</hi> Synod, <hi>&amp;c.—Afterwards,
by the same Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
<hi>Approved, Ratified</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd;</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59355:31"/>
and by the Authority of the
same, under the Great Seal of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>Promulged,</hi> to be diligently</hi>
observed <hi>thro' both</hi> Provinces, <hi>as
well of</hi> Canterbury, as York.</q> This
is the true <hi>Title</hi> given to these <hi>Canons:</hi>
And was fit to be thus particularly
taken notice of, because in our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Book of Canons,</hi> which is of most
common Use, this <hi>Inscription</hi> (as well
as many of the <hi>Canons</hi> themselves) is
very imperfectly rendred, and may
be apt to lead Men into some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
concerning these, as well as
other Matters. It were easie to make
several Observations, to our present
Purpose, upon the several Parts of
this truly <hi>Accurate,</hi> and <hi>Legal, Title:</hi>
But I shall chuse rather to express
the process of this <hi>Convocation,</hi> in
the Words of an <hi>Author,</hi> who may
perhaps be less liable to Exception;<note place="margin">Heylin Ref justified. p. 19. 20.</note> and
whose account of it is this: <q>
                     <hi>That the</hi>

<hi>according to the</hi> Tenour <hi>and</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>of his</hi> Majesties Writ, <hi>his</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<hi>was pleased, by Vertue of his</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative

be agreeable to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our

was, to set the Crown again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>It is evident then that this <hi>Queen,</hi>

                     <q>Concerning
the Determination of Matters in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
I know not wherein you differ
from them. For tho' the <hi>Prince</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
your <hi>Determination,</hi> yet can
he not <hi>Himself</hi> conclude any thing;
only he may compel you to go to it again,
and take better Rold: But if it shall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59355:37"/>
please you to Go forward in your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi>
or if you cannot <hi>Agree</hi>
among your selves, I see not what <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
you have given the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi>
to <hi>Determine</hi> the matter;
but for ought I can espy, if you and your
Seniors be disposed to be peevish, either
must the <hi>Prince</hi> have no <hi>Religion,</hi> or
such as you shall <hi>appoint</hi> unto Him.
For <hi>potestatem Facti</hi> you have given
Him, that is, you make him your Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner;
but <hi>Potestatem Juris</hi> you do
as fully Remove from him as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
do: For he hath not, as you say,
any <hi>Authority</hi> to make <hi>Orders,</hi> or
<hi>Laws,</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters.</hi>

may the <hi>Orders,</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> there

If any One behave themselves there <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuously,</hi>

                  <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Cartwright:</hi> And in

that the <hi>Papists</hi> say the very same
things; and of both He affirms in his

                     <note place="margin">P. 269.</note> that <q>
                        <hi>Hereby they

                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus seen what these <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
of the <hi>Consistory</hi> allow to <hi>Christian
Princes</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> it might
not perhaps be improper for me to ask
of our <hi>New Disciplinarians,</hi> wherein
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59355:39"/>
they differ from them in the <hi>Point</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. But, indeed, it is clear, that if
there be any Difference at all between
them,<note place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. p. 123, 124.</note> it consists in this, That those
Men, as bad as they were, yet real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allow'd more <hi>Authority</hi> to the <hi>Civil

continued Discourse in <hi>Defence</hi> of the
<hi>Supremacy,</hi> and of which it shall suffice
to point out some <hi>Brief Heads</hi> on this
Occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>1. That the <hi>Emperors</hi> heretofore
call'd <hi>Councils:</hi>
                     </q> This he proves;
pag. 134, 153, 159, 227, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2. That they appointed the <hi>Time,</hi>
and Place of them; p. 154, 155.
Nay, and even the <hi>Persons</hi> that
should come to them; p. 207. And
<hi>have Voices</hi> in them; p. 208.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>3. That they <hi>directed</hi> what should
be <hi>handled</hi> in them; p. 135. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged</hi>
their <hi>Debates;</hi> p. 134. And
forbad them to call in Question the
<hi>Faith,</hi> that had by former <hi>Synods</hi>
been Establish'd; p. 155, 208.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>4. That they <hi>judged</hi> of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;</hi>
p. 135. And that in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Doctrine;</hi> p. 261. By the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59355:40"/>
Common <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>All Christians,</hi> the
Word of God; p. 264, 266, 276.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>5. That they <hi>Confirm'd</hi> the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
Decrees; <hi>See p.</hi> 242. And this
not at all adventures; but chose
such of their <hi>Canons</hi> as they <hi>approv'd,</hi>
and <hi>passed</hi> them into <hi>Laws;</hi> p. 139.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>6. That as to their <hi>Sentences;</hi> they
Received <hi>Appeals</hi> from <hi>Councils;</hi>
                     </q> p.
135, 151, 152. <q>
                        <hi>Suspended;</hi> p. 154.
And if they thought them too severe,
<hi>Released</hi> the <hi>Rigour</hi> of their <hi>Censures,</hi>
and <hi>Determinations;</hi> p. 136.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are some of the <hi>Points</hi> which
this Learned Man not only allows of,<note place="margin">Pag. 192, to 198.—Ibid. p. 200, 249.</note>
but defends from the <hi>Examples</hi> of the
<hi>Jewish Princes,</hi> and <hi>Christian Emperors.</hi>
And I will be bold to say, either his
<hi>Treatise</hi> is altogether <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous;</hi>
contrary to the <hi>Rights</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Antient
Fathers;</hi> or my Discourse, after all
that has been said against it, must be
Confessed to be True and Orthodox,
and <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because <hi>Bishops</hi> may be look'd
upon as Suspicious Men,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> let us see
what those of an <hi>Inferior Order,</hi> have
written in this Case: And for these
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59355:41"/>
I will take but One of a Kind; Dean
<hi>Nowell,</hi> for the <hi>Dignitaries;</hi> and the
<hi>Venerable</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> for the Rest of
the <hi>Lower House.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> the latter of
these,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dean</hi> Nowell.</note> He was much too Young to
have had any part in that <hi>Convocation,</hi>
in which our <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> were

and then newly approv'd of

<hi>Dean</hi> thought himself concern'd to
undertake the <hi>Defence</hi> of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he has so well discharged his
Part in it, that, I believe, it will be
very hard for our Modern Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

As for the Civil Governor's Authority,
it suffered them only as things not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,

which our <hi>Kings</hi> have in the Case of

                     <q>If it be demanded by what <hi>Right,</hi>
from <hi>Constantine</hi> downwards, the
<hi>Christian Emperors</hi> did so far inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
in the <hi>Church's Affairs;</hi> either
we must herein condemn them, as being
over-presumptuously bold; or else Judge
that by a <hi>Law</hi> which is termed <hi>Regia,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Royal,</hi> the People having
derived unto their <hi>Emperors</hi> their

competent <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power, to

were thought by Christianity to Vse their
Power, being Christians, unto the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

there any <hi>Christian Bishop</hi> in the World

                        <note place="margin">Page 468.</note> I
would demand, What Evidence there is
whereby it may clearly be shew'd, that in

<hi>Canon,</hi> devised by the <hi>Clergy alone</hi> in
their <hi>Synods,</hi> whether Provincial, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,

                  </p>
                  <p>And this shall suffice for the Reign
of this Great, and Wise <hi>Queen.</hi> I shall
make no <hi>Apology</hi> for taking these last

Authority with the <hi>Books</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
by himself in his Life time:

There being so much of Mr. <hi>Hooker's

me undoubtedly conclude, that, as
they are, they proceeded from Him.
And those who are supposed to have
interpolated these Books, were never
charged with turning things to the
Advantage of <hi>Sovereign Authority.</hi> So
that if any <hi>Changes,</hi> or <hi>Omissions,</hi> should
have happened in this Place, it must
have been to the <hi>Disadvantage,</hi> not to
the <hi>Interest,</hi> of the Cause before Us.
But I shall be content to take his <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
as it still is left to Us; and is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
contrary to that wild Notion

Nevertheless it is clearer than the Suns

because <hi>Emperours</hi> took upon them to

only that <hi>Emperours</hi> might see and

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59355:48"/>
then, p. 176. thus Sums up the</hi> Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Authority: <q>Put <hi>this, says he,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
The King assembles the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod;
the Synod presumes to do nothing
without his Knowledge. The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the whole Affair to their Power:
They, by vertue of his Princely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
proceed to do what was needful
to be done.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might easily Confirm this same
Opinion both of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
with the Concurrent <hi>Authority</hi>
of <hi>Burhil, Tooker,</hi> and some Others,
who, were afterwards, engaged in
the same Controversy. But I must
not enlarge upon this Subject, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much more yet to observe
both of this <hi>King,</hi> and this <hi>Bishop,</hi>
upon another Occasion, as to the
Points under Debate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> being Dissatisfied with
the Proceedings of the <hi>Presbyterian
Ministers in Scotland,</hi>

To these <hi>Ministers,</hi> after other
things Transacted with them; he

                     <note place="margin">Calderwood <hi>Hist.</hi> p. 543.</note>

the other Affairs about which they

to my Purpose to shew, and may
at large be seen in the <hi>Histories</hi> here
Referr'd to by me. That which I
have further to observe is, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Course of this <hi>Transaction,</hi>
the King caused <hi>four</hi> of his <hi>English
Bishops,</hi> on certain Days appointed
to them, to <hi>Preach</hi> before him at
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59355:49"/>
                     <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and Commanded the
<hi>Scotch Ministers</hi> to be present at their
<hi>Sermons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third of these turns fell upon
our learned <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> at that time <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of <hi>Chichester;</hi> whose <hi>Subject,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
him by the <hi>King,</hi> was, to
prove the <hi>Power of Princes,</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating
Synods and Councils.</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whereunto he first laid down
these two Points:<note place="margin">Sermons. pag. 105.</note> 
                     <q>1. <hi>That when the
Prince calls, the Clergy are to meet:</hi>
And 2. <hi>That they are not to meet, of
Themselves, unless he call them.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Proof of these Points he thus
pursues: <hi>1st.</hi> From the Law of God,
p. 104. 105. confirm'd by the Law
of Nature, and Nations, p. 106. And
<hi>2dly.</hi> From Matter of Fact: Before
<hi>Christ;</hi> From <hi>Moses,</hi> to the <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee</hi>'s,
in the <hi>Jewish Church.</hi> p. 106,
107. After <hi>Christ;</hi> From <hi>Constantine,</hi>

(3) Under <hi>Emperours,</hi> and (4)
<hi>Kings,</hi> by the space of many Hundred
Years, p. 108.</p>
                  <p>This is the Substance of his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi>
and from which I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59355:49"/>
to extract some part of what he says,
in the Prosecution of most of the Heads,
before laid down.</p>
                  <p>1st. <hi>In Speaking of the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions
<hi>he has this Remark:</hi>

                     <q>The <hi>Law</hi> of

if time would suffer, both in their
General Order for <hi>Convocations</hi> so to be
called, and in their General Opposing all
<hi>Conventicles</hi> called Otherwise. Verily
the Heathen Laws made all such <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
Vnlawful, which the highest <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
did not cause to meet; yea, tho' they
were—<hi>Sub praetextu Religionis,</hi> say the
<hi>Roman Laws.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Emperours</hi> think fit to abate any thing
of that <hi>Right;</hi> nay they took more straight
Order.</q>

                     <hi>he has these Words:</hi> 
                     <q>Thus
from <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> we see
in whose Hands this <hi>Power</hi> was. And
what should I say more? There was in all
God<hi>'s</hi> People no One <hi>Religious King,</hi> but
this Power he Practised: And there was
of all God<hi>'s Prophets</hi> no One, that ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
any Prohibition against it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>What shall we say then? Were all these
wrong? Shall we condemn them all?—Yet
to this we are come now, that either we must
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59355:50"/>
condemn them All, the One after Another;
the <hi>Kings</hi> as <hi>Usurpers</hi> for taking on them
to use more <hi>Power</hi> than ever <hi>orderly</hi> they
Received; the <hi>Prophets</hi> for soothers of
them in that their unjust Claim; Or else
confess that they did no more than they

we must Confess, for that is the Truth.</q>

he thus Speaks of that of <hi>Nice.</hi> At <hi>Nice</hi>
there were together 318 <hi>Bishops,</hi> the Lights
of the whole World, the chiefest and choicest
Men for Holiness, Learning, Vertue,
and Valour, that the Christian Religion
ever had, before or since.—Did any of them
refuse to come being called by Him, (<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>)
as not called aright? Or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was there any One of them that did
<hi>Protest</hi> against it;<note place="margin">Pag. 109.</note> or pleaded the <hi>Churches
Interest</hi> to meet of <hi>Themselves?</hi>—Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (which is, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath been so much admired by All
<hi>Christians</hi>) cannot be excused before God
or Men, if they thus conspired (All) to
betray the <hi>Churches Right;</hi> and suffered
it, contrary to all Equity, to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
leaving a dangerous Precedent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
for all Councils, ever after, to the Worlds
End.—There is no Man of Reason but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59355:50"/>
will think it reasonable, if this were the
<hi>Churches own peculiar,</hi> if <hi>Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
unto it,</hi> (and so known to them to be)
there ought to have been plain dealing now,
at the very first Council of All, that if
<hi>Constantine</hi> would embrace Religion, he
must forbear to meddle with their <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi>

Congregations may be called thus; but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
or Provincial, such as Ours, How?
Even so too,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 159.</note> and no otherwise—Yea, I
add this, which is a Point to be consider'd,
that even then when the <hi>Emperours</hi> were
profess'd <hi>Arians,</hi> even then did the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
acknowledge their <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>call
Councils; Come</hi> to them being called,
Sued to them that they might be called;—And
sometimes They sped—and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not. And yet when they sped not
they held themselves Quiet, and never
<hi>presumed to Draw together, of their
Own Heads.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But it may be this was some <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Power,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ib. p. 110.</note> and that the <hi>Emperours</hi> had,
in this Point, more Jurisdiction than
<hi>Kings?</hi> Not that neither: For about 500
Years after Christ, when the Empire fell
in Pieces, and these Western Parts came
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59355:51"/>
into the Hands of <hi>Kings,</hi> those <hi>Kings</hi> had,
held, and enjoy'd, and practised the same
<hi>Power.</hi>

                     <q>If it be excepted that there are of these
(<hi>Provincial and National</hi>) Councils,<note place="margin">Ib p. 111. Comp. Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cip Eccles. p. 168.</note>
which carry in their Acts no mention
how they were called; For them we are to
understand, that after the Decrees of the
first <hi>Nicene Council</hi> were by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's</hi>
Edict confirm'd, wherein, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it was
order'd, that each Province should Yearly
hold their Synods twice—We are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Emperour's</hi> Authority was in All
afterwards; habitually at least.—</q>

before <hi>Constantine?</hi> How went <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
then?—Truly even as the <hi>Jews</hi> did
before in <hi>Egypt.</hi> They were then a
<hi>Church</hi> under <hi>Persecution,</hi> till <hi>Moses</hi>
was raised up by God, a lawful <hi>Magistrate</hi>
over them.—No <hi>Magistrate</hi> did <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
them in <hi>Egypt:</hi> And, good Reason,
They had none then to do it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>True it is therefore,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 112.</note> that before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine's</hi> Time they met together as they
durst; and took such Order as they could.—But
when <hi>Constantine</hi> came in <hi>Moses</hi>
Place, it was lawful for him to do as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
did. And so he did: And they never
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59355:51"/>
said to him—Look how we have done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
we will do so even still; Meet no
otherwise now, than in former Times we
have, by <hi>Our Own Agreement;</hi>—No,
but they went to him, as to <hi>Moses,</hi> for
their <hi>Meetings;</hi> At his Hands they
sought them; <hi>Without his Leave, or
Liking, they would not Attempt them:</hi>
Yea (I dare say) they blessed God from
their Hearts that they had lived to see the
Day, that they might now Assemble by the
Sound of the Trumphet.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To conclude this <hi>Point</hi> then; These
two Times, or Estates of the Church, are
not to be Confounded: There is a plain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between them, and a diverse Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to be had of Each. If the Succession
of <hi>Magistrates</hi> be interrupted, in such
Case, of Necessity, the Church, of her self,
maketh supply, because then God's Order
<hi>Ceaseth.</hi> But God granting a <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
to them again, God's former, <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Order,</hi> returneth, and the Case is
to proceed,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 113.</note> and go on, as before.—In a
Word, None can seek to have the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
so <hi>called</hi> (as before <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>)
but they must secretly, and by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
confess,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Municip. Eccles. p. 115.</note> they are a <hi>Persecuted
Church,</hi> as that then was; without a
<hi>Moses,</hi> without a <hi>Constantine.</hi>

6thly. <hi>Hitherto we have seen the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of this Learned</hi> Prelate <hi>in the
Case before us; let us now see what</hi>
Application <hi>he made of what he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
on this Subject.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 113.</note> 
                     <q>You may please to
Remember, <hi>says he,</hi> there was not long
since a <hi>Clergy</hi> in place that was wholly <hi>ad
Oppositum,</hi> and would never have yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Reform</hi> ought. Nothing they would
do; and (in Eye of the Law) without
them Nothing could be done. They had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
the <hi>Power of Assembling</hi> into
their <hi>Own Hands.</hi> How then? How
shall we do for an <hi>Assembly?</hi> Then—the
<hi>Prince</hi> had this <hi>Power,</hi> and to
him, <hi>of Right,</hi> it belonged. This was
then God Divinity: And what Writer
is there extant, of those Times, but it may
be turn'd to in him? And was it Good
Divinity then, and is it now no longer so?
Was the <hi>King</hi> but Licensed, for a while
to hold this <hi>Power</hi> till <hi>another Clergy</hi>
were in, and must he then be deprived of
it again? Was it then <hi>Usurped</hi> from
<hi>Princes;</hi> and are, now, <hi>Princes Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>
of it Themselves?—Nay I trust we
will be better Advised, and not thus go
against our selves, and let <hi>Truth</hi> be no
longer <hi>Truth,</hi> than it <hi>will serve our
turns.</hi>

                     <hi>I shall conclude all I have to draw
out of this</hi> Discourse, <hi>with the same
Words, that the Learned</hi> Preacher <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his Sermon;</hi> 
                     <q>It remaineth that
as God, by his Law, hath taken this <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and his People, in former Ages, have
kept this <hi>Order,</hi> that we do so too: That
we say, as God saith,—This Power per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
unto <hi>Moses:</hi> And that neither
with <hi>Core</hi> we say <hi>We will not come;</hi>
Nor with <hi>Demetrius</hi> run together of <hi>our
selves,</hi> and think to carry it away with cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Great is</hi> Diana. But as we see the
<hi>Power</hi> is of <hi>God,</hi> so truly to acknowledge
it, and dutifully to yeild to it: That so
they, whose it is, may quietly hold it, and
laudably use it, to his Glory that gave it,
and to their Good, for whom it was given.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will not,<note place="margin">§ 25.</note> I hope, be thought much
of, that I have so long insisted upon the
Judgment of this Great <hi>Prelate,</hi> in the
present Case. No Man there was in that
Time, or perhaps in any Other <hi>Age</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> that was either fitter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the <hi>Sense</hi> of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> or better
qualified to maintain it. I might add
that this Discourse, being <hi>Preached</hi> first,
and then <hi>Publish'd,</hi> by the express <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
of the <hi>King,</hi> carries with it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than a <hi>Private Authority</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59355:53"/>
And when it shall be consider'd how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a while it was, before this, that that
<hi>Convocation</hi> met,<note place="margin">Anno 1603.</note> which took such care
both to explain its <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Royal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi>
and to give the utmost <hi>Cononical
Enforcement,</hi> that could be given to it;
we may well conclude this to have been
the <hi>Vniversal Judgment</hi> of our <hi>Church Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
in <hi>that Reign;</hi> as we are sure it
was of those, of the <hi>Reign foregoing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already alledged the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of those two Eminent Archbishops,
<hi>Whitgift,</hi> and <hi>Bancroft:</hi> To these I have
added those of <hi>Bilson,</hi> and <hi>Hooker;</hi> and
I thought it but Reasonable to give
them a place in the same Period in which
their <hi>Books</hi> were publish'd. But yet I
must observe, that the most of These,
not only continued to the present time;
but attain'd to their <hi>highest Promotions</hi>
under <hi>this Government</hi> The <hi>Synod</hi> of
1603, was held under the <hi>Presidence</hi> of
<hi>Bancroft,</hi> then <hi>Bishop of London:</hi> Bishop
<hi>Bilson,</hi> was a <hi>Member</hi> of it; and, no doubt,
concurr'd heartily to the passing of those
<hi>Canons,</hi> which relate to the <hi>King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi>
in it. I shall therefore, here,
add only the Judgment of One Learned
Man more (who must never be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

that it belongs to the <hi>Prince</hi> to Promulge

his Subjects to Obey it.—That he must

look'd upon as due, of <hi>Right,</hi>
to the <hi>Christian Prince.</hi> Of what Esteem
this Work in those days was, may be
Gather'd not only from the Great Care,
and Accuracy with which it was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
but from that Concern which the
<hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> shew'd for the
Publication of it. Twice it was solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dedicated to King <hi>James:</hi> And being
first publish'd in our <hi>Own Language,</hi> it
was thought considerable enough to
Carry both the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> of
<hi>our Church</hi> to those Abroad, in a <hi>Latin
Translation.</hi> And I have never yet heard
that any of its Adversaries could charge
it with any <hi>false Representation</hi> of our

pretended to be satisfied with His <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
of it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">§. 27.</note> but proceed to pursue the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> in the Sense of
our most Eminent <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi>
during the Unfortunate <hi>Reign</hi> of that

                  <p>And here, one would have thought,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59355:55"/>
that the Account I took care, on purpose,
to give, with a more than ordinary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity,
of the <hi>Convocation</hi> of 1640,
might have sufficiently convinced all
Unprejudic'd Persons, what the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of those <hi>Times</hi> was, in the <hi>present
Case.</hi> But since it is insinuated by some,

all that <hi>Power</hi> over the <hi>Convocation,</hi> for
which I am pleading; as if All this were
done meerly in compliance with the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of our Laws, and not as what Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>King,</hi> or his <hi>Archbishop,</hi> in their
<hi>Own Consciences,</hi> approved of; I will
proceed to clear this matter, a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and shew, that we have all the
Reason in the World to believe, that in
the Management of that <hi>Convocation,</hi>
they, <hi>Both</hi> of them, acted not more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> than to
the <hi>Real Sense</hi> of their <hi>Own Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was but about Twelve Years before
the <hi>Meeting</hi> of that <hi>Synod,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 28.</note> that upon the

the Account of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets,
the <hi>King</hi> was induced to publish anew
the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and to prefix his
<hi>Royal Declaration</hi> to them, suitable to
that Occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59355:55"/>
                     <hi>The</hi> Words <hi>of this</hi> Declaration <hi>are these:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Book of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1628.</note>
                     <q>Being, by <hi>God's Ordinance,</hi> according
to our just Title, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi>
and <hi>Supreme Governor</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
within these our <hi>Dominions;</hi> We hold it
most agreeable to this our <hi>Kingly Office,</hi>
and our Own Religious Zeal, to Conserve,
and Maintain the <hi>Church,</hi> committed to
our Charge, in <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>true Religion,</hi>
and in the Bond of Peace; and not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
unnecessary <hi>Disputations, Altercati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or <hi>Questions,</hi> to be Raised, which
may nourish Faction both in the Church
and Commonweal. We have therefore,
upon Mature <hi>Deliberation,</hi> and with the
<hi>Advice</hi> of so many of our <hi>Bishops,</hi> as might
conveniently be called together, thought fit
to make this <hi>Declaration</hi> following: That
the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
(which have been allow'd, and <hi>authorised</hi>
heretofore, and which our <hi>Clergy,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
have <hi>subscribed</hi> unto) do contain
the <hi>true Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
agreeable to <hi>God's Word:</hi> Which
we do, therefore, <hi>Ratify,</hi> and <hi>Confirm,</hi>
Requiring all our Loving Subjects to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Vniform Profession thereof,
and prohibiting the least difference from the
said <hi>Articles;</hi> which, to that End, we
command to be New-printed, and this Our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59355:56"/>
                        <hi>Declaration</hi> to be publish'd therewith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the beginning of this <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and in which we may already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
several notable Instances of that
<hi>Supremacy</hi> we are enquiring into. For,
<hi>1st.</hi> It is plain this <hi>King</hi> thought himself
Authoriz'd, as <hi>Supreme Governour</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> within his <hi>Dominions,</hi> to take
care of the <hi>Vnity</hi> of it; and to put an
End to those <hi>Disputes,</hi> which Some had
raised, to the manifest endangering of it.
<hi>2dly.</hi> Upon his <hi>Own mature Deliberation,</hi>
and with the <hi>Advice</hi> of such of his <hi>Bishops</hi>
as he thought fit to call to his <hi>Assistance;</hi>
he judges anew of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> contain'd in the XXXIX <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
and confirm'd by so many <hi>Synods</hi> of
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as had met, since the first
Establishment of them. And, <hi>3dly,</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that <hi>Judgment,</hi> he again <hi>Ratifies</hi> and
<hi>Confirms</hi> them; and <hi>Requires</hi> all his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
to <hi>continue</hi> in the <hi>Vniform Profession
of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But we will go on with the</hi> Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>which the</hi> King <hi>farther makes:</hi>
                     <q>That We are <hi>Supreme Governor</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and that if any
difference arise about the <hi>External Policy,</hi>
concerning the <hi>Injunctions, Canons,</hi> or
<hi>Other Constitutions,</hi> whatsoever, thereto
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59355:56"/>
belonging; the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in their <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
is to <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Settle</hi> them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
first Obtain'd <hi>Leave</hi> under Our Broad
Seal so <hi>to do;</hi> and We <hi>approving</hi> their
said <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Constitutions;</hi>
provided that none be made Contrary to
the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of the <hi>Land.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the next Paragraph; and it
gives us a clear account of the <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Synods</hi> of this <hi>Realm.</hi>
To them it belongs to <hi>deliberate</hi> of what
concerns the <hi>Policy</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and
to make <hi>Canons, &amp;c.</hi> for the <hi>Ordering</hi> of
it. But before they can do this, they
must have the <hi>King's Leave,</hi> not only
to <hi>Sit;</hi> but to Go <hi>about</hi> any such Work,
being <hi>Sate:</hi> And having done it, the
<hi>King</hi> is to have the <hi>last Review;</hi>
He is to <hi>Confirm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rolles Rep. Hill. 14. Jac. in Cam. Scacc. Colt vers. Glover. p. 454, &amp;c.</note> or <hi>Reject,</hi>
what they do; And even that
too within the Bounds that the
<hi>Laws</hi> have set both to <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But we will Go yet farther. In the
next place then the</hi> King <hi>thus</hi> declares;
<q>That out of our Princely Care, that the
<hi>Church-men</hi> may do the Work which is
<hi>Proper</hi> unto them, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
<hi>Clergy,</hi> from time to time, in <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
upon their humble Desire, shall have
<hi>Licence</hi> under our Broad Seal, to <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59355:57"/>
of, and to <hi>do</hi> all such things, as being
made plain by them, and <hi>assented</hi> unto by
<hi>Us,</hi> shall concern the <hi>setled Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> now Established,
from which we will not endure any <hi>Vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>Departing,</hi> in the least Degree.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we have not only our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Reflections, again confirm'd, but
with an Addition of some farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the <hi>Prince's Authority</hi> in these
Cases. The <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>Convocation,</hi> are
<hi>humbly</hi> to <hi>move the King</hi> for his <hi>Licence,</hi>
to do, what they shall Judge to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
for the better Establishment of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Discipline,</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England.</hi> To this the <hi>King</hi> is
pleased to promise them, at all times, a
favourable Answer: That they shall
have <hi>Leave</hi> to <hi>do,</hi> what they <hi>desire,</hi> and
he shall judge <hi>needful,</hi> to be done by them.
But still he declares it shall be with this
Restraint, that what they desire to do,
be consistent with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>
of the <hi>Church, already Establish'd:</hi>
For from that, the <hi>King</hi> Resolved that
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> even in <hi>Convocation assembled,</hi>
should not be at Liberty to <hi>Vary,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
in the least degree.</hi> All which being
supposed, yet still they are only to <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate,</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59355:57"/>
and <hi>make plain</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> what
they think to be of Use, even within
these <hi>Restrictions.</hi> But the <hi>King</hi> is to
<hi>Allow,</hi> or <hi>not Allow</hi> of it; and upon his
<hi>Rejecting,</hi> or <hi>Ratifying</hi> their <hi>Resolutions,</hi>
the whole <hi>Authority,</hi> and even <hi>Subsistence</hi>
of them is to depend.</p>
                  <p>Such was the Opinion which this
<hi>Prince</hi> had of his Own <hi>Royal Authority</hi>
over the <hi>Convocations</hi> of his <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Clergy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> Wherein the <hi>Power</hi> here claim'd
by him, comes short of what our <hi>Laws</hi>
have assign'd the <hi>King,</hi> and I, in my late
<hi>Treatise</hi> on this <hi>Argument,</hi> have contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for; it will, I believe, be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to shew. I shall only add, that this
<q>
                        <hi>Declaration was made by Him, with the</hi>
Advice <hi>of so many of the</hi> Bishops, <hi>as might
conveniently be Called together.</hi>
                     </q> Who
those <hi>Bishops</hi> were, with whom the <hi>King</hi>
consulted upon this Occasion, we are not
told. But that <hi>Archbishop Laud</hi> was One
of them, we have all the Reason in the
World to believe. He was, at that time,
a <hi>Privy-Counsellor; Dean</hi> of the <hi>Chappel;</hi>
and One of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> for the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring</hi>
of the <hi>Archbishoprick,</hi> upon the
Sequestration of <hi>Archbishop Abbot;</hi> And
especially advised with by the <hi>King,</hi> in
all Matters of Importance, relating to
the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And upon all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59355:58"/>
which accounts we may venture almost
confidently to say, that this <hi>Declaration</hi>
was, without Controversy, <hi>publish</hi>'d by
his <hi>Advice,</hi> above any Others; and
speaks <hi>his Sense,</hi> in these Matters, no
less than the <hi>King's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is indeed a thing justly to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Archbishop</hi> Laud.</note> after what I have formerly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
that any One who pretends to have
any Veneration for the Memory of that
Great <hi>Prelate,</hi> should be able to make
any doubt of his <hi>Judgment</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
The Integrity which he shew'd
in all his Actions, sufficiently assures us,
that what he <hi>Swore</hi> to, in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;
Subscribed</hi> in the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
Approved</hi> of in the <hi>Canons</hi> of the
<hi>Church; Advised</hi> in this last <hi>Declaration;</hi>
and <hi>Acted</hi> under at the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
Anno</hi> 1640, was undoubtedly
agreeable to the <hi>Inward Sense</hi> of his <hi>Own
Mind.</hi> And I would desire those who,
upon such slender Grounds, now insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
the Contrary,<note place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. pag. 117.</note> to consider, What
a mean <hi>Spirit</hi> they must take a Person
of his High <hi>Character</hi> to have been acted
by; who can suppose, that in a Matter
of such vast Concernment to the <hi>Church,</hi>
and upon which the <hi>Divine Rights,</hi> and
<hi>Authority</hi> of it, in their Opinion, so much
depend; He should nevertheless, against
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59355:58"/>
his <hi>Own Conscience,</hi> run in with the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the Times, and thereby give
so dangerous a Countenance, to those
<hi>Enslaving Principles,</hi> to which he <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, since such is the Rashness
of some Men, that they care not what
Injury they do the Greatest Personages,
so they may but seem thereby to justify
their Own Errors; I will now give such
an Evidence, not only of that <hi>Archbishop</hi>'s,
but with his of all the Other <hi>Bishops,</hi>
and the whole <hi>Convocations</hi> Sense, in
this Case, as will, I think, admit of no
Exception.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Canons</hi> of 1640;<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> (and whose
<hi>Authority,</hi> tho' I pretend not to assert, yet
I conceive I may, without Offence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them as a <hi>private Evidence</hi> of the

And when, in the first Times of

this <hi>Power,</hi> 'twas therefore only,<note n="‖" place="margin">Therefore not by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Unalienable Right which they had so to do.</note>

That they accounted the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Calling</hi>

to <hi>Vote</hi> in their <hi>Synods,</hi> but only <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical.
3dly,</hi> That <hi>Synods</hi> have the

Legis-lative Power, to make Rules and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
for keeping Good Order in the

or <hi>Appellation,</hi>
                     </q> to any <hi>Judge, Civil</hi>

<q>these Privileges not from the <hi>Magistrate,</hi>
or <hi>People,</hi> or <hi>Particular Laws</hi> of the
<hi>Country,—</hi> but Immediately from <hi>God,
&amp;c. Lastly;</hi> That they have all this <hi>Power,</hi>

him; that is, tho' he <hi>Dissents, &amp;c.</hi>

Power</hi> to <hi>call Synods, &amp;c.</hi>—It is
a Duty which the <hi>Magistrate</hi> Owes to the

have a <hi>Synod Convocated,</hi> to strengthen
<hi>their Summons</hi> by a <hi>Civil Sanction;</hi>
To secure them in Coming to the Synod, and
Returning from the Synod:—To compel
obstinate Persons, by Civil Laws and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
to submit to their Censures and

All this?—For they declare expresly, that
neither All the Power, nor any Part of the
Power, which Synods have to <hi>Deliberate
of,</hi> or to <hi>define Ecclesiastical things,</hi>
doth flow from the Magistrate.</q>
                  </p>

to <hi>Account</hi> for any thing they do?
Can he <hi>Remedy</hi> the <hi>Errors</hi> of a <hi>Synod,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Discipline?</hi> No:—</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>If you conceive that by ascribing to the
King the <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ib. numb. vi.</note> taking
Him for their <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> and by
the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Submission</hi> which ensued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, the Clergy did unwittingly <hi>ensnare
Themselves,</hi> and draw a <hi>Vassallage</hi> on
those of the Times Succeeding, inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with their <hi>Native Rights,</hi> and
contrary to the <hi>Usage</hi> of the <hi>Primitive
Church,</hi> I hope it will be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to remove that Scruple.—Its true, the
<hi>Clergy</hi> of this <hi>Realm</hi> can neither <hi>Meet</hi>
in <hi>Convocation,</hi> nor <hi>Conclude</hi> any
thing therein; nor <hi>put in Execution</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing which they have <hi>Concluded,</hi>
but as they are <hi>Enabled</hi> by the <hi>King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
But then it is as true, that this
is neither inconsistent with their <hi>Native
Rights,</hi> nor contrary to the <hi>Usage</hi> of the
<hi>Primitive Times.</hi>—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I grant, indeed, that when the Church
was under the Command of the <hi>Heathen
Emperours,</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> did <hi>Assemble</hi>
in their <hi>National,</hi> and <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
of their Own Authority. Which
<hi>Councils</hi> being <hi>Summon'd</hi> by the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi>
and <hi>Subscribed</hi> by the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
were of sufficient Power to bind all good
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59355:63"/>
Christians, who lived within the Verge of
their Authority. But it was <hi>Otherwise</hi>
when the <hi>Church</hi> came under the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of <hi>Christian Princes.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As for the <hi>Vassallage,</hi> which the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
are supposed to have drawn upon
Themselves, by this <hi>Submission;</hi> I see no
fear, or danger of it.—That which is most
insisted on for the Proof hereof, is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legating
of this <hi>Power</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi>
the VIII. to Sir <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi>—by
the Name of his <hi>Vicar General</hi> in
<hi>Ecclesiastical Matters;</hi> Who by that
Name <hi>Presided</hi> in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
1536. And this is look'd upon both
by <hi>Saunders,</hi> and some <hi>Protestant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi>
not only as a great debasing of the
<hi>English Clergy,</hi> but as a kind of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strosity
in Nature. But certainly these
Men forget—that in the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
the <hi>Emperour</hi> appointed certain
<hi>Noble-Men</hi> to sit as <hi>Judges,</hi> whose
Names Occur in the first <hi>Action</hi> of that
Council.<note place="margin">See the same tract: <hi>p. 7, 23, 24, 39, 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 41, &amp;c.</hi> more to the same Effect.</note> The like we find Exemplified
in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council; in which, by
the Appointment of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi>
the <hi>Roman Emperours, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didianus,</hi>
a Count <hi>Imperial,</hi> sat as <hi>Judge,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not Possible to imagine any thing
more express to our present Concern,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59355:64"/>
than what this Learned, and Zealous
Defender of our <hi>Church</hi> has here advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
If any One should be so Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as to imagine, that this great Man
had any Byass of private Interest upon
him, when he wrote this; He may please
to know, that this Book was set forth
by him in the time of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi>
when our <hi>Church</hi> was in its worst E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
and there seemed but little hopes
Remaining of its ever Recovering its self
to a New Establishment. But indeed
this was his real Judgment; and the
General Sense of our <hi>Clergy</hi> in those
Days. Nor had our greatest <hi>Church-Men</hi>
then learnt either to think Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the <hi>Princes Right;</hi> Or to run
down the <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> of those
Holy Men, by whose <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi>
the <hi>Reformation</hi> was carry'd on;
and many of whom sealed the <hi>Sincerity</hi>
of their <hi>Opinions,</hi> with their <hi>Own Blood.</hi>

                  <head>KING CHARLES II.</head>
                  <p>I have now but one <hi>Period</hi> more to
pass over,<note place="margin">§ 34.</note> and that a very short One too;
wherein I am to enquire, How this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
continued to be Received after the
<hi>Restauration of King Charles</hi> the II. and
upon that last <hi>Reveiw,</hi> that was then
made of our <hi>Constitution.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59355:64"/>
That, at that time, both the <hi>King,</hi>
and his <hi>Parliament,</hi> were not only well
Affected to the Interests of our <hi>Church,</hi>
but ready to concur with whatever the
<hi>Convocation</hi> could reasonably have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to Them, for the better Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, is not to be doubted. But
what then did they do, as to this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Was this enslaving <hi>Act,</hi> made by
our<note n="‖" place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. p. 107.</note> Saint <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

                     <hi>Oppressing Successors</hi> of
the <hi>Reform'd Religion;</hi> repealed by this
<hi>Zealous, Church-Parliament?</hi> Or, because
that cannot be pretended; Did that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<hi>Synod,</hi> which altered so many
Other things, ever once touch upon this,
and were stop'd in it? Neither can that
be Affirm'd.</p>
                  <p>Was there,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 119.</note> in that large Body, Any
<hi>One,</hi> (but <hi>One) Generous, Freeborn Spirit,</hi>
who being Scandalized at the Restraints
under which the <hi>Divine Rights</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> had so long lain, moved the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
to protest against the <hi>King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi>
if they could not yet be so Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as totally to shake it off? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ither
does any thing of this Occurr,
in the <hi>Diary,</hi> which I have seen, of that
<hi>Convocations</hi> Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Now that which makes me the rather
to Remark this, is, that both that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59355:65"/>
and that <hi>Convocation,</hi>
had this very Business of the
<hi>King's Supremacy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">13 Car. 2. cap. xii. <hi>An Act for Explanation of the</hi> 17 Car. 1. c. xi. <hi>Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> An <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>Repeal</hi> of a Branch of a Statute <hi>1 Eliz.</hi> c. i. concerning Commissioners for <hi>Causes Ecclesiastical.</hi>
                     </note> and the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Power,</hi> under their Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
And an <hi>Act</hi> was made
for the better <hi>Execution</hi> of the
<hi>One,</hi> but still so as not to <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi>
the <hi>Other.</hi> Here therefore was a
just Opportunity given to the <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to have declared its self; and for the
<hi>Parliament</hi> to have provided for the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi>
of the <hi>Church.</hi> They were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Repealing</hi> One <hi>Branch</hi> of that very
<hi>Statute,</hi> of the First of <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. And two

Truth,) they Neither of them thought
the <hi>Church</hi> was at all <hi>Oppress'd,</hi> by this
just <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> over it.</p>
                  <p>But we know <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> are
Obstinate things, and will no longer <hi>bend,</hi>
as they were wont to do, to the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Canon.</hi> Did the <hi>Synod</hi> therefore,
at least, make bold with its <hi>Own Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions;</hi>
and Rescind those <hi>base,</hi> and <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

<hi>Act</hi> the <hi>Churches Approbation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. Pref. and p. 122.</note> And, by
so doing, sign'd the <hi>Theta</hi> upon her <hi>Rights,

have (as far as One of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
has power to do it;) <hi>ipso facto
Excommunicated</hi> some among Us, who,
while they make a Noise in the World,
as if they only were the true <hi>Sons</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> are Really cut off
from all <hi>Communion</hi> with Her.</p>
                  <p>In a word; When upon the Review
of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> several other <hi>Alterations</hi>
were made in the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Ordaining</hi> of
<hi>Bishops, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> did they
slip aside the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> that Bond
of Iniquity,<note place="margin">Ibid. Pref. p. 1, 2.</note> contriv'd by the <hi>Atheists,</hi> and
<hi>Erastians,</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the First
of <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> on purpose to run down
the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and set up an
<hi>Oppressive Supremacy</hi> over them? But,
they still stand as they did before; and
may move some to consider, who have
been <hi>Ordain'd</hi> by these <hi>Forms,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 119.</note> How to
Reconcile the <hi>Solemn Recognition</hi> of that

with what they have since Written,
with so much Bitterness, against it.</p>
                  <p>But tho' the <hi>Convocation</hi> therefore did
nothing to Recover the <hi>Church</hi> out of that
<hi>slavish Estate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35.</note> into which former <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi>

may have Remonstrated against it. That

any have done so, till this present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
began, is what I never Heard:
This I know, that several have <hi>Asserted,</hi>
and, which is more, defended too, the
<hi>Supremacy,</hi> on its <hi>present Legal Bottom,</hi>
beyond the <hi>possibility</hi> of a <hi>Reasonable Reply.</hi>
                  </p>

<hi>Taylour.</hi> It was but a very little
while before the <hi>Restauration</hi> of King
<hi>Charles,</hi> that he published his Excellent
Book of <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Conscience;</hi> and which
has never, I conceive, fallen under any
Censure, tho' often Re-printed, since.
In these having first, in General, shewn,
that <hi>the Prince has Authority in Matters of
Religion;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Book iii. ch. 3. Rule 4.</note> and Asserted it so highly, as

                        <hi>That without it, he is but the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a King, and the Servant of his

                     </q> He proceeds, more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to lay down this, as his next <hi>Rule</hi> of
<hi>Conscience; <q>That Kings have a Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Power, in the Affairs of Religion,
and the Church.</q>
                     </hi> Which having also
shewn; his next Conclusion to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is this; §. 9. <q>
                        <hi>The Supreme Civil
Power, hath a Power of External Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in Causes of Faith:</hi>
                     </q> That is, as he
Explains himself, <q>
                        <hi>a Power to determine
what Doctrines are to be taught to the
People, and what not.</hi>

                     <hi>And to prevent mistake, he thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himself, more particularly, as to
this matter.</hi> §. 16. <q>I do not intend by
this, that whatsoever Article is by Princes
allow'd, is therefore to be accounted a part
of True Religion: For that is more than
we can justify of a Definition made by a
Synod of Bishops. But that They are to
take care that True Doctrine be Establish'd;
That they that are bound to do so, must be
supposed <hi>Competent Judges</hi> what is <hi>true
Doctrine;</hi> Else <hi>They <hi>Guide</hi>
                        </hi> their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
and <hi>some Body Else <hi>Rules</hi>
                        </hi> them:
And then <hi>Who</hi> is the <hi>Prince?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Prince then is to <hi>Judge</hi> what is
true <hi>Doctrine;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ib. Rule 8.</note> yet this He must do, by
the Assistance, and Ministries of <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Persons.—Kings</hi> are the <hi>Supreme
Judges</hi> of <hi>Law:</hi>—Yet in Cases where there
is Doubt, the <hi>Supreme Civil Power</hi> speaks
by them whose Profession it is to Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Laws. And so it is in Religion:
The King is to study the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> not
that He should wholly <hi>depend,</hi> in Religion,
upon the <hi>Sentences</hi> of <hi>Others;</hi> but be
able, of <hi>Himself,</hi> to <hi>Judge.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>—<q>But the <hi>Prince's Office</hi> of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for Religion, and his <hi>Manner</hi> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, in <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Difficulty,</hi> are rarely

Where the <hi>Emperor</hi> gives the <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                     <hi>And

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 6. He shews that <hi>Princes</hi> are not
bound to <hi>Govern</hi> their <hi>Churches,</hi> by the
<hi>Consent,</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> of their <hi>Bishops;</hi> but
only that it is Reasonable they should.
<q>
                        <hi>For</hi> (says he) Bishops <hi>and</hi> Priests, <hi>are
the most</hi> Knowing <hi>in</hi> Spiritual Affairs;
<hi>and therefore most</hi> fit <hi>to be <hi>Councellors</hi>
to the</hi> Prince <hi>in them.</hi>

                     <hi>Thus stood this</hi> Author'<hi>s Judgment in
this Case, about the Year 1669: It is
true, that being engaged against another
sort of</hi> Adversaries, <hi>and which led

we find him a little gone off from this</hi>
Hypothesis;<note place="margin">The Case of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> stated.</note> 
                     <hi>in the Year 1681. Yet even
there he is much more for the</hi> Supremacy,
<hi>than those we have now to do with. He
affirms indeed, p.</hi> 105. <q>That from the
Precedent of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in the <hi>First
Council</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Governours</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> in all Ages, enjoy'd a <hi>Power</hi>
of making <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> for
Discipline, and Good Order.</q> 
                     <hi>But withal
he adds, that</hi> 
                     <q>By the <hi>Example</hi> of the
<hi>Primitive Church,</hi> our <hi>Bishops</hi> submitted
the Exercise thereof to the <hi>King's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Authority,</hi> as we see in that famous
Act called, <hi>The Submission of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi>
Whereby (<hi>says he,</hi> p. 106.) they
do not pass away their <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>making
Ecclesiastical Canons;</hi> but only give Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to the Government, that, under that
Pretence, they would not attempt any thing
tending to the Disturbance of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or Injurious to the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the
<hi>Crown.</hi> Which, in truth, is such a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi>
as all the <hi>Clergy</hi> in the World
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59355:69"/>
ought, in duty, to make to their <hi>Sovereign,</hi>
at least in <hi>Gratitude,</hi> for his <hi>Protection;</hi>
and that without any Abatement, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of their Own Authority; <hi>viz.</hi>
The standing Laws of Christianity being
secured, to submit <hi>All Other Matters</hi> to
his <hi>Sovereign Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And p. 108. He approves King <hi>James</hi>
Reply to <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> where he lets
him know, <q>
                        <hi>That tho'</hi> Christian Kings
<hi>and</hi> Emperors, <hi>never arrogated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a</hi> Power <hi>of being</hi> Sovereign Judges
<hi>in</hi> Matters <hi>and</hi> Controversies <hi>of</hi> Faith;
<hi>yet for</hi> Moderation <hi>of</hi> Synods; <hi>for</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,
<hi>and</hi> Orders, <hi>Establish'd in</hi>
Councils; <hi>and for the</hi> Discipline <hi>of the</hi>
Church; <hi>they have made a</hi> full, <hi>and</hi>
Good <hi>Vse of their</hi> Imperial Authority.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the last Sense, if I mistake
not, of this Writer; and that when he
was in his highest <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the
<hi>Churches Authority.</hi> And all the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
I can find between his Own last,
and first Opinion, is but this; that what
He before gave the <hi>Christian Prince</hi> as
his Own due, He now grants him by
the <hi>Concession</hi> of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> yet so, as to
declare the <hi>Clergy</hi> bound to yeild it to
Him, and to affirm the <hi>Churches Rights</hi>
to be in no wise injured, or impeach'd
by it.</p>

But I shall not insist any longer on this
Authority; but pass on to consider the
Judgment of an Author, or Two, of a

Them to all Sober, and Indifferent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>Concerning the Christian Doctrine,

has any Right to Oppose any part of
the Christian Truth; yet Princes may, and
ought to, take Care of the True Profession
thereof in their Dominions; and to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
such dangerous Errours, as are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
contrary thereunto.—But in Cases
of Difficulty, for the deciding, or ending
of Controversies, about Matters of Faith;
the <hi>Disquisition, and Resolution</hi> of the
<hi>Spiritual Guides,</hi> ought to take Place,
and be Embraced.—In such Cases, the

of the <hi>Oecumenical Councils.</hi> But

to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Officers</hi> to

yet this with such <hi>Dependance</hi>
upon the <hi>Royal Power,</hi> as King <hi>Charles</hi>
has declared</q>—<hi>[that is; That they first

Case,</hi> as that in the <hi>Primitive
Times</hi> was, when the <hi>Civil Power</hi> will
not own the Church; the <hi>Ecclesiastical

establish necessary Rules of Order, as was

of such things, doth flow from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Nature of Power and Authority;
wheresoever the Temporal Power will take
that Care of the Church, which it ought,
it hath a <hi>Right</hi> to give its <hi>Establishment</hi>
to such <hi>Constitutions;</hi> and the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical

and <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,

                  </p>
                  <p>But indeed he himself in his <hi>5th Chapter,</hi>
abundantly Demonstrates both that, and
all the rest that is Contended for, in the

which are such as these: <q>That the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

                     </q>
p. 156, 158, 159, 161, 165, 170:
To be <hi>present at</hi> Them: p. 157, 160.
And by Themselves, or their Deputies,

To <hi>direct</hi> them what they should <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult</hi>

These are the <hi>Instances</hi> which may be
observed, in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> of the <hi>Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>Authority,</hi> which the antient
<hi>Emperours</hi> Exercised over their <hi>Synods</hi>
heretofore: And by which we are to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,<note place="margin">Can. 2.</note>
as our Church has taught Us,
the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of our <hi>Own Princes</hi> in the
like Cases. I shall conclude what I have
to observe from this <hi>Learned Writer,</hi>
with a Remark, which I wish some Men
would be perswaded a little more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to Consider:<note place="margin">Comp. Munic. Eccles. Pref.</note> p. 204. <q>
                        <hi>Some things
which, at first Sight, may seem an</hi> Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>of the</hi> Authority <hi>of the</hi> Church,
<hi>is rather such a way of Regulating the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of its</hi> Power, <hi>as, under</hi> Religious
Princes, <hi>is for the</hi> Churches Advantage.
<hi>Of this Nature I conceive that</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
[of the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII.] <hi>that</hi> No
new Canons shall be Enacted, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged,
or Executed, without the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Assent, and Licence, to Enact, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge,
and Execute the same. <hi>For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the</hi> Cergy <hi>give such Security to the
King, against all jealousies of Renew'd</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Usurpations, <hi>that thereupon
the Church may, under the Kings Favour,
and with the Assurance of greater Safety
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59355:72"/>
and Protection, practise upon its Establish'd
Constitutions; which are so</hi> Good, <hi>that we
have great Reason to bless God for them.
And hereupon it may also be hoped, that
what shall be farther needful, may be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-added,
by the Royal Licence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more Effectual to its End, by the
Confirmation of that Authority.</hi>

by Law, confessedly, Establish'd: And,

<hi>Member of Our Communion,</hi> to <hi>Judge</hi> in
this Case, between <hi>Me,</hi> and <hi>Those,</hi> who

Is it that I have Asserted the <hi>King's
Authority,</hi> over the <hi>Ecclesiastical Synods</hi> of
this <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Realm?</hi> But so the <hi>Laws</hi>
speak, as well as I: And to <hi>these,</hi> both
the <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
require me to <hi>Conform.</hi> Nay, they do
more; they Require me not only to
<hi>Conform</hi> my self, but to do, what in me
lies,<note place="margin">Can. 1.</note> to move All Others to the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>
of them. And if for this I must
be <hi>Censured;</hi> these <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi>
must run the same Fate with Me. And
I shall always account it an Honour, to
Suffer, for Asserting the <hi>Laws</hi> of the
<hi>Realm;</hi> and for maintaining the <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
and <hi>Constitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or is it that I have gone beyond the
<hi>Bounds</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and given a <hi>Greater,</hi>
and more <hi>General Authority,</hi> to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Prince,</hi> than either the <hi>Submission</hi>

yet not be Guilty of any <hi>Fault</hi> neither,
in the doing of it. I have before said,
and do here again <hi>Repeat</hi> it, with the

That I do not found the <hi>Right</hi> of our

                  <hi>that,</hi> or upon any Other <hi>Act,</hi> that has

                  <hi>Lawyers</hi>

particularly that which we are
here especially concern'd in, the

of a <hi>New Law,</hi> but <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory</hi>
of the <hi>Old.</hi> And therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can justly be condemn'd upon this
account, my Proofs must be Answer'd;
and it must be shewn, that what I <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe</hi>
to the <hi>King,</hi> is not a <hi>parcel</hi> of that
<hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> which was once enjoy'd by
the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> of this <hi>Realm;</hi>
and did <hi>Always,</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> belong to them.
And that, I believe, it will be no easie
Matter to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> I affirm that it is the <hi>Right</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Christian King,</hi> to <hi>Call</hi> his <hi>Clergy</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59355:75"/>
in <hi>Convocation;</hi> and that without
his <hi>Call,</hi> they cannot Regularly <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
to any such purpose, of themselves.
But so our <hi>Law</hi> expresly declares; that
the <hi>Convocation shall Evermore be Called
by the King's Writ:</hi> And it is Notorious
to Every One, who has any Knowledge
in these Matters, how dangerous it
would be for the <hi>Clergy</hi> to presume to
<hi>come together without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> I Assert that the very <hi>Persons</hi>
who meet in Our <hi>Convocations,</hi> are <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,</hi>
and <hi>Empower'd,</hi> by the <hi>King's
Writ;</hi> and that none have a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,</hi>
but such as he <hi>Calls</hi> by it. Let
the <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi> be Examined, and
let it there be seen whether the <hi>Case</hi> be
not so, as I pretend it to be. Let this
<hi>Author</hi> tell me, if he can, why such and
such <hi>Dignitaries</hi> are required, <hi>personally,</hi>
to come to the <hi>Convocation;</hi> Others to
send such a certain <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Delegates</hi>
to <hi>Represent</hi> them; but that the <hi>Writ</hi> of
<hi>Summons</hi> so <hi>Directs,</hi> so <hi>Authorizes</hi> them
to do? And tho' I do not suppose it to
be now in the <hi>King's Power</hi> to alter this
<hi>Form,</hi> yet the <hi>Sovereign Legislative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
may, without Controversy, do it;
and appoint any Other Method of Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Lower House</hi> of <hi>Convocation,</hi> that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59355:76"/>
should appear to them to be more <hi>Proper</hi>
and <hi>Expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> I declare, that by <hi>Our Law,</hi> the
<hi>Convocation</hi> can <hi>deliberate</hi> on <hi>No Canons,</hi>
or <hi>Constitutions,</hi> without first <hi>Obtaining</hi>
the <hi>King's Licence</hi> so to do. It is the
express Resolution of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:</hi>
And our <hi>Convocations</hi> do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
notoriously, Govern their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings</hi>
by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> I add, That heretofore, the
<hi>Christian Emperors</hi> prescribed to their
<hi>Synods,</hi> the very <hi>Method</hi> they should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
in handling the <hi>Matters</hi> which lay
before them. This indeed I affirm;
and, I think, I have proved it too.
And, if to this End, Our <hi>King</hi> should
think fit, either Himself to Come; or
to Appoint any Other to <hi>Preside</hi> in his
Stead, and <hi>Direct</hi> the <hi>Debates</hi> of our <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
as he should Command them to
do; I do not see that he would therein
do any more, than what some of the best
<hi>Christian Princes</hi> have done before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> I pretend, that to the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi>
it belongs to <hi>Confirm,</hi> or <hi>Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
such of the <hi>Acts</hi> of their <hi>Synods</hi> as
they think fit. Our <hi>Laws</hi> agree to it;
Our <hi>Kings</hi> claim it; Our <hi>Convocations
submit</hi> to, and <hi>approve,</hi> of it. And let
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59355:76"/>
those who scruple this, consider, how
low they sink the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Prince;</hi>
if they leave him not the <hi>Power,</hi> which
every ordinary Person claims, of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
for <hi>Himself;</hi> but would oblige him,
at a venture, to <hi>Confirm</hi> whatsoever the
<hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Consistory</hi> shall please to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> That the <hi>Prince</hi> may <hi>Alter</hi> their
<hi>Constitutions,</hi> I no otherwise affirm, than
as I say it is in his <hi>Power</hi> to make <hi>Laws</hi>
in <hi>Matters Ecclesiastical:</hi> And that for the
doing of this, He may <hi>Advise</hi> with his
<hi>Clergy,</hi> and follow their <hi>Counsel,</hi> so far
as he approves of it. Thus <hi>Charles</hi> the
<hi>Emperor</hi> made up his <hi>Capitular:</hi> And
thus any Other <hi>Sovereign Prince,</hi> may
take the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and form
them in such Wise into an <hi>Ecclesiastical
Law,</hi> as he thinks will be most for the
<hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> of his
<hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7thly.</hi> In Cases of <hi>Appeals,</hi> I shew
what <hi>Power</hi> the Antient <hi>Emperors</hi> both
<hi>Claim'd,</hi> and <hi>Exercised:</hi> And I modestly
Vindicate to our <hi>Own Sovereign</hi> the same
<hi>Authority,</hi> which the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
without all Scruple, allow'd to their
<hi>Princes.</hi> And except it be in such Cases
where the <hi>King</hi> is a Party,<note place="margin">4 Inst. pag. 340.</note> and the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi>
therefore is to stop at the <hi>Vpper
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59355:77"/>
House</hi> of <hi>Convocation;</hi> I see no Reason
why this <hi>Authority</hi> should not be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the <hi>King,</hi> and I conceive the
<hi>Law</hi> of our <hi>Realm</hi> does allow of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8thly.</hi> As for the <hi>Dissolving</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
that is so evidently a part of
the <hi>Royal Jurisdiction,</hi> and has been so
fully adjudged to belong to the <hi>King;</hi>
that I do not see what Exceptions can
be taken at it. However the <hi>Constant
Practice</hi> of our <hi>Convocations,</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is on my Side: And I have herein
ascribed no <hi>Authority</hi> to the <hi>Prince,</hi> but
what our <hi>Clergy,</hi> for above these Hundred
and Fifty Years last past, have constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>submitted</hi> to; and, by that <hi>Submission</hi>
alone, have sufficiently Vested in Him.</p>
               <p>But if I am not mistaken in <hi>Point</hi> of
<hi>Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 40.</note> what is it that deserves so <hi>Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
an <hi>Outcry,</hi> as this late <hi>Author</hi> has
made against me? Is it, that being a
<hi>Clergy-Man</hi> my self, I appear'd in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
of the <hi>King's Authority</hi> over the
<hi>Clergy;</hi> and which, in some Mens No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is the same thing as to say, <hi>against
the Rights of the Church?</hi> So indeed the
<hi>Convocation</hi> seem'd to think, in the Case
of Dr. <hi>Standish,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Pref.</note> heretofore; and so Some
seem to account it now. But, God be
thanked, the Reformed <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
never yet thought it any <hi>Offence</hi> in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59355:77"/>
her Clergy to stand up for the just
<hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Prince;</hi> nor have I any
Apprehension that I shall ever be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
upon this account, by any <hi>True
Members</hi> of Her Communion. And for
Others, give me leave to ask, only; Am
I the <hi>First,</hi> of Our <hi>Order,</hi> that have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
on this Occasion? Or do I stand
<hi>Alone</hi> in <hi>this Cause?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what then shall we say of all
those Learned <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Clergy-Men,</hi>
whose Books I have here Quoted to the
same Purpose? Nay rather, what shall
we say of those whole <hi>Convocations,</hi> who
compiled our <hi>Articles, and Canons?</hi> And
have Obliged us thereby, not only Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
to Defend the Kings <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Can.</note>
but to the best of our <hi>Wit, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> publickly to <hi>Declare,</hi>
and <hi>Confirm</hi> it to our <hi>Congregations,</hi> four
times every Year. If this be that for
which I ought to be <hi>Censured;</hi> I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
so great a part of our <hi>Order</hi> will
go along with me, as may make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Scandalous to stay behind: And be
number'd among that Little, Noisy,
Turbulent Party, that now set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up as <hi>Judges</hi> over Us.</p>
               <p>But if both the Law be on my side;<note place="margin">§ 41.</note>
and it be no improper Enterprize for a
<hi>Clergy-Man</hi> to appear in; What shall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59355:78"/>
we say, more? Was the <hi>Time</hi> impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
Did I take an Unseasonable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of Asserting this Authority?</p>
               <p>Nay but this They should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
who by appearing so Eagerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Princes Power</hi> over the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
made it absolutely Necessary for
some or Other of our Church, to do her
<hi>Right;</hi> and let the World know, that
she never <hi>Commission'd</hi> any of her <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
to broach any such <hi>Principles,</hi> on
her Behalf. That she is content to <hi>Act</hi>
under the <hi>Royal Supremacy;</hi> and is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that it is her <hi>Duty</hi> so to do. That
if some <hi>Hot Men,</hi> (for ought she knows
her <hi>Enemies,</hi>) will under pretence of
asserting such a <hi>Power</hi> to her, as she has
always disclaim'd, endeavour to raise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Jealousies in the Mind of her Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
against her; it is what she cannot
help: And she hopes, she shall not be the
worse Accounted of, for such <hi>Attempts,</hi>
as she neither approves of, nor knows
how to Prevent.</p>
               <p>And now,<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> there is but One thing more,
that can, I think, be Objected against my
Undertaking: And I shall lay it down
in the Words in which it is Charged
upon me.<note place="margin">Municip. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Pref. p. 5. Comp. p. 3.</note> For what if the <hi>Publick from
such a Work (inscribed to the</hi> Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan)
<hi>should be tempted to proceed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59355:78"/>
Resolves against the Powers Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archicall?</hi>
This I confess would be such
a use of it, as I should be heartily sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for; tho' even, in such a Case, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell whether I should ever the more
deserve to be Censured for what I had
done. There can nothing be either so
well Design'd, or so carefully Perform'd,
of which an ill Use may not be made.
And if that should be Sufficient to cry
down any Undertaking, I do not see
how we shall be able to Satisfie our
Consciences, in anything we have to do.</p>
               <p>But, in Reason, I am sure the <hi>Church</hi>
might have expected to suffer much
more by the <hi>Letter to the Convocation
Man,</hi> than by the <hi>Answer</hi> which I made
to it. When <hi>Church-Men</hi> set up their
<hi>Divine Rights,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Laws</hi>
of their <hi>Country;</hi> and upon <hi>Visionary
Notions,</hi> endeavour to lead Men into
<hi>Discontents</hi> against their <hi>Governours;</hi> it
is <hi>Natural,</hi> not to say <hi>Necesiary,</hi> for
<hi>Princes</hi> to look to themselves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how to stop those <hi>Attempts</hi> at the
Beginning, which, Experience has shewn
them, may Otherwise, in time, <hi>grow</hi> too
<hi>strong</hi> for Them. It was the Intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Insolence,</hi> and <hi>Vsurpations,</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> that made her first <hi>Fear'd,</hi>
then <hi>Hated;</hi> and, at last, crush'd the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59355:79"/>
                  <hi>Hierarchic</hi> in many Places, to peices.
And whatever Party shall think fit to
pursue the same <hi>Methods,</hi> ought, in all
Reason, to expect the same <hi>Treatment.</hi>
If <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> will enjoy the <hi>Protection</hi>
of <hi>Princes,</hi> it is but Reasonable that
they should be Content to acknowledge
their <hi>Authority.</hi> To contend for more
<hi>Power,</hi> than either <hi>Christ</hi> has left us; or
our <hi>Calling</hi> requires, or the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
<hi>Councils,</hi> under the first <hi>Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi>
pretended to, or desired; is neither
<hi>Prudent,</hi> nor <hi>Justifyable:</hi> It is to render
the <hi>Church</hi> suspected by the <hi>State;</hi> and to
set those <hi>Powers</hi> in <hi>Opposition</hi> to, which
ought mutually to <hi>Help,</hi> and <hi>Support,</hi> One-Another.</p>
               <p>I have before shewn what Opinion
a very Learned Man,<note place="margin">See above §. 37.</note> upon this Ground,
had of the <hi>Act of Submission,</hi> now so
much railed at, in these Days. He look'd
upon it as a <hi>Law</hi> of great <hi>Benefit</hi> to the
<hi>Church,</hi> even for this Reason alone, that
it freed the <hi>Civil Powers</hi> from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any more <hi>Fears,</hi> and <hi>Jealousies,</hi> of
the <hi>Clergy.</hi> This was a Remark found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon <hi>Good Reason,</hi> as well as upon
the <hi>Experience</hi> of those former <hi>Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi>
which the <hi>Clergy</hi> had run into, for
want of such a <hi>Restraint.</hi> And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but every Day more and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59355:79"/>
the <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God</hi> towards
our <hi>Church,</hi> in that very thing, for
which some Men so Tragically lament
the <hi>Oppression,</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> of it: Being
fully Perswaded that nothing, at this
Day, preserves us from <hi>Ruin,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation;</hi>
but that we have not <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
of our selves, to do the <hi>Church</hi> a
<hi>Mischief;</hi> and the <hi>Prince,</hi> who sees but
too much of our <hi>Tempers,</hi> is too <hi>Gracious</hi>
to Us, and has too <hi>Great</hi> a <hi>Concern</hi> for
the <hi>Churches Good,</hi> to <hi>suffer</hi> Us to do it.</p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Advantages</hi> which I
look upon the <hi>Church</hi> to derive to her
self from this <hi>Act.</hi> It prevents all <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,</hi>
which either the <hi>Odd Principles,</hi>
the <hi>Violent Tempers,</hi> Or the <hi>Wicked
Designs,</hi> of some Men, might justly raise
in the Minds of our <hi>Governours</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us: And frees them from all.
<hi>Temptation,</hi> as well as from all <hi>Need,</hi> of
laying any <hi>farther Restraints</hi> upon Us.
It encourages the <hi>Civil Powers</hi> to be
willing to allow us both <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>come
Together,</hi> and <hi>leave</hi> to <hi>Deliberate,</hi> of what
may be <hi>Profitable</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi> when
ever they shall Judge it to be, in any
wise, <hi>Needful,</hi> or but <hi>Proper</hi> so to do.
And, in the mean while, it hinders us
from throwing all into <hi>Confusion,</hi> in
such Times of <hi>Faction,</hi> and <hi>Discontent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59355:80"/>
of <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Animosities,</hi> as we are at
present in; to the certain <hi>Scandal,</hi> and
<hi>Division,</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> it may be, to
a <hi>New Confusion</hi> of All things in the <hi>State</hi>
too.</p>
               <p>And thus have I deliver'd the Real
Sense of my <hi>Own Conscience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 43.</note> in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before me. I have shewn what my
<hi>Principles,</hi> as to the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi>
are; and from <hi>Whom</hi> I have <hi>Learnt</hi>
them. That the <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Articles,</hi> and
<hi>Canons</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> are my <hi>Instructors:</hi>
And all these, as explain'd to me, by the
<hi>Greatest,</hi> and most <hi>Eminent</hi> of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
both for <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>Ability,</hi>
that Our <hi>Church</hi> has produced ever since
the <hi>Reformation.</hi> All that I desire, in
Return, is, That those who now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
so vehemently against me, in this
Point, would as freely declare <hi>their
Sense;</hi> and as plainly shew from
whom they have Received it. If they
can make as fair a Plea to our <hi>Church's
Patronage,</hi> as I have here done, I must
then ingenuously Own, I have been
Greatly Mistaken. If they cannot, I
shall then leave them under this <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;</hi>
that whatever they may pretend,
they must, in Reality, be either of the
<hi>Conclave,</hi> or of the <hi>Consistory;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
this Cause, for the <hi>Pope,</hi> or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59355:80"/>
for the <hi>Kirk.</hi> Whether of these Parties
they will fly unto, to me it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
This I am sure of, that if they
are resolved to hold to our <hi>Church,</hi> in
Defiance of Her <hi>Doctrine;</hi> they must, at
least, be confessed to be in a very low
Degree of <hi>Communion</hi> with Her: She
having solemnly, by her <hi>Canons,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them from her <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and left
them no Regular method of returning
to the participation of them, but by the
<hi>Archbishop's, Absolution;</hi> and that upon
<hi>Sincere Repentance</hi> for <hi>what</hi> they have
done, and after a <hi>Publick Revocation of
their present <hi>Wicked Errors.</hi>
