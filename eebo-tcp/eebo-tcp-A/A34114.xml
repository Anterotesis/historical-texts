            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Iſedome is ſaid (by <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> to be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many and by marvellous things: <hi>(Cicero)</hi> the knowledge of divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, as alſo of the cauſes in which they are contained: (by <hi>Solomon)</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and teacher of all things: which with how great praiſes it hath of old beene cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, thoſe who have ſpent any endeavours in the ſtudy of it, cannot be ignorant.

                  <p>If you aske the cauſe, why this one vertue is ſo much magnified, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> will anſwer, <q>That without the ſtudy of wiſdome it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to lead an happy, or even an indifferent life. And <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, That wiſedome is the mother of all Arts, teaching us firſt how to worſhip <hi>God,</hi> then how to obſerve juſtice in humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and alſo framing our minds to modeſty and magnanimity: She drives away darkneſſe from our mind's, as it were from our eyes, that we may diſcerne all things both above us, and below us, and things of all orders, natures, and degrees whatſoever: and laſtly, that ſhe is the onely ſoveraigne medicine of the mind. And <hi>Solomon</hi> addeth, that Wiſedome ſtrengtheneth the wiſe man more than ten mighty men, that are in the City, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 19. And that wiſedome is a treaſure unto men that never faileth, which they that uſe, become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts, that come from learning. For God loveth not any, but him that dwelleth with wiſdome, <hi>VViſd.</hi> 7. 14, 28.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not without good cauſe therefore have the moſt excellent men in all ages, neglected the care of tranſitory things, as of riches, pleaſures, and honours, applying their deſires, and endeavours to this end, that by a ſerious contemplation of all things, they might comprehend whatſoever the mind of man is capable of, and ſo bring the whole world into a kind of ſubjection unto themſelves: which kind of men in reſpect of others, are indeed (as the gift of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is in compariſon of other good things granted unto men) moſt glittering pearles, or ſtarres rather, that do drive away the darkneſſe of the world. We ought therefore thankfully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Divine worke of Gods mercy, that hee hath not onely opened unto us the Theaters of his wiſdome in the bookes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of the holy Scripture, but hath moreover endued us with Senſe, and Reaſon, that we might be able to behold them, and to collect wiſedome out of them, ſupplying us farther with divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, where our Senſe and Reaſon are deficient. Yet this is not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49470:3"/>
all we owe unto his goodneſſe; for he hath moreover preſerved unto this our age the knowledge of humane learning, by which the ſtudy of wiſedome is cheriſhed, and tranſmitted unto us from our Progenitors; yea and hath made it to flouriſh more now, than ever heretofore. So that this preſent age may in reſpect of learning juſtly take content, and pleaſure in its ſelfe, expecting ſtill a further diſcovery of its light, and luſtre. For it muſt needs be in the world, as it is with man, that wiſedome comes not afore old age, which we may eaſily ſee, if wee conſider the nature of it. For wiſedome is gained by much experience: and experience requireth length of time, and variety of occurrences. Now the longer a man liveth, the more varieties ſtill paſſe by him, whence his experience is encreaſed the more, and by his experience his wiſedome, according to that of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi> A man of experience will thinke of many things: And that of the Poet,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Per caſus varios Ariem experientia fecit,</hi>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We therefore in this preſentage being ſo well ſtored with experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as no former ages could have the like, why ſhould we not raiſe our thoughts unto ſome higher aime? For not onely by the benefit of Printing (which Art God ſeemes, not without ſome My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, to have reſerved to theſe latter times) what ſoever was inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly invented by the Ancients (though long buried in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) is now come to light: but alſo moderne men being ſtirred up by new occaſions, have attempted new inventions: and Wiſdome hath beene, and is daily miraculouſly multiplied with variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments. According as God hath foretold of theſe latter times, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. Whereunto may be added the erecting of Schooles every where more, then any Hiſtories record of any former ages: whereby bookes are growne ſo common in all Languages and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that even common countrey people, and women themſelves are familiarly acquainted with them; whereas formerly the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thoſe that were rich, could hardly at any price obtaine them. And now at length the conſtant endeavour of ſome breakes forth to bring the Method of ſtudies to ſuch a perfection, that whatſoever is found worthy of knowledge, may with much leſſe labour, then heretofore, be attained unto. Which if it ſhall ſucceed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49470:4"/>
(as I hope) and that there be an eaſie way diſcovered of teaching all men all things, I ſee not what ſhould hinder us from a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgment, and hearty embracing of that Golden Age <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of light and knowledge, which hath beene ſo long foretold, and expected.</p>
                  <p>To the attaining whereunto one matter of ſpeciall moment ſeemeth yet to be wanting, that as a more compendious, uſefull, and eaſie way of teaching the tongues hath lately been found out, and publiſhed (in the <hi>Janua Linguarum;)</hi> ſo alſo ſome means ſhould be thought of for the making of an open gate unto the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereby mens minds may finde an eaſie entrance into all Arts and Sciences whatſoever. Which how neceſſary, and worthy of our moſt ſerious thoughts it is, (if we tender as we ought, the good of mankind) I will firſt demonſtrate: next I will conſider of the meanes for accompliſhing ſo worthy a deſigne: and laſtly I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover upon what occaſion, and with what ſucceſſe I my ſelfe have attempted ſo rare a work.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I take it for granted, that the ſtudies of learning, to which Youth is every where ſet, ought to bee the dreſſing and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing of their minds towards the attaining of Wiſdome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which end it can be nothing elſe but meere vanity. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſeeke knowledge for curioſity, or to pleaſe, and delight our mind, or to raiſe our ſelves in eſteeme, and credit in the world, or as the meanes to better our outward eſtates, and fortunes, we are too groſſely minded to propoſe ſo baſe, and temporary ends to a gift ſo high, and ſo divine. It muſt therefore be agreed upon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that Wiſdome is the thing we are to ſeeke. And becauſe Wiſdome is ſaid to be the worker of all things, teaching all things, <hi>Wiſdome</hi> 7. 22. it is evident, that learning ought to be uſed, and improved as the meanes to bring us unto the univerſall knowledge of all things, (unto Panſophie, that is, a Wiſdome every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, both in the largeneſſe of its extent, and in its perfect agreement with it ſelfe) that we be not ignorant of any thing which is ſecret, or knowne, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 7. 21. That ſo mans mind may become indeed, as it ought to be, the image of God, who knoweth all things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas Wiſdome is ſaid to give unto the young man <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, whereas the wayes of Wiſdome are ſaid to be a ſhining light, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. 18. it followes that they ought to be free from all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of errors.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wiſdome is ſaid to be uſefull unto men for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their wayes, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 4. 18, 19.) and all things that they doe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9. It followes therefore, that the ſtudies of Wiſdome ought to prepare mens minds for doing, and ſuffering of all things incident to this life.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Wiſdome is ſaid to make men happy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 13. becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> it leads them to God the eternall fountaine of happineſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtudy thereof ought neceſſarily to ſtirre up mens minds to the ſeeking of God, to ſhew them the way how to finde him, and to prepare their affections for the ſtraiter imbracing of him in the bonds of love. Otherwiſe all endeavours of this ſort are utterly unprofitable. For if men hit not upon this end of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it were better for them to know nothing, yea, rather that they had never beene borne.</p>
                  <p>Now then let us examine whether the common courſe of ſtudies be ſutable to theſe ends, that if we find any defects therein, we may thereby know the better what is to be amended.</p>
                  <p>It is the common complaint of many, that the learning which is now taught in Schooles, is a thing too tedious, and long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſhortneſſe of life, too laborious for common capacities, too narrow in reſpect of the amplitude of things, and in regard of the ſubtilty, and ſolidity of their truth many wayes defective. And the wiſer ſort have noted, that it is not anſwerable to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed end; ſeldome attaining to any ſubſtantiall uſes of life, but rather ending in the ſmoake of opinionative brawlings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: which that they are not idle ſayings and ſurmiſes, but even reall defects, we muſt firſt declare, before we undertake to ſeeke remedies to redreſſe them. We muſt, I ſay, make it good, that the ſtudies of learning, as they are now managed, and commonly taught in Schooles, are not well proportioned.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>The firſt argument of their prolixity I take from the common confeſſion of all. For who is there that hath not uſually in his mouth that ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Life is ſhort, but Art is long? The ſecond argument is from the greatneſſe of the bookes, in which things are deſcribed. Good God! what vaſt volumes are compiled almoſt of every matter, which if they were laid together, would raiſe ſuch heapes, that many millions of yeares would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to peruſe them? Thirdly, it is manifeſt enough, that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is too farre diffuſed, and ſcattered about, beyond the modell, and reach of mens capacities, ſeeing that among ſo many learned men, with which the world is repleniſhed, ſcarce one of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or of a thouſand is to be found, who hath taſted of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall learning, and is able to give any reaſonable account of all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that are to be found in divine workes, and humane affaires. So rare is the generality of learning, even in thoſe that are held to be learned, that a man of much learning, or of much reading, is reputed almoſt for a miracle. Hence comes that (ſo commonly uſed) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling and tearing of learning into peeces, that men making their choyce of this, or that Art, or Science, take no care ſo much, as to looke into any of the reſt. Divines there are, that will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to caſt an eye upon Philoſophy: and Philoſophers againe, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> have as little regard of Divinity. Lawyers for the moſt part neglect the ſtudy of naturall Cauſes: and Phyſitianslikewiſe of Law, and equity. Every faculty boundeth out a ſeverall Kingdome for its ſelfe, without thoſe common, certaine, and immovable grounds and Lawes, which ſhould bind them all together. And even in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy it ſelfe, one chooſeth this part, and another that. Some will be Naturaliſts not regarding the Mathematicks: and others will be Morall Philoſophers, without any knowledge of naturall things; They will be accounted Logicians, Rhetoricians, and Poets, though they have ſcarce a whit of reall Science in them. Who knowes not, that this is ſo? and who ſees not, that this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and ſharing of Arts, and Sciences, proceeds from this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, That it is not poſſible for the wit of one man to attaine the knowledge of them all? As if God had not proportioned Man the Lord of all things to thoſe things, that he hath ſet him over. Not that I am ſo fond, as to thinke one man may be excellent in all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49470:5"/>
things, but that I reſt well aſſured, that every one may, and ſhould, as be eminent in his owne profeſſion, ſo alſo know all things that are neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The difficulty (I meane, that it is not eaſie for men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, even unto ſuch particular parcels of learning, as they make choyce of for themſelves) is too notorious by frequent teſtimonies. Firſt, by the common complaints, not onely of youth, who are learners, but even of their Maſters, and Teachers. Then by thoſe ſtripes, laſhings, and outcries, wherewith Schooles continually ring. Whereas the holy Scripture commends Wiſdome, and the ſtudy thereof to be delightfull: and the Ancients ſeeme to have ſo eſteemed them, terming Schooles <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Otium.</note> 
                     <hi>Scholas, &amp; ludos literarios,</hi> meaning, that the ſtudy of learning was but a pleaſant paines-taking, or ſerious recreation. What a monſtrous thing is it then, that ſuch pleaſures are turned into preſſures, and ſuch paſtimes into torments? Whence, I ſay, can this proceed, but from the difficulty of making any progreſſe according to our preſent method of teaching? For it is that which makes the ſtudy of learning, not onely laborious, but even nauſeous, that the greater part of ſuch as are ſet unto it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon it, and forſake it, never minding to returne there to gather flowers, where they have encountred with ſo many thornes. And common practiſe alſo will prove the ſame: For who can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how much eaſier it is to learne a Language by uſe among thoſe that ſpeake it, then in the Schooles (which is the common way) where it is hardly learned in many yeares? And even the ſame advantage might we make uſe of in attaining of knowledge in things themſelves, which yet hath not hitherto beene put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Many wiſe men have long ſince obſerved, that the truth of the Sciences is but lame, and unperfect, and thereupon have vented forth frequent complaints of thoſe deepe gulfes, wherein it is plunged: Yea, ſome over-conſcious of their imperfections, have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> beene bold to pronounce <hi>Nihil ſciri poſſe (i. certo &amp; ſine errore)</hi> That nothing could be certainely knowne. Which ſaying, they that (upon confidence of their owne firme, and ſtable knowledge) did deride, and hiſſe at, as a dotage, and folly, yet have in the event themſelves almoſt confirmed it to be true. For whatſoever any one of them affirmed, others were preſently ready to gaine-ſay it. And even unto this day there is no end of their perplexities. For Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is full of nothing but diſſentions, contradictions, and wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49470:6"/>
Which, what can it be elſe, but aſtrong teſtimony, that the truth therof every where ſtaggers, and is unſtable For by this very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>Joſephus</hi> (againſt <hi>Apion)</hi> aſſerteth the truth of the Wiſdome of the Hebrewes, and proves the vanity of that of the Greekes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former continued alwayes one and the ſame, but the other was divided into many Sects. For Truth alwayes retaines one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and native forme: but errors walk in a thouſand ſhapes. Seeing therefore, that in this our age alſo there ariſe ſo many Sects, both in Divinity, and Philoſophy, and ſo many contrary opinions are tooth and naile defended, which differ from themſelves, as much as light from darkneſſe; what is it but a moſt certaine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that all the learning our age can yet make boaſt of, is deepely plunged in the darkneſſe of ignorance? Since the judgement of Charity preſuppoſeth, that none doth erre willingly contrary to his knowledge, or rebelleth againſt the light, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap. 24. verſ.</hi> 13. The laſt teſtimony hereof ſhall be thoſe many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> bookes which are daily publiſhed, which are nothing elſe but ſparkes, that riſe from the ſtriking of wits together, every one fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſeverall way for to raiſe a flame. But the darkneſſe of diſſentions, and doubts ſtill continuing, is an evident argument, that there are yet no true lights kindled, and that the bright Sunne of Truth is not yet riſen among us.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Learning as it is commonly taught, is not enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the uſes of our life; and of this we have notable witneſſes. <q>Philoſophy, ſaith a famous man, is impriſoned in the Schooles, neither is there any man that brings it forth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe: for it is full of thornes, and buſied altogether in tying of ſuch knots which cannot be looſed, and in raveling out, what her ſelfe hath woven. She feeds men with nothing but gravelly bread, ſuch as breakes the teeth, and tireth out mens wits with trifles, and vanities, which are full of ſtings. Another ſaith, that the ſtudy of Philoſophy is nothing elſe but <hi>(otium occupatum, &amp; impeditum)</hi> a buſie, and diſtracted vacation to no purpoſe. And like as Squirrels that are ſhut into a turning cage, how faſt ſoever they tumble forward, yet are they no farther then they were: ſo is it with us Philoſophers: we learne but little, though wee take great paines, and that little ſeldome makes us better, but worſe.</q> That which common experience proveth to be true: For not onely doe the learned ſeldome excell thoſe that are illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the ſtudy of Vertue (which is the Baſis of civill converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49470:6"/>
but alſo in the dextrous managing of buſineſſes they are for the moſt part excelled by them. I ſpeake it not onely of a few odde Grammarians, for the moſt part the deepeſt Philoſophers, &amp; Divines, though they ſeeme Eagles to themſelves, with their abſtracted ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, yet are they as blind as Moles in matters of this life, and of humane ſociety. Hence aroſe that ſcoffing proverb, <hi>Bonus Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticus, malus Politicus,</hi> A good Scholler, and a bad Common-wealths-man: whereas indeed the Schoole ought to prepare us for things incident to our lives.</p>
                  <p>But to particularize a little: every one knowes how the ſtudy of Metaphyſicks is praiſed, and even extolled unto Heaven, as the firmeſt ground-worke and higheſt accompliſhment of all Learning. And if we conſider aright of it, ſo it is. Yet becauſe this Queen of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences is ſo beſet with thornes, and ſo involv'd in obſurity, that few can reach unto thoſe ſubtilties, and thoſe that underſtand them, know not how to make any uſe of them in inferiour Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it comes to paſſe, that it reſts, and dies with it ſelfe, and, except a little momentary and tickling pleaſure which it yeelds to thoſe that doe affect it, it is of very little uſe in humane affaires. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, ſome doe not onely forſake it, and utterly exclude it out of the compaſſe of Philoſophy, (as the Ramiſts doe) but even out of Univerſities, as an unprofitable, and fruitleſſe vanity. For <hi>Johannes Angelius Werdenbagen</hi> witneſſeth, that the King of <hi>Sweden, Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> of famous memory (whoſe exploits teſtifie, that he was not borne to trifling, but to ſerious action) did by a publike edict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate all ſtudies of the Metaphyſickes out of his Kingdome, ſo that no Bookſellers might cauſe any ſuch bookes to be imported upon paine of confiſcation, nor any of his ſubjects might reade them, leſt his Kingdome ſhould be bewitched with a new kind of Barbariſme, and himſelfe ſerved with diſputers, and gloſſers in ſtead of ſuch, as would throughly follow his affaires.</p>
                  <p>The ſtudie of Logicke and Rhetoricke ſhould indeed be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated unto the affaires of our life, ſeeing they are intended as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of reaſon, and ſpeech, on which two bonds all humane things ſo much depend. But the teſtimony of <hi>Jacobus Acontius</hi> is too truly verified: <q>There is every where, ſaith hee, a great number of Logicians, but if you obſerve their writings, and diſputations; you will find but little Logicke in them. And againe, You may obſerve many well ſeene in Rhetoricke, whoſe ſpeeches and ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though they be copious, elegant, well trimmed, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49470:7"/>
yet you will find the ſtrength and power of perſwaſion wanting.</q> And we may paſſe the ſame judgement of the other Arts and Sciences: that we are rather buſied and detained about them, than that they do any wayes promote the buſineſſe of our life.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Laſtly, to prove that our ſtudies of learning are not yet ſo ordered, as to lead us the true, and certaine way toward our end, which is God, what need is there of any witneſſes? The prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the luxury, the pride, and revelling, the quarrelling and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie of our Univerſities ſpeake it out too loud. And alaſſe! even the learning it ſelfe, which is there obtained, proves unto many but a whetſtone of miſchiefe, and an helpe to do evill all their daies: ſo that it is moſt true of the greateſt number of thoſe that are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which God himſelfe complaineth of; They are wiſe to do evill, but to do good they have no underſtanding. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 22. And to ſuch their wiſedome is but a guide unto deſtruction: Hence is that voyce from God, that not many wiſe are choſen, becauſe the wiſedome of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God. Indeed that this ſentence may not fall flat upon our ſelves, we uſe to interpret it of the wiſedome of the Gentiles, but yet we our ſelves ſeeke not for any farther wiſedome. For that which the Schooles have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto commended to us, is derived from Gentiliſme, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſerpentine venome, affecting onely the knowledge of good and evill, which puffeth up, but not conducing to charity, which edifieth. And becauſe wee are according to our hereditary perverſneſſe readier alwaies to excuſe, than to amend our faults; we grow moreover, by pretending the corruption of our nature, to flatter and content our ſelves; as if it were impoſſible to be againe transformed, ſince we are thus depraved. As if the feare of the Lord ought not to be an antidote againſt that corruption, which God hath ſo often pronounced to be both the beginning, and the end of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> wiſdome. Therefore we conclude it to be true, that the common ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of learning are,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. A buſineſſe never comming to an end.</item>
                     <item>II. A moſt troubleſome diſtraction of mens minds.</item>
                     <item>III. A road of perpetuall by-waies, and errours.</item>
                     <item>IV. An hindrance to the affaires of our lives.</item>
                     <item>V. And laſtly, an occaſion of our manifold wandrings out of the wayes of God, which is moſt to be lamented.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Many worthy men have in former times beene much affected with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49470:7"/>
this hard condition of learning, and learned men, and according to their ſeveral fancies have ſought ſeverall waies to ſalve this ſore: ſome being of opinion, that all that ancient learning borrowed from the Gentiles, was to be quite rejected: others, that Philoſophie, and the other Arts were to be uſed ſparingly, and with much care, and choyce: ſome have attempted the transforming, and altering of all the Sciences, one after this manner, another after that. And indeed it is more than neceſſary, that all ſuch, as are able to afford any ayd or counſell in this matter, ſhould put to their helping hands. Firſt, that that little knowledge, which common learning ſupplies us with, may not coſt us ſo much ſweat and paines, or if we are willing to employ our labours therein, that they may be more beneficiall and profitable to us.</p>
                  <p>And againe, that we may vindicate our ſelves and learning from the reproach of the illiterate rout, who (while they behold ſuch as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> are for their learning preferred before themſelves, and ſee them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent in morall honeſty, nor pious zeale, nor even in reall and common skill, and cunning, but many times to come behind many of the meaneſt and ſinpleſt ſort, they) often fall into deriſion, and contempt of learning. And laſtly, leſt we incurre Gods anger (who ſeekes by that heavenly gift of wiſedome, to repaire his Image in us) if we be not faithfull deſpenſers of ſo divine a gift unto his glory.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it is a raſh thing to undertake the cure of any diſeaſe, before we have found the true cauſe of it, let us now make triall, whether wee can eſpie, and make diſcovery of the true rootes and grounds of this ſo great a miſchiefe that learning groaneth under: that ſo we may the more ſafely apply fit remedies thereto: I will therefore give you a true account of thoſe things which I conceive to be the cauſes of the fore-mentioned evils, and withall what may be done for the rectifying thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The Prolixity of ſtudies, as they are commonly ordered, ſeemeth <note place="margin">Prolixity.</note> to ariſe from three grounds; Firſt, becauſe there is not care enough taken to leave out unneceſſary things from among thoſe which are neceſſary; for thence according to <hi>Seneca's</hi> complaint, we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of neceſſary things, becauſe we buſie our ſelves too much in learning thoſe things, which are not neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And if theſe things ſhould be ſequeſtred from our ſtudies, we ſhould have twice as much time, (to ſpeake at the leaſt) or but halfe as much taske to do. Now theſe things are to be accounted unneceſſary.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49470:8"/>
Firſt, whatſoever is not of the eſſence of learning, of which ſort are the moſt part of the vanities of the Gentiles, the name of their petty Deities, together with their lying hiſtories, and fables. Next, ſuch things as weary out mens braines to little benefit, of which ſort are moſt of the rules of Grammar, which overburden childrens minds, and conſume their yeares, and other things of like nature, which have no uſe but onely in Schooles. Laſtly, all circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and windings, and turnings of expreſſions, which fetch not out the kernell, but onely make a few aſſayes upon the ſhell. Such kind of ſtuffe is it, wherewith moſt of our bookes of learning ſwell, which muſt needs both detaine and ſtraine the minds of youth with unneceſſary, and unprofitable things; what wonder then can it be, that ſo few attaine unto any ſolid, and ſubſtantiall learning?</p>
                  <p>The remedie for theſe things will be to compoſe a Seminary of learning of ſuch things, and words, as are of ſolid, true, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine uſe: For you ſhall have as great increaſe of one acre of ground ſowne with cleane wheat, as if you ſhould mixe ten times as much chaffe therewith, and ſowe it in ten acres.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Secondly, becauſe the ſtudy of learning is ſuch an intricate, and confounding labyrinth, that few can find the way out of it; ſuch a ſea as ſwallows up thoſe, who would goe about to empty it; which proceeds from hence, that thoſe things which are to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are not yet reduced into any cleare and certaine order. Now theſe things which being collected together make but a ſmall heap, if they be ſcattred in ſunder, ſeeme very many, and breed a great confuſion.</p>
                  <p>The remedy for this will be to bring all things both great, and ſmall, which are to be learned, into ſuch a perſpicuous order, that ſtudents may have them before their face, as plaine as their owne fingers, and that they may from the firſt beginning have ſomelight of that, which followes unto the end, and be aſſured that this one ſhip which they lanch forth in, will carry them over the whole Sea of learning unto the ports of deſired perfection.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Thirdly, another ground of the vaſtneſſe, and prolixity of the ſtudy of learning is that needleſſe diligence of ſome in following all ſorts of vaine, and trifling nicities. For there is no end, nor meaſure of ſuch things, either in things themſelves, or words, ſeing the chances, and ſports both of wit, and nature are infinite, therfore ſuch as ſet themſelves about the particular deſcriptions of things in whatſoever Science or Art it be, whether it be to take
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49470:8"/>
paines therein, or to pleaſe and humor their owne fancies, they may indeed take a pleaſant and delightfull journey to their minds, but of neceſſity, it will hinder them in, if not lead them out of the way of univerſall wiſedome: yea, and there will be ſcarce any roome left for other things, when their minds are thus poſſeſſed with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of one kind.</p>
                  <p>The Remedy hereof is to frame ſuch a booke, wherein by a true Anatomy of the univerſe, all things that can be thought of may be reduced to their generall kinds and ſpecies: and ſo, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is to be ſaid of any thing, may at once be ſaid of all things, whereof it can be ſaid. By this meanes wee ſhall find all things both better grounded and more contracted, even beyond our hopes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the underſtanding being by a few rules freed from an infinite number of hops and barres, will runne through and dive into all things of its owne accord. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith truly, <q>Precepts of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome need not to be many, but rather efficacious; they are to be uſed as ſeed, which though it be ſmall, yet if it find a fit ſoile, it quickly diſplayes it's owne vertue, in a numerous, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous encreaſe from one onely ſmall graine.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the difficulty and roughneſſe of the waies of ſtudy, I thinke <note place="margin">Difficulty.</note> the cauſes thereof are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Firſt, becauſe there hath not beene uſed a due preparation of the minds of youth, for the readier embracing of learning, neither hath profit and pleaſure beene ſufficiently proportioned, and mixt together for the winning of them, but every one is taken in as he comes without farther care. And for their entertainment, they have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> not beene uſed, as friends at a banquet, with curteſies and delights, but even like ſlaves in a mill, with force, ſtripes, and reproachfull ſpeeches. For fiſts, and ferulars, roddes, and ſcourages have beene the uſuall dainties in Schooles, and their daily diſhes. And is it any wonder then that they have proved nauſeous, and dulling unto any? Nothing is ſo eaſie which may not be difficult to an unwilling mind. How then can learning be eaſie to thoſe that come to it trembling, and in feare, which is not to be found in learning of any mechanick Art? For ſeverity doth neceſſarily breed feare, and feare confounds, and troubles the mind, that it loſeth it ſelfe, and knowes not where it is, yea and breeds a giddineſſe too in a weake and tender mind. Therefore there is need of great art for the taking, alluring, &amp; gentle handling of their minds: which art will be made up by a ſweete and mild carriage of the Teachers, and a prudent diſpoſing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49470:9"/>
of their method; which will cauſe the ſtudies of learning to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but enticing baits, and meere recreations.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Secondly, a great part of this difficulty lyes herein, that things are not preſented unto the very eyes and hands of thoſe that are learners, but rather delivered to them in vaſt, and dull narrations, which make little impreſſion upon the underſtanding, and are hardly retained by the memory: ſo that they either eaſily vaniſh againe, or onely a confuſed ſpecies of them remaines.</p>
                  <p>The remedy hereof will be to repreſent every thing to its proper ſenſe, viſible things to the eyes, things that may be taſted to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and ſo for the reſt. For by once looking upon an elephant, or at leaſt, upon his picture, a man ſhall more eaſily, and firmely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> his forme, than if it had beene told him ten times over, what manner of beaſt he is. For,
<q>
                        <l>The eyes make true report unto the mind,</l>
                        <l>But eares are duller, and come farre behind.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. The third and chiefeſt part of this difficulty lies in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of teaching the Arts, and Sciences, which is neither well proportioned to things themſelves, nor to humane underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It is indeed the common voyce of all, that we ought according to the order of nature to proceed from thoſe things, which are firſt, to thoſe that follow, from generalls to thoſe which are more ſpeciall, from things knowne to thoſe which are more obſcure. But who is there, that takes this courſe? For as yet no ſuch thing hath been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. Except but only the Mathematicks, and all other Arts &amp; Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are confounded by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It is eaſie for him that is but provided of feete, to clime to the top of the higheſt mountaine, if there be ſteps cut out in it: and if thoſe bookes, which are extant, did but lead our minds by degrees without any interruption from knowne things to thoſe which are more obſcure, it would be as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for all thoſe that bend their endeavours to learning, to attaine to the moſt difficult, and excellent knowledge. Indeed ſome have the prerogative of able parts, and can by maine ſtrength raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pierce into things by the ſharpneſſe of their native wits; others by often inculcation of the ſame things, at laſt begin to ſee things, as through a cloud: but if we caſt up the generall ſumme, we ſhall find very few, that can make any thing to purpoſe of thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> bookes; which is an evident argument, that the underſtanding is not directed in a plaine, and continuall way, but rather dragged, as it were, over pits and ditches, and cragged interruptions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49470:9"/>
The remedy hereof will be by laying ſuch a platforme of all the Arts and Sciences, that we may alwayes beginne with ſuch things as are knowne, making a gentle progreſſe unto thoſe that are unknowne; I meane, that every thing may ſhine upon, and give light to that which followes, even as in a chaine, every linke receives and drawes its fellow after it, which if we can but preſcribe a right order for the due effecting of it, we ſhall thinke our time to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed to very good purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why Truth is ſo eſtranged, and ſcarcely to be found <note place="margin">Want of Truth.</note> in the whole compaſſe of the Sciences, ſeemeth to be threefold.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The tearing of Sciences into peeces.</item>
                     <item>2. Want of due fitting of the method unto the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</item>
                     <item>3. The careleſneſſe, and extravagancies of expreſſions and ſtile.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For firſt, I profeſſe ſeriouſly, that as yet in all the bookes that ever I ſaw, I could never find any thing anſwerable unto the amplitude of things; or which would fetch in the whole univerſality of them within its compaſſe: whatſoever ſome <hi>Encyclopaedias,</hi> or <hi>Syntaxes,</hi> or books of <hi>Panſophy,</hi> have pretended to in their titles. Much leſſe could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> I ever ſee the whole proviſion of humane underſtanding ſo raiſed upon its certain and eternal principles, that all things were chained, and linked together, from the beginning to the end, without any rent, or chink of truth. And perhaps no man ever aimed hereat as yet, ſo to ſquare and proportion the univerſall principles of things, that they might be the certain limits to bound in that every-way-ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variety of things: that ſo invincible, and unchangeable Truth might diſcover its univerſall, and proportionate harmony in all things. I ſay, no man ever yet ſeemes to have intended to cleare any univerſall way for the knowledge of Truth, with the helpe of thoſe univerſall principles, and according to the true lawes of deductions even to the laſt concluſions. Metaphyſitians ſing a requiem to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Naturaliſts applaud themſelves, Moraliſts make their owne lawes, and Politicians fix their owne grounds, Mathematicians have their triumphant Chariot, and Divines their over-ruling throne, every one in ſeverall by themſelves. Yea, in every faculty, or Science almoſt every man laies his particular grounds, and principles, whereupon to build and faſten his particular opinions, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what others have deduced from theirs. But it is impoſſible that Truth ſo ſcattered, and obſcured, ſhould be this way raked up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49470:10"/>
together. For while every one followes his owne fancie in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there is as much hope of agreement, as there is in a company of Muſicians, when every one ſings his ſeverall ſong without reſpect of common time or melody: and who would beleeve a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to be well ordered, wherein there are no publique lawes eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, but every one liveth as he liſteth? We ſee the boughs of a tree will quickly wither, and die, except they receive nouriſhment from the common ſtocke, and roots: and can the faire branches of Wiſdome be thus rent and torne in ſunder with ſafety of their life, that is their truth? Can any man be a good Naturaliſt, that is not ſeene in the Metaphyſicks? or a good Moraliſt, who is not a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt? (at leaſt in the knowledge of humane nature) or a Logician, who is ignorant of reall Sciences? or a Divine, a Lawyer, or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, that is no Philoſopher? or an Oratour, or Poet, who is not accompliſhed with them all? He deprives himſelfe of hands, and eyes, and rules, that neglecteth, or rejecteth any thing which may be knowne. Aſtronomers (for example ſake) would never have had the faces to introduce, and maintaine ſuch contrary, and abſurd hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes, or poſitions, if they had been to raiſe them upon the ſame ground of Truth: neither would other things be, or at leaſt ſeeme to be ſo ſlippery, and uncertaine. For the common fate of all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> is this, that whoſoever delivers it, others will take the paines to demoliſh it, or at leaſt to lay it bare. <hi>Plato's</hi> philoſophy ſeemed moſt elegant, and divine: but the Peripateticks accuſed it of too much vaine ſpeculation. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought his Philoſophy compleat, and trimme enough: but Chriſtian Philoſophers have found it neither agreeing with the holy Scriptures, nor anſwerable enough to the Truth of things. Aſtronomers for many ages carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away the bell with their Spheres, Eccentricks, and Epicycles, but <hi>Copernicus</hi> explodes them all. <hi>Copernicus</hi> himſelfe framed a new and plauſible Aſtronomy out of his Optick grounds, but ſuch as will no way be admitted by the unmovable principles of naturall Truth. <hi>Gilbertus</hi> being carried away with the ſpeculation of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, would out of it have deduced all Philoſophy: but to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt injury of naturall principles. <hi>Campanella</hi> triumphs almoſt in the principles of the ancient Philoſopher <hi>Parmenides,</hi> which he had reaſſumed to himſelfe in his naturall Philoſophy, but is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by one Optick glaſſe of <hi>Galilaeus Galilaei.</hi> And why ſhould we reckon any more?</p>
                  <p>Truly, if every one would ground their judgements upon the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49470:10"/>
common principles, it could not be, that they ſhould ruſh into ſuch contradictions, not onely to the hinderance of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but even to the detriment of Truth, which for the moſt part in ſuch contentions falleth to the ground. For when needles, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and ambiguous things are propounded, they cannot but breed diſtaſt, and thwarting in the minds of thoſe that heare them. And when for the gaining of their aſſents, principles are aſſumed, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever traſh they be) which are neither knowne, nor yeelded, nor of undoubted truth, but rather obnoxious to ſeverall limitations, and exceptions (of which ſort are moſt of the Canons of common Philoſophy and Divinity) what can enſue from hence, but moſt tedious contradictions, and contentions? that a man would be weary to heare ſuch doubts, and differences, in things perhaps cleare enough of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Another courſe therfore muſt herein be taken, &amp; care muſt be had, that Truth approaching us in a moſt cleare light, may not be mired in doubts, nor wounded with contradictions, but may over come all errours: which we think cannot be effected, unleſſe the beames ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diſperſed over all things, be united into one, that ſo there may be one and the ſame ſymmetry of all things, both ſenſuall, intellectuall, &amp; revealed. Now this we cannot behold without a perfect ſquaring, and unſeparable conſolidation of the principles of knowledge (Senſe, Reaſon, and Divine Revelation) which alone will make it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> to appeare, and conſequently put an end unto thoſe many contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. For upon the diſcovery of the ground of things, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will follow either the manifeſtation of an errour in one part of an oppoſition, or elſe that each part perhaps, both thinketh, and ſpeaketh true (though they underſtand not one another) in regard of the divers reſpects, and conſiderations of things, the ground whereof they doe not yet perceive. Certainely thoſe errours which on every ſide beſiege mens minds, may this way be ſubdued, and their minds brought into the open light, or no way elſe. For it muſt needs be, that the bright Sunne of Truth ariſing, infinite miſts and clouds of opinions will vaniſh of themſelves: yea, and by Gods help, the very darkneſſe of Atheiſme it ſelfe may at length be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond cauſe, why Truth is ſo ſtaggering, and uncertaine, I before declared to be the looſeneſſe of Method, that Writers doe not wholly tie themſelves unto the things themſelves, to deliver them, as they are conſtantly in themſelves, but rather draw them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49470:11"/>
unto ſome trimme and neat conceits of their owne to expreſſe them by, abuſing them a thouſand wayes: which is nothing elſe, but to wreſt and transfigure things from their native, into ſtrange formes, even in face of the mind: and what then can it behold, but monſters in ſtead of things themſelves? Againe, it is impoſſible to find any Method parallell unto things, unleſſe all things be reduced unto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> ſame harmony in the underſtanding, wherewith they are knit, and faſtened together out of it. I told you but even now, of many ſorts of Philoſophy, which were deviſed at pleaſure, and ſhortly after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed by others. And we may ſay the ſame of many Decrees, yea, and whole Methods of Divinity, that they may be built, and pulled downe againe, ſeeing they are not ſquared by the immutable rule of things, but by the leaden rule of this, or that noddle.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh therefore that all theſe ſtraggling methods fancied by lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant braines might be quite removed out of the way, that at laſt all things might be handled in one order, and method. For ſuch is our Chriſtian Philoſophy, or rather Panſophy, which we labour to promote, that therein all things ariſe out of unmoveable principles, unto unmoveable, and ſtable Truth, ſo knitting and claſping one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with the armes of their perpetuall harmony, that this worke of the mind is as little ſubject to fall in ſunder, as the world it ſelfe. So that as the world is not ordered at our diſcretion, but proceeds on immutably according to the lawes implanted in it: in like manner Panſophy, which is nothing but the glaſſe or mirrour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſhould be delivered in ſuch a method, from which there is no ſtarting aſide, if a man would even burſt himſelfe with deſire of change, or diſagreement. Which will be effected if all things be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered demonſtratively by their proper cauſes and effects. But hereto it will be requiſite not to truſt to externall teſtimonies, and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> but to the inward truth of things themſelves. For authorities may as eaſily caſt falſe colours over things, as yeeld them any light or illuſtration; at leaſt they doe diſtract the learner, and eſtrange his mind from the things unto themſelves: But things themſelves cannot make another manner of impreſſion in the ſenſes, then as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are. And whereſoever ſenſe is deficient, there reaſon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with its certaine rules muſt alſo act its part; but when Reaſon is a ſtand, we muſt then have recourſe unto Divine Revelation. Which three principles of knowledge are to be laid as the Baſis, and groundworke of Panſophy, that the ſpeeches and writings, which Philoſophers, or Divines have vented forth, may not preſently be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49470:11"/>
held for Oracles, but that rejecting all falſe ſpectacles, we may looke neerely unto things themſelves, and by a diligent-ſearch diſcover, what they will owne themſelves to be. For wiſe, and able men have many times uttered ſuch things as ſound of levity, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which notwithſtanding men-admirers admit promiſcuouſly, and adore. It were eaſie enough to produce many examples hereof, but I forbeare, hoping, that when once a clearer light of Truth is kindled, abundance of ſuch things will lie open of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing whereby Truth is prejudiced, is, as I ſaid, either the careleſneſſe, or luxuriance of the ſtile wherein things are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. We call that a luxuriating ſtile, when in the explication of things, improper, tropicall, hyperbolicall, and alluſive words or ſentences, and expreſſions are uſed: eſpecially when Poets, or Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours (and ſometimes Philoſophers and Divines acting their parts) falling upon any ſubject, which they would amplifie, or extenuate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> according to their manner, uſe with their figures, and colours ſo to alter things, that for the moſt part they appeare not in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but in a borrowed, and adventitious forme. Which is nothing elſe, but a painting, and falſe glaſſe, whereas truth ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with a pure, and unaltering light. Careleſneſſe of ſtile is, when obſcure words are uſed, or termes borrowed from a language which is not underſtood, ſuch as Greeke words are to the moſt part of men: or laſtly, if ſuch things as are not ſtable. Truths, are ſet to ſale, as the rules of Truth. Of which ſort (we muſt needs confeſſe, though it be ſhamefull to ſpeake) the bookes of Philoſophers and Divines are too full.</p>
                  <p>I may therefore boldly affirme, that the originall, and continuall cauſe of errours in learning, is that unhappy Triplicity whereof I have ſpoken, I meane that divers ſundring; that divers tranſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and changing; and laſtly, that divers moulding and mixing of things. For who can underſtand things as they are, while they are preſented but in ſnatches and pieces? while they are out of their proper Series and order? while they are under a ſtrange forme? For it is eaſie to erre in any particular object, while the generall ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of all things is unknowne; and while their Series, or order <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> is not duely obſerved, it is eaſier to finde a labyrinth, then a guiding path; and truth is very ready to glide away, while the eyes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with the falſe colours of their objects. Hence is the off-ſpring of thoſe infinite errours, and hence comes that faſtidious multiplication, and confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of bookes, that the world is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49470:12"/>
ſcarce able to containe them. Hence is that penury, and want of light in this enlightned age, (as it will be termed) that as <hi>Tantalus</hi> in the water ſeekes for water; ſo we ſeeke for light in light, and in bookes, want bookes, yea, and learning in the learned. I will not inſiſt upon that too fruitfull mother of errours, partiality, and ſiding with Sects. For <hi>Galen</hi> hath beſtowed a true and deſerved Character upon them, That thoſe who addict themſelves to Sects, become both deafe and blind, ſo that they neither heare, nor ſee thoſe things, which others eaſily both heare and ſee, yea, and dumb alſo, that they will not ſpeake what is true, but rather oppoſe thoſe that teach it; like the drunken <hi>Lapithae,</hi> who with their fiſts, and kickings, drove away the Chirurgeon, that would have applied remedies to their wounds.</p>
                  <p>The next thing is, that learning is not enough accommodated to the uſes of our life, to teach us how to behaveour ſelves in the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences <note place="margin">Learning not fitted the uſe life.</note> thereof. The fault whereof muſt be laid upon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate cuſtome, or rather diſeaſe of Schooles, whereby all the time of youth is ſpent in Grammaticall, Rhetoricall, and Logicall toyes; thoſe things which are reall, and fit to enlighten mens minds, and to prepare them for action, being reſerved for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, that forſooth, their judgements being more ripe, and they able to undertake ſuch things, they may make the more happy progreſſe. But it comes to paſſe for the moſt part, that as ſoone as the heat of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> youth is over, every man ſettles upon his ſeverall way, and faculty, never minding any due preparation, or accompliſhment for it. Yea, and moſt of ſuch as intend to be Divines, Politicians, or Phyſitians, doe of ſet purpoſe skip over the ſtudies of the Metaphyſicks, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and Naturall Philoſophy, as if they would be unprofitable ſtaies, and hinderances in their way, whereas it is a great errour in them, ſeeing a ſolid judgement can never be attained without ſolid learning.</p>
                  <p>The way to remedy this, will be to propound all things ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably unto youth, and to make ſerious exerciſes the preparatives of ſerious employments. For ſeeing no man becomes a Smith, but by hammering, nor a Scribe, but by writing, nor a Diſputant, but by diſputing; children alſo muſt be framed to be men by handling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things; and by having all manner of occurrences of this life repreſented both to their notice, and practice while they are in Schooles. Yea, and all Philoſophy in generall muſt be ſo ordered, that it may be a lively image of things, and a ſecret fitting and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49470:12"/>
of mens minds for the buſineſſes of this life.</p>
                  <p>And for the laſt thing, what wonder can it be that learning doth <note place="margin">Learning not leading us to Go</note> not enough advance youth towards God? For it is not yet purged, and cleared of the prophaneneſſe of the Gentiles, which treateth raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God, and of his workes, without any knowledge, or due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of him, changing the glory of the incoruptible God into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> the ſimilitude of corruptible things. For this is the cauſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Heathen Philoſophers became vaine in their imaginations, and thinking themſelves wiſe, became fooles, and were given over of God unto the luſts of their hearts, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, becauſe they changed the Truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped, and ſerved the creature, more then the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. But even unto this day the like Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme is in practiſe: The moſt part of thoſe that are eſteemed wiſe, are, as the others, wiſe without God, neither deriving their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from him, nor directing it to him, but beginning, and ending in the creatures, without any thought of God; and regarding, and ſerving onely themſelves, and other corruptible things. God hath ſaid, that he is <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning, and the End of all, from whom, by whom, and in whom are all things. But who is there that makes him (that is, his feare) the beginning of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? who makes him (that is, his word and ſpirit) his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor unto wiſdome? who is there that terminates his wiſdome in him, devoting himſelfe, and all his endeavours to his glory? Theſe things are hidden from moſt mens eyes. Our ſelves are all in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: We beginne in confidence of our ſelves, we goe on by our ſtrength, and light, and we intend all for our ſelves, for our owne profit and reputation. Thus are we drawne about through the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the creatures, ſlipping about by our ſelves, to our ſelves, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and from our ſelves, untill even our ſelves alſo returne to vanity. This is the ſad and dolorous way of all fleſh, wherein many of the wiſeſt of men ſtray unhappily from their God. The cure of this laſt and worſt diſeaſe muſt be, by ſowing and ſprinkling abroad the ſeeds of the true knowledge, and feare of God through all this field of Panſophie, that whither ſoever a man turne himſelfe, he may ſee, that all things are nothing without God. Yea, all our Panſophie muſt be ſo husbanded, that it may perpetually ſpurre us forward to the ſeeking after God in every thing, and point us out the way where to find him, as alſo prepare our minds for the due embracing and acknowledgment of him; That by this meanes it may be as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49470:13"/>
a ſacred ladder for our minds to clime up by all viſible things, unto the inviſible top of all things, the Majeſty of the higheſt God (which by its ſplendor will ſhew us, how all inferior things are but the ſhadow of the true light) there at laſt to repoſe our ſelves in that center of reſt, and end of all our deſires, and to bath in that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, from which all the ſtreames of bliſſe and pleaſure flow for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Unleſſe this end may be obtained (with the other) our ſelves, and all our actions, and endeavours are but vaine: Wits will be ſtill wandring in their perplexed labyrinths, Schooles will be ſtill rolling of their Siſyphean ſtones, yea, and the whole world will goe on in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> its madding and reeling pace.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſeeing it is a matter ſo throughly ſerious, as wherein the glory of God, and the ſafety of mankind conſiſteth, we ought to ſolicite God with ardent ſupplications, that he would take pity upon us, and open our dimme eyes, that in his light wee may ſee light. And becauſe Chriſt ſaid not onely, <hi>Aske, and yee ſhall receive,</hi> but alſo, <hi>Seeke, and yee ſhall find; Knocke, and it ſhall be opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, Matth.</hi> 7. 7. Our deſires, and prayers muſt be ſeconded with unwearied, and conſtant endeavours, that all veiles may be plucked off from things, and men may of all ſides be prepared to behold in open, and cleare light all thoſe wondrous things of God wherewith we are encompaſſed.</p>
                  <p>And now behold! I my ſelfe, the leaſt of all, come forth to bring either a new light into the world, or ſome few ſparkes to kindle it withall: Conſcious indeed of my too much weakneſſe, yet by Gods grace encouraged in humble expectation, that aid from heaven ſhall be ſupplied upon theſe my endeavours, which are intended for Gods glory, and much peoples good. God is privy to the ſecrets of my heart, and knoweth that it was not confidence of mine owne abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which led me hither, but that I was, and am forced on by the pricks of mine owne conſcience, that if I be any way able to profit others, I ſhould deſire and endeavour it, at leaſt if I may but ſtirre up others, who are able to effect greater matters. For indeed this is the time above all ages that are paſt, both to hope, and to attempt greater things.</p>
                  <p>For if the Reader will but conſider, he will eaſily ſee, that thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> many poliſhings of Sciences, thoſe trimmings of Arts, thoſe ſearches of ſecrets and hidden things, thoſe conflicts of wit, and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny workes, and writings almoſt concerning every thing, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49470:13"/>
hitherto have beene made or publiſhed, are nothing elſe, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of learning ſought, as it were, out of every wood, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey throughout the world, thence diverſly wrought by divers work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo brought together into various heapes, which yet lie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and not united. What then remaines, but that now at laſt we ſhould uſe a skilfull hand in bringing theſe heapes of materials into their due forme and order? That ſo there may be erected ſome U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Temple of Wiſdome, truly glorious, and refulgent with the ornaments of Harmony, and the light of Truth: Such as wee might juſtly apply that of <hi>Lucretius</hi> unto it,

Unleſſe ſuch a Palace of true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be attempted by the followers of Wiſdome, they will be like a ſlothfull builder, who is alwayes doing ſomething about his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but never drawing it towards an end. Yea, and it is to be feared, that learning it ſelfe will at length fall with its owne weight, and be over-whelmed with ſuch a vaſt floud of writers, if no dams be oppoſed thereunto. But in deed ſuch skil in Architecture is hereto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, as is not to be expected in any humane wit. For none but Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome her ſelf, can build an houſe fit for her ſelf to dwel in. But where ſhall Wiſdome be found, and where is the place of Underſtanding?

God alone underſtandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof: He which looketh to the ends of the Earth, and ſeeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole Heaven; which maketh a weight for the winds, and ſpreadeth out the waters in meaſure; which ſetteth lawes for the raine, and maketh way for the lightning of thunder: He alone ſeeth it, and declareth it, becauſe he hath prepared, and ſearched it out, <hi>Job.</hi> 28. 12, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

                  <p>I deſire the learned to pardon me, of whoſe labours I now preſume to ſhew my judgement. The moſt exact Encyclopaedias, or ſums of Art, which I could ever lay my eyes upon, ſeemed to me like a chaine neatly framed of many linkes, but nothing comparable to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mover, ſo artificially made with wheeles, that it turres it ſelfe: or like a pile of wood, very neatly laid in order, with great care, and diligence, but nothing like unto a tree ariſing from its living roots, which by its inbred vertue ſpreads it ſelfe into boughs, and leaves, and yeeldeth fruit. But that which we deſire, is to have a living tree, with living roots, and living fruits of all the Arts, and Sciences, I meane Panſophy, which is a lively image of the Univerſe, every way cloſing, and agreeing with it ſelfe, every where quickning it ſelfe, and covering it ſelfe with fruit. That is (to reflect a little to our former intentions) we would have ſuch a booke of Panſophy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, which might be,</p>

                  <p>The firſt will make learning to be univerſall, which is our firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The ſecond will make it cleare, and diſtinct, which we alſo earneſtly ſeeke. And the third will be a meanes to have it true and ſolid, which is our chiefe deſire.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, we would have ſuch a booke compiled, which alone, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of all, ſhould be the Spenſe, and Store-houſe of Univerſall Learning: in which nothing ſhould be wanting, and by reading whereof, Wiſdome ſhould of its owne accord, ſpring up in mens minds, by reaſon of the cleare, diſtinct, and perpetuall coherence of all things ariſing out of their true veines, and rootes, that every thing may plainely appeare to be, as it is ſaid to be, and that it can be no otherwiſe then it is, in regard of the immutable truth of things every where interwoven with it ſelfe. But all this we would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> have done compendiouſly, becauſe we muſt have reſpect to the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and frailty of our lives: And in a popular ſtile, which may bring light, and not darkneſſe into the underſtanding: And laſtly, ſolidly, by a perpetuall connexion of cauſes, and effects; becauſe we ſeek for a true and firm foundation of truth, and not for any forged and falſe props of opinions: that ſo all things which may be known (whether Naturall, Morall, or Artificiall, or even Metaphyſicall) may be delivered like unto Mathematicall demonſtrations, with ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and certainty, that there may be no roome left for any doubt to ariſe. By which meanes, not onely ſuch things as are, will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, and truly knowne, but alſo the floud-gates of infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, deductions, and inventions, will be ſet wide open.</p>
                  <p>O how much are theſe things to be deſired! what an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bettering would this be of our mortality! For ſeeing bookes are the inſtruments of tranſplanting Wiſdome, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument perfectly good, or a rule without any default, keepes the workemans hand from going awry; if ſuch an inſtrument of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and teaching univerſall Wiſdome, as we have projected, and deſcribed, were extant among us, it would be beneficiall, not onely for the dextrous faſhioning and inſtructing of youth, (which ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANCHTON in one place ſaith is an harder matter then the taking of <hi>Troy)</hi> but alſo for the opening of a way, wherby all the ſonnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49470:15"/>
of men may readily attaine unto the true knowledge, and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things, that they may be wiſe both in beholding the works of God, and ordering of their owne.</p>
                  <p>As for the darkneſſe of errors, it would flee amaine from the face of ſo cleare a light: and men, being buſied onely about ſolidities, and bending through aſſured and certaine wayes unto ſerious ends, would eaſier leave off thoſe diſſentions, ſtrifes, and warres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the world is now conſumed. For a diſordered, and ſtragling ſearch of the truth of things muſt needs breed difference in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that againe will as eaſily produce a mutuall croſſing of mens wils, and inclinations, which, when it comes to irritate, and exaſperate their minds, breakes forth into open ſtrife, and conflicts. But theſe occaſions of differences, and contentions, and all by waies of error, would of themſelves vaniſh away, if that one, and onely way of things, which is the way of Truth, were but enough diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. For by Gods goodneſſe this would be the meanes to heale up thoſe wounds in Schooles, Churches, and Common-wealths, and to reſtore peace to the Chriſtian world, that not onely all Chriſtian nations might flouriſh in the ſtudies of true Wiſdome, and Piety; but even Infidels themſelves might partake of the ſame light, and be won to the embracing of Chriſtianity in this divinely revealed way of Truth. And ſo at laſt we ſhould ſee (what Gods ſacred Oracles have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> foretold, ſhall at length come to paſſe) that the Earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. And that the Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth, and there ſhall be but one Lord, and his name one, <hi>Zach</hi> 14. 9. And that the way of SION ſhall be ſo plaine, that even fooles ſhall not erre therein, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 8. Which is the ſame that another Prophet hath foretold, That in the laſt dayes the mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountaines, and it ſhall be exalted above the hils, and people ſhall flow unto it. And many Nations ſhall come and ſay, Come and let us goe up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Lord, that he may teach us of his wayes. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And they ſhall beate their Swords into Plough-ſhares, and Speares into Pruning-hookes: Nation ſhall not lift up a Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nation, neither ſhall they learne warre any more, <hi>Micah.</hi> 4. 1. Take pity upon us, O Lord, and let thy peace reſt upon <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Let thy glory ariſe over us, that the Nations may walke in thy light.</p>
                  <p>But may ſuch things be hoped for? Certainely we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire

of them, if this guide and director of humane underſtanding be once framed, whereby mens minds may be infallibly led by continuall degrees, and in open light from the groundworks, and fundamentalls unto the higheſt tops of things. For if wee come once by this meanes to behold the Theater of Gods wiſedome, mens minds cannot but be filled with joy, and gladneſſe, ſo that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> they will call one unto another, Come and let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, that he may teach us of his wayes. Now that ſuch a Director (or perfect method of Panſophie) is not to be deſpaired of, we have theſe perſwaſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, although things may ſeeme infinite and innumerable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their multitude, not to be meaſured in regard of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſproportions: and unſearchable, by reaſon of that depth wherein Truth is plunged: Yet it is moſt certaine that all things are beneath man and ſubject to his underſtanding. For all things are made for his ſake, but in an inferiour degree: hee therefore being the laſt accompliſhment of the creation, and the moſt abſolute Image of his Creator, containing in himſelfe onely the perfections of all other things, why ſhould he not at laſt habituate himſelfe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of himſelfe, and all things elſe? For ſeeing God hath appointed him to be a ſpectator of his wiſedome, it is moſt certaine that he hath made him ſuitable to that e d: which would not be if he had made either Things unproportionable to his underſtanding, or his underſtanding uncapable of the Things. It may then be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded that God alone is great over all, and his greatneſſe is unſearchable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 3. all things elſe are made in number, weight and meaſure, <hi>Wiſd. 11. 20. Iſay</hi> 40. 12. They are therefore to be numbred, meaſured, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> &amp; weighed, untill this univerſall harmony do clea ly appeare unto us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hath made all things well, as the Scripture ſaith, but every thing in his time, that is, by degrees. Is it then in vaine, that God hath ſet the world in mens hearts, that is, a deſire to find out thoſe things which he worketh from the beginning to the end? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 11. It would be in vaine, if that deſire could not obtaine its end. But we muſt not aſcribe any fruſtraneous actions unto that Soveraigne wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee have already great ſtore of proviſion hereto, thoſe bookes and monuments of mens diligence, compiled with great care and induſtry. Can we thinke that all theſe have done nothing? That cannot be in regard (as I have ſhewed already) of the ſupreme governour of all things, who will not ſuffer any thing, even errours
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49470:16"/>
themſelves to be in vaine. Let us grant therefore that they have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and beene deceived in moſt things, yet God who is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and unchangeable foundation of Truth, will ſurely order the matter ſo, that even errours themſelves will at laſt perforce be made ſubſervient to the farther diſcovering and eſtabliſhing of Truth. Now it is manifeſt, that many things are already found out, and why ſhould we not hope, that the reſt will follow? It it no ſmall matter that <hi>Euclides, Archimedes,</hi> and others have brought the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Quantities to ſuch evidence, and perfection, that even miracles may be effected by numbers, meaſures, and weights. It is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> not a thing of nothing, that Hermeticall Phyſitians, and others have by meanes of Chymiſtry found how to extract the qualities out of naturall bodies, and to ſeparate even the very eſſences of things. It is a matter of moment, which the Lord VERULAM hath effected in his excellent <hi>Novum Organum,</hi> where he ſhewes the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible way of making a narrow ſearch into the natures of things: and that which JUNGIUS the <hi>Saxon</hi> is now about, who laboureth to bring the Art of Logicke to ſuch perfection, that the truth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions may be upheld, and all fallacies avoided, with as much certainty as any of EUCLIDES's Problemes can be demonſtrated: Why ſhould I adde any more? as one pinne drives out another, ſo doth one invention thruſt another forward, eſpecially in this age ſo fruitfull of wits: and why ſhould wee not hope for ſome inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of inventions, whereby the ſeverall inventions, and endeavours of ſo many wits, may not onely in their matter, but even in their manner of diſcovery be united into one, and made common to mankind? It would ſurely be an excellent thing.</p>
                  <p>For if every one hath formerly had his owne ſharpneſſe of wit, his owne rules of proceeding, and his owne weights of judgement; what might not be effected, if all theſe wits were united into one, their lawes into one, and their judgements into one? The more candles, the greater light. If only the way be found out; how all theſe lights may be united into one: that is, how thoſe divers and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite deviſes, inventions, and knowne truths, may be reduced unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> one perpetuall, immutable, and eternall rule and manner of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, knowing and deviſing. For if this be found out, that which we ſeeke for, is eaſily obtained.</p>
                  <p>And why may it not be found out? we are already poſſeſſed of more than a contemptible ſtore of knowne truths; and for our farther progreſſe, we are provided of ſuch light of method, as wee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49470:16"/>
need not feare walking in the darke. Onely let us preſſe forward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the utmoſt bounds of Method, and of things themſelves. For where there is a progreſſe, there will at laſt be an end. Eternity onely, to which we are appointed, doth bound our minds, but all temporary things are within the bounds, and compaſſe of our minds: if only we be but acquainted with their rootes, and grounds, thoſe immutable, conſtant and eternall conceptions, and lawes of things, by which all things are firſt made, and ſo continue.</p>
                  <p>We have alſo an expreſſe promiſe concerning the latter times, that <hi>Many ſhall runne to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be encreaſed, Dan.</hi> 12. 4. Many have already paſſed to and fro, and have ſearched out (in this our age more than ever) both Heaven, and Earth, Seas, and Iſlands, even the whole Kingdome of Nature; as alſo the holy Scriptures, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> and thoſe divine Oracles after a various manner. And what remains then, but that the other part of the Propheſie ſhould alſo take its turne to be fulfilled?</p>
                  <p>But let us now at length come up cloſer with the thing in hand, I meane, the meanes whereby ſo great a deſigne may be duly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: which though it may ſomewhat appeare from that, which hath beene already ſaid concerning both the cauſes, and the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of that confuſion, which is in learning; yet we will enter into a more expreſſe, and particular diſcourſe of them.</p>
                  <p>I thinke therefore that we can never attaine unto the Univerſall Knowledge, Poſſeſſion, and Uſe of all things, unleſſe by a new and Univerſall,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. Reviſing of all our goods, with all the inventories of them.</item>
                     <item>II. Comparing of thoſe Inventories, with the things themſelves, to ſee whether they are ſo indeed, as our regiſters, and accounts relate unto us.</item>
                     <item>III. By a new and univerſall Diſpoſing of thoſe things, which we find certaine, unto new, and univerſall uſes.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The reviſing of our goods ſhall be to this purpoſe, that we be not ignorant, what is our proper inheritance, and what is worthy for us to employ our minds about. For it is too true, that men know not their owne goods; I meane, that the whole world, and the creatures thereof are their poſſeſſion, and that they partake of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with God himſelfe. The little thought and knowledge, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe whereof, is the cauſe that moſt men caſting themſelves into vaine, baſe, and pernicious courſes, are at laſt diſherited for their unworthineſſe. Therefore Chriſtians muſt be taught throughly to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49470:17"/>
conſider, what is meant by that of the Apoſtle; whether the world, or life, or death, or things preſent or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. Neither was it any word of courſe, when I ſaid, that we muſt reviſe our Inventories: for our Riches are ſo abundant, and ſo various, that few know what names to give them, much leſſe do they comprehend, what they are, and what care is fitting for us to beſtow upon them. All thoſe things are therefore to be deſcribed to men very plainly, and clearly, like the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 8. And becauſe they muſt be accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, we muſt have a ſpeciall care, that nothing be left out; wee muſt therefore ſearch all former Regiſters, both generall and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, old and new, by whomſoever ſet forth. For although there is a vaſt number of them, yet he, who will undertake to make a true ſurvey, and ſynopſis of all things, muſt of neceſſity undergoe this taske. And it is greatly to be wiſhed, that more were extant. But many famous monuments of learning are utterly loſt, among which are the hiſtories of living creatures, and plants compiled by SOLOMON the wiſeſt of Kings, which ſeeing it is in vaine to hope for; or deſire: we muſt make uſe of ſuch as we have, eſpecially Gods owne booke, the holy Scriptures, which are nothing elſe but Gods owne commentary upon thoſe things which God beſtowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in this life, and reſerveth for us in the future. And becauſe Gods Spirit ſcarcely deſcendeth unto things of a lower nature, but chiefly teacheth us that which concerns our ſpirituall eſtate, we muſt therefore make uſe of thoſe which treat of inferiour matters, as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, Phyſicians, Hiſtorians, Coſmographers, Lawyers, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, and all ſuch as are happy in various inventions, that out of all particular Sciences may at laſt reſult one univerſall Science of Sciences, and Art of Arts, which is Panſophy.</p>
                  <p>But our intention is not, that the various opinions of ſeverall Authors ſhould be heaped up in this booke, as their practiſe is, who eſteeme of learning by much reading, and who take no further care, if they can but recite the divers opinions of divers men, or ſpread their names a little by publiſhing ſome botcherly mingle-mangle of collections out of others. Nor do we drive ſo much at this, that ſeverall opinions may be collected and compar'd among themſelves, as they do, that fill up large volumes with handling queſtions to and fro, on both ſides, and confuting ſuch as agree not with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But our maine aime is, that all who have written any thing concerning Piety and good manners, or concerning the Arts
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49470:17"/>
and ſciences, not reſpecting whether they be Chriſtians, or Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Jewes or Pagans, and of what ſect ſoever, Pythagoreans, Acad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Peripateticks, Stoicks, Eſſeans, Greekes, Latines, Ancient or Moderne Doctors, or Rabbins, every Church, Synod, and Councell, that all, I ſay, be admitted, and heard to ſee what they will bring in for the compiling of this Philoſophicall worke.</p>
                  <p>And this we adviſe for theſe reaſons,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Becauſe that which we goe about, is an univerſall Treaſurie of Wiſedome for the common intereſt, and behoofe of mankind, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is juſt that all Nations, Sects, Ages, and Wits, ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. All of us, as ſoone as we come into this world, ſit as ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in this common Amphitheater of Gods wiſedome: and wee Chriſtians have moreover, the light of divine revelation equally granted unto us all: and why ſhould not the very meaneſt have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, if he thinkes that he ſeeth any thing worthy of obſervation, to point it out, and ſhew it unto others.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It is not likely, that any one alone, or ſome few men of an Age or two, have had the priviledge to ſee all things, and others to ſee nothing: but as no ſoyle yeelds all kind of fruits, and yet every one yeelds ſomething in their ſeaſons yeare after yeare: ſo God alſo ſcattereth in mens minds various ſparkes of his light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, in divers Nations, and Ages. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſpeaking of the holy Ghoſt, and his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And there want not examples of ſome, out of the bounds of the Church, whom the ſpirit of Wiſedome hath ſeverally inſpired: as <hi>Job, Elephaz, Elihu, Mercurius Triſmegiſtus, Socrates, Epictetus, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero.</hi> Therefore none muſt be contemned, eſpecially in ſuch things, wherein the light of nature may guide us: For,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Quandoque eſt Olitor ſatis opportuna locutus:</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                     <q>
                        <l>The delving gardner often hits aright</l>
                        <l>Upon thoſe things, which flee our ſoaring ſight.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord VERULAM ſaith very well, that the divers opinions of men concerning the nature of things, are like divers gloſſes upon the ſame Text, whereof one is more exact in one part, another in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, each of them helping you to ſomething obſervable. Let it therefore be agreed: That there is no booke ſo bad, wherein ſome good thing or other may not be found: and if nothing elſe, yet it may occaſion us to amend ſome errour.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. It is certaine that no man would willingly erre (for to what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49470:18"/>
end ſhould he do it) but then men erre, when they are deceived by ſome ſimilitude of truth. For errours alſo have their pretenſes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to maintaine them, which muſt therefore be heard, becauſe we have to do with man a reaſonable creature. So by collation of reaſon, the falſe colours will eaſily be diſcovered, and the ſhadow will fly away before the light.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. When any one is condemned before he be heard, how juſt ſoever his condemnation be, yet juſtice her ſelfe ſuffereth violence thereby: for it is poſſible that the caſe may be otherwiſe, than it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> apprehended upon heareſay, therefore all things muſt be firſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. That I may onely mention that phantaſticall, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious practiſe of ſome, who for ſome opinion, or ſuſpicion, which they have formerly entertained, beare ſuch prejudice againſt others, that they will not ſo much as give their reaſons the hearing. Is not this to ſay <hi>Racha</hi> to his brother? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Let it be granted that ſome men have committed great errours in this, or that matter: yet who knowes not, that wiſemen by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others errours, learne to avoid them? Many uſefull things will be continually ſuggeſted from former errours, and their occaſions, to thoſe that will be undertakers in this worke of Panſophie, for the better trimming and poliſhing of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. It is to be wiſhed, that men may once at laſt be unburdened of their troubleſome diſſentions, and that Sects and ſtrife may ceaſe, but that will never bee, unleſſe firſt all ſuſpicions be left off, wherein men are intangled one with another. Now ſuſpicions cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, where either part is unſatisfied in their owne, or the others meaning, and doubts. And theſe things can never be cleared, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe both opinions be mildly heard, and compared together, and then examined by the ſame lawes of cleare and undeniable truth, which both ſides ſhall conſent upon.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Laſtly, it is very obſervable, that at the building of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle by MOSES, and of the Temple by SOLOMON, the Iſraelites <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> offered not onely of their owne, but alſo of the ſpoiles, which they had taken away from the enemies of God, as the Egyptians, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, and Ammonites; and that they were accepted of by the builders. For gold was ſought for on every ſide, and there were pretious ſtones offered before they came to the holy Land, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar wood was brought from <hi>Libanus,</hi> at the building of the Temple, all making for the glory of the God of Iſrael, and the ſplendour of his houſe. As alſo in the re-edifying of the Temple by ZOROBABEL,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49470:18"/>
God ſtirred up the heart of CYRUS the King, that he not only offered of his owne royall treaſure, but alſo gave commandement to his ſubjects through all his dominions, to helpe the Iſraelites every one in his owne place of dwelling, with ſilver, and gold, and ſubſtance, and cattell, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 7. And why ſhould not the builders of the Temple of wiſedome accept of every thing from what hand ſoever, which may make for the beauty and ornament of it? Even the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites themſelves, though accurſed, may be employed for the hewing of wood, and drawing of water for the houſe of our God, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. 23.</p>
                  <p>If any man taxe mee, that I have formerly beene of another mind, that I have inclined to partiality, and ſided with a particular ſect, inſtilling into others a diſlike of ARISTOTLE, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors. I will not deny but that I have beene carried away by the example of thoſe, who with NEHEMIAH were piouſly zealous, becauſe the children of the Iſraelites running up and downe Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> knew not how to ſpeake the Jewes language perfectly, but mixed it with the language of Aſhdod, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 24. I meane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wiſedome and eloquence of the Gentiles beare more ſway in our Schooles, than true Chriſtian, and ſaving knowledge, which is abominable, and better it is a thouſand times, that Heathen wiſedome ſhould be utterly ſtripped of all her inticing dreſſes, and allurements, then that any ſoule, which Chriſt would have to be filled with his ſpirit, ſhould be thereby endangered, or ſubverted. But ſeeing, that we meddle not here concerning the ſway, which Paganiſme beareth, or of the dangerous mixture of it with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; but only how to make all the earth tributary unto Chriſt the King of all the world, and how all thoſe rivulets, which have any way diſperſed themſelves from this fountaine of wiſedome may with the loſſe onely of their filth, be returned to their fountaine head; Let even the Gentiles, and Arabians therefore be admitted to furniſh us with ſuch ornaments, as they are able for the beauty of this houſe of God. Eſpecially ſeeing not onely the maine buſineſſe of our ſalvation is regarded in our Panſophie, but even the affaires of this life alſo, wherein ſeeing the Gentiles chiefly imployed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they cannot but have obſerved profitable things, which to loath, and reject for their ſakes, would be but fond, and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vanity. We will therefore give them admittance, but upon this condition, that whatſoever they have thought, written, or found out, which appeares to be true, conſiderate, and pious, ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to common uſe, and benefit: but wherein ſoever they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49470:19"/>
to have done, or ſaid any thing unmeet, or contrary to truth, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> piety, therein they ſhall be for ever ſilenced, leſt piety be any more borne down by profaneneſſe, truth by errour, or light by darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But herein wee had need to deale fairely with much judgement, and moderation, leſt wee be too facile in paſſing cenſure upon others. For if we be prepoſſeſſed with ſuſpicion, or carried away with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, we oftentimes are ready to faſten errours upon others, which they themſelves will not owne, and to wreſt their expreſſions, and words contrary to their meaning: whereas every one is, and ought to be his owne beſt interpreter. ARISTOTLE himſelfe in this regard hath not the beſt report, for his practiſing to raiſe the credit of his owne workes, by his confuting of the ancient Philoſophers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any true and juſt report of their opinions. Which if it be true (as I will not determine) it may be a warning for all the undertakers of Panſophy, where no partiall victory, but an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall harmony is to be ſought) that as much as may be, all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in opinions may be reconciled, and brought to conſonancie, by reducing them to the meane and certaine truth.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre concerning a Review of all Things, and their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. I told you moreover, that it is needfull we ſhould compare them one with the other to ſee whether all things, that are to be found in nature, are duly entred, and whether all things that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, can any where be found, and whether things are ſo indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> as they are regiſtred? For unleſſe things be truly ſtowed, as they are in themſelves, mens underſtandings are eaſily confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and entangled in errours. Now it is moſt certaine that many things are entred in the Catalogues of the learned (eſpecially by ſome Sects, which vent dreames and ſhadowes inſtead of realities) which can no where be found among Things themſelves: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that the Treaſuries of God, and Nature containe many things in them, which are not yet come to our knowledge: and laſtly, that very many things are otherwiſe in themſelves, than our bookes tell us: ſo that it is exceeding neceſſary to have ſuch a collation made between theſe commentaries, &amp; the things themſelves. For when this is done (and not before) as well all defects as ſuperfluities, and errors will be manifeſt: ſo that then it will be an eaſie matter to ſupply, or amend them, or to take them quite away. But what mortall man is ſufficient for ſuch a taske? ſeeing the multitude and variety both of naturall and ſupernaturall, morall, and artificiall things is ſo infinite? For if thoſe who have formerly laboured in the ſearch of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49470:19"/>
particular things, have met with ſuch knots, and rubs, that their endeavours have for the moſt part ſate downe, and reſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon that grand complaint of the intricate ſubtilty of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the unſearchable complication, and intervening of cauſes, of the implacable hoſtility of contraries every where occurrent, and laſtly, of the great weakneſſe, and inſufficiencie of humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for the compaſſing of them all: what then may hee expect that ſhall goe about to rip them all up from the very bottome? But we muſt not utterly deſpaire. Art many times helps us to effect that which no ſtrength is able to performe: which ſeemeth not to have beene enough obſerved by thoſe which have hitherto ſearched into the nature of things, who have ſtrained to breake through thoſe great lets, onely by the force and ſtrength of wit, and the aſſaults of continuall diligence; whereas notwithſtanding the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding left unto it ſelfe, like a naked and empty hand, is able to do no great matters: but every thing is more eaſily and certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with helps, and inſtruments. Therefore herein it will be requiſite to be furniſhed with ſome Rules, by application where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto things themſelves, and to all opinions, and decrees concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, we may be able to diſcerne neceſſary things, from ſuch as are not neceſſary, profitable things from unprofitable, and truth from falſhood. Such a kind of rule, for the ſearching out of nature, ſeemeth to have beene found out by the famous Lord VERULAM: A certaine artificiall induction, which indeed is the onely way to pierce through into the moſt abſtruſe ſecrets of Nature. But becauſe this requireth the continuall induſtry of many men, and ages, and ſo is not onely laborious, but ſeemeth alſo to be uncertaine in the event and ſucceſſe thereof; hence it comes to paſſe, that though it be a moſt excellent invention, yet the moſt part of men neglect it as unprofitable. Yet notwithſtanding it is of no great uſe, or advantage towards our deſigne of Panſophy, becauſe (as I ſaid before) it is onely intended for the diſcovery of the ſecrets of Nature, but wee drive and aime at the whole univerſality of things. It will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requiſite for us to ſearch out ſome other more univerſall Rule, which perhaps God of his great mercy will upon our diligent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour vouchſafe to reveale unto us: who therefore hides himſelfe, that he may be ſought, and therefore will be ſought that hee may be found, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 14, 15, 19. <q>He which hath inflamed thine heart to ſeeke him (ſaith <hi>Beatus Fulgentius ad Monimum)</hi> will by no meanes ſuffer thee to loſe thy end of ſeeking; for his faithfull
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49470:20"/>
promiſe can by no meanes be made void, which ſaith, <hi>Aske, and ye ſhall receive, Seeke, and yee ſhall find, Knocke, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi>
                     </q> Being now therefore about to unfold, what God hath revealed unto us, and given us to ſee upon our asking, ſeeking, and knocking. I firſt crave, and humbly begge the pious attention of all ſuch as are able to judge of things of this nature. And for the thing it ſelfe I will briefly diſpatch it in a few Aphoriſmes.
<q>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>There are three things which accompliſh that knowledge which is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for our condition, yea, which rather raiſe it to a kinde of Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the knowledge of God, Nature, and Art.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By art we underſtand whatſoever is compaſſed by humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as our thoughts, words, and actions: by Nature we meane whatſoever comes to paſſe of its owne accord by thoſe diſpoſitions implanted in things: by God, all that power, wiſdome, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which lying hid from eternity, hath hitherto diſplayed it ſelfe unto us, either in divine words or workes: he that knowes theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> three, knowes all things, for of theſe three the whole world conſiſts.
<q>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>A perfect knowledge of theſe three ought to be ſought for.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leſt we ſhould thinke we have enough, if we know ſomething of God, ſomething of Nature, and ſomething of Art, (for ſo much may be ſaid of the verieſt fooles and idiots) but that we may have a full and perfect underſtanding of all things that may be knowne.
<q>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Knowledge is then onely perfect, when it is true.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if it be not true, in ſtead of realities, it exhibits phantaſmes, and ends in a meere mockery.
<q>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Knowledge is true, when things are knowne as they are.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if they be otherwiſe apprehended then they are, it is no knowledge, but errour.
<q>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Things are knowne as they are, when they are knowne according as they were made.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For every thing is ſo as it was made, or elſe things muſt have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from that they were.
<q>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:49470:20"/>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Every thing was made according to its proper Idea, that is according to to ſuch a conception, by which it might be ſuch as it is.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For unleſſe things could be, they ſhould not be, and unleſſe they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="61"/> could be ſuch or ſuch, they ſhould not be ſo: that poſſibility there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of being ſuch, or ſuch, is called an Idea, whereby a thing is ſuch as it is.
<q>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Therefore all things that are, are made according to their Idea's, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be workes of God, of Nature, or of Art.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For ſeeing an Idea is a certaine rule of things, God cannot bee thought to doe any thing without Idea's, that is, without a certaine rule, as who is of himſelfe the rule of all rules: So likewiſe Nature when ſhe effects moſt orderly workes, cannot worke without a rule; as neither can Art, which is natures Ape.
<q>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Art borrowes the Ideas of its workes from Nature, Nature from God, but God hath them onely from himſelfe.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is commonly enough knowne, that Art is lame without Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Art is the daughter, follower, and imitator of Nature; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="62"/> as truly may we ſpeake it of Nature in reſpect of God, that without him ſhe can doe nothing, that ſhe is his daughter, follower, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour. But God imitates none but himſelfe, becauſe he neither can, nor will doe otherwiſe: he cannot, becauſe he can behold nothing but himſelfe in his infinite eternity: whence then ſhould he borrow either the beginning, or rule of his works? Neither will he, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is moſt perfect, he can will nothing but that which is moſt perfect: now nothing can be ſaid to be moſt perfect, but that one, onely eternall, and perfect good, which is himſelfe. If any man ſay, that God did take liberty to himſelfe to thinke of other rules for the forming of things, I aske then to what end he did ſo? If God doe nothing in vaine now in his ordinary concurrence with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, why ſhould he be thought to have done ſo at the beginning? why ſhould he bethinke himſelfe of any other way, when himſelfe was the moſt infinite patterne of all perfection? Was it, that he might conceale his owne Majeſty, No; for it was his owne good purpoſe to diſplay it viſibly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. Was it that he might mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the depth of his wiſdome by that looking off from himſelfe? Neither; for this would prove a diminution of the fulneſſe of his glory, if he could find out any perfection, which was not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which is impoſſible. Therefore it is moſt certaine, that both the creatures, and their Idea's have iſſued from this one fountaine.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49470:21"/>
And ſeeing that among the creatures every agent naturally labours to aſſimilate its object unto it ſelfe, why ſhould we not acknowledge the ſame in God, who hath imprinted this property in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? eſpecially ſeeing God can find nothing fit to be the end of his works, but himſelfe. Therefore we conclude that God takes from himſelfe the rule of his workes, as well at the end of them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="63"/> and power to effect them; the matter onely whereof the creatures are compos'd, and wherein they differ chiefely from their Creator, he takes out of nothing.
<q>
                        <p n="9">9. God therefore in framing of the world, figureth out himſelfe ſo as the creature is wholly proportioned to the Creator.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even as the impreſſion anſwereth alwayes to the ſtamp, although ſometimes it be more, ſometimes leſſe evident; whence ariſe divers degrees of this proportion. So the Sonne of God is called the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe image of his Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And yet man is ſaid to be made after the image of God, <hi>Gen. 1. 26. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 6. Yea, and all other things are ſaid to reſemble him in ſome ſort; for it is ſaid, that the inviſible things of God are ſeene from the beginning of the world in thoſe things which are made, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and that in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and beauty of created things their Creator may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably knowne, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 13. 5. And hereupon it was that the Gentiles entitled Nature not onely the Daughter of God, but ſaid that its ſelfe was God. Nature is nothing elſe, ſaith SENECA, but God, and divine Law implanted in the whole world, and all its parts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="64"/> 
                     <hi>de Benef. 4. c.</hi> 7.
<q>
                        <p n="10">10. And becauſe all things are partakers of divine Ideas, hence alſo it comes to paſſe that they partake one of another, and are proportioned one to the other.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thoſe things that agree in any third thing, agree among themſelves.
<q>
                        <p n="11">11. Therefore the conceptions of all things are the ſame, nor is there any difference, but in the manner of their exiſtence, becauſe in God they are as in their <note n="*" place="margin">Vt in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetypo,</note> Originall, in Nature as in the <note n="*" place="margin">Ectypo,</note> Coppy, in Art as in the <note n="*" place="margin">Antitypo.</note> counterfeit.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even as in a Seale the form is one and the ſame, which is firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the mind of him, that graves it, or commands it to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: then as it is engraven in metall; and laſtly, as it is ſtamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49470:21"/>
wax: For although it be threefold, yet it is the ſame, becauſe the ſecond is formed by the firſt, the third by the ſecond, each of them after the reſemblance of that which is next before it in order. So theſe Ideas being firſt conceived in God, imprint their likeneſſe in the creatures; and likewiſe the reaſonable creatures in things, which they themſelves effect.
<q>
                        <p n="12">12. Therefore the ground as of the framing, ſo of the knowledge of all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/> is Harmony.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That which the Muſicians call harmony, is a ſweet conſonancie of diverstones: the like exact agreement is to be found in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perfections of God, with thoſe which are created in Nature, and thoſe which are expreſſed in Art: for each of them is harmonious in it ſelfe, as alſo in mutuall reſpect one to the other. Nature is the image of divine Harmony, and Art of Nature.

                        <p n="13">13. The firſt thing required in Harmony, is that there he nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Muſical Harmony is compoſed of moſt different, &amp; contrary tones, and yet there is a certaine conſonancie to be found in their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety: So the whole world is compoſed of contraries; (becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them the Truth, and order, &amp; eſſence of the world would fall) as alſo the Scripture containeth many things in it, which ſeeme to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one another, all which notwithſtanding have a perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in themſelves, and ſo are to be diſpoſed in our underſtandings towards a perfect Harmony; that ſo there may bee an univerſall conſent, as in Divine, ſo in humane workes and words, all ſeeming diſſonancies vaniſhing of themſelves. The want of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="66"/> of this myſtery, is the reaſon that Philoſophers, and Divines doe picke out of Nature and Scripture, one this thing, another that, oppoſing Nature to Nature, Scripture to Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon drawing out contrary ſenſes fall into contentions, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among themſelves: which thing cannot chuſe but vaniſh of it ſelfe, if once the light of this univerſall Harmony doe but appeare. For Truth is one, and every way agreeing with it ſelfe.
<q>
                        <p n="14">14. The ſecond thing required in Harmony, is that all things have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſonancie and agreement.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt both in naturall, and artificiall things, that all are framed according to Harmony: So in a beaſt, a tree, a muſicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49470:22"/>
a ſhip, a booke, an houſe, all the parts are neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate, as to the whole, ſo to one another. But ſome men may make a queſtion, whether divine things have any proportion with things naturall, and artificiall? for it may be thought, that it beſt becomes the divine Majeſty to have nothing common with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But we muſt obſerve, that whatſoever is to be found in the counterfeit, is firſt, and by way of excellencie in the patterne: ſo the river proceeds from the fountaine, the ſhadow from the body, and the image in a glaſſe from the thing it repreſents. Againe, if the workes of nature are ſo abſolute, and exact, that there is no place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="67"/> left for new additions thereunto, (as GALEN confeſſeth, <hi>lib. 6. de uſu part. cap.</hi> 1.) and if the nature of Nature be unchangeable, and unalterable (as TERTULLIAN witneſſeth againſt <hi>Valent. cap.</hi> 9. 29.) what then is Nature, but a lively image of him in whom all things are firſt, and by way of excellencie, good, perfect, and unchangeable? Laſtly, in the Scripture God attributes to himſelfe eares, eyes, a mouth, hands, feet, an heart, a face, and back parts: alſo he ſtiles himſelfe, fire, a rocke, a tower, an anchor: To what purpoſe is all this, if theſe things cannot repreſent God? but if on the otherſide they can, and doe repreſent him, then it is certainely no otherwiſe then he is, ſeeing the word of God is the rule of Truth. We are not ignorant, that all theſe things are ſpoken figuratively, (for we will not goe a madding with the Anthropomorphites) but no man can deny, but that all theſe figures have their ground, and foundation in the proportion, and identity of the things themſelves: For every thing muſt firſt be, before it can be predicated. Therefore as arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall things are proportioned unto things naturall, ſo are naturall things unto divine.
<q>
                        <p n="15">15. The third property of Harmony is, that though the variety of ſounds and melodies be infinite, yet all ariſeth out of ſome few principles, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="68"/> certaine different moods.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all different harmonies, whatſoever have, or can be invented, ariſe onely from ſeven notes, and three concords. All corporeall things that are contained in the world, are compoſed of thoſe few elements, and ſome few differences of qualities: and ſo of the reſt: So that the multitude and variety of things is nothing elſe but the various iteration of the ſame things: As for example upon a tree, though there are millions of leaves, yet all are of the ſame figure, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and vertue; yea, and all trees of the ſame kind through the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49470:22"/>
whole world grow after the ſame ſort, and have the ſame active and paſſive diſpoſitions. So alſo the trees of ſeverall kinds agree in many things among themſelves.
<q>
                        <p n="16">16. Therefore all things will be knowne, if their principles, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their differences be diſcovered.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as in Muſick, he that knowes the nature of the ſeverall tones, and moods, will eaſily be able both to ſing, and compoſe any kind of melody; yea, ſuch a way is found out, that players on Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are able by looking upon one onely generall Baſe, to play many parts at once without any kind of diſcord: ſo alſo it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="69"/> that he may both underſtand, and performe, that doth but comprehend the generall natures of artificiall, naturall, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall things. As for example, he that knowes what faireneſſe or beauty is of it ſelfe, and whereof it conſiſts, will eaſily be able to know what is meant by a faire ſoule, a beautifull body, a faire co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, faire manners, or the like. Againe, whatſoever doth not agree with that Idea, will eaſily appeare not to be faire or beautifull. The opening of theſe fountaines will afford us the knowledge of a world of things.
<q>
                        <p n="17">17. Now theſe common natures of things are to be abſtracted from the things themſelves, and to be laid for the common rules of all things.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for example, the nature of faire, good, perfect, profitable of life, ſenſe, &amp;c. is to be ſought for in things which are faire, good, perfect, &amp;c. And this muſt be done by a prudent, and diligent ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of thoſe things which are not of the eſſence of beauty, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or perfection; untill the formes and natures of them remaine cleared from all other conceptions. For all things that are, have their common nature, or conception, whereby they are: therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> they all neceſſarily meet in ſome common manner of being: as alſo all living things in ſome manner of life; ſenſitive creatures in their ſenſation: and thoſe things that are beautifull in ſome manner of being, for which they are ſo called: and ſo of others. If therefore ſuch common notions, and Ideas were accurately abſtracted from all things, it would prove a generall key to let us in unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, a rule for all ſorts of operations, it would point out many new inventions, and be the touchſtone of all opinions, in a word, a moſt large field for all pleaſant ſpeculations.
<q>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49470:23"/>
                        <p n="18">18. But theſe rules of Truth muſt be abſtracted from ſuch things as cannot be otherwiſe then they are, and ſuch as are obvious to every one for making experiments in them all, I meane from naturall things.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Divine things are of themſelves unſearchable, and are knowne onely ſo farre, as they are ſhadowed but in nature, or revealed by the word of God: on the other ſide, Art borrowes all its reaſon and certainty from Nature, and is often deceived. Therefore the field of Nature chiefly is that, wherein we muſt ſearch for theſe Idea's, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> yet not neglecting the help of Gods word, the holy Scripture, wherein the trueſt, and ampleſt deſignment of the workes of God (that is, what he hath done, doth, and will doe, and to what end) is to be found. Therefore the rules, whereby our Panſophy is to bee evected, muſt be borrowed from theſe two, Nature, and Scripture, whereby all things great and ſmall, high and low, firſt and laſt, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, created and uncreated, may be reduced to ſuch an Harmony (or Pan-harmony rather) as which is true, perfect, and every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and ſatisfactory to it ſelfe, and to things themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre have we proceeded in the laying downe of rules for the reviſing of all things anew: It followes now, that we declare the manner how they are to be diſpoſed of. For we thinke ſuch a method is neceſſary for our Panſophy, as is abſolutely perfect, whereunto nothing may be added, and ſuch an one as may ſo knit mens minds unto the things themſelves, that they may find no end, but in the end, and may firſt reape ſome ſolid fruit of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, before they perceive any difficulties therein; which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive may be attained,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By an accurate Anatomizing of the whole Univerſe, if all the veines, and joynts thereof be ſo cleared, and laid bare, that there may nothing lie hid from our ſight, but every thing may appeare in his proper place without any confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is neceſſary, that the true ſignification of words (eſpecially ſuch as are of more generall uſe) be fully agreed upon, that homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="72"/> and ambiguons expreſſions breed no more diſſentions; and this will be effected by accurate definitions of things, ſuch as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians uſually premiſe before their demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Next after the diviſions and definitions of things ſhall follow their Rules, Lawes, and Canons, with their demonſtrations annexed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is alſo requiſite, that both diviſions, definitions, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, ſhould be 1. very cleare and perſpicuous, 2. of certaine uſe and benefit, 3. altogether true <note n="*" place="margin">

For the want of theſe three conditions, hath not without cauſe beene hitherto excepted againſt, both in the writings of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Divines. Many things are ſet downe ſo obſcurely, that even <hi>Mercury</hi> himſelfe would want another <hi>Mercury</hi> to explaine them. Many things againe of very little, or no uſe, and ſome things which are onely accidentally true. For example, that Metaphyſicall Theoreme <hi>Subſtantia non recipit magis &amp; minus,</hi> is neither true, nor if it be true, is it of any uſe. For he that is fully growne up is more a man then an <hi>Embryo,</hi> or infant in the womb: An Eagle is more a bird then a bat: The Sunne is more light then the Moone. And is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> it not a vaine thing to ſay, every Hogge is an Hogge, and every Horſe is an Horſe? For who would gain-ſay this, or who needs to be told it? Therefore the precepts of Panſophy ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing in them, but what is worth our ſerious knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The generall precepts of Panſophy ought to be nothing but reall and practicall axioms, that is, ſentences gaining credit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not to be demonſtrated <hi>(a priori)</hi> but onely to be illuſtrated by examples: as which, ſo ſoone as they are underſtood, cannot but be allowed by all men for a rule of truth. For ſuch generall noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons naturally ſtamped upon our minds, will be like fire-brands to kindle the light of truth, that it may ſhine unto us in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and withall will be the firſt moving wheeles in all our opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But we muſt have a ſpeciall care, leſt we admit any things for axiomes, which are not ſo indeed. For it is not without cauſe that the L. VERULAM, STRESO, and others complaine, That the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Canons in Logick are ſo farre from being exact rules of truth, or uſefull in demonſtrations, that they ſerve onely for diſputation, which is performed by excepting, diſtinguiſhing, limiting, inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and retorting, and indeed appeares to be nothing elſe but a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned brangling.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All particular theorems throughout the whole Panſophy, muſt be onely ſpeciall diductions of thoſe generals, which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without any new addition; as we ſee it comes to paſſe in the growth of trees, and living creatures, new boughs, or members are not brought forth ever yeere, but the former onely grow towards perfection. Panſophy being prepared after this ſort will be, 1. Eaſie to be apprehended, for one thing will iſſue out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="74"/> other; 2. It will be ſatisfactory in matter of truth, when all things that follow are grounded in thoſe that went before; 3. It will bee of excellent uſe: For it will be as a cleare
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49470:24"/>
mirrour, wherein to behold the natures and grounds of all things that can be known: And indeed ſuch a booke would not onely prove a Nurſery for all ſort of knowledge, but it would alſo water it, and make it take the deeper root: ſo that learners ſhould no more be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by perſwaſions, but rather compelled by demonſtrations to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that which is truth, which is the onely way to make one firmely grounded in knowledge.</p>
                  <p>As it is not uſuall therefore among Mathematicians to ſay, PY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAGORAS affirmes, that three times three are nine, or EUCLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DES makes three ſorts of continuall quantity, a line, a ſuperficies, and a ſolid body. All Geometricians agree in this, That the three angles of a triangle, are equall to two right angles; and he would be hiſſed at, that ſhould in ſuch things vouch their authorities; but their manner hath beene to prove by demonſtration, that thoſe things are ſo, and can be no otherwiſe, though there had never beene any ſuch as EUCLIDES or PYTHAGORAS: So we would have men aſhamed to alledge authorities hereafter, either in Metaphyſicks, Phyſicks, Ethicks, or Politicks, whereſoever reaſon may ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Now we have deſigned this in ſuch a method, as that the whole worke of Panſophy may proceed on without any repetitions, and that the ſuccinctneſſe, and brevity thereof may not (though the worke be full of cloſely-couched ſolidities) make it the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="75"/> for ſeeing it proceeds on by degrees, thoſe things that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will eaſily caſt light upon ſuch as follow. And ſo may that rule of fortification, No place defends it ſelfe, but is defended by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be happily put in practiſe alſo in writing of bookes, if all things that are delivered, receive both light and ſtrength from ſuch as were formerly knowne,</p>
                  <p>But in matters of greater moment, the authority of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be requiſite to be added, as the witneſſe of God himſelfe: as alſo ſuch things muſt be ſhewed, and manifeſted to the very ſenſes, that every man may have liberty to make experiment himſelfe of their truth: that, as among Mathematicians upon the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Theoreme neceſſarily enſues the perfect knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and alſo a Probleme being demonſtrated the effect certainely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: ſo the precepts of Panſophy may ſupply us with a certainty both of knowledge and operation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But if there remaine any thing, which cannot be ſo certainely demonſtrated, and yet is profitable to be knowne, let ſuch things be referred among thoſe that are farther to be enquired of, or elſe the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49470:24"/>
reaſons of both parts may be ſet downe; that every one may have liberty to uſe his owne judgement in enclining to either part; as alſo that an occaſion may be prepared for ſome or other afterward to diſſolve thoſe doubts, and to find out the certaine truth of them. For God communicates his light unto men, but by degrees, and we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="76"/> know that ſoft and faire goes farre. In the meane while, ſuch things, as ſhall be perfectly demonſtrated, though perhaps they will be few in number, yet they will be of excellent uſe. For it is farre better to poſſeſſe a certaine, full, and perfect knowledge, though but of few things, then to tumble about in uncertainty through the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall world.</p>
                  <p>Now betweene this booke of Panſophy (if it be once perfected) and other bookes of continuall uſe amongſt us, there would be as great difference, as there is betweene a muſicall inſtrument exactly framed for a full harmony, and many others that are bounded in compaſſe of a few notes, and out of tune: or as there is betweene a tune accurately ſet, or prickt (by looking on which alone an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſt or other Muſitian is able to expreſſe moſt various melodie) and thoſe Sets of Muſicall bookes in parts, which can onely be made uſe of by many together, and perhaps many times are full of diſcords.</p>
                  <p>Which booke ſo often as I conſider with my ſelfe, how greatly it would advance the ſtudy of Wiſedome, I have not, nor do not ceaſe to put up my humble requeſts unto God, that he would pleaſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="77"/> to ſtirre up ſome Noble, and Heroick minds for the kindling of ſo great a light in the world. And ſeeing that he hath made mee one of thoſe, who are ſenſible of humane imperfection, and do earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that things may be brought to a better ſtay: I thought that I ſhould not tranſgreſſe the bounds of my duty, if I my ſelfe ſhould make triall, whether his divine goodneſſe would make uſe of mee (for that heavenly wind bloweth where it liſteth) for the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating ſome ſmall light unto others, or at leaſt, that I ſhould be a ſpurre unto others, upon whom that divine goodneſſe hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed more leiſure, parts, and learning for the effecting of greater matters of this ſort, then can be performed by me. And what blame can it be to mee, if my deſires have beene very vehemently bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the benefitting of Chriſtian youth, either by my ſelfe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? yea, and I did greatly feare, leſt this ſo neceſſary a deſigne ſhould go no further than mens deſires, if my ſelfe ſhould publiſh my owne good wiſhes onely. I have therefore attempted ſomething
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49470:25"/>
according to that little which God hath beſtowed upon mee, that by that ſmall taſte, I might be the better underſtood, and others alſo whom God ſhall pleaſe to excite thereunto, may have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for to follow.</p>
                  <p>But I may not paſſe over in ſilence, what the occaſion was, which ſet mee upon ſo great a worke, as alſo what order, and method I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="78"/> have uſed in the compiling of it, and laſtly, what ſucceſſe I have found according to mine owne apprehenſion: all theſe I muſt ſay ſomething of, becauſe without propounding my owne intentions, I cannot expect from others either any ſound or favourable cenſure of them. But for that which I have performed herein, it ſhall ſpeake for its ſelfe in our booke of Panſophie, by peruſing whereof it will be eaſie for judicious minds to reſolve themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is now above twenty yeares ſince I was firſt touched with this deſire of ſearching out ſome meanes for the eaſing of thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are uſuall in the ſtudy of learning, and that by occaſion of mine owne unhappineſſe, which, alaſſe! deprived mee of the moſt part of my youth. For looſing both my parents, while I was yet a child, I began through the neglect of my guardians, but at ſixteene yeares of age, to taſte of the Latine tongue. Yet by the goodneſſe of God, that taſte bred ſuch a thirſt of deſire in mee, that I ceaſed not from that time by all meanes and endeavours, to labour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of my loſt years: and now not onely for my ſelfe, but for the good of others alſo. For I could not but pity others alſo in this reſpect, eſpecially in my owne nation, which is too too ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and careleſſe in matter of learning. Thereupon I was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally full of thoughts for the finding out of ſome meanes, whereby more might be enflamed with the love of learning, and whereby learning it ſelfe might be made more compendious both in matter of the charge, and coſt, and of the labour belonging thereunto, that ſo youth might be brought in a more eaſie method unto ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proficiencie in learning. But beeing ſhortly after at the age of 24. called to the ſervice of the Church, becauſe that divine functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="79"/> challenged all my endeavours, theſe Scolaſticke cares were laid aſide untill five yeares after: when being by Gods permiſſion bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed my country with divers others, and forced for my ſuſtenance to apply my ſelfe to the inſtruction of youth, I gave my mind to the peruſall of divers Authors, and lighted upon many, which in this age have made a beginning in reforming the method of Studies, as RATICHIUS, HELVICUS, RHENIUS, RITTERUS, GLAUMIUS,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49470:25"/>
COECILIUS, and who indeed ſhould have had the firſt place, JOAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES VALENTINUS ANDREAE, a man of a nimble and cleare braine: as alſo COMPANELLA, and the Lord VERULAM, thoſe famous reſtorers of Philoſophy: By reading of whom I was raiſed in good hope, that at laſt thoſe ſo many various ſparkes would conſpire into a flame: yet obſerving here and there ſome defects, and gaps as it were, I could not containe my ſelfe from attempting ſomething that might reſt upon an unmoveable foundation, and which if it could be once found out, ſhould not be ſubject to any ruine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after many workings, and toſſings of my thoughts, by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing every thing to the immoveable lawes, and rules of Nature, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="80"/> lighted upon my <hi>Didactica magna,</hi> which ſhewes the art of readily, and ſolidly teaching all men all things.</p>
                  <p>According to the Canons and rules whereof, when I had aſſayed a compendious way of teaching the Languages, and had publiſhed it (under the title of <hi>Janua Linguarum reſerata)</hi> that ſo I might ſee how others would approve of it: it happened that it was accepted <note place="margin">A Gate of Languages.</note> with much applauſe, and unanimouſly approved by the learned, as the true, and moſt genuine way of teaching the languages. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I apprehended a new occaſion to be offered mee of attempting to make an open gate unto the things themſelves, or if you will, a key of humane underſtanding, whereby it might have acceſſe unto all ſorts of things. From which worke, if it proved ſucceſſefull, I thought there was ſo much more benefit to be hoped for, by how much it is better to be wiſe, than to be able to prattle a few Latine words.</p>
                  <p>There wanted not ſome indeed, who were of opinion, that ſuch a Gate or Key of the things themſelves, was altogether impoſſible: for I did communicate my intentions with my friends: yet that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion which I had conceived of the univerſall, and conſtant har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of things, did encourage mee very much to thinke that all ſuch things as come in the compaſſe of humane underſtanding, might be reduced unto ſome certaine rules, which being finite, and perhaps not very many in number, yet ſhould be of infinite uſe. For thus I reaſoned with my ſelfe: If the tongue, that nimble intepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the mind, when it doth moſt luxuriate in variety of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="81"/> is yet ſo bounded, that of neceſſity it muſt utter all concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind in a few words, why may not alſo thoſe wandring conceptions be reduced, and brought into bounds according to the nature of things themſelves? For although things as they are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49470:26"/>
in themſelves may ſeeme to have a certaine infinitie in them, yet is it not ſo indeed: for the world it ſelfe (that admirable worke of God) is framed of a few elements, and ſome few kinds of formes: and all Arts whatſoever have beene invented, may eaſily be reduced unto a ſummary and generall method. Becauſe therefore things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Conceptions, and Words the expreſſions of thoſe Conceptions are parallel one to the other, and in each of them there are certaine fuodamentalls from which the reſt of them reſult: I thought that it is not impoſſible, to collect alſo the fundamentalls of Things themſelves, and their conceptions, as well as hath been done already in Words. Alſo the practiſe of the Chymiſts came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind, who have found out a way ſo to cleare, and unburden the eſſences, and ſpirits of things from the ſurcharge of matter, that one ſmall drop extracted out of Mineralls, or Vegetables containes more ſtrength, and vertue in it, and is uſed with better ſucceſſe, and efficacie, then can be hoped for from the whole, and entire lumpe. And is there no meanes to be found out, thought I with my ſelfe, whereby the precepts of wiſedome (ſo divided in the ſeverall enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sciences, yea and infinitely diſperſed out of their due bounds) may bee united and concentred together? why ſhould I deſpaire? All deſpaire is a diſhonour to God, who hath promiſed to hearken unto all, ſuch as aske, and ſeeke, and knocke. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I concluded with my ſelfe, that it was poſſible to plant ſuch an univerſall Nurſery of learning.</p>
                  <p>And then in the name of God I ſet upon this worke, obſerving the ſame method herein, which I uſed in compoſing the <hi>Gate of Languages.</hi> Firſt, that (as I did there with all the words of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue, ſo here alſo) all things worthy of mans knowledge ſhould be collected together, as into a treaſury. Secondly, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be ſet downe above once, unleſſe onely ſuch, as by reaſon of their connexion, and relation with others were neceſſary for the others explication. Thirdly, that nothing ſhould be ſet downe but in its owne place, and proper ſenſe, according to the moſt naturall order of things, and in moſt cleare expreſſions, that herein might be ſummarily, and clearly learned all things that are contained in all bookes, and libraries, and in the whole world it ſelfe. Which if we had ſo effectually performed, as to ſet open a Gate to the underſtanding of all things, and all bookes, without the helpe of others to guide men therein, it may be wee might have ſhared of that praiſe which TIMOTHY BRIGHT aſcribes unto ſuch,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49470:26"/>
as are inventors of brevity, and perſpicuity. For ſaith he, <q>Among all the parts of Philoſophy, wherein ſuch as are lovers of Truth, and of the beſt things, have taken paines, there is none more profitable for life, or which gives the mind a more reall content, then that which helps the other Arts with brevity and perſpicuity. Therefore we ought thankfully to acknowledge their endeavours, who have beſtowed their paines to this end, that learners may be eaſed of all tediouſmeſſe and prolixity, and freed from all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous labyrinths, and thorny difficulty. <hi>(ſuper Scribonii Phyſ. cap.</hi> 1.)</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſuiteth very neere with the preſent caſe, for when we firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted this worke, our intentions aimed no farther than onely at a ſhort and perſpicuous comprehenſion of all things that are to be knowne. But in the progreſſe of the worke, Gods goodneſſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted a more ſublime care, and thought into our minds, that wee ſhould labour to rectifie all things ſo, as wee might have them truer, and better, and more fitted (for us Chriſtians) for the intents both of this preſent, and the future life. Of the neceſſity of which intention, I have already diſcourſed ſufficiently. That therefore this worke might indeed prove a Gate, not onely into the reading of Authors, but rather into the whole univerſality of things, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred hither all things, that I could find extant either in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or humane workes or writings: not by an unprofitable, and ſuperſtitious diligence, making Catalogues of all, and ſingular things, but rather by a true diſcovery of the grounds of all things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="84"/> and in things of greater moment, by a more ſpeciall explication of what is moſt obſervable, which might eaſily conclude the reſt. Whence perhaps ſome things will be here found out, and pointed at, not onely ſuch as are newly invented, but even ſuch as remaine ſtill to be invented, which are no where elſe to be found. For wee have found our ſelves ſo farre carried in this new, and generall order of things, that no man ſeemeth hitherto to have reached thereto.</p>
                  <p>And to the end that this booke might alſo prove a dore into the holy Scriptures, I have endeavoured to inſert all the decrees of holy Writ every one in his place among the rules of Panſophy, &amp; to bring moſt of the hiſtories thereof for examples: to this intent, that Youth being acquainted with all thoſe great, and pretious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beſtowed upon us, by which wee are partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.) may not onely be fore-armed againſt the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prophane authors, when time ſhall require the reading of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49470:27"/>
them, but alſo againſt all other ſtumbling blockes in the whole courſe of their lives. 2. I have laboured to bring in all the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure paſſages of Scripture in their proper places, that ſo the due citation, and alleaging of them might be as a Comment, and cleare apprehenſion of their meaning, (of which kind of places of Scripture there may be annexed a particular table.) 3. I have laboured ſo to make uſe of the Phraſes, and acute expreſſions in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture throughout my booke, that youth may be acquainted both with the matter, and ſtile of the holy Spirit, and may not eaſily meete with any thing in the whole body of the Bible, which they knew not formerly. Neither do wee addict our ſelves unto any particular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="85"/> ſect in our divinity, but we deliver the univerſall, and Catholique Truth: as for thoſe things which lead unto dangerous by-wayes, whence it is hard to find the right way out, wee meddle not at all with them. For we judge it better to be ignorant of ſome things, than to know them amiſſe (as the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 15, 16.) Although I hope our grounds, and fundamentals are ſo well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo firmly cloſed, that the underſtanding Reader will eaſily judge, that there remaines little danger of by-wayes, and errours, moſt part of ſtumbling blockes being removed out of the way. For as it is impoſſible for him, which in two contradictory propoſitions (of which many may be found in the Scripture according to the letter) addicts himſelfe irreconciliably unto the one, but that the other will urge, &amp; ſtrain him very far: ſo alſo it is impoſſible, but that they being reconciled, &amp; combined together in a true, &amp; middle ſenſe, all difficulties, ſcandals, &amp; doubts wil vaniſh of themſelves to the great rejoycing of our minds. For by this means whatſoever truth there is in either opinion, it groneth ſweetly into one, &amp; whatſoever is vain, or erroneous on either part, preſently it diſappeareth; which that it is the only means of uniting all truths in the center of harmony, &amp; of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="86"/> ridding all controverſies out of the world, we have already declared.</p>
                  <p>For our order of handling the Sciences, we hope that by Gods grace we have attained ſo farre as that men may finde here an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of ſuch a method, as doth divide and diſpoſe things for our ſight, according as they are. For I truſt we have diſcovered the true veines of things in our Metaphyſickes, which if wee follow them will moſt eaſily conduct us unto all individuals, and to the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the leaſt and niceſt conceptions and words: ſo that we may hereby make a new Anatomie of the Univerſe, and truer than any hath hitherto beene ſeene. Neither doe they conſiſt of ſuch intricate
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49470:27"/>
ſubtilties, as can be diſcerned onely by the learned, and thoſe that are already verſed in ſuch matters, but they are ſo plaine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious unto any, though but of moderate apprehenſion, that even children of eight yeares of age may eaſily conceive of our whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſickes, and (by benefit thereof) of all the inferiour Arts, and Sciences with very little paines, but with much delight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation. That which is the ſtrength, and nerves of Science, I frame it into Aphoriſmes, or Axioms, but, as I hope, into ſuch as are true and ſolid, not ſuch as are trifling, and expoſed to the blows of contrary inſtances and exceptions, not ſuch as muſt be defended with the weake ſhields of limitations, but ſuch as will perſiſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable of themſelves, by the luſtre and force of their univerſall Truth. Neither in the delivery of theſe things, though evidently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="87"/> true, do wee preſuppoſe any thing, as if we would gaine mens aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by ſtealth or flattery, but we premonſtrate rather, that is, wee deduce one thing out of another continually, from the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Metaphyſickes, untill we come to the laſt, and leaſt differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Things: and this with ſuch evidence of truth, as the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Mathematicians have, when they are demonſtrated, ſo that there is a neceſſity of yeelding to the laſt as well as to the firſt, for the continuall, and no where interrupted demonſtration of their truth. Onely in our introduction or bookes of the <hi>Praecognita)</hi> we could not obſerve this courſe, by reaſon of the cauſes of things not yet delivered. Therefore there wee deale with humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as horſe-riders do with colts, when they firſt breake them. For at firſt they uſe eaſie bits, ſuch as will rather delight then trouble them, and runne them firſt on ſmooth and pleaſant grounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they uſe them to the ring.</p>
                  <p>One thing is ſingular, and even wonderfull in our Method, that all the chiefeſt diviſions of things are made by a Trichotomie, which I proteſt I ſought not by any ſuperſtitious affectation, but that it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it ſelfe freely unto mee in things of greateſt moment, even from the firſt attributes of things (One, True, Good) that I was for <note place="margin">Unum, Verum, Bonum</note> a while at a ſtand, being amazed with the newneſſe of the thing. But being erected in expectation by thoſe examples that I firſt lighted on, I began to try it other where, and found it every where to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="88"/> Therefore not daring to oppoſe the truth of things, which repreſented it ſelfe ſo in a threefold myſtery, but rather heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing ſo great an harmony of the ſacred Ternary, I proſecuted it in other things alſo, without offering them any violence (as I am
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49470:28"/>
fully perſwaded) but even as they divide themſelves of their owne accord. And I thought this would be very profitable for learners alſo: Firſt, in regard of their memory, which uſeth to proceed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically, both in beſtowing, and reviving of things. Secondly, for the underſtanding of the things themſelves, becauſe their nature doth for the moſt part diſcover it ſelfe moſt clearely in this way; wherein I appeale unto the judgement of all ſuch as ſhall piouſly, and ſeriouſly, and in the feare of God, weigh theſe things: being confident, that thereby they ſhall perceive not any vaine fancies, but even the truth of things themſelves. Let therefore this Chriſtian Panſophy, unfolding the Ternary myſteries be ſacred unto that eternall Trinity, JEHOVAH, God onely wiſe, Almighty, moſt good, and ever to be worſhipped.</p>
                  <p>Let no man be offended with the word Panſophy; wee know there is but one truly <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the onely wiſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 27. That which we profeſſe, is humane Panſophy, or the knowledge of ſuch things as God will have us to know, together with a diſcreet ignorance of ſuch things, as our great Maſter hath concealed from us. Secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but ſuch things as are revealed, unto us, and to our children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. and we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell men not to neglect theſe things by a careleſſe, and unthankfull ignorance of them. And becauſe in Chriſt are hidden all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdome, and knowledge, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 3. and we chiefely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to unfold the myſteries of Chriſt, that men may underſtand how by him, the eternall wiſdome, and power of God, all things have beene, and are to be made, untill the end come (when he ſhall have delivered the Kingdome to his Father, and ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24.) and that they may yeeld themſelves to the guidance of his Spirit; ſeeing, I ſay, we teach ſuch things, why may we not juſtly aſſume unto our ſelves the teaching of the true and ſaving knowledge of all things? It becomes us Chriſtians, and none others, to profeſſe Panſophy, for out of Chriſtianity, there neither is, nor can be any Panſophy. Which AUGUSTINE of old mantained <hi>(lib. 3. contra Acad. cap.</hi> 19.) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that onely Chriſtianity is true Philoſophy. And not without cauſe, for ſeeing divine revelation is no where to be met withall, out of the Church, and without it our underſtandings can reach no farther, then this preſent life, and our lives themſelves are ſo ſhort, that we beginne even to die, when we beginne to live; what can there be conſiderable in ſuch wiſdome as is gathered onely from the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49470:28"/>
ſenſes, &amp; from natural reaſon, which is not much before them? It may in deed for a few dayes feed us with ſome painted joncates, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="90"/> ſend us empty away. He therefore is wiſe in deed, who is wiſe for eternity: Yet ſo that he learn withal, for to paſſe over this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life with as much wiſdome as may be. Worthily was it ſaid by a Spiritual man, <hi>Chriſtians onely may be ſaid to know, becauſe they have it from God, all others doe but trifle, becauſe they have it of themſelves.</hi> And I will adde, that true Panſophy is the onely way to holy ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it alone teacheth us, how all our knowledge is but like a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, if it be compared with the ſplendor of that eternall wiſdome which is in God. We have therefore a threefold ground, why this manner of ſtudy, which we counſell others to, and which wee are now about, ſhould be called Panſophy, or Univerſall Wiſdome. Firſt, in regard of the proportion of the things themſelves to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding, for we would not have them torne aſunder one from another, ſeeing the underſtanding is capable of them all. Secondly, in reſpect of the Sciences themſelves, which we propoſe not as ſeverall, and divers, but as one Science comprehending all things within its owne compaſſe. Thirdly, in regard of thoſe, for whoſe benefit it is intended, I meane of all Chriſtians in generall: ſo that the fruit of this worke may be reaped by three ſorts: by the learned; by Youth in Schooles; and by all the vulgar in generall among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we have not undertaken to write a perfect Panſophy, but onely the Gate thereof, we doe not proſecute all things, (which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="91"/> would be infinite, and farre beyond any one mans abilities) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hinges and baſes of all things. And ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eing I profeſſe my ſelfe a Divine, who doe, and ought to make it my chiefeſt end, to ſhew others the way how they may ſee through viſible, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things unto thoſe, that are inviſible, and eternall; who can juſtly blame me, if I have paſſed over ſome things more ſleightly, which conduce to this end? Of which ſort is almoſt the whole Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Law, which is employed in nothing but contentions about earthly and tranſitory things, that is, in trifles, and vanities. And the Lawyers themſelves confeſſe that there is little ſublime wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in it. For BEFOLDUS, one of the moſt famous Lawyers of our age (near the end of his diſcourſe concerning the comprehenſion, or content of all the Arts and Sciences) writeth thus. <q>I may juſtly determine that that high, &amp; excellent learning, which men for the large extent of it, call Polymathie, is exceedingly beholden to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49470:29"/>
and not a little to Phyſick, but the Law only contributes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little towards it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore I doe not goe about to excuſe the matter, that I being a Divine ſhould attempt to circumſcribe this Polymathy, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoyce, that God pleaſeth to honour me by making uſe of me (how meane an inſtrument ſoever) for the diſcovering of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto men. I account the Goſpell, which Chriſt hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, moſt ſacred, and dearer then my owne life, neither doe I deſire or endeavour any other thing, then to be found a faithfull diſpenſer of his myſteries. But becauſe I know, that Chriſt hath ſaid unto PETER not onely, <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> but alſo, <hi>Feed my Lambs, John</hi> 21. 15. I am moſt confident that it is the duty of all Divines to take care, that as well theſe, as the other, may be brought backe unto the rich paſtures upon the high mountaines of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where they may lie in a good fold, and feed in a fat paſture, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34. 13, 14, 15. that thoſe Sheepe, and Lambs of Gods flock, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together againe, eſpecially then when the beaſts of the field cauſe them to be ſcattered one from another. Therefore with the Prophet, I will bleſſe the Lord, who wakeneth mine eare, that I ſhould be, as he that attendeth and learneth.</p>
                  <p>Neither will I ſtand to excuſe the rudeneſſe of my ſtile; as for tickling of mens eares, neither can I, nor will I doe it. There are more then enough of ſuch kind of men in the world: and there is more need of compoſing mens minds, that they may embrace pure, and untinctur'd wiſdome, which may the better be effected, if things be nakedly delivered without any plaiſtring, or bravery of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I deſire nothing, but to expreſſe the ſenſe, and therefore with PLINY, will reſt upon the wiſdome of ſuch, as are good and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they will preferre reall benefit and profit, before gracefull pleaſing, and eſteeme better of a compendious, and cloſe wrought ſerious matter, then of a laviſh, and flaſhing ſtile.</p>
                  <p>This is rather my deſire and requeſt, that men would not out of a precipitancie of judgment condemne things before they underſtand them, which I have great cauſe to feare. For I know there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that being bewitched with the great fame, and report of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, will preſently, though not without ſome blemiſh of indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reject whatſoever is new, as meerely fantaſticall, and vaine, not ſo much as daigning to give it the hearing, or peruſall. But ſuch men ſhould remember that of SOLOMON, He that anſwereth a matter before he heareth it, it is a folly, and ſhame unto him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 13.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49470:29"/>
I deſire not that any man ſhould yeeld his aſſent to a thing hee knowes not, for to doe me a pleaſure, but that men would conſider whether that which I offer, will impart unto them any cleare light in things, and afford them the infallible rules of vertue, to which it doth pretend. For my owne part, I am verily ſo perſwaded by the teſtimony of the things themſelves. Yet becauſe the thoughts of mortall men are fearfull, and their devices uncertaine, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 9. 14. I doe hereby cheerefully invite all ſuch unto the triall of it, whom God hath made ſo apprehenſive and judicious, as that they are able to judge of the Univerſality, brevity, and Truth of things. Such I intreat, that laying aſide the falſe glaſſes of former opinions, they would with free minds, and in open light behold this ſmall Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world, and not to judge of things according to what they have formerly had by hearſay, but according to the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which we hold forth to be handled and ſeene. For unleſſe they doe thus, they will caſt a cloud, not ſo much upon the things, as upon themſelves: as he that lookes through coloured glaſſe, doth not colour, or alter the things he ſees, but deceives his owne ſight. Therefore it is a thing worthy of mens care, that they hinder not themſelves by heeding their owne opinions more, then the truth of things. And I thinke that all diſcreet perſons will take pleaſure in it, if we once attaine (according to the priviledge which is common to us all) to looke into things without any overſeers, and that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be not diſtracted with opinions of things, but have the things themſelves, freely laid before them to ſee, and handle, and peruſe. Neither let any man ſuſpect that we remove other mens decrees out of the way, to make roome for our owne. We deteſt ſuch kind of vanities. We neither have, nor doe intend any other thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimply to tranſcribe out of Gods bookes, Nature, and Scripture, into a table for our owne uſe, ſuch things as concerne this preſent, and the future life, according as they preſent themſelves unto us; which if we doe not fitly enough effect, it ſhall be our failing, and not our fraud. We are not of ſuch account, that we ſhould thinke to make Diſciples to our ſelves, yet daring enough to ſeeke them for Nature, and for God. For this onely end have we endeavoured this new Anatome of the Univerſe, that all ſuch as love truth better then opinions, might be led away from other bookes, unto the greateſt book of all: not that we ſlight all authorities; but becauſe we know, that they are abuſed to the hurt and prejudice of the freedome of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="95"/> mens judgements, we hold it very fit they ſhould be a while ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49470:30"/>
untill there be liberty of piercing ſufficiently into the things themſelves. In deed in our firſt and ſecond booke of Panſophy, wee cite ſome things out of Philoſophers, for to eſtabliſh the grounds of Panſophy, yet not in it ſelfe, but onely in their minds, who being fore-clad with opinions, are to be ſtripped of them, even by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame men, whom they have hitherto followed as their leaders. But more rarely afterward, and in matters of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence onely, we cite ſome others, who have heretofore obſerved the ſame truths: yet not as Judges, but as witneſſes, from whoſe teſtimony it may appeare, that whatſoever hath beene heretofore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally concluded by any men, is neceſſarily coincident with thoſe things which are wrought out of the bowels of Truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to the end, that a perfect, and ſolid judgement may paſſe upon this our deſigne, it will be requiſite, that all things be ſurvayed from the beginning to the end. For unleſſe a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand upon what ground all things ariſe, and what coherence they have together, it will be in vaine for him to thinke to give cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon it by that which hee hath ſnatched here, and there. For the moſt eaſie gradation of things being interrupted, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſtop, and difficulty. Every man is able to get up to the top of an high Tower, and to come downe againe, if there be ſteps for him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="96"/> to aſcend by; but take away ſome few ſteps, and he is preſently at a ſtand, or fals into a precipice. When a Painter begins a Peece, no man will be ſo raſh, as to blurre the firſt draught of it, though as then it hath no beauty in it; but he will ſtay till it is compleat, and then he may have his judgement, whether it be anſwerable to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. A Comedy cannot be judged by one Scene, or Act, much leſſe by one ſentence, becauſe therein many things intervene, which ſeeme very intricate, and abſurd: but the Cataſtrophe or end will diſcover the whole Art, and Plot of it.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, whether I have reached or not, unto that which I have propounded, yet I earneſtly intreat the learned Readers, that they will not ſuffer me to faile of my end, which is, that theſe things may ſerve to the improvement of our age. For either I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing at all, or elſe thoſe things, which I make offer of, are really ſuch, as may open the eyes of many to take better order for the ſtudies of learning, and conſequently for ſchooles, Churches, and all mankind. Which ſhall be the firſt uſe of this our worke, pertaining to thoſe that are learned: that being excited by this new draught of true, ſolid, &amp; univerſal learning, they may adventure upon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49470:30"/>
ſome more perfect peeces then have yet beene ſeene in learnings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. The marke which we have pitched, is ſuch, that all mens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="97"/> endeavours ought to be leveld at, (unleſſe they would have them for ever to come to nothing) we have clearely ſet in order ſuch meanes, which infallibly lead unto that end, as alſo we have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the certaine way how to make uſe of thoſe meanes: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we give you a taſte of all things, how they reſult into one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Art of Arts, among all things that are to be knowne. Wherein notwithſtanding if any ſcapes, or failings happen to be eſpied, as that we have not ſufficiently reached our owne aimes, or have not contained our ſelves preciſely within our owne limits, I thinke I need not to frame any tedious excuſe: becauſe that moſt diffuſed multitude of things, which is able to tire out any one mans dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and that intricate, and ſubtill variety of them, which is able to deceive the quickeſt eye, will, I hope, be a ſufficient plea for my pardon, among ſuch as are able to eſteeme aright of things. Eſpecially, ſeeing nothing was ever yet invented, and brought to full perfection by any one man. And why ſhould I, a weake man, aſſume that unto my ſelfe, which was never yet gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto any? or why ſhould that be required of me alone, which was never yet required of any? It is enough for any one mans dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or praiſe, (if any may be here admitted, where onely Gods glory is ſought) to make a beginning of any thing, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="98"/> may afterward be raiſed unto high perfection. But that it may be ſo raiſed, it is now to be committed to others induſtry, whoſe hearts God ſhall pleaſe to ſtirre up thereunto, as he did in times paſt to the building of the materiall Temple in his holy City <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> God, that he might excite them thereunto, commands the Prophet thus to expoſtulate with them, <q>This people ſay, The time is not yet come, that the Lords houſe ſhould be built. But is it time for you to dwell in your fieled houſes, and this Houſe lie waſt? Now therefore thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Conſider your wayes. Yee have ſowen much, and bring in little; yee eate, but yee have not enough; yee drinke, but yee are not filled with drinke; yee cloath you, but yee are not warme; and he that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth wages, putteth it into a broken bagge. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Conſider your wayes, <hi>Haggai</hi> 1.</q> Heare yee this alſo O yee, that are Leaders among Chriſtians in Learning, and Wiſdome, for it is even your owne caſe. It is a frequent ſaying, This is no time for aſpiring unto any higher ſort of wiſdome, that is reſerved
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49470:31"/>
for the future life. And too many there are, that contenting themſelves with theſe thoughts, ſet up their reſt in a partiall, and obſcure knowledge of things, joyned with a few private delights, and ſeeke no farther. But what benefit enſues? Yee have ſowen much, it is the voyce of God himſelfe, (that is, yee have taken great paines in the poliſhing of your parts) but you bring in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: Yee eate, yea, yee devoure bookes, and are not ſatisfied: Yee drinke of every water you meet withall, and yet are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="99"/> filled: Yee cloath your ſelves, and caſt as many mantles of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities over you, as you can purchaſe, and yet you are never warmed by the light of Truth. O therefore conſider your wayes, and be encouraged to the building of a more ſtately temple for Wiſdome to dwell in, whatſoever paines, and charge it coſts us: That wee may I ſay by Divine Art erect an elegant ſtructure of Wiſdome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwerable to the patterne, wherein may be no confuſions, nor any thing that is frivolous, and unprofitable; but all things that are true, profitable, and deſirable: That ſo men being weaned from the vaine ſtudy of tranſitory things, and cleared of their high conceipts of vanities, may be invited to draw out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fountaines of truth, and goodneſſe, and led unto the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of reall goods. Which may be effected, if ſuch a gate of Wiſdome be ſet open for Chriſtian Youth, that they may come to behold the rich treaſures of it. Which leads me to the ſecond, and moſt wholſome, and ſeaſonable uſe of this our worke; to wit, for the inſtruction of Youth. For as new veſſels are fitteſt for new wine (as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 17.). So the minds of Children; like new, and pure veſſels, not yet filled with vaine apprehenſions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="100"/> of vaine knowledge, are moſt fit to draw in theſe new, and purer conceptions of things: and by this meanes will be accuſtomed, not to ſuperficiall, and opinionative knowledge, ſuch as is uſuall for oſtentation of parts, and for ſtreperous diſputations, and contentions: but to a more reall, ſolid, and well grounded Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: ſuch as will ſerve for ſound direction of the judgement, for multiplying of new inventions among men, and for a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect guide to lead us toward eternall bliſſe, the laſt end of our lives.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, our intention is, that this Amphitheater of Gods Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being thus raiſed, ſhould be made common for all mankind, by inviting all Chriſtian people of what ranke, age, ſexe, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſoever, and bringing them in to ſee, and behold what admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49470:31"/>
ſights &amp; paſtime, that ever to be adored Wiſdome of God exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits unto all men in all times, and places. For every mothers child that comes into this world, is to be directed to the ſame end of Gods glory, and his owne eternall bliſſe: none ought to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, neither man, nor woman, neither old man, nor child, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble, nor ignoble, neither craftſ-man, nor plough-man, &amp;c. For we are all alike, the off-ſpring of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. And it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="101"/> is ſaid alike unto all, that come into the Theater of this world, Come, and behold the workes of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 8. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all of us are to paſſe a tedious, and troubleſome life, which breaketh, and afflicteth the ſpirit (as SOLOMON witneſſeth) ſo that all have great need of preſervatives againſt vanity, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their wearineſſe, which helps can no where be found, but in the poſſeſſion of true wiſdome. We therefore deſire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that learning may not any longer be confined to the Latine tongue, and impriſoned in Schooles, as hath hitherto beene practiſed to the great prejudice, and contempt both of vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and languages: but that it may be communicated unto all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their owne languages, that all men may have occaſion of exerciſing themſelves in ſuch honeſt, and good things, rather then, as is commonly uſed, to weary out themſelves with the cares of this life, with ambition, drunkenneſſe, and other like vaine cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſo to miſpend, and loſe both their parts, and lives. By this meanes alſo, languages themſelves will be poliſhed, as well as the Arts, and Sciences. To which ends we our ſelves intend alſo, if God ſo pleaſe, to publiſh theſe our endeavours both in the Latine, and in our native tongue. For no man lighteth a candle to put it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="102"/> under a buſhell, but on a candleſticke, that it may give light unto all that are in the houſe, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 25. And what profit is there in Wiſdome, which is hid, and treaſure, which is hoarded up? <hi>Eccleſiaſtious</hi> 20. 30. Thoſe therefore that bend their ſtudies to the ſeeking of Wiſdome, ought to make it their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that they may herein follow the ſteps of Wiſdome, which ſaith, Behold, that I have not laboured for my ſelfe onely, but for all them that ſeeke Wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>And upon this ground we have ſomewhat altered our title from that which was in our former work, calling this a Gate, rather then a Dore. It was enough that we called our entrance into the Latine tongue a Dore, in this matter the word Gate ſeemes to drive more neerely at our intentions. For one by one enters in at a Dore, but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49470:32"/>
whole troupes through a Gate. A Dore is ſhut as every one is entred in: but Gates in peaceable Cities, ſtand alwayes open. And ſo the ſtudy of the Latine tongue, which we firſt endeavoured to open, is peculiar unto ſome few; but the deſire of Wiſdome is common unto all mankind. Thoſe that will, or are neceſſitated thereto, enter in there: but it is the duty of all men living to come in hither, as we have already made it cleare. Therefore let it be an open, and wide Gate which leades unto Wiſdome. Grant O Lord, that we may on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="103"/> earth ſee ſome reſemblance of that which thou haſt foretold ſhall be in thy heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Gates of it may not at all bee ſhut by day, and there may be no more night there, <hi>Revel. 21. v.</hi> 25.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a diſcreet and wiſe diſcourſe, which the mother of thoſe ſeven brethren Martyrs (2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 7. 22, 23.) uſed to them: <q>I cannot tell how you came into my wombe, for I neither gave you breath, nor life; neither was it I, that formed the Members of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you: But the Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the beginning of all things.</q> The like may they ſay of the off-ſpring of their minds, who out of a pious diſpoſition to God, offer up, and ſacrifice themſelves, and their endeavours to him, to wit, that themſelves are not the Authours of thoſe things, which ſucceed well, but that it is God, who hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it (by what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments ſoever) unto <hi>Jacob</hi> his ſervant, and to Iſrael his beloved, as <hi>Baruch</hi> ſaith, Chap. 3. Verſ. 36. And God himſelfe aſcribeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the beſtowing and conferring of wiſedome, for the performance of his owne commands, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 31. 6.) Now God commands not onely when he ſpeakes from heaven, and expreſſely declares, what hee will have done, as he did to the Prophets: but alſo when
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49470:34"/>
inwardly he enlightens the mind, or outwardly miniſters, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents occaſions of action (1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 4, 9.) ſuch as may be eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by any one, who will but carefully heed, and note the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, and guidance of Divine Providence in things both great and ſmall. My ſelfe (though the leaſt of all) am not without ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the effectuall concurrence, and ſweete diſpoſition of all things, by that admirable wiſedome of our God: That wee muſt needs confeſſe every uſefull apprehenſion, or invention to proceed from God, and not from our ſelves, and thereupon we may ſolace our ſelves, though malice rage, and teare both us and our iſſue, which we have conſecrated to God, becauſe it is not chiefly our, but Gods cauſe that is in agitation.</p>
                  <p>Not many yeares ſince occaſion was offered mee by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to compoſe a worke for direction in teaching the Latine tongue, (as other languages alſo) more compendiouſly, according to the true ſeries and order of Things, which by the perſwaſion of my friends, and approbation of ſuperiours, I publiſhed under the Title of <hi>Linguarum janua</hi> (following therein the example of the Iriſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the Colledge of <hi>Salamanca</hi> in Spaine, who firſt gave mee the hint thereof, which being commonly received into Schooles with great applauſe, incouraged mee to intend my thoughts for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of a <hi>Janua rerum:</hi> an entrance to the knowledge of things themſelves. For I thought it not enough to teach what is called white, blacke, hot, cold, a plant, a man, an Angell, Heaven, God, Chriſt, &amp;c. there is more need of teaching, what thoſe things are, that the underſtanding may be rather acquainted with the eſſence of things, than with their names; which when I had aſſayed by ſome ſmall endeavours, I was eaſily invited to the hope of a proſperous ſucceſſe of them. In the meane while D. PETER LAURENBERG ſets out under the Title of <note n="*" place="margin">Generall knowledge, or wiſdome.</note> 
                     <hi>Panſophia,</hi> an <hi>Encyclopaedia,</hi> or generall comprehenſion of all the arts, which having viewed with great deſire, and expectation, and not finding it anſwerable to the ampleneſſe of the title (for nothing was therein contained of the object and fountaine of true wiſedome, which is Chriſt, nothing of the life to come, and the way thereto, &amp;c. wherein to be wiſe is wiſedome indeed) I thought it a fit occaſion to ſupply, what was there wanting: that whatſoever is fit to be taught, and learned in Chriſtian Schooles, might be compriſed in one Summary, and in ſuch a method, which might inſtill the knowledge of all things into youth, more ſuddenly, and ſoundly, and more ſuitablely to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49470:34"/>
intents both of the preſent, and the future life. For (to tell you by the way) my intent was to epitomize thoſe bookes of God, Nature, Scripture, and mans Conſcience, that what things ſoever are, they might be all here digeſted into one continued ſeries and order, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations might be applyed to illuſtrate them withall, and the common and inbred notions and apprehenſions of humane minds might be referred to their ſeverall uſes. By this meanes wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To make the holy Scripture more familiar among Chriſtians then formerly it hath beene.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To put into mens hands a <hi>Clavis,</hi> or Key, wherewith they might unlocke moſt of the greateſt myſteries, both in Nature and Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To draw men more and more from the ſtudies and cares of this life, to the ſerious thoughts of life eternall, and that by ſuch means, as which thoſe, who have beene privie to the depth of our intentions, have and do ſtill judge may be profitable for the bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of men.</p>
                  <p>There wanted not ſome (ſome five yeares ſince) who perſwaded and urged mee to the publiſhing of this worke, as I had done the former. But in this I being not ſo adventurous, as before, nothing more could be obtained of mee, than onely for the diſcovery of mens judgements hereupon to publiſh the title thereof in the Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Catalogue of ſuch bookes as were to come forth the next Mart.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon it came to paſſe more then once, that this Title of <hi>Janua rerum,</hi> or Chriſtian Panſophie, was ſold publikely, which ſoone after I recalled, not thinking it meete to blow the Trumpet before my ſelfe, eſpecially in ſuch things, wherein delay is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: yet being deſired by an intimate friend (one that is piouſly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in his affections to the publique good) to communicate ſome <hi>Idea,</hi> or Deſcription of the worke in hand, I ſent him a careleſſe draught of that, which I intended afterward to premiſe in manner of a preface to the worke, which beyond my expectation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my knowledge, was printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (entituled <hi>Conatuum Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menianorum praeludia)</hi> with a good intent indeed (that ſo the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned might partake of it, and paſſe their judgements on it) yet with an event not fully anſwerable to that good mans hope. For though many learned and worthy men, forecaſting much good from ſuch a worke, encouraged us very much, and ſtill perſiſt to preſſe us, not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49470:35"/>
to relinquiſh the deſigne, and ſome of more excellent ſpirits, and abilities, do promiſe their helping hands, and endeavours. Yet ſome there were, who thought us not excuſable of ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall raſhneſſe for attempting of things ſo impoſſible, and above the reach of humane underſtanding. And ſome alſo, which is worſe, who from ſome words (uſed as they thought, not in an orthodoxe ſenſe) gathered ſuſpicions more than enough, fearing that ſome poyſon was mingled, or ſome monſter lurked under the trimneſſe of the method. Laſtly, there were ſome, who ſeeing wee deferred the publiſhing (though we had good reaſon ſo to doe, leſt the birth, which we deſired might be vitall, ſhould prove abortive, by coming before the time) thought that wee had faſtned a cheat upon the world by promiſing that which was ſo much wanting, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it as already neere effected: or elſe that wee had fallen under the burthen, and all our promiſes were turned into ſmoke. All which laid together ſet us on worke a freſh to write that which here thou findeſt (Chriſtian Reader) for the better clearing, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of our wiſhes, intentions, and endeavours. This was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by us, and printed, by the approbation and injunction of the Patrons of our Churches here (after a ſerious deliberation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in a late ſolemne aſſembly) not to be made common, but to be communicated to thoſe whom it may concerne. Hence therefore you may know:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our draught of Panſophie is no dreame, but a reall worke.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That here lurkes no Monſter, but that our intent is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile before all mens eyes, the true and amiable faces of Things, as they were formed by that eternall wiſdome, and imprinted in Things, that ſo they may be wonne, and inſtructed to reject thoſe wicked and devilliſh diſguiſes of falſe doctrine, and ill manners. For my purpoſe was not to coyne any new Tenets, nor to burniſh over old errours, but to collect together ſcattered Truths, both Naturall, Artificiall, Morall, and Divine; to digeſt them in ſuch a continued order (that there might be no end, but in the end; and ſo digeſted to direct, and fit them for the ready uſe of Schooles, or of any, who would deſire to take a compendious view of the amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater of Gods wiſedome. When I therefore was thus minded, did I uſe lightneſſe? or the things that I purpoſe, do I purpoſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fieſh? as ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. If any ill ſuiting expreſſion hath paſſed, I wiſh it were unſpoken, for I ſubmit my
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49470:35"/>
ſelfe and mine to the Churches judgement. But let wiſe men judge whether it be fitting to reject a faire, and well proportioned body for one ſmall ſpot or blemiſh. Hee that knowes all things knowe, this, that my deſires tend to no other end, than for the kindlings of an univerſall light in mens minds, which God hath made mee to find poſſible to be effected, by a certaine well compoſed method bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from nature, whereby all the rivulets of humane obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as alſo the greater ſtreames of divine workes, and words, are all reduced to their proper fountaines, and againe diſperſed in their true veines, for the eaſier deriving of a more univerſall knowledge into mens minds than could formerly be compaſſed by ſuch meanes, as have beene uſed. For while prolixe and tedious things are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to brevity, confuſed things cleared by diſtinction, obſcurity manifeſted by light, all things become pervious, and tranſparent to the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Yet here, becauſe the deeper wee dive into theſe things, the more doth the ſplendor of Gods wiſedome dazle, and the multitudinous variety of his wayes, and workes diſtract us, the judicious Readers, and examiners of this deſigne, may pleaſe to take notice, that wee cannot but doubt of attaining ſo excellent an end (as is an exact, and lively repreſentation anſwerable to, and worthy of the majeſty, and dignity of the Univerſe) unleſſe ſome do appeare to lend us their helping hands, that elſe may ſinke under the burden of ſuch a ſtructure; which we thinke may juſtly be both expected and deſired in a thing of common benefit.</p>
                  <p>But indeed it is much to be lamented, that mens inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould diſcover it ſelfe ſo farre, as purpoſely to affront, raile upon, and reproach, yea even to wound ſuch, as in a friendly way hold forth not a ſword, but a branch of olive, being ready in ſtead of tumultuous opinion, s to exhibit and tender ſomething towards more reall, and exquiſite ſcience. Some examples hereof our age hath beene acquainted with, and we our ſelves have had experience of it, from ſuch as had ſmall cauſe ſo to doe. Miſerable, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table! that men cannot remember, what difference uſeth to be put betweene Learning and Armes! Is it not enough, that the world almoſt, is conſumed by the ſword, unleſſe pennes alſo, and tongues be turned to ſwords? Let Armes beare that character of wrath, which an angry God imprints upon them, when he ſends them into the world to be like that <hi>great and ſtrong wind renting the mountaines,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 King 19. 11, 12. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>and breaking the rockes in pieces with earthquakes, and flames of fire:</hi> yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49470:36"/>
it is fit, that learning which is the inſtrument of wiſedome, ſhould be ſtamped with the the Character of divine preſence, which <hi>comes in a ſtill ſmall voyce,</hi> without tumultuous noyſe. Neither is there any thing more fitting, than that wiſe and pious men, wrapping up their faces, as it were in a mantle, ſhould with <hi>Elias,</hi> ſtand waiting at the entrance of the Cave, to ſee, what favourable breath of God may blow from any part. Otherwiſe, what wil the world be the better for thoſe odious diſputations, wherewith it hath ſo long conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Wherefore laying aſide that prepoſterous, and too long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſpirit of contradiction and oppoſition, let us with common endeavours ſearch out the wayes of Gods wiſedome, that ſo getting a taſt of it, as it is ſweetly diffuſed on every ſide, wee may the more comfortably paſſe this mortall life, and be more fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that which is immortall. My deſire is not to begge mens aſſents to this deſigne, before it be underſtood, but that affection, and prejudice may not over-ſway reaſon. I wiſh it may be examined; but fairely, and by free and impartiall minds: becauſe anticipated thoughts, &amp; reſpect of men more than of things themſelves, to gether with the humor of defending old opinions, rather than of ſearching for the Truth, do keepe in bondage, and enſlave even the nimbleſt wits. I oppoſe no man, why then ſhould I be oppoſed? I declare the meanes of reconciling thoſe, who are any waies devoted to Truth, why ſhould any be irreconcileable towards mee? Although I confeſſe,
<q>
                        <l>—Monitis ſum minor ipſe meis,</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not able fully to effect what I pretend, yet am I therfore worthy to be hated? It was not confidence of any extraordinary learning, or ſtrength of parts which moved mee to attempt to deſcribe the bounds of univerſall wiſedome: but becauſe I know, that that which God hath put into my mind, will be moſt profitable to the world, I thought that no occaſion ought to be loſt, for the inciting of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are more able to ſet about ſuch a great worke: ſo that I choſe rather to venture my ſelfe into the view of the world, than to reſerve in mine owne breaſt that, which might be for others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. For ſeeing the marke, whereat I aime, is ſo high, and ſo to be deſired of all mankind, if I come ſhort of effecting it, I ſhall deſerve pity rather than hatred. It is great inhumanity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhment on him, that laboureth to doe good, but moſt juſt, that he who goeth along the publique road, ſhould enjoy publique
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49470:36"/>
ſecurity, and that the promoter of the common good, ſhould be partaker of common ſafety and protection. But let us proceed to the matter it ſelfe, that we may once more publiſh our deſires, for the flouriſhing eſtate of the Church. I will therefore conclude this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in Saint AUGUSTINES words: <q>My ſpeech ſhall be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to thy preſence, O my God, to them, who yeeld thoſe things to be true, which thy truth continually teſtifieth in my mind. For, for thoſe who gainſay them, let them ruſtle as they liſt, I will endeavour to perſwade them to be quiet, and not to reſiſt thy word, when it approacheth to them.

BELLARINUS hath gathered out of ARISTOTLE in his <hi>Praxis Scientiarum, lib. 4. Diſtinct. 1.

But whatſoever was either purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or performed by any of them, yet we may juſtly apply SENECA'S Speech unto them all. <q>Our Predeceſſors have performed many things, but not perfected them.

The grounds and reaſons whereof, are there ſo in generall unfolded, that many have conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with us, that no doubt need be made either of the neceſſity, or poſſibility of it: But becauſe ſome have beene jealous, that by this meanes divine and humane wiſedome would be confounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have taken occaſion to propound theſe things more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upon ſuch a ground, which ſhould alſo alter the title of the booke.

properly to ſignifie a building reared for divine worſhip, in which ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe it is now chiefly uſed.

                  <p>And this is the firſt reaſon, why we have thought fit to entitle this our new <hi>Encyclopaedie,</hi> or generall comprehenſion of knowledge, with the name Temple, becauſe preparation is here made of an univerſall ſtructure, as it were, from whence mans mind turning to every ſide, may with pleaſing contemplation looke upon every thing in the world, viſible and inviſible, temporall and eternall, ſo farre as they are revealed.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon there is of farre higher conſideration, which the holy Scripture it ſelfe ſuggeſts unto us.

                  </list>
                  <p>We will adde a third reaſon alſo of no ſmall moment. Becauſe there may, and ought to be the ſame ends, and uſes of this Temple of Chriſtian wiſedome, which were of that materiall Temple in the old Teſtament. Now we may obſerve in the Scripture a fivefold end, which God had in his appointing of the Tabernacle by MOSES and the Temple by SOLOMON, which are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Gods people might be kept in the unity of faith, that is, in the worſhip of that one God, by that ſolemne aſſembling into one place, which God himſelfe had choſen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That by hearing the law taught, and beholding the outward grace of the ceremonies, they might be brought to learne the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and inward worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That by ſolemne rehearſall of Gods many favours, they might be incited to love God, and praiſe his Name. Thence it is that they were commanded to enter into his gates with thankſgiving, and into his Courts with praiſe, and to bleſſe his Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That they might kindle and nouriſh mutuall concord, and charity among themſelves, as fellow ſervants of the ſame God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, that by this meanes alſo they might have their minds the more erected in hope of the life to come; where God ſhall be for ever praiſed in that great aſſembly of elect, both Angels and men, before his Throne. Now this fabricke of the Temple of wiſedome tends to the very ſame ends.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all Chriſtians may the eaſier meet in, and maintaine a mutuall conſent among themſelves in one Catholique and ſaving faith: being inſtructed the ſame way, upon the ſame grounds, concerning the ſame God, and to the ſame end. For that holy way of Sion, which is ſo plaine in it ſelfe, that even fooles cannot erre in it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 35. 8. is here moſt plainly taught.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That by a rationall contemplation, and comparing of Gods words, and workes together, all might learne to obſerve the greatneſſe of all the workes of God, and how wiſely they are made, <hi>(Pſalm.</hi> 104. 24.) to the end, that wee who are Gods
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49470:39"/>
Image, may learne to expreſſe wiſedome in all our actions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Care, as it may, ought to be taken, for thoſe, who deſire to behold this Temple of wiſedome, that they may not want helps for the ſtirring up the like affection in them, that DAVID had, when the contemplation of Gods workes moved him to ſay, <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall indure for ever, the Lord ſhall rejoyce in his workes: I will ſing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will ſing praiſe to my God, while I have my beeing, (Pſal. 104. v.</hi> 31. 33.) 4. Neither is there any reaſon why we ſhould deſpaire of greater concord among men, if they could be brought to a more generall conſent in their opinions concerning the ſame things. For if all men would well conſider of this, that they are all directed to the ſame end, by the ſame Creator, and led along in the ſame common wayes (although there be ſome variety in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars) it is likely enough that they would be more ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their courſe to this divine Providence, rather than by fruitleſſe reluctancie to diſturbe it, which will produce no other iſſue, than that at laſt, whether they will or no, they muſt be brought into order in their eternall confuſion. 5. Laſtly, this Temple of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be alſo fitted for the ſtirring up both of the hope, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the life to come, if in this generall ſurvey of things it be plainly manifeſted, how <hi>all things ſpring out of eternity, and returne thither,</hi> and conſequently that thoſe who ſettle their affections here, do nothing elſe, than catch at a vaine ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre have we ſhewed, why this Theater of wiſedome may well paſſe under the name of a Temple. The next is, why wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title it not wiſedome ſimply, but univerſall wiſedome, and Panſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie (according to the Greeke.) I will not here produce examples of others (as of LAURENBER GIUS, and ALSTEDIUS, who commendeth five ſorts of things to be knowne, to him that deſires to be, and to be accounted generally wiſe and knowing <hi>Archilog. cap.</hi> 1.) Our owne ground is ſufficient, which is threefold, taken from the ſubject of this wiſedome, the object of it, and the manner of teaching it. As for the ſubject, it hath beene the cuſtome of former ages, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the myſteries of wiſdome to be publiſhed in vulgar languages, for every ones underſtanding, but in ſtrange and forraine languages (as the Latine and Greeke) which muſt be of purpoſe learned for them: by which meanes wiſedome it ſelfe was eſteemed the peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch onely, as had acceſſe unto thoſe fountaines: But wee claime it as the publique poſſeſſion granted unto all mankind, which ought to be recovered to their common uſe and behoofe. And our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49470:39"/>
earneſt deſire and ſuit is, even by the glory of God, that ſome courſe may be ſought, and diſcovered, that all in generall, even the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſort of people, may be able to behold, and adore the prints, and footſteps of the goodneſſe of their Creator, expreſſed even in all things, which they either ſee, heare, taſte, touch, do, ſpeake, or think. And this is the firſt reaſon, why wee call it not (ſimply) wiſedome, but wiſedome generall for all men. Concerning the object of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it hath hitherto for the moſt part beene parted among the learned, one undertaking Philoſophy, another Divinity, a third Phyſicke, and ſome the Lawes, rejecting all other care, or reſpect of common Truth. And againe, in Philoſophie one chooſeth this part, another that, to buſie their thoughts about, not ſo much as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere the threſhold where the others dwell. Whence it cometh to paſſe, that moſt mens knowledge is but particular, yea and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall too, which is farre worſe. For they muſt needs ſever into parts, that agree not in the whole, and they eaſily become the founders of Sects, who underſtand not how Truth, which differs not from it ſelfe, ſpreads it ſelfe upon the ſame ſtocke. But wee proteſt to the world, that neither order the bond, nor truth the ſoule of things, can be perfectly knowne, unleſſe from a generall comprehenſion of all things. The order or things cannot be perceived by thoſe, that bounding themſelves in the compaſſe of one or two, neglect their coherence one with another. Neither can hee comprehend the full Truth of Things, who obſerves not, how Truth ſtill retaines its own form in its infinite diffuſions. We wiſh therefore, that the whole orbe of Things and humane knowledge being taken, the true cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of eſſences may be found, by an exact meaſuring of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things among themſelves: that ſo venerable Truth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering its amiable face to us in abſtract formes, wee may be the ſo oner acquainted with it, when we meete it concrete in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Things. And hence may eaſily be gathered, how little that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcing of Divinity from Philoſophy, and of Philoſophy from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which is every where to be found, liketh us. For Divines for the moſt part thinke it their duty to intend nothing, but Divinity: &amp; on the other ſide Philoſophers fixe themſelves ſo to the ſpeculation of nature, that they forget Divinity, yea even God himſelfe. Hence it comes to paſſe that many Philoſophers through diſuſe of God, and religion fall into meere Atheiſme; againe, ſome Divines loath and deteſt Philoſophie, which is very injurious, as the other is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly impious. For God, who is the Author as well of his workes,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49470:40"/>
as of his words, will (as he may well be) be acknowledged and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in them both. And he inſtructs us both by his words, and alſo by his workes, which wee here meete withall in this preſent life, that he may prepare us for that which is to come. Therefore he doth not onely injoyne us to hearken to his voyce; but alſo to behold his workes. That we may therefore reconcile Philoſophie to Divinity (that is, Gods workes to his words, or Truth impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Things to Truth expreſſed in words) and ſo may make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubordinate to faith; Our Counſell is, that among Chriſtians, neither Philoſophy, nor Divinity may be taught ſeverally, but both <note place="margin">Omni ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</note> joyntly, which is <hi>Panſophie.</hi> For this will be our perfect wiſedome, to be wiſe for the life to come, and to avoid folly here: to have an eye to God, and the life to come, and yet to obſerve, how we are here encircled with his Majeſtie diffuſed over all.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay (and ſome have already vented ſuch ſpeeches againſt us) By this your Panſophie, Divinitie will be confounded with Philoſophy, Divine wiſedome with humane, &amp; a medley will be made of heaven and earth I anſwer, 1. Seeing they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in learned mens underſtandings (there being many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirits, that are deeply inſighted both in ſacred and profane knowledge) what reaſon have wee to feare, that they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in bookes? 2. Diſtinct things may be ſo diſtinctly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that though they goe together, they may ſtill remaine incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. 3. How comes it to paſſe that they are not confounded in the ſacred Scripture, ſeeing it doth not onely declare heavenly and eternall things, but oftentimes falls upon things of this life? You will ſay, But this is ſubordinately to the life to come. True; and this is the ſame, which we would have done in this booke of Panſophie, that all things contained in the world may be put in ſubordination to heaven, and that all humane knowledge may be ſubſervient to that, which is according to Godlineſſe. And this for a threefold end. 1. That the children of God may not be ignorant of thoſe things, which the wiſe men of this world ſo much admire, and ſet up their reſt upon: and that worldlings themſelves may be unſettled from them, when they ſee, that though wee underſtand them, yet we find other more excellent things, which are ſtronger attractives of our affections. 2 Becauſe the workes of Nature, and the various myſteries, which lie couched therein, are not intended ſo much for wicked and profane men, that they onely ſhould feed on ſuch dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but rather that they ſhould delight the children of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49470:40"/>
and Men, for whom this ſo admirable Theater of his power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe is diſcovered. Let us therefore make uſe of this our right, and rather ſit ourſelves in this Theater in a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall contemplation of all things, than ſurrendring our places to ſuffer it wholly to be poſſeſſed by ſuch as are profane. Laſtly, wee would have all things ordered together, and reſpectively ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated one to the other, that by all inferiour things the mind may by degrees be raiſed to all things more ſublime. For it is certaine, that there can be no commodious aſſent unto the height of things, but by degrees; and this is as certaine that all Naturall things (as alſo artificiall) are as Alphabeticall elements to the children of God, whereby they are prepared for to read, and underſtand better the higher dictates of the Law of God. Which DAVID ſheweth, where he telleth us, that much is to be learned out of the ordinary courſe of Heaven and Nature, but much more by the preſcript of divine Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. The third reaſon why wee would have the word <hi>Panſophie</hi> uſed, is drawne from the more ample way of handling things, than can be uſed either in Philoſophie, or Divinity ſeverall by themſelves. For that which ARISTOTLE required in a wiſe man, (who ſhould as much as is poſſible, know all things) the ſame is neceſſary in Panſophie. I meane univerſality of Principles, A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and well ordered ſeries of Things without interruption, from the beginning to the end, and infallibility of Truth. The Principles which are here laid, are truly univerſall, whereby all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands may be ſatisfied, Senſe, Reaſon, and Divine Revelation. The method, which is here taught, is as eaſie as may be, beginnnig from things moſt certainly knowne, untill it end in thoſe which are moſt obſcure, yet with ſuch a perpetuall gradation, as is without either gap, or breach. Whence the third iſſueth of it ſelfe, I meane, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of knowledge, and Truth, whereby the learner, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the light, ſeeth aſſuredly, that he goeth forward, and not backward, without either ſtay or doubt, and knowing he knowes, that he knowes, and that he is not deceived.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that vve teach, hovv all men may be altogether vviſe in All things (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) vvhy may not that vvhich <note place="margin">Omnes cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca omnia, omnino.</note> vve teach be called, and eſteemed Panſophie?</p>
                  <p>But vvhat is the reaſon, vvhy vve call it not onely <hi>Panſophie,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtian Panſophie?</hi> Firſt, becauſe they onely can frame <hi>Panſophie,</hi> or reap fruit by it, vvho are furniſhed vvith ſufficient principles, ſuch as are Senſe, Reaſon, and Faith in Divine Revelations. But
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49470:41"/>
Chriſtians onely have the world in their eyes, Gods word in their mouthes, and his Spirit in their hearts, according to the promiſe, <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 59. 21. And therefore AUGUSTINE argues very ſtrongly, that onely Chriſtianity is true Philoſophie, <hi>(lib. 3. contra Academ. cap.</hi> 19.) Secondly, all pious and faithfull Chriſtians, even the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt of them, in as much as they are good Chriſtians, are poſſeſſed of this Panſophie. Becauſe they reliſh heaven more than earth, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things more than temporary, and do poſſeſſe Chriſt, (in whom all the treaſures of wiſedome are hid) myſtically indeed, yet truly in like manner, as every ſeed doth truly containe in it ſelfe the whole tree, or herbe, with their fruit. But perhaps this might have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beene called <hi>Humane Panſophie,</hi> becauſe (according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <note place="margin">Doubt. 1.</note> of it, which is univerſall inſtruction, leading from univerſall, and eaſie Principles to thoſe things which are more obſcure) it ought not to be appropriated to Chriſtians onely, but ſo diſpoſed, that all men may partake of it, that (if God ſo pleaſe) it may be a means of enlightning, and convincing the minds of unbeleevers: As alſo to cleare our ſelves from all imputations of inconſiderateneſſe in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting <note place="margin">2.</note> things above the Sphere of humane abilities; Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we urge nothing but humane, that is, things poſſible, and due to man. To conclude, whether this or the former Title plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">Solut.</note> beſt, it mattereth not much: for our part, we thought fit to uſe the word <hi>Panſophie</hi> for this onely end, becauſe we deſired to ſharpen mens appetites toward wiſedome, that All men in All things may altogether ſeeke to fill their minds with Truths and realities, rather than with the ſmoke of fancies and opinions. Laying aſide this conſideration, we care not though it be called <hi>Ariſtoſophie,</hi> or <hi>Chre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoſophie, (i.</hi> excellent and choyce wiſedome, or about ſuch things as are excellent) yea even ignorance: For wee are very willing with SOCRATES to profeſſe, that wee know this onely, that wee know nothing: As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man thinke that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know, 1. Corinth.</hi> 8. 2.</p>
                  <p>The next thing we are to ſpeake of is, why we ſay, that the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of this Temple of Panſophie, is framed according to the Rules, Lawes, and Idea's of God the ſupreme Architect? The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is at hand: Becauſe we follow in the generall dimenſions, the ſeverall parts, their ſituation &amp; uſe, the very pattern which Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it ſelfe did before delineate. Firſt to MOSES for the erecting of the Tabernacle: then for SOLOMON in the building of the Temple: Laſtly, to EZEKIEL for the glorious reſtauration of the Temple, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49470:41"/>
was demoliſhed. For firſt God ſpeakes thus to MOSES, <hi>Exod. 25. 8, 9. Let them make mee a Sanctuary that I may dwell amongſt them, according to all that I ſhew thee, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>verſ. 40. And looke that thou make them after the patterne which was ſhewed thee in the Mount.</hi> Againe, God ſent (by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> as is probably held) the patterne of the Temple, and all the parts thereof to <hi>David,</hi> who delivering it to <hi>Solomon,</hi> charged him not to depart from the forme thereof, proteſting thus to him, 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 19. All this the Lord made mee underſtand in writing by his hand upon mee, even all the workes of this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne.</hi> Laſtly, he ſhewed to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the forme of the myſticall Temple; that is, of the new Church under Chriſt, with expreſſe charge to be attentive in the receiving of it, and to declare it all unto the houſe of Iſrael, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 4. Now we muſt obſerve, that every latter draught was more full and perfect than the former. Not as if God gained skill by continuance of time, and practiſe for the mending of his workes (as is common with men in building, that their latter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes pleaſe them more, and are better than the former) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would therein prefigure the State of the Church, as it was to improve with time. For it was for our ſakes, not his owne, that theſe things were figured out to us. The Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſiſted of three parts, the Court, the Sanctuary, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Holies, as appeares in the 40. Chapter of <hi>Exod.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> contained without the inward, and laſt ſpace, (the Holy of Holies) three outward ſpaces, the Court of the Common people, the Court of the Levites, and the Court of the Prieſts: and laſtly, the Holy of Holies, which might be entred by the high Prieſt onely once every yeare. The ſtructure of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Temple conſiſted of the ſame number of parts (though of more walls and gates) but of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſituation. For <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was built upon Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> but onely on the plaine thereof: but the outward parts of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Temple, were ſituate on the ſide of the hill, every more inward Court being raiſed certaine degrees above the other, ſo that the Temple it ſelfe, that is, the Holy of Holies being pleaſantly ſeated on the very top, yeelded every way a moſt refulgent ſplendor. Which divers ſtructures of Gods dwelling places amongſt men, did typifie the various increaſes, and enlargements of God Church, as well in regard of its ſpreading among many peoples, and tongues, as alſo in reſpect of knowledge, which was to be encreaſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Churches ages. For the Church hath its ages as well as the world, infancie, youth, middle age, declining, and old age:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49470:42"/>
which laſt, as it brings decay of bodily ſtrength, ſo alſo it perfects the vigour of the mind: in regard that then the temper of the body declines to drineſſe, whereby the animall ſpirits become more fixed, and the mind more ſedate, and quiet in its motions. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very fitting, that the Church of the New Teſtament ſhould be of ripe underſtanding, eſpecially now the world is drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards old age, (1 <hi>Cor. 14. 20. Eph.</hi> 4. 14.) We have therefore bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for this Temple of Chriſtian wiſedome the forme of the draught of the laſt Temple given to EZEKIEL: diſtinguiſhing the whole worke of Panſophie into ſeven ſeverall parts, in every one whereof ſeverall things may be preſented to the beholders view, that ſo mens minds being raiſed from baſer things to thoſe which are more ſublime, may at laſt attaine to its Holy of Holies, that is, Gods bleſſed eternity. But how this may be drawne from the forme of EZEKIEL's Temple, remaines now to be explained.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Firſt, EZEKIEL declares briefly, and in generall, what he ſaw in the viſions of God; to wit, 1. A City ſcituate upon a Mountaine, the place of that moſt magnificent Temple, which hee was about to deſcribe, <hi>chap. 40. verſ.</hi> 2. 2. A man ſtanding by him provided with meaſures, and rules, who ſhould ſhew him all thoſe things, exhorting him to liſten, and behold, and to ſet his heart upon thoſe things which ſhould be ſhewed him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. 4. 3. The compaſſe of the Temple, or the outward wall, with the meaſures of its breadth, and height, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Next he deſcribeth the gate of the Temple, which was onely one in the whole compaſſe of the Temple, and that on the Eaſterne ſide thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 6. to the 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The firſt or outward Court, which was called the Court of the people, becauſe all the people might come into it, is deſcribed, <hi>v.</hi> 17. to the 28. which had three gates, through which the aſcent was by ſeven ſteps unto the pavement of that Court, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 19, 22, 26.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Then hee deſcribeth the middle Court, where the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments were kept, and preparation made by the Levites, as was fitting, for legall ſacrifices, and oblations: the deſcription where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be found from the 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> to the 44. And we muſt obſerve, that it was higher by eight ſteps, than the firſt Court, as appeares by the Deſcription of the Gates thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 31, 34, 35.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Then followes the inward Court, wherein was the Altar of burnt-offerings, with other neceſſaries for making of atonement; wherefore it is called, the Court of the Prieſts. The Deſcription there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, <hi>v.</hi> 44. to 48.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49470:42"/>
VI. The Temple it ſelfe, called the Holy of Holies <hi>(chap. 41. v.</hi> 4.) is deſcribed, from the 48. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the 40. <hi>chap.</hi> to the end of the 41. <hi>chap.</hi> and the ſcituation thereof upon the very top of the Hill, <hi>chap. 43. v.</hi> 12. Therefore in the Deſcription of the Porch thereof <hi>(chap. 40. v.</hi> 49.) mention is made of ſteps, yet without any expreſſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how many there were. In the Temple it ſelfe, or Houſe of the Lord, nothing is mentioned beſides the Cherubims, and Palme-trees <hi>(chap. 41. verſ.</hi> 20, 21.) and the Table which is before the Lord, <hi>(v.</hi> 24.)</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, after the ſetting downe of the Ordinances for Gods worſhip in this new Temple <hi>(chap.</hi> 43, and 44.) and the forme of politicall government among Gods people <hi>(chap.</hi> 45, and 46.) he comes at the beginning of the 47. <hi>chap.</hi> to deſcribe the river of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters iſſuing out of Gods Temple through thoſe three Courts, and from a ſmall beginning riſing to a very great depth, and how from thence it was diffuſed over all the earth, giving life and fruitfulneſſe unto all things.</p>
                  <p>Now if wee forme the diviſions of the ſtructure of wiſedomes Temple according to this patterne, it will alſo conſiſt of ſeaven parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. In the firſt part ſhall be generally handled by way of preface, 1. What manner of booke this Panſophie is, and what end, and uſe there is thereof. 2. What are thoſe helps which Gods goodneſſe hath ſupplyed us withall, for the furniſhing of univerſall wiſedome. 3. What is the generall forme thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In ſtead of the Eaſterne gate, we will have a Syſteme, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſuch common Notions, as are of themſelves obvious to all mens underſtandings. For our mind being the image of that high God, from whom all things derive their eſſence, is compoſed of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and furniſhed with inbred rules, for the diſcerning of Truth from falſhood. And theſe Rules are certaine common Truths, which need no proofe, becauſe as ſoone as they are uttered, every ſound underſtanding doth admit them freely. But other particular things, which are ſubject to any queſtion, are examined by theſe, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allowed or rejected. Now a ſufficient ſtore of ſuch common and obvious notions will prove a truly ſacred Gate for our eaſie, ſafe, and ſpeedy entrance into the knowledge of all things.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The Court of the people ſuggeſteth to us the third part of Panſophie, which treats of ſuch things, as fall under our ſenſes, the viſible world, with all viſible creatures therein contained; and ſuch
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49470:43"/>
things as are by Nature effected in them, or with relation to them. For the Gate of common Notions openeth hither immediately, that common truth being already taſted of, may be farther ſought, and found in ſuch things as are neere at hand, and may be ſeene, and felt: which is a very eaſie and certaine ſtep to the diſcovery of things more remote. And here men ſhall learne the knowledge of naturall life, and of ſuch things, as are requiſite for the prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that ſo they may have skill, and ability to preſerve, and draw it out by naturall meanes, as long as their deſtiny ſuffereth them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The middle Court ſhall be paralleld by the fourth part of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, which explaines ſuch things as are ſubject to reaſon, or the Intellectuall world, that is, all humane workes, which are, and may be effected by wit and Art, and all things which humane underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reacheth unto. The neareſt entrance hither is out of the Court of Nature: for all that our art and wiſedome can effect, is either to imitate the courſe, or amend the defects, or ſupply the wants of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In this Theater men may learne wherein they excell brute beaſts, to wit, in the right uſe of Reaſon, in prudent diſpoſing all ſorts of affaires, and in the benefit of ſpeech. In a word, here they may find how to live a true rationall life, as well in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and other men with whom they converſe, as of all other creatures alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The innermoſt Court ſupplies us with the fift part of Panſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, wherein men ſhall be brought acquainted with themſelves in their inward man, and taught to lead a divine, and ſpirituall life. For here man ſhall behold that part of himſelfe, wherein he moſt reſembled God, that is, the abſolute freedome of his will. So as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beforehand ſtored with proviſion from his ſenſes, for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things, and the light of reaſon to direct his judgement in them, he might now like a King of unbounded power, freely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, or refuſe things according as they were repreſented, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by the ſenſes, and either approved or rejected by reaſon. For this is the greateſt height of dignity, that creatures can be raiſed unto by their Creator: as God expreſſeth in his conſultation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the creation of man: <hi>Let us make man according to our Image, who may have dominion over the fiſh and birds, &amp;c.</hi> that is, that he may do according to his owne will. For it was requiſite for the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, that beſides elements, ſtones, plants, and brute beaſts, and ſuch like, which have their actions aſſigned them by nature,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49470:43"/>
and act onely according to the force of their naturall inſtincts, there ſhould be alſo ſome more noble Creature, who ſhould be maſter of his owne, both actions and inclinations. Beſides it makes much for the glory of God, whoſe wiſedome diſcovers it ſelfe farre more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly in over-ruling ſuch creatures, as are acted by their owne wills, than in ſuch as are by nature determined to their actions. And hereby God prepared a way to manifeſt the depth of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in rewarding voluntary obedience, of his juſtice in puniſhing of ſinne, and laſtly of his clemencie in reſtoring this moſt excellent Creature after his fall. Therefore he is the adequate object of the full diſcovery of Gods wiſedome, MAN: who bethinking himſelfe of his former height of dignity, will the eaſier acknowledge the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his fall into that bottomleſſe gulfe of miſery: from whence there was no other recovery, or reſtitution to his former dignity, unleſſe God himſelfe ſhould condeſcend to tye him to himſelfe by a ſtronger bond, in a new and eternall union.</p>
                  <p>In this part of Panſophie therefore, Man ſhall behold thoſe great and profound myſteries, which are hid from the eyes of the world, of his internall Generation, Degeneration, and Regeneration: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with thoſe admirable ſecrets of God, in mans creation, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſanctification, in Gods governing him, or giving him over, in his ſalvation or damnation: and ſhall learne (being drawne out of the depth of perdition, and reſtored to God, and to himſelfe) hereafter to deny himſelfe, that is, by reſigning his liberty of will unto God, to commit himſelfe to the rule, and guidance of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: in a word, to adhere cloſe unto God, and to live a true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life. Therefore the content of this part of Panſophie ſhall be that knowledge, which is deſcribed <hi>(Prov.</hi> 30. 3.) to be the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the holy, and <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 51. 6.) hidden wiſedome, and is made to be the abſtract ſumme of all wiſedome <hi>(Job 28. 28. Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 13.) which is hidden from the wiſemen of this world <hi>(Matth.</hi> 11. 25.) that ſo it may plainly appeare, how farre the knowledge conferr'd upon the Church, excels all the learning of Philoſophers, and how high Gods houſe is raiſed upon the top of other mountaines, <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The laſt, and moſt ſecret part of the Temple, called the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> ſhall be here anſwered by the ſixt part of <hi>Panſophie,</hi> wherein the GOD of GODS ſhall be ſeene in habiting his owne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: ſo farre I meane, as in this life he diſcovers himſelfe, and his infinite and eternall Majeſty, and Glory, to ſuch as he predeſtinates,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49470:44"/>
and invites unto the eternall fruition of himſelfe. In this Theater, Man by beholding his owne, and the worlds originall draught, ſhall find how truly all Gods workes do repreſent him, though in their ſeverall manner and meaſure: and yet how every thing, that can be found in the creature, either good, beautifull, pleaſant, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, is in God in an infinitely more excellent manner. The fruit whereof will be, that being raviſhed with the taſte, and ſweetneſſe of that eternall bliſſe, he may know how to do nothing elſe, but even to melt in delight and love of his God, and to yeeld himſelfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be his habitation, that ſo paſſing comfortably this preſent life, he may by the gate of death enter into eternity.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, from that River of waters iſſuing out of the Temple, and diffuſing themſelves over all the earth, we will derive the laſt part of Panſophie, which unfolds the right uſe of the waters of true wiſedome. I am not ignorant that by thoſe waters proceeding out of EZEKIELS Temple, the courſe of the Goſpell is diſciphered to us, which was but ſtill and calme at the beginning, afterward by degrees receiving ſuch large encreaſes, as it was not to be ſtayed by any oppoſition, like a river, that breakes over, and waſheth away all dammes, and ramparts, that can be raiſed againſt it. Yet it plainly appeares alſo, that wiſedome is compared to waters, <hi>The law of the wiſe is a fountaine of life,</hi> ſaith SOLOMON, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 13. 14 and 14. 27.) and <hi>chap. 18. 4. The words of a mans mouth, are as deepe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the welſpring of wiſedome as a flowing brooke.</hi> The Sonne of SYRACH brings in wiſedome, thus ſpeaking of her ſelfe, <hi>I came out as a brooke from a river, and as a conduit into a garden; I ſaid, I will wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my beſt garden, and will water abundantly my garden-bed: and loe my brooke became a river, and my river became a Sea, Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 24. 30, 31. Therefore in this laſt part of <hi>Panſophie</hi> it will be our work to conſider of, and deſigne ſuch fit channels, as may convey theſe waters abroad on every ſide, that ſo the vaſt Commons of humane affaires, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the private garden-plots of every ones ſoule, and the whole Paradiſe of the Church may be therewith watered.</p>
                  <p>And this among others is the reaſon, why we ſayd, this <hi>Temple of wiſedome was to be conſecrate to Chriſts Catholique Church gathered, and to be gathered out of all nations,</hi> to wit, 1. Becauſe ſhe as a mother may juſtly challenge from her children, whatſoever they are able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or do for her honour and comfort.</p>
                  <p>2. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 19. Men do not light a candle, that they may ſet it under a buſhell, but upon a candleſticke, that it may give
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49470:44"/>
light to all that are in the houſe. Now this light of univerſall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) which puts every thing in ſubordination to its true end) is as it were Gods candle, and muſt therefore be ſet up in his houſe, which is the Church, that it may give light to all.</p>
                  <p>3. This houſe of the living God, the Church (as it is called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.) is built after the ſame patterne, according to which this Temple of wiſedome is reared: ſo that by beholding hereof, ſhe may be advanced much in knowledge of her ſelfe. According to to that in <hi>Cantic. 1. 8. If thou know not thy ſelfe, O thou faireſt among women, goe thy way forth by the footſteps of the flocke, &amp;c.</hi> For here by theſe continually deduced footſteps of Things, the Church is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the right way to the diſcovery of her owne, and her eternall Spouſes comelineſſe. And ſeeing that the manifold wiſedome of God is made knowne unto Angels by the Church <hi>(Eph.</hi> 3. 10.) we ought alſo to take ſpeciall care, that the Church in contemplation of her ſelfe, Angels, and of God, may have all advantages ſupplyed her, for her promoting in the knowledge of this manifold wiſedome of God.</p>
                  <p>4. But chiefely becauſe God hath foretold, that the Glory of his new Temple (the Church of the New Teſtament) ſhould be moſt conſpicuous in the laſt times, and hath promiſed a large affluence of light and bleſſing to it. For thus hath God declared by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ISAIAH and MICAH, and by divers others, at ſeverall times, and twice in the ſame words, that he might manifeſt the certainty of his decree: <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes, that the mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountaines, and it ſhall be exalted above the hils, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it, &amp;c. (Iſaiah 2. 2. Micah 4. 1.) And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the mountaines ſhall drop downe new wine, and the hils ſhall flow with milke, and all the rivers of Judah ſhall flow with waters, and a fountaine ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the valley of the choyce Cedars (Joel 3. 18.) For living waters ſhall goe out from Jeruſalem, halfe of them toward the former Sea, and halfe of them toward the hinder Sea, in Summer, and in winter ſhall it be. And the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth: in that day ſhall there be one Lord, and his name one.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things remaine yet to be moſt certainly fulfilled, men ſhould be ſtirred up, by all meanes poſſible, not onely to behold, but alſo to promote, as much as in them lies, this glory of the houſe of God, to enlarge the Churches bounds, and to derive ſuch rivulets from Gods ſtreame, as may water even dry places, which were never
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49470:45"/>
yet moyſtned with this heavenly dew, that at laſt all with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſtanding (as it were) upon a Sea of glaſſe with harpes of God in their hands, might begin to ſing the ſong of MOSES the ſervant of the Lord, and the ſong of the Lambe ſaying, <hi>Great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy workes, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints. Who ſhall not feare thee O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? for thou onely art holy, for all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judgements are made manifeſt, Revel.</hi> 15. 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>And now I beleeve it appeares ſufficiently what manner of booke it is, that wee would have compiled, and what are our reaſons for the urging of it. Let therefore all feare, and ſuſpicion of confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſacred and prophane things together be utterly baniſhed: For firſt, all things are pure to thoſe that are pure <hi>(Tit.</hi> 1. 15.) The gold and ſilver which was gotten away from thoſe impure Egyptians, did not at all defile the Iſraelites, or the Tabernacle. Againe here is no confounding of things together, but proviſion is made of remedies againſt thoſe confuſions, which ſo much diſtract mens minds by a diſtinct and graduall knowledge of all things, which may, or ought, or are worthy to be knowne. Therefore firſt we declare ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and knowne truthes, as are cleare of themſelves by the teſtimony of common ſenſe: next ſuch things as fall under the outward ſenſes to be ſeene, or felt without any errour, or miſtake: afterward ſuch things, as are rationally, and certainly deduced from ſenſuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, but with an application of their truth alſo to ſenſible Objects: Laſtly, thoſe things, which Divine revelation imparts to us, and faith onely receives; but ſo, that Senſe and Reaſon may alſo beare record unto God, and the truth of things inviſible revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us, may be acknowledged in the analogie of ſuch things as are viſible, that the voyce of eternall Truth uttered from all ſorts of things, may be found to agree in one eternall harmony. This confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therefore, beeing ſo harmonious, is nothing elſe but perfect order.</p>
                  <p>But they object, Chriſt taught no ſuch matter, he onely declared the way of Salvation. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why do you then by your ſelves, or by others take care to have your children inſtructed in the meaner things of this life, as in Arithmeticke, Logicke, and other ſorts of learning? 2. Be it ſo, that Chriſt taught not theſe things, it is moſt certaine he forbad them not, but rather ſignifies unto us, that we ought not to be ignorant of them, in that he ſo often borrowes from things naturall, and artificiall, both the occaſion, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49470:45"/>
manner of unfolding ſpirituall myſteries; thereby declaring to us, that there is ſuch proportion betweene things viſible and inviſible, that theſe cannot be eaſier underſtood than in reference unto them. Therefore they would be wiſer than Chriſt himſelfe, who reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves onely to ſpirituall, and heavenly things, reject from the ſtudy of Chriſtianity, all ſuch things, wherewith (as they terme them) worldlings imploy themſelves. If indeed they do ſo imploy themſelves, and ſettle their reſt hereupon, yet wee (alwaies mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our <hi>plus ultra)</hi> will not be imployed therein, but imploy them as ſteps and degrees for our more eaſie and ſpeedie attaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things of an higher value. 3. If Chriſt taught not ſuch things himſelfe, yet he hath taught them by others: and if not then, yet now at leaſt he teacheth them. For, <hi>he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, (Heb.</hi> 13. 8.) to wit, that <hi>wiſedome of God by which all things are made, (Prov. 8. v.</hi> 22, &amp;c.) Therefore whatſoever wiſedome, light, or order, is any where, or in any time, or perſon to be found, it all comes from him, and is derived out of his treaſury. When hee came into the world, his worke was not to ſpeed forward theſe things of ſmaller moment, but that he might give his life a <hi>ranſome for many (Matth.</hi> 20. 28.) Therefore he committed the writing of the Goſpels, and conſtituting of outward order in his Church unto his Diſciples care, promiſing to be with them, and their ſucceſſours, even unto the end of the world. Therefore this worke, if profitable, or what ever good thing otherwiſe ſhall at any time breake forth, even unto the worlds end, muſt be all accounted to proceed from Chriſt, <hi>who maketh every thing beautifull in his time, Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
                  <p>Now if our deſigne for the rearing up this Temple of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall wiſedome do go forward, it will be meete for us to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That (according to DAVIDS inſtructions to SOLOMON) the Temple to be builded muſt be great, and <hi>magnificall, of fame and glory throughout all countries (1. Chron.</hi> 2. 5.) Therefore workemen ſhould be ſought out, who are worthy of ſuch employment, and who are skilfull to find out every thing that is thereto neceſſary, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 7. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. SOLOMONS Temple was builded by Gods command upon the mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> which ſignifies the viſion of God: and the ground-worke of wiſedomes Temple ſhall likewiſe be the viſion of God; that is, all viſible things ſhall be uſed as Perſpectives for our minds, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the inviſible Ruler of the univerſe, with his power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe, richly mantling over all things.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49470:46"/>
3. The matter whereof SOLOMONS Temple was built, was of three ſorts, ſtones, wood, and metals: the ſtones were all of great value, as marble, and pretious ſtones: the woods were fat, and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous, as the firre and the cedar: the metals moſt pure, as gold perfectly refined. The matter of wiſedomes Temple ſhall be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the ſtore of three ſorts of principles, Senſe, Reaſon, and divine Revelation; of which Senſe reſembles the nature of ſtones in the groſſeneſſe of its perception; Reaſon for its ever flouring quality, may well be compared to the ſpreading of trees: and Gods word, which remains for ever, is like unto pure &amp; incorruptible gold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of the ſtones were made the walls; of the woods ſeeling for to cover the walls: and the ſeeling was over-laid with plates of gold, (2 <hi>Chr n.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7.) Moreover, the marble floore there of; (2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 3. 6.) was over-laid with gold, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 30.) but the ſacred veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, the Altar, the Table, the Candleſtickes, the Lamps, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, all were made of moſt pure gold, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4 19, &amp;c.) So the foundation, and walls of wiſedomes Temple ſhall be reared onely of ſuch Truthes, as are palpable &amp; evident to the ſenſe, to which reaſon ſhall ſupply the cauſes, why every thing muſt needs be ſo, as it is: and laſtly, the luſtre of divine teſtimony ſhall thereto be added, that truth may every where retaine its native majeſty. But the ſacred furniture hereof, which hath reference to the myſteries of faith, and ſalvation, ſhall be the moſt pure gold of the Oracles of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. SOLOMONS Temple was built of ſtones, that were hewed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly aforehand, ſo that there were neither hammer, nor axe, nor any iron toole heard, while it was in building, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 7.) So in the building of wiſedomes Temple, it will be very unſeemly, to have the noiſe of diſputes, and brawles heard; it is more fitting, that it ſhould be reared of Truth already ſquared; that is, not of ſuch tenets, and opinions, as are promiſcuouſly taken upon truſt, and when they come to be laid in the building muſt then be new hewed, and ſquared to fit them for the underſtanding, and to bring them to ſome ſimilitude of Truth; but ſuch as being exactly wrought in the ſhop of Principles, come forth without any crackes, ruggedneſſe, or other inequality, ſo that being applyed, they fit fully on every ſide, with things going before, with, and after them. By this only meanes can Truth be ſettled in the light, and recovered from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The parts of that materiall Temple were of moſt exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore in the ſtory of the building thereof, you may find
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49470:46"/>
every where mention made of numbers, and meaſures, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.) And the Angel, which was to imforme the Prophet concerning the building of the myſticall Temple, came provided of a line of flaxe, and a meaſuring reed <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 40. 3.) In like manner, in this Temple of wiſedome all things muſt be reduced to ſuch an univerſall Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, that the wandring thoughts of our minds may be contained in their juſt, certaine, and immoveable bounds.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There were added artificiall ornaments by graving, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſſing of Cherubims, Palme-trees, and Flowers, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 29.) Anſwerable thereunto this Temple of wiſedome muſt be framed in an apt method, and elegant ſtile, that ſo the outward palate may be therewith delighted, as much as may be.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. All things contained in the compaſſe of that Temple were holy, (for the outward wall thereof onely, was to ſeparate the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred from that which was prophane) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41. 20. So let every thing that comes into the content of wiſedomes Temple be holy, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it ſelfe, or elſe in reference to ſacred uſes, I meane, as a ſtep for our eaſier finding, and attaining our ends, which are Gods glory, and our eternall bliſſe in him, to which all things, both great and ſmall, every one in their ſeverall order are here directed.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And as God for the encouragement of thoſe who did reedifie the ruined Temple of Jeruſalem, promiſed them abundance of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings together with his preſence, and aſſiſtance, <hi>(Hagg.</hi> 1. &amp; 2.) the ſame may the builders of wiſedomes Temple be confident of, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that promiſe of Wiſedome from above, <hi>I love thoſe that love mee, and I will fill their treaſures, (Prov.</hi> 8. 17, 21.)</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Laſtly, according as when the builders laid the foundation of that materiall Temple, the Prieſts and Levites ſtood in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell with Trumpets, and Cimbals to praiſe the Lord, and all the people ſhouted with a great ſhout, while they praiſed the Lord: <hi>(Ezra</hi> 3. 10, 11.) So it will well become all good Chriſtians that are any way privy to this pious deſigne, to add their good deſires, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, while the foundation of Wiſedomes Temple is in laying, that this worke begun in Gods name and feare may happily go forward unto his praiſe, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord from this time forth, and for evermore, from the riſing of the Sunne to the going downe of the ſame the Lords Name be praiſed, (Pſal.</hi> 113. 2, 3.)</p>
