            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16925:3"/>
for if therin God giue ſucceſſe and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, their aduentures once made and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes ſafelye ended, their great perrilles and dangers they haue bene in: after nine dayes wonder (as we ſay) ſhalbe ſcarſe ſpoken off. But the caſe ſtandeth otherwiſe with them that ſhall put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vpon the multitude, whome if they either by their publike prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or writing ſhall not affect, they ſhalbe ſure to beare the skarre of their reprochefull tungs to their graues, &amp; hardly be thought off all their life after, let them in the ſetting downe of the trueth beare themſelues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo vprightly: Such is the miſerie of our dayes, ſo great are the diſcretions of mindes, the diuerſities of iudgementes, and the ouer ſpeedy taking of matters to hurt, without weighing before hand, or aduiſed counſaile taking before reſolution, contrary to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> his iudgement: who ſaith, <hi>Stabliſh thoughts by counſell.</hi> The conſideration whereof, partelye hath long ſtayed me from attempting anything, as alſo mine owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencye in compariſon of many others more fit for this worke: yet by the matter which in this tretiſe I haue handled, wherin
<pb facs="tcp:16925:3"/>
I haue had ſome good times deliberation, at length thus farre J haue beene drawen, not in vanitye of minde, as delighted to heare my ſelfe, as perhaps ſome will not ſticke to iudge, whoſe miſiudging affections as of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of our time I not weighing, being men heady and prepoſterous, ſome of them being carried by a proud conceite of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: others led in reſpect of perſons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to fauour, not weighing the trueth for it ſelfe ſake, which cauſeth that many of them in ſtead of light, haue taken holde of darkenes and walke therin: and in ſtead of the ſimple trueth, haue waded ouer head and eares into foul and abhominable errors. The reaſon therefore as I ſuppoſe is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that pleaſeth to run, before he can well goe, nay ſcarſe creepe, ſuch as are our multitude: ſhall ſtumble dangerouſlye and that moſt vnrecouerably, I ſpeake it J ſay, in regarde of the people of our daies, and thoſe alſo who pretend conſcience of religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, who, how offenſiuelye ſo euer themſelues walke before men, it matters not in their owne iudgement, ſo they can finde but one dart to caſt at the miniſter, and
<pb facs="tcp:16925:4"/>
haue neuer ſo little skill to comptroll their teachers, whome though we are not to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from being but weak in faith, yet when a caſe of controuerſies diſputable ſhalbe, they are to be put aſide. <hi>Rom. 14. 1.

            <p>But if we will ſtand vpon pleaſing of men, (and men pleaſers, miniſters in any wiſe may not be) except it be in matters tending to edification, according to the rule of Th'appoſtle <hi>Rom. 15. 2.</hi> We ſhall not pleaſe God, of which people I may ſay againe as a certaine heathen Poet ſpake of the people of his time.</p>

I anſwere thee, that the law of God, is made alſo for a bridle to thy very thoughtes, luſtes, and againſt the very motions of ſinne, which before that euer they come into the outward act, are then cenſured by the Lorde, as giltie of his wrath.

the corrupt nature of man aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, doth thinke this doctrine to be an ouer great abacement of ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a creature as man is, and to ſette downe a principle of theirs in a worde and their reaſon flatte oppoſite to the 10. precept, which they neuer tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly vnderſtood, this is their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: <hi>Concupiſcentia in Baptizat is non eſt peccatum,</hi> That is concupiſcence in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are baptized is no ſinne, their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is: <hi>Quia ſtimulus eſt ad exercendam virtutem,</hi> becauſe (ſay they) it is a ſpur to the exercyſing of vertue. <hi>Paule</hi> is vtterly againſt them, <hi>For they that</hi>

as the text maketh it playne. 8. verſe. <hi>Then the King of Aram warred againſt Jſraell, and tooke counſell with his ſeruauntes, and ſayde: in ſuch and ſuch a place ſhall be my Campe.</hi> 9. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the man of God ſent vnto the King of Jſraell, ſaying: Beware thou goe not ouer to ſuch a place, for there the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytes are come downe.</hi> Theſe meanes of the diſcouerie of practiſes againſt Prince or Countrey, God hath ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ordeyned as preſidentes for all people to laye vp in their heartes, and to followe when and aſſoone as they may attayne to the notice of anie ſuch matter.

lawfull and commaunded, but not all perſons: To reforme corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church being once known and diſcouered, concerning either Gods ſeruice or manners of men in their conuerſation, a thing neceſſarye expedient, and hye time it were done, and yet this no priuate action, nor by priuate perſons to be done.</p>

            <p>This thing that <hi>Johanan</hi> vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, was good, neceſſarye, and a thing moſte conuenient: namelye, that <hi>Jſhmael</hi> might be executed for high treaſon, whereof he certainlye

knew he was guilty, but he would not in any wiſe proceede further then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed him, he diſcouered the villanye and the villaine, the trecherye and the traitor: he diſcouers it where remedy might and ought to haue bene had. Further he proceedes not, God had called him to it: if any ſhall replye that concerning the danger the Prince and people ſtood in, and that the ſtate was growen into ſuch extremety, he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceeded not ſo boldely, neither yet ſo far as he might haue done, and ſo thereby take occaſion to cenſure his manhoode, as the vnbrideled hotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurres of our time, with whom there is but a word and a blow, who it maye be will not ſticke to ſay if the caſe had beene theirs, they would haue cut off the traitor, &amp; afterward required iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: theſe are they who in euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate cauſe perſwaded themſelues that the quarrell cannot be euded without bloodſhed, they haue not learned this point: firſte that courage, manhoode, ſtrength and valure, are to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

and limited within the compaſſe of the law of God: and as a mans life is not his owne to ſpill it at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo neither is the blood of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſpilt, except (God requiring it) the blood or life of a malefactor be lawfully taken away by the magiſtrat, and for that cauſe he holdes his handes referring the execution of iuſtice, and earneſtlye requiring at the ſupreame magiſtrates handes, who might or ought to haue authoriſed him or ſome other to the taking away of ſo vile a malefactor: And where he ſaith (and no man ſhal know it) his mening was, that he would ſo ſpeedily diſpatch the matter, as that before he had doone it no intelligence ſhould be had, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim for begging of pardons, for it ſhould ſeeme that <hi>Iohanan</hi> feared that if the matter ſhouldbe too publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, ſome ſtop would be made of iuſtice, and great ſute for an arrant Traitor. The daies belike then, were like to theſe daies now, wherin though a man be knowne to be a moſt filthye

perſon, a bloody murtherer, a ſorcerer, an idolator, yea a traitor too perhaps: ſome one or other in a land, wil in this interim of iuſtice not ſpare, and that to become a moſt earneſt ſuter for him, and therefore ſaith <hi>Iohanan,</hi> giue me au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, ſeale my commiſsion, let me but goe, and I will runne to diſpatche ſuch a monſter.

            <p>The firſt, a reaſon expoſtulatorye, from the danger the Prince himſelfe, ſtood in theſe words: <hi>Wherefore ſhould he kill thee?</hi> The ſecond drawne from the danger of the whole bodie of the Iewes, in theſe woordes: <hi>That all the Iewes which are gathered to thee ſhould be ſcattered, and the remnant in Judah periſh?</hi>

            <p>Firſt then mark the ſpeech of <hi>Ioha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> who ſeeing the Arch traitor to be in ſuch credit, dooth expoſtulate the matter with the Prince, and in a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding manner dooth take him vp very roundly, ſtill biſſeuering his accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be iuſt: <hi>Wherefore ſhould he kill</hi>

            <p>It was a good thing in <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> if that were his purpoſe, as it ſeemes it was, to cut off the backbyting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſlaunders, as he ſuppoſed of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanan</hi> againſt <hi>Iſhmaell,</hi> that the cutting off <hi>Iohanan</hi> might be an example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but yet it had beene meete, that as hee would not receiue any tale ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly againſt him, he ſhould yet haue firſt wiſely and thoroughly examined the cauſes brought by <hi>Iohanan</hi> and the reſt, before that he had ſo definitiuely proceeded, eyther clearing or iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iſhmaell,</hi> or in ouer raſhly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Magiſtrates, in whome it is the greater ſinne, becauſe of their places wherein they are ſet, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all ſuch backbyters and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous perſons, like vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> who would not in any wiſe permit to abide in his houſe any ſuch perſons: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are admoniſhed to do vp right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in iudgement, not reſpecting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but to heare the ſmall, as well as the great, not ſuffering themſelues to be led by affection any way.

And therefore the way for a Magiſtrate to deale vp rightly in iudgement, is not lightly to heare the ſlaunderous perſon, but to ſet both his eares on worke indifferently, the one to heare the accuſer, &amp; accuſation brought, and the other to heare the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, &amp; the defence that he can make for himſelfe: otherwiſe to be too ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in iudgement vppon the firſt tale

but ſtoppeth his eares, leaſt perhaps he might heare a matter of bloud: foorth with the ſlaunderer holdes his peace, his countenance chaunges, his lippes cleaue together, and his ſpittle is dryed vp: meaning that he ſeeth that his market is marred, his combe is cut, and not a worde more that he hath to ſpeake: herein fayled <hi>Ioſephes</hi> Maiſter, as in the 39.

On the other ſide, how many haue we with <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> that run themſelues into daunger, being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned, and not giuing credite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and ſo receiued a worthy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their incrudelitie?</p>
            <p>We reade of <hi>Ahab</hi> how he ſcorned <hi>Michaiah</hi> the Lords Prophet, whome
<pb facs="tcp:16925:54"/>
he ſent for, as many ſend for and call to their companies the miniſters, either to ſcorne them to their faces, or at the leaſt with <hi>Ahab</hi> not to beleeue what they ſay: or if they doo, not with any purpoſe to follow their counſell: who when he came, foretolde him of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe, but he beleeued him not, being ſeduced by the lying ſpirites of his falſe Prophets, as it is ſaide in the <note place="margin">1. kin. 22. 18.</note>1.

            <p>Such a like example of incredulitie we finde to haue bene in a prince, on whoſe hand as the text ſaith, the king of Iſraell leaned.</p>
            <p>The prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> foretelleth of great plentye of victalles to fall in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria ere the morrowe at that time,
<pb facs="tcp:16925:54"/>
and how it ſhalbe wonderfully cheap: The Prince would not beleeue it, but replyed vpon the prophet: though the Lord would make windowes from heauen, could this thing come to paſſe? and he ſaide, beholde thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eyes, but thou ſhalt not eate therof.</p>
            <p>Many are the examples in ſcripture concerning the incredulitie of men, but <hi>Gedaliah</hi> ſinned ſo much the more againſt the Lorde, in that he was not foretolde onely of this villanous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by <hi>Iohanan</hi> alone, but all the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the hoſt with him, ſo that had he onely caſt off <hi>Johanan,</hi> the matter had not been ſo weightie, but refuſing ſo many witneſſes whome hee would not vouchſafe to call to their tryall, he did as it were pull the wrath of God vpon the people, and was (as we ſay) acceſſary to his owne death. But ſome man will ſay, it was very hard to haue found out ſuch a ſerious thing: it is not ſo, for this was plaine and eaſie enough to haue beene prooued by witneſſes,
<pb facs="tcp:16925:55"/>
had not <hi>Gedaliah</hi> beene led with a ſelfe will as concerning the diligent ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it out, which indeede was the will of God for the blinding of him in ſo manifeſt a matter: but ſay it had bin ſo hard, the remedy had beene as in the booke of Eccleſiaſtes 10. 10. the <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 10</note>wiſe man ſayth, <hi>If the yron be blunt, and a man hath not whet the edge, he muſt put to more ſtrength, the excellency to direct a thing is wiſedome.</hi> But yet God doth in the finding out of thinges very hard, and of great difficultie, giue vnto man wiſdome, eſpecially when it concernes equitie and vpright dealing betweene man and man, if they ſeeke for it, and therefore <hi>Gedaliah</hi> ſhoulde haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the more labour in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the matter, according as is to ſee in that wonderfull boulting out of the truth of the child, according to the holy hiſtorie, that was dead, that was chalenged by two harlottes, whoſe it was, <hi>Salomon</hi> to iudge the controuerſie betweene them being a matter verie intricate: but becauſe <hi>Salomon</hi> asked

aboue all thinges an vnderſtanding heart, refuſing to make demaunde of honour and riches, the Lord graunted his requeſt, and ſo hee found out the true mother of the childe, according to the ſpeech of the Apoſtle Iames. <hi>If any of you lacke wiſedome, let him aske of God which giueth to all men liberally, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth no man, and it ſhall be giuen him.</hi> Thus much concerning <hi>Gedaliah</hi> his incredulitie.</p>

               <hi>Chap. 41. ver. 1.</hi> But in the ſeuenth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth came Iſhmael the ſonne of Nethaniah, the ſonne of Eliſhama of the ſeede royall, and the Princes of the King, and ten men with him, vnto Gedaliah the ſonne of Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kam to Mizpah, and there they did eate bread together in Mizpah.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Then aroſe Iſhmaell the ſonne of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniah with theſe ten men that were with him, and ſmote Gedaliah the ſonne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hikam, the ſon of Shaphan with the ſword,
<pb facs="tcp:16925:56"/>
and ſlew him, whom the king of Babell had made gouernour ouer the land.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Iſhmaell alſo ſlew all the Jewes that were with Gedaliah in Mizpah, and al the Caldeans that were found there, and the men of warre.</p>
            <p>This third part concerneth <hi>Jſhmaell</hi> the Traytor, the execution of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the manner of it: wherein firſt we are to learne theſe principall heads or maximes: that is, how this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was not committed by <hi>Jſhmaell,</hi> but that the will of God did concurre and goe together with his will: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if it be asked how this could be, the acte being ill and wicked in <hi>Jſhmaell,</hi> but that the Lord muſt needes be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie alſo of ſinne: the anſwere is, that the ſinne of the wicked is vnto God, as an other creature, in reſpect not that hee created it, for it is a thing proceeding from mans owne vile nature: but as concerning his power ouer it, to rule it, that it ſhall no further goe or paſſe, then he hath &amp; doth limit it: and that by it, as by the creature that worketh
<pb facs="tcp:16925:56"/>
it, being euill and wicked: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he worketh and effecteth his owne will being good, being himſelfe guiltleſſe of any euill: for in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſolution or looſing of the point, ſtandeth in the diuerſitie of the endes: of the end of God his working, and of the end of man his working: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, end, and purpoſe of God being good: the meaning, end, and purpoſe of the wicked being ill, which maketh them without excuſe, whereas Gods purpoſe and end in the wicked, and by them is eyther to be glorifyed in them to their confuſion, or to make tryall of his children by them in rayſing them vp as his puniſhments for ſinne: the end of the wicked being an vtter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God him ſelfe, and the hurt of his creatures, which yet could neuer further proceede, then by the handie worke of God, they were ledde againſt their wils, to doe his will contrarie to their purpoſes, and to glorifie his name in deſpight of themſelues: the which matter is notably ſet foorth in the 3.
<pb facs="tcp:16925:57"/>
Acts. 23. <hi>Him I ſay</hi> (ſayth <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Act. 2. 23.</note>of Chriſt) <hi>haue yee taken by the handes of the wicked, being deliuered vp by the determinate counſell and foreknowledge of God, and haue crucifyed and ſlaine:</hi> &amp;c. But to ſpeake of this further I will not: But to <hi>Jſhmaell</hi> himſelfe, of whom firſt before in the wordes of the diſcouerie is to be remembred, what <hi>Iohanan</hi> ſayd of him, namely that <hi>Baalis</hi> the king of the Ammonites had ſent him to ſlaye <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> wherein we may ſee his baſe minde, who would not with his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men beare in the courage of a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heart according to Gods will, the bondage of <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> but wold make himſelf ſeruile &amp; ouermuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thral to another ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g king, &amp; that againſt his own countreymen, ſo that in a word, he euery way ſold himſelf as a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſlaue to ſin. Not vnlike to him are our runagats and haue beene, that haue fled, not to <hi>Baaliſh</hi> king of the Ammonites, but to that <hi>Baaliſh</hi> Prieſt, that man of ſinne Antichriſt of Rome, whom to follow as their Pilot, whoſe lawes to liue after
<pb facs="tcp:16925:57"/>
as Rebels they haue not ſpared, choſing rather to be his thrals and bondmen, ſo their treacherous harts in hauing their will being naught, might be relieued, then otherwiſe according to the lawes of God, of nature, and of all nations, to be ſubiects at home in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to their owne leige, naturall, and mercifull Princes. And ſo they whoſe hyrelinges and bondmen they bee, though they vſe them for their purpoſe a while, yet hardly will they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any great truſt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſome reaſon they haue for it: but if they doe commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at all, it ſhall be no further then they play in ſight aboue the borde as we ſay, and in the end, if they ſende them not home, or make no ſale of them, as it may be they will when they haue once worne them out to the ſtumps, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they be not brought home by ſome other meanes, that in the iuſtice of God, they may be made publique ſpectacles to the whole world, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſtill vnrepentant, they are like to periſh both in ſoule and body, moſt
<pb facs="tcp:16925:58"/>
damnably for euer.</p>
            <p>Now where it is ſaide of him that he was of the ſeede Royall, the holye ghoſt doth it not but to ſome purpoſe, wherein he ſhewed forth his diſdaine ouer <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> the which ſeemed to be the very foundation of all his outrage: Indeede to be noblye borne, and to come of a princes ſtocke, is a matter to be reſpected: but when God wil either by his own puniſhment vpon the lyne and race of a Prince, either for ſome ſecret in the Lord himſelfe, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pull down the kings themſelues, for ſome notable ſin, as he for pride did abace <hi>Nabuchadnezzer:</hi> what a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is it for men to ſtand vpon theſe tearmes, I am a prince, or a Princes Sonne, or neere kinſeman, or of his race, I am a noble man, and can fetche my lyne and pedegree from (as we ſay) the conqueſt, what of all this? thou ſhouldſt for theſe cauſes the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue thy ſelfe in holines, not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes before God and before men, not in thy high parentage, to thinke
<pb facs="tcp:16925:58"/>
that in all righteouſnes &amp; iuſt dealing, thou maiſt liue vncomptrollable, though otherwiſe it maye be: take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy great birth, thou ſhalt ſhewe thy ſelfe a very monſter in life, as <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> did. This coulde ſtand for no plea, for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in Mizpah, though it were in the land of Iudah, ſeeing <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer</hi> had brought it vnder, being as concerning birth of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of the Kings of Iudah, that needes he muſt therefore become a Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: God had otherwiſe prouided. The King <hi>Zedekiah</hi> himſelf, reproche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled, as is 39. Chapter before to ſee, his eies put out, himſelfe bound in chaines, all his nobles for the moſt partſlaine, his ſonnes put to the ſword, and God had alreadye aduaunced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Nebuchadnezzer, Gedaliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome men that were noblye borne, cannot in any wiſe liue ſubiects in a land, although there want neither fauour of Prince, nor Lands, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor credit, nor honor, except they maye be Monarches, all that
<pb facs="tcp:16925:59"/>
will not ſatiſfie them. No maruel then though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> who wanted the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth penny of the maintenance that ſome haue had, and might ſtil haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed amongſt vs, if their preſent ſtate could haue ſerued them: but well, let conſcience of religion be a colour for their treaſons, I am not to meddle in it: only this, a bad conſcience, and a bad religion, it is in my conſcience, which can giue libertye to the ſpilling of the bloud of the Lords annointed: But alas <hi>Iſhmael</hi> his hornes were cutte being of no ſuch abilitye in a ſtrange land, and yet he ſtands vpon his birth: in whome we ſee this pointe that men hauing bene hie and alofte, it is a hard matter for them to ſtoop and become ſubiects: for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had ſmally profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning the good wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God vpon his creatures, therin to referre himſelfe to his maker.

the execution of their villanyes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I am firſt to craue humbly of ſo many as this treatiſe ſhal come into their hands to be ſeene and read, that they will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſider the excellency of the hiſtory, &amp; how it agrees with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate of this age vniuerſally tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out al the parts of Chriſtendom, requiring all of euery condition in the feare of God, that according as they finde the truth ſet downe before their eyes, they wil lay it to their hearts, and make profite therof, and with greater care of practiſe to proceed vnto a more full purpoſe of obedience vnto our Prince, Counſellers and Magiſtrates: in not only bridling their owne tongs from ſpeaking, or hearts from concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ill againſt the Prince, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely againſt the lawe of God proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but alſo they will care, not to giue their eares to heare ought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, (eſpecially thoſe runagates about the lande, the Seminary men) that eyther tendeth, or may tend to the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the glory, credite and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:16925:70"/>
of her Maieſtie, and of her royall Crowne &amp; dignitie: But with all their care and diligent endeuour, they wold hence learne to diſcry theſe Seminaries and ſeedes men of high treaſons, that by diſcouering them, (and that in all conuenient time) thereby they may ſtoppe the cauſe of any ill concerning reports or other miſchiefes pretended againſt the preſent ſtate of her Maieſty and people, not giuing themſelues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to heare the licentious commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications which in the houſes of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of many in their ignorance, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſupreme Magiſtrate in plain tearms, which ſo openly they dare not, but againſt the inferiour Gouernours, alſo whom not to thinke euill of only, but in brode termes to ſpeake againſt (ſuch is the looſeneſſe of theſe dayes) as hardly as may be, is their common cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Secondly vpon the care and regard that ſubiectes haue ouer and towardes their Princes, and ſo conſequently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her Maieſtie our Soueraigne,
<pb facs="tcp:16925:71"/>
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herein we are to prayſe God for, from our very hearts, vpryſing and downe lying, humbly vpon our knees Euening and Morning, conſidering how ſhe hath ſhewed and approoued her ſelfe, hitherto the only Prince and Paſtor moſt carefull and louing, moſt tender and mercifull, for mainteyning vs her people, for ſhedding the ſheepe from the goates, for prouiding for vs, that we haue liued, and doe yet, in all peace and proſperitie: for preuenting the woluiſh and deceitful troublers of our peace, for gathering vs together when we were like to be ſcattered, for preſeruing vs vnder God, when we were like to periſh, <hi>had not the Lorde beene on her ſide, had not the Lorde beene on her ſide,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 124.

And this deliuerance through Gods mercy hath befallen vs vnder her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhee hauing beene the onely Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of all the Princes vppon the earth, for many yeares: whoſe watchings and carefulnes God hath bleſſed, of whom I hope, I may without flattery ſay that with <hi>Dauid, She hath fedde vs her people and ſheepe of her folde, according to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of her heart, and guided vs by the diſcretion of her handes:</hi> For whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance wee are further to pray to God, that her Maieſty as ſhe hath now many yeares honorably ruled vs, ſo ſhe may in Gods feare proceede to play the part of a good Princeſſe ouer vs ſtill, to maintain vs by the law of God, and the wholſome lawes of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in all peace and godlineſſe during Gods will and pleaſure. And finally, that all other, to whoſe view this ſhall come, not aunſwering perhaps their iudgements being contrarily minded, as Papiſts, Recuſants, from whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion haue proceeded, eſpecially, the

<pb facs="tcp:16925:72"/>
but all concealementes of euill againſt Prince, Magiſtrate and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtate of the lande. And thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring God that the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus his ſonne, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by the preaching thereof may be continued, and more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged vpon our land, wee our Prince and Countrey may liue in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipe of one ſayth agreeable to the holy Scriptures, thereby the higher powers learning to rule according to godlineſſe and we the people may liue in all obedience to our Princes &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors according to the phraſe of the immortall, inuiſible, and onely wiſe God, three diſtinct perſons, the father, ſonne, and the holy Ghoſt, all one in the vnitie of the Godhead: to whom be all honour, prayſe and glorie now and for euer.
