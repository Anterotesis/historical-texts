            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Make account of me in the meane while, as of a man deuided in my selfe with great paine, and as (naturall bonds set aside) hauing my better part with you. And though I doubt not but in your godly wisedomes you both foresee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue vpon that which concerneth your present

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e I thought but my dutie to adde some further spurre of prouocation vnto them who run already, if not because you need it, yet because I owe it in loue and dutie.</p>
            <p>And first, as we are daily to renew our repentance with our God, speciall for our sinnes knowne, and generall for our vnknowne trespasses; so doth the Lord call vs in a singular maner vpon occasions of such difficultie and danger as lieth vpon you, to a both more narrow search and carefull reformation of our wayes in his sight, lest he calling to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance our sinnes forgotten by vs or vnrepented of, take aduantage against vs, and in iudgement leaue vs for the same to be swallowed vp in one danger or other; whereas on the contrary, sin being taken away by earnest repentance and the pardon thereof from the Lord, sealed vp vnto a mans conscience by his Spirit, great shall be his securitie and peace in all dangers, sweete his comforts in all distresses, with happie deliuerance from all euill, whether in life or in death.</p>
            <p>Now next after this heauenly peace with God and our owne consciences, we are carefully to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for peace with all men what in vs lieth, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with our associates, and for that end watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes must be had, that we neither at all in our selues do giue, no nor easily take offence being giuen by others. Woe be vnto the world for offences, for though it be necessary (considering the malice of Satan and mans corruption) that offences come, yet woe vnto the man or woman either by whom
<pb facs="tcp:10930:5"/>
the offence cometh, saith Christ, Math. 18.7. And if offences in the vnseasonable vse of things in them selues indifferent, be more to be feared then death it selfe, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 9.15. how much more in things simply euill, in which neither honour of God nor loue of man is thought worthy to be regarded.</p>
            <p>Neither yet is it sufficient that we keep our selues by the grace of God from giuing offence, except withall we be armed against the taking of them when they are giuen by others. For how vnperfect and lame is the worke of grace in that person, who wants charitie to couer a multitude of offences, as the Scriptures speake. Neither are you to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this grace onely vpon the common grounds of Christianitie, which are, that persons ready to take offence, either want charitie to couer offences, or wisedome duly to weigh humane frailtie; or lastly are grosse, though close hypocrites, as Christ our Lord teacheth, Math. 7.1, 2, 3. as indeed in mine owne experience, few or none haue beene found which sooner giue offence, then such as easily take it; neither haue they euer proued sound and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table members in societies, which haue nourished in themselues that touchey humour. But besides these, there are diuers spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iall motiues prouoking you aboue others to great care and conscience this way: As first, you are many of you strangers, as to the persons, so to the infirmities one of another, and so stand in neede of more watchfulnesse this way, lest when such things fall out in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as you suspected not, you be inordinately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb facs="tcp:10930:6"/>
with them; which doth require at your hands much wisedome and charitie for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and preuenting of incident offences that way. And last<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y your intended course of ciuill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie wil minister continuall occasion of offence, and will be as fuell for that fire, except you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently quench it with brotherly forbearance. And if taking of offence causlesly or easily at mens do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be so carefully to be auoided, how much more heed is to be taken that we take not offence at God himselfe, which yet we certainly do so oft as we do murmure at his prouidence in our crosses, or beare impatiently such afflictions as wherewith he pleaseth to visit vs. Store we vp therefore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience against the euill day, without which we take offence at the Lord himselfe in his holy and iust works.</p>
            <p>A fourth thing there is carefully to be prouided for, to wit, that with your common emploiments you ioyne common affections truly bent vpon the generall good, auoiding as a deadly plague of your both common and speciall comfort all retirednesse of minde for proper aduantage, and all singularly affected any maner of way; let euery man represse in himselfe and the whole bodie in each person, as so many rebels against the common good, all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate respects of mens selues, not sorting with the generall conueniencie. And as men are carefull not to haue a new house shaken with any violence before it be well settled and the parts firmly knit: so be you, I beseech you brethren, much more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the house of God which you are and are
<pb facs="tcp:10930:6"/>
to be, be not shaken with vnnecessary nouelties or other oppositions at the first settling thereof.</p>
            <p>Lastly, whereas you are to become a body politik, vsing amongst your selues ciuill gouernment, and are not furnished with any persons of speciall emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie aboue the rest, to be chosen by you into of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of gouernment: Let your wisedome and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse appeare, not onely in chusing such persons as do entirely loue, and will diligently promote the common good, but also in yeelding vnto them all due honour and obedience in their lawfull admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations; not beholding in them the ordinarinesse of their persons, but Gods ordinance for your good; nor being like vnto the foolish multitude, who more honour the gay coate, then either the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind of the man, or glorious ordinance of the Lord. But you know better things, and that the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Lords power and authoritie which the Magistrate beareth, is honorable, in how meane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons soeuer. And this dutie you both may the more willingly, and ought the more conscionably to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, because you are at least for the present to haue onely them for your ordinary gouernours, which your selues shall make choise of for that worke.</p>
            <p>Sundrie other things of importance I could put you in mind of, and of those before mentioned in more words, but I will not so far wrong your godly minds, as to thinke you heedlesse of these things, there being also diuers among you so well able to admonish both themselues and others of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth them. These few things therefore, and
<pb facs="tcp:10930:7"/>
the same in few words I do earnestly commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your care and conscience, ioyning therewith my daily incessant prayers vnto the Lord, that he who hath made the heauens and the earth, the sea and all riuers of waters, and whose prouidence is ouer all his workes, especially ouer all his deare childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The same day so soone as we could we set a-shore 15. or 16. men, well armed, with some to fetch wood, for we had none left; as also to see what the Land was, and what Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants they could meet with, they found it to be a small neck of Land; on this side where we lay is the <hi>Bay</hi> and the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Munday the 13. of <hi>November,</hi> we vnshipped our Shallop and drew her on land, to mend and repaire her, having bin forced to cut her downe in bestowing her betwixt the decks, and she was much opened with the peoples lying in her, which kept vs long there, for it was 16. or 17. dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Carpenter had finished her; our people went on shore to refresh themselues, and our women to wash<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they had great need; but whilest we lay thus still, hoping our Shallop would be ready in fiue or sixe dayes at the furthest, but our Carpenter made slow worke of it, so that some of our people impatient of delay, desired for our better furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to travaile by Land into the Countrey, which was not without appearance of danger, not having the Shallop with them nor meanes to carry provision, but on their backes, to see whether it might be fit for vs to seate in or no, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because as we sayled into the Harbour, there seemed to be a river opening it selfe into the maine land; the willingnes of the persons was liked, but the thing it selfe, in regard of the danger was rather permitted then approved, and so with cautions, directions, and instructions, sixteene men were set out with every man his Musket, Sword, and Corslet, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of Captaine <hi>Miles Standish,</hi> vnto whom was adioyned for counsell and advise, <hi>William Bradford, Stephen Hopkins,</hi> and <hi>Edward Tilley.</hi>

            <p>Wednesday the 15. of <hi>November,</hi> they were set a shore, and when they had ordered themselues in the order of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle File, and marched about the space of a myle, by the Sea they espyed fiue or sixe people, with a Dogge comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, who were Savages, who when they saw them ran into the Wood and whilled the Dogge after them, &amp;c.

At length night came vpon them, and they were constrained to take vp their lodging, so they set forth three Sentinells, and the rest, some kindled a fire, and others fetched wood, and there held our Randevous that night. In the morning so soone as we could see the trace, we proceeded on our iourney, &amp; had the tracke vntill we had compassed the head of a long creake, and there they tooke into another wood, and we after them, supposing to finde some of their dwellings, but we marched thorow boughes and bushes, and vnder hills and vallies, which tore our very Armour in peeces, and yet could meete with none of them, nor their houses, nor finde any fresh water, which we greatly desired, and stood in need off, for we brought neither Beere nor Water with vs, and our victuals was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bisket and Holland cheese, and a little Bottle of <hi>aquavite,</hi> so as we were sore a thirst. About ten a clocke we came into a deepe Valley, full of brush, wood-gaile, and long grasse, through which we found little paths or tracts, and there we saw a Deere, and found springs of fresh water, of which we were heartily glad, and sat vs downe and drunke our first <hi>New-England</hi> water with as much delight as euer we drunke drinke in all our liues. When we had refreshed our selues, we directed our course full South, that we might come to the shore, which within a short while after we did, and there made a fire, that they in the ship might see where wee were (as we had direction) and so marched on towards this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed River; and as we went in another valley we found a fine cleere Pond of fresh water, being about a Musket sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10930:10"/>
and Foule and Deere haunted there; there grew much Sasa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fras: from thence we went on &amp; found much plaine ground, about fiftie Acres, fit for the Plow, and some signes where the <hi>Indians</hi> had formerly planted their corne; after this, some thought it best for nearenesse of the river to goe downe and travaile on the Sea sands, by which meanes some of our men were tyred, and lagged behind, so we stayed and gathered them vp, and struck into the Land againe; where we found a little path to certaine heapes of sand, one whereof was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with old Matts, and had a woodden thing like a morter whelmed on the top of it, and an earthen pot layd in a little hole at the end thereof; we musing what it might be, digged &amp; found a Bow, and, as we thought, Arrowes, but they were rotten; We supposed, there were many other things, but because we deemed them graues, we put in the Bow againe and made it vp as it was, and left the rest vntouched, because we thought it would be odious vnto them to ransacke their Sepulchers. We went on further and found new stubble, of which they had gotten Corne this yeare, and many Wallnut trees full of Nuts, and great store of Strawberries, and some Vines; passing thus a field or two, which were not great, we came to another, which had also bin new gotten, and there we found where an house had beene, and foure or fiue old Plankes layed together; also we found a great Ketle, which had beene some Ships ketle and brought out of <hi>Europe</hi>; there was also an heape of sand, made like the former, but it was newly done, we might see how they had padled it with their hands which we digged vp, and in it we found a little old Basket full of faire <hi>Indian</hi> Corne, and digged further &amp; found a fine great new Basket full of very faire corne of this yeare, with some 36. goodly eares of corne, some yellow, and some red, and others mixt with blew, which was a very goodly sight: the Basket was round, and narrow at the top, it held about three or foure Bushels, which was as much as two of vs could lift vp from the ground, and was very handsomely and cunningly made; But whilst wee were busie about these things, we set our men Sentinell in a round ring, all but two
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10930:10"/>
or three which digged vp the corne. We were in suspence, what to doe with it, and the Ketle, and at length after much consultation, we concluded to take the Ketle, and as much of the Corne as we could carry away with vs; and when our Shallop came, if we could find any of the people, and come to parley with them, we would giue them the Ketle againe, and satisfie them for their Corne, so wee tooke all the eares and put a good deale of the loose Corne in the Ketle for two men to bring away on a staffe; besides, they that could put any into their Pockets filled the same; the rest wee buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for we were so laden with Armour that we could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no more. Not farre from this place we found the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an old Fort, or Palizado, which as we conceiued had beene made by some Christians, this was also hard by that place which we thought had beene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here also we saw two Canoas, the one on the one side, the other on the other side, wee could not beleeue it was a Canoa, till we came neare it, so we returned leauing the further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hereof to our Shallop, and came that night backe againe to the fresh water pond, and there we made our Rande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It proved a very rainie night. In the morning we tooke our Ketle and sunke it in the pond, and trimmed our Muskets, for few of them would goe off because of the wett, and so coasted the wood againe to come home, in which we were shrewdly pus-led, and lost our way, as we wandred we came to a tree, where a yong Spritt was bowed downe over a bow, and some Acornes strewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Wee also did spring three couple of Partridges; and as we came along by the creake, wee saw great flockes of wild Geese and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When we were set forth, it proued rough weather and crosse windes, so as we were constrained, some in the Shallop, and others in the long Boate, to row to the neerest shore the wind would suffer them to goe vnto, and then to wade out aboue the knees; the wind was so strong as the Shallop could not keepe the water, but was forced to harbour there that night, but we marched sixe or seaven miles further, and appointed the Shallop to come to vs as soone as they could. It blowed and did snow all that day &amp; night, and frose withall; some of our people that are dead tooke the originall of their death here. The next day about 11. a clocke our Shallop came to vs, and wee shipped our selues, and the wind being good, we sayled to the river we formerly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which we named, <hi>Cold Harbour,</hi> to which when wee came we found it not Navigable for Ships, yet we thought it might be a good harbour for Boats, for it flowes there 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. foote at high water. We landed our men betweene the two creekes, and marched some foure or fiue myles by the greater of them, and the Shallop followed vs; at length night grew on, and our men were tired with marching vp and downe the steepe hills, and deepe vallies, which lay halfe a foot thicke with snow: Master <hi>Iones</hi> vvearied with marching, was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous we should take vp our lodging, though some of vs would haue marched further, so we made there our Randevous for that night, vnder a few Pine trees, and as it fell out, wee got three fat Geese, and six Ducks to our Supper, which we eate with Souldiers stomacks, for we had eaten little all that day; our resolution was next morning to goe vp to the head of this river, for we supposed it would proue fresh water, but in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10930:12"/>
the morning our resolution held not, because many liked not the hillinesse of the soyle, and badnesse of the harbour, so we turned towards the other creeke, that wee might goe over and looke for the rest of the Corne that we left behind when we were here before; when we came to the creeke, we saw the Canow lie on the dry ground, and a flocke of Geese in the river, at which one made a shot, and killed a couple of them, and we lanched the Canow &amp; fetcht them and when we had done, she carryed vs over by seaven or eight at once. This done, we marched to the place where we had the corne formerly, which place we called <hi>Corne-hill</hi>; and digged and found the rest, of which we were very glad: we also digged in a place little further off, and found a Botle of oyle; wee went to another place, which we had seene before, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and found more corne, <hi>viz.</hi> two or three Baskets full of <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat, and a bag of Beanes, with a good man, of faire Wheat-eares; whilst some of vs were digging vp this, some others found another heape of Corne, which they dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp also, so as we had in all about ten Bushels, which will serve vs sufficiently for seed.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And sure it was Gods good providence that we found this Corne, for els wee know not how we should haue done, for we knew not how we should find, or meete with any of the <hi>Indians,</hi> except it be to doe vs a mischiefe. Also we had neuer in all likelihood seene a graine of it, if we had not made our first Iourney; for the ground was now covered with snow, and so hard frosen, that we were faine with our Curtlaxes and short Swords, to hew and carue the ground a foot deepe, and then wrest it vp with leavers, for we had forgot to bring other Tooles; whilst we were in this imployment, foule weather being towards, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Iones</hi> was earnest to goe abourd, but sundry of vs desired to make further discovery, and to find out the <hi>Indians</hi> habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, so we sent home with him our weakest people, and some that were sicke, and all the Corne, and 18. of vs stayed still, and lodged there that night, and desired that the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop might returne to vs next day, and bring vs some Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks and Spades with them.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:10930:12"/>The next morning we followed certaine beaten pathes and tracts of the <hi>Indians</hi> into the Woods, supposing they would haue led vs into some Towne, or houses; after wee had gone a while, we light vpon a very broad beaten path, well nigh two foote broad then we lighted all our Matches, and prepared our selues, concluding wee were neare their dwellings, but in the end we found it to be onely a path made to driue Deere in, when the <hi>Indians</hi> hunt, as wee supposed; when we had ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was also covered with boords, so as we mused what it should be, and resolved to digge it vp, where we found, first a Matt, and vnder that a fayre Bow, and there another Matt, and vnder that a boord about three quarters long, finely carued and paynted, with three tynes, or broches on the top, like a Crowne; also betweene the Matts we found Boules, Trayes, Dishes, and such like Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; at length we came to a faire new Matt, and vnder that two Bundles, the one bigger, the other lesse, we opened the greater and found in it a great quantitie of fine and perfect red Powder, and in it the bones and skull of a man. The skull had fine yellow haire still on it, and some of the flesh vnconsumed; there was bound vp with it a knife, a pack-needle, and two or three old iron things. It was bound vp in a Saylers canvas Casacke, and a payre of cloth breeches; the red Powder was a kind of Embaulment, and yeelded a strong, but no offensiue smell; It was as fine as any flower. We opened the lesse bundle likewise, and found of the same Powder in it, and the bones and head of a little childe, about the leggs, and other parts of it was bound strings, and brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of fine white Beads; there was also by it a little Bow, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three quarters long, and some other odd knackes; we brought sundry of the pretiest things away with vs, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Corps vp againe. After this, we digged in sundry like places, but found no more Corne, nor any things els but

graues: There was varietie of opinions amongst vs about the embalmed person; some thought it was an <hi>Indian</hi> Lord and King: others sayd, the <hi>Indians</hi> haue all blacke hayre, and never any was seene with browne or yellow hayre; some thought, it was a Christian of some speciall note, which had dyed amongst them, and they thus buried him to honour him; others thought, they had killed him, and did it in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over him. Whilest we were thus ranging and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, two of the Saylers, which were newly come on the shore, by chance espied two houses, which had beene lately dwelt in, but the people were gone. They having their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and hearing no body entred the houses, and tooke out some things, and du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st not stay but came againe and told vs; so some seaven or eight of vs went with them, and found how we had gone within a slight shot of them before. The houses were made with long yong Sapling trees, bended and both ends stucke into the ground; they were made round, like vnto an Arbour, and covered downe to the ground with thicke and well wrought matts, and the doore was not over a yard high, made of a matt to open; the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was a wide open hole in the top, for which they had a matt to cover it close when they pleased; one might stand and goe vpright in them, in the midst of them were foure little trunches knockt into the ground, and small stickes laid over, on which they hung their Pots, and what they had to seeth; round about the fire they lay on matts, which are their beds. The houses were double matted, for as they were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without, so were they within, with newer &amp; fairer matts. In the houses we found wooden Boules, Trayes &amp; Dishes, Earthen Pots, Hand baskets made of Crab shells, wrought together; also an English Paile or Bucket, it wanted a bayle, but it had two Iron eares: there was also Baskets of sundry sorts, bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Deeres feete, stuck vp in the houses, Harts hornes, and Eagles clawes, and sundry such like things there was: also two or three Baskets full of pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll rushes, and other stuffe to make matts; there was thrust into an hollow tree, two or three peeces of Venison, but we thought it fitter for the Dogs then for vs: some of the best things we tooke away with vs, and left the houses standing still as they were, so it growing towards night, and the tyde almost spent, we hasted with our things downe to the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, and got abourd that night, intending to haue brought some Beades, and other things to haue left in the houses, in signe of Peace, and that we meant to truk with them, but it was not done, by meanes of our hastie comming away from Cape Cod, but so soone as we can meete conveniently with them, we will giue them full satisfaction. Thus much of our second Discovery.</p>
            <p>Having thus discovered this place, it was controversall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, what to doe touching our aboad and setling there; some thought it best for many reasons to abide there.</p>
            <p>As first, that there was a convenient harbour for Boates, though not for Ships.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Good Corne ground readie to our hands, as we saw by experience in the goodly corne it yeelded, which would againe agree with the ground, and be naturall seed for the same.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Cape Cod was like to be a place of good fishing, for we saw daily great Whales of the best kind for oyle and bone, come close aboord our Ship, and in fayre weather swim and play about vs; there was once one when the Sun shone warme, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me and lay aboue water, as if she had beene dead, for a good while together, within halfe a Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God, neither he nor any man els was hurt with it, though many were there about, but when the Whale saw her time she gaue a snuffe and away.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the place was likely to be healthfull, secure, and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ensible.</p>
            <p>But the last and especiall reason was, that now the heart of Wint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r and vnseasonable weather was come vpon vs, so that we could not goe vpon coasting and discovery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of loosing men and Boat, vpon which would follow the overthrow of all, especially considering what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable windes and sodaine stormes doe there arise. Also cold and wett lodging had so taynted our people, for scarce any of vs were free from vehement coughs, as if they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in that estate, it would indanger the liues of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and breed diseases and infection amongst vs. Againe, we had yet some Beere, Butter, Flesh, and other such victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als left, which would quickly be all gone, and then we should haue nothing to comfort vs in the great labour and toyle we were like to vnder-goe at the first; It was also conceived, whilst we had competent victuals, that the Ship would stay with vs, but when that grew low, they would be gone, and let vs shift as we could.</p>
            <p>Others againe, vrged greatly the going to <hi>Anguum</hi> or <hi>Angoum,</hi> a place twentie leagues off to the North-wards, which they had heard to be an excellent harbour for ships; better ground and better fishing. Secondly for any thing we knew, there might be hard by vs a farre better seate, and it should be a great hindrance to seate where wee should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue againe. Thirdly, The water was but in ponds, and it was thought there would be none in Summer, or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Fourthly, the water there must be fetched vp a steepe hill: but to omit many reasons and replies vsed heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; It was in the ende concluded, to make some disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very within the Bay, but in no case so farre as <hi>Angoum</hi>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <hi>Robert Coppin</hi> our Pilot, made relation of a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable River and good harbour in the other head land of this Bay, almost right over against <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> being a right

line, not much aboue eight leagues distant, in which hee had beene once: and because that one of the wild men with whom they had some trucking, stole a harping Iron from them, they called it theeuish harbour. And beyond that place they were enioyned not to goe, whereupon, a Company was chosen to goe out vppon a third discovery: whilest some were imployed in this discovery, it pleased God that Mistris <hi>White</hi> was brought a bed of a Sonne, which was called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fift day, we through Gods mercy escaped a great danger by the foolishnes of a Boy, one of <hi>Francis Billingtons</hi> Sonnes, who in his Fathers absence, had got Gun-powder, and had shot of a peice or two, and made squibs, and there being a fowling peice charged in his fathers Cabbin, shot her off in the Cabbin, there being a little barrell of powder halfe full, scattered in and about the Cabbin, the fire being within foure foote of the bed betweene the Deckes, and many s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ints and Iron things about the Cabbin, and many people about the fire, and yet by Gods mercy no harme done.</p>
            <p>Wednesday the sixt of December, it was resolved our discoverers should set forth, for the day before was too fowle weather, and so they did, though it was well ore the day ere all things could be readie: So ten of our men were appointed who were of themselues willing to vndertake it, to wit, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Standish,</hi> Maister <hi>Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winsloe, Iohn Tilley, Edward Tilley, Iohn Houland,</hi> and three of London, <hi>Richard Warren, Steeuen Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Edward Dotte,</hi> and two of our Sea-men, <hi>Iohn Alderton</hi> and <hi>Thomas En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> of the Ships Company there went two of the Masters Mates, Master <hi>Clarke</hi> and Master <hi>Copin,</hi> the Master Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and three Saylers. The narration of which Discovery, followes, penned by one of the Company.</p>
            <p>Wednesday the sixt of December wee set out, being very cold and hard weather, wee were a long while after we lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from the ship, before we could get cleare of a sandie poynt, which lay within lesse then a fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fiue or sixe paces long, and about two inches thicke of fat, and fleshed like a Swine, they would haue yeelded a great deale of oyle, if there had beene time and meanes to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, so we finding nothing for our turne, both we and our Shallop returned. We then directed our course along the Sea-sands, to the place where we first saw the <hi>Indians,</hi> when we were there, we saw it was also a <hi>Grampus</hi> which they were cutting vp, they cut it into long rands or peeces, about an ell long, and two handfull broad, wee found here and there a peece scattered by the way, as it seemed, for hast: this place the most were minded we should call, the <hi>Grampus Bay,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we found so many of them there: wee followed the tract of the <hi>Indians</hi> bare feete a good way on the sands, as length we saw where they strucke into the Woods by the side of a Pond, as wee went to view the place, one sayd, hee thought hee saw an <hi>Indian</hi>-house among the trees, so went vp to see: and here we and the Shallop lost sight one of another till night, it being now about nine or ten a clocke, so we light on a path, but saw no house, and followed a great way into the woods, at length wee found where Corne had beene set, but not that yeare, anone we found a great bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, one part whereof was incompassed with a large Palazado, like a Church-yard, with yong spires foure or fiue yards long, set as close one by another as they could two o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As we ranged we light on foure or fiue <hi>Indian</hi>-houses, which had beene lately dwelt in, but they were vncovered, and had no matts about them, els they were like those we found at <hi>Corne-hill,</hi> but had not beene so lately dwelt in, there was nothing left but two or three peeces of old matts, a little sedge, also a little further we

found two Baskets full of parched Acorns hid in the ground, which we supposed had beene Corne when we beganne to dig the same, we cast earth thereon againe &amp; went our way. All this while we saw no people, wee went ranging vp and downe till the Sunne began to draw low, and then we hasted out of the woods, that we might come to our Shallop, which when we were out of the woods, we espied a great way off, and call'd them to come vnto vs, the which they did as soone as they could, for it was not yet high water, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad to see vs, (for they feared because they had not seene vs in so long a time) thinking we would haue kept by the shore side, so being both weary and faint, for we had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nothing all that day, we sell to make our Randevous and get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About midnight we heard a great and hideous cry, and our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell called, <hi>Arme, Arme.</hi> So we bestirred our selues and shot off a couple of Muskets, and noyse ceased; we concluded, that it was a company of Wolues or Foxes, for one told vs, hee had heard such a noyse in <hi>New-found land.</hi> About fiue a clocke in the morning wee began to be stirring, and two or three which doubted whether their Peeces would goe off or no made tryall of them, and shot them off, but thought nothing at all, after Prayer we prepared our selues for brek-fast, and for a journey, and it being now the twilight in the morning, it was thought meet to carry the things downe to the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop: some sayd, it was not best to carry the Armour downe, others sayd, they would be readier, two or three sayd, they would not carry theirs, till they went themselues, but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting nothing at all: as it fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The cry of our enemies was dreadfull, especially, when our men ran out to recover their Armes, their note was after this manner, <hi>Woath woach ha ha hach woach</hi>: our men were no sooner come to their Armes, but the enemy was ready to assault them.</p>
            <p>There was a lustie man and no whit lesse valiant, who was thought to bee their Captaine, stood behind a tree within halfe a musket shot of vs, and there let his arrowes fly at vs; hee was seene to shoote three arrowes, which were all avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for he at whom the first arrow was aymed, saw it, and stooped downe and it flew over him, the rest were avoyded also: he stood three shots of a Musket, at length one tooke as he sayd full ayme at him, after which he gaue an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cry and away they went all, wee followed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of a mile, but wee left sixe to keepe our Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, for we were carefull of our businesse: then wee shouted all together two severall times, and shot off a couple of mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and so returned: this wee did that they might see wee were not afrayd of them nor discouraged.

So after wee had given God thankes for our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, wee tooke our Shallop and went on our Iourney, and called this place, <hi>The first Encounter,</hi> from hence we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to haue sayled to the aforesayd theeuish Harbour, if wee found no convenient Harbour by the way, having the wind good, we sayled all that day along the Coast about 15. leagues, but saw neither River nor Creeke to put into, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had sayled an houre or two, it began to snow and raine, and to be bad weather; about the midst of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, the winde increased and the Seas began to be very rough, and the hinges of the rudder broke, so that we could steere no longer with it, but two men with much adoe were same to serue with a couple of Oares, the Seas were growne so great, that we were much troubled and in great daunger, and night grew on: Anon Master <hi>Coppin</hi> bad vs be of good cheere he saw the Harbour, as we drew neare, the gale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stiffe, and we bearing great sayle to get in, split our Mast in 3. peices, and were like to haue cast away our Shallop, yet by Gods mercy recovering our selues, wee had the floud with vs, and struck into the Harbour.</p>

            <p>On the fifteenth day, we waighed Anchor, to goe to the place we had discovered, and comming within two leagues of the Land, we could not fetch the Harbour, but were faine to put roome againe towards <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> our course lying West; and the wind was at North west, but it pleased God that the next day being Saturday the 16. day, the winde came faire, and wee put to Sea againe, and came safely into a safe Harbour; and within halfe an houre the winde changed, so as if we had beene letted but a little, we had gone backe to <hi>Cape Cod.</hi> This Harbour is a Bay greater then <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> compassed with a goodly Land, and in the Bay, 2. fine Ilands vninhabited, wherein are nothing but wood, Okes, Pines, Wal-nut, Beech, Sasifras, Vines, and other trees which wee know not; This Bay is a most hopefull place, innumerable store of fowle, and excellent good, and cannot but bee of fish in their seasons: Skote, Cod, Turbot, and Herring, wee haue tasted of, abundance of Musles the greatest &amp; best that ever we saw; Crabs, and Lobsters, in their time infinite, It is in fashion like a Cikle or Fish-hooke.</p>
            <p>Munday the 13. day, we went a land, manned with the Maister of the Ship, and 3. or 4. of the Saylers, we marched

            <p>The next morning being Tuesday the 19. of December, wee went againe to discover further; some went on Land, and some in the Shallop, the Land we found as the former day we did, and we found a Creeke, and went vp three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish myles, a very pleasant river at full Sea, a Barke of thirty tunne may goe vp, but at low water scarce our Shallop could passe: this place we had a great liking to plant in, but that it was so farre from our fishing our principall profit, and so incompassed with woods, that we should bee in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Salvages, and our number being so little, and so much ground to cleare, so as wee thought good to quit and cleare that place, till we were of more strength; some of vs hauing a good minde for safety to plant in the greater Ile, wee crossed the Bay which there is fiue or sixe myles ouer, and found the Ile about a myle and a halfe, or two myles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, all wooded, and no fresh water but 2. or 3. pits, that we doubted of fresh water in Summer, and so full of wood,

            <p>That night we returned againe a ship boord, with resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the next morning to setle on some of those places, so in the morning, after we had called on God for direction, we came to this resolution, to goe presently ashore againe, and to take a better view of two places, which wee thought most fitting for vs, for we could not now take time for further search or consideration, our victuals being much spent, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, our Beere, and it being now the 19. of <hi>December.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our landing and viewing of the places, so well as we could we came to a conclusion, by most voyces, to set on the maine Land, on the first place, on an high ground, where there is a great deale of Land cleared, and hath beene planted with Corne three or foure yeares agoe, and there is a very sweet brooke runnes vnder the hill side, and many delicate springs of as good water as can be drunke, and where we may har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour our Shallops and Boates exceeding well, and in this brooke much good fish in their seasons: on the further side of the river also much Corne ground cleared, in one field is a great hill, on which wee poynt to make a plat-forme, and plant our Ordinance, which will command all round about, from thence we may see into the <hi>Bay,</hi> and farre into the Sea, and we may see thence <hi>Cape Cod</hi>: our greatest labour will be fetching of our wood, which is halfe a quarter of an English myle, but there is enough so farre off; what people inhabite here we yet know not, for as yet we haue seene none, so there we made our Randevous, and a place for some of our people about twentie, resolving in the morning to come all ashore, and to build houses, but the next morning being Thursday the 21. of <hi>December,</hi> it was stormie and wett, that we could not goe ashore, and those that remained there all night could doe nothing, but were wet, not having dai-light enough to make them a sufficient court of gard, to keepe them dry.

            <p>Munday the 25. being Christmas day, we began to drinke water aboord, but at night the Master caused vs to haue some Beere, and so on boord we had diverse times now and then some Beere, but on shore none at all.</p>

Families they were, willing all single men that had no wiues to ioyne with some Familie, as they thought fit, that so we might build fewer houses, which was done, and we reduced them to 19. Families; to greater Families we allotted larger plots, to every person halfe a pole in breadth, and three in length, and so Lots were cast where euery man should lie, which was done, and staked out; we thought this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was large enough at the first, for houses and gardens, to impale them round, considering the weaknes of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, many of them growing ill with coldes, for our former Discoveries in frost and stormes, and the wading at Cape <hi>Cod</hi> had brought much weakenes amongst vs, which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so every day more and more, and after was the cause of many of their deaths.</p>
            <p>Fryday and Saturday, we fitted our selues for our labour, but our people on shore were much troubled and discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with rayne and wett that day, being very stormie and cold; we saw great smokes of fire made by the <hi>Indians</hi> about six or seaven myles from vs as we coniectured.</p>

            <p>Munday the eight day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> was a very fayre day, and we went betimes to worke, master <hi>Iones</hi> sent the Shallop as he had formerly done, to see where fish could be got, they had a great storme at Sea, and were in some danger, at night they returned with three great Seales, and an excellent good Cod, which did assure vs that we should haue plentie of fish shortly.</p>
            <p>This day, <hi>Francis Billington,</hi> having the weeke before seene from the top of a tree on an hie hill, a great sea as he thought, went with one of the Masters mates to see it, they went three myles, and then came to a great water, devided into two great Lakes, the bigger of them fiue or sixe myles in circuit, and in it an Ile of a Cable length square, the other three miles in compasse; in their estimation they are fine fresh water, full of fish, and foule; a brooke issues from it, it will be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent helpe for vs in time. They found seaven or eight <hi>Indian</hi> houses, but not lately inhabited, when they saw the houses they were in some feare, for they were but two persons and one peece.</p>
            <p>Tuesday the 9.

            <p>The 19. day, we resolved to make a Shed, to put our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon provision in, of which some were alreadie set on shore, but at noone it rayned, that we could not worke. This day in the evening, <hi>Iohn Goodman</hi> went abroad to vse his lame feete, that were pittifully ill with the cold he had got, having a little Spannell with him, a little way from the Plantation, two great Wolues ran after the Dog, the Dog ran to him and betwixt his leggs for succour, he had nothing in his hand but tooke vp a sticke, and threw at one of them and hit him, and they presently ran both away, but came againe, he got a pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Saturday 20. we made vp our Shed for our common goods.</p>
            <p>Sunday the 21. we kept our meeting on Land.</p>
            <p>Munday the 22. was a faire day, we wrought on our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in the after-noone carried vp our hogsheads of meale to our common store house.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:10930:23"/>The rest of the weeke we followed our businesse likewise.</p>
            <p>Munday the 29. in the morning cold frost and sleete, but after reasonable fayre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both the long Boate and the Shallop brought our common goods on shore.</p>
            <p>Tuesday and wednesday 30. and 31. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> cold frosty weather and sleete, that we could not worke: in the morning the Master and others saw two Savages, that had beene on the Iland nere our Ship, what they came for wee could not tell, they were going so farre backe againe before they were des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ried, that we could not speake with them.</p>
            <p>Sunday the 4. of <hi>February,</hi> was very wett and rainie, with the greatest gusts of winde that ever we had since wee came forth, that though we rid in a very good harbour, yet we were in danger, because our Ship was light, the goods taken out, and she vnballased; and it caused much daubing of our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to fall downe.</p>
            <p>Fryday the 9. still the cold weather continued, that wee could doe little worke. That after-noone our little house for our sicke people was set on fire by a sparke that kindled in the roofe, but no great harme was done. That evening the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster going ashore, killed fiue Geese, which he friendly distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among the sicke people; he found also a good Deere killed, the Savages had cut off the hornes, and a Wolfe was eating of him, how he came there we could not conceiue.</p>
            <p>Friday the 16. day, was a faire day, but the northerly wind continued, which continued the frost, this day after-noone one of our people being a fouling, and having taken a stand by a creeke side in the Reeds, about a myle and an halfe from our Plantation, there came by him twelue <hi>Indians,</hi> marching towards our Plantation, &amp; in the woods he heard the noyse of many more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he lay close till they were passed, and then with what speed he could he went home &amp; gaue the Alarm, so the people abroad in the woods returned &amp; armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but say none of them, onely toward the euening they made a great fire, about the place where they were first discovered: Captaine <hi>Miles Standish,</hi> and <hi>Francis Cooke,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at worke in the Woods, comming home, left their

tooles behind them, but before they returned, their tooles were taken away by the Savages. This comming of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages gaue vs occasion to keepe more strict watch, and to make our peeces and furniture readie, which by the moysture and rayne were out of temper.</p>
            <p>Saturday the 17 day, in the morning we called a meeting for the establishing of military Orders amongst our selues, and we chose <hi>Miles Standish</hi> our Captaine, and gaue him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of command in affayres: and as we were in consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation here abouts, two Savages presented themselues vpon the top of an hill, over against our Plantation, about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a myle and lesse, and made signes vnto vs to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; we likewise made signes vnto them to come to vs, whereupon we armed our selues, and stood readie, and sent two over the brooke towards them, to wit, Captaine <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> and <hi>Steven Hopkins,</hi> who went towards them, onely one of them had a Musket, which they layd downe on the ground in their sight, in signe of peace, and to parley with them, but the Savages would not tarry their comming: a noyse of a great many more was heard behind the hill, but no more came in sight. This caused vs to plant our great Ordinances in places most convenient.</p>
            <p>Wednesday the 21. of <hi>February,</hi> the master came on shore with many of his Saylers, and brought with him one of the great Peeces, called a <hi>Minion,</hi> and helped vs to draw it vp the hill, with another Peece that lay on shore, and mounted them, and a saller and two bases; he brought with him a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fat Goose to eate with vs, and we had a fat Crane, and a Mallerd, and a dry'd neats-tongue, and so wee were kindly and friendly together.</p>
            <p>Saturday the third of <hi>March,</hi> the winde was South, the morning mistie, but towards noone warme and fayre wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Birds sang in the Woods most pleasantly; at one of the Clocke it thundred, which was the first wee heard in that Countrey, it was strong and great claps, but short, but after an houre it rayned very sadly till midnight.</p>

When wee came to any small Brooke where no bridge was, two of them desired to carry vs through of their owne accords, also fearing wee were or would be weary, offered to carry our peeces, also if we would lay off any of our clothes, we should haue them carried: and as the one of them had found more speciall kindnesse from one of the Messengers, and the other Salvage from the other so they shewed their thankefulnesse accordingly in affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

saluted him, who after their manner kindly well commed vs, and tooke vs into his house, and set vs downe by him, where having delivered our foresayd Message, and Presents, and having put the Coat on his backe, and the Chayne about his necke, he was not a little proud to behold himselfe, and his men also to see their King so brauely attyred.</p>
               <p>For answere to our Message, he told vs we were well-come, and he would gladly continue that Peace and Friendship which was betweene him &amp; vs: and for his men they should no more pester vs as they had done: Also, that he would send to <hi>Paomet,</hi> and would helpe vs with Corne for seed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our request.</p>
               <p>This being done his men gathered neere to him, to whom he turned himselfe, and made a great Speech; they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time interposing, and as it were, confirming and applauding him in that he sayd. The meaning whereof was (as farre as we could learne) thus; Was not he <hi>Massasoyt</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Countrey about them? Was not such a Towne his and the people of it? and should they not bring their skins vnto vs? To which they answered, they were his &amp; would be at peace with vs, and bring their skins to vs. After this manner, he named at least thirtie places, and their answere was as aforesayd to every one: so that as it was delightfull, it was tedious vnto vs.</p>
               <p>This being ended, he lighted Tobacco for vs, and fell to discoursing of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; of the Kings Maiestie, marvayling that he would liue without a wife. Also he talked of the French-men, bidding vs not to suffer them to come to <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rohiganset,</hi> for it was King IAMES his Countrey, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was King IAMES his man. Late it grew, but victualls he offered none; for indeed he had not any, being he came so newly home. So we desired to goe to rest: he layd vs on the bed with himselfe and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other, it being onely plancks layd a foot from the ground, and a thin Mat vpon them.

That night we reached to the wire where we lay before, but the <hi>Namascheusks</hi> were returned: so that we had no hope of any thing there.

After supper we went to rest, and they to fishing againe: more they gat and fell to eating a fresh, and retayned sufficient readie rost for all our break-fasts. About two a Clocke in the morning, arose a great storme of wind, raine, lightning, and thunder, in such violent manner, that we could not keepe in our fire; and had the Savages not ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted fish when we were asleepe, we had set forward fasting: for the raine still continued with great violence, even the whole day thorow, till wee came within two myles of home.</p>
               <p>Being wett and weary, at length we came to <hi>Namaschet,</hi> there we refreshed our selues, giuing gifts to all such as had shewed vs any kindnesse.

It being night before we came in, we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in the middest of the Bay, where we were drie at a low water. In the morning we espied Savages seeking Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and sent our two Interpreters to speake with them, the channell being betweene them; where they told them what we were, and for what we were come, willing them not at all to feare vs, for we would not hurt them. Their answere was, that the Boy was well, but he was at <hi>Nauset</hi>; yet since wee were there they desired vs to come ashore &amp; eate with them: which as soone as our Boat floated we did: and went sixe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, having foure pledges for them in the Boate. They brought vs to their Sachim or Gouernour, whom they call
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10930:33"/>
                  <hi>Iyanough,</hi> a man not exceeding twentie-six yeeres of age, but very personable, gentle, courteous, and fayre conditioned, indeed not like a Savage, saue for his attyre; his entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was answerable to his parts, and his cheare plentifull and various.</p>
               <p>One thing was very grieuous vnto vs at this place; There was an old woman, whom we iudged to be no lesse then an hundred yeeres old, which came to see vs because shee neuer saw English, yet could not behold vs without breaking forth into great passion, weeping and crying excessiuely. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the reason of it, they told vs, she had three sons, who when master <hi>Hunt</hi> was in these parts went aboord his Ship to trade with him, and he carried them Captiues into Spaine (for <hi>Tisquantum</hi> at that time was carried away also) by which meanes shee was depriued of the comfort of her children in her old age. We told them we were sorry that any English man should giue them that offence, that <hi>Hunt</hi> was a bad man, and that all the English that heard of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him for the same: but for vs we would not offer them any such iniury, though it would gaine vs all the skins in the Countrey. So we gaue her some small trifles, which somewhat appeased her.</p>
               <p>After dinner we tooke Boat for <hi>Nauset, Iyanough</hi> and two of his men accompanying vs. Ere we came to <hi>Nauset,</hi> the day and tyde were almost spent, in so much as we could not goe in with our Shallop: but the Sachim or Governour of <hi>Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Sauages here came very thicke amongst vs, and were earnest with vs to bring in our Boate. But we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well could, nor yet desired to doe it, because we had lest cause to trust them, being they onely had formerly made an Assault vpon vs in the same place, in time of our Winter Discouery for Habitation. And indeed it was no maruayle they did so, for howsoeuer through snow or otherwise wee saw no houses, yet wee were in the middest of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:10930:33"/>When our boat was a ground they came very thicke, but wee stood therein vpon our guard, not suffering any to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter except two: the one being of <hi>Maramoick</hi> and one of those, whose Corne we had formerly found, we promised him restitution, &amp; desired him either to come to <hi>Patuxet</hi> for satisfaction, or else we would bring them so much corne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hee promised to come, wee vsed him very kindely for the present. Some few skins we gate there but not many.</p>
               <p>After Sun-set, <hi>Aspinet</hi> came with a great traine, &amp; brought the boy with him, one bearing him through the water: hee had not lesse then an hundred with him, the halfe whereof came to the Shallop side vnarmed with him, the other stood aloofe with their bow and arrowes. There he delivered vs the boy, behung with beades, and made peace with vs, wee bestowing a knife on him, and likewise on another that first entertained the Boy and brought him thither. So they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from vs.</p>
               <p>Here we vnderstood, that the <hi>Narrohigansets</hi> had spoyled some of <hi>Massasoyts</hi> men, and taken him. This strucke some feare in vs, because the Colony was so weakely guarded, the strength thereof being abroad: But we set foorth with resolution to make the best hast home wee could; yet the winde being contrary, having scarce any fresh water least, and at least 16. leagues home, we put in againe for the shore. There we met againe with <hi>Iyanough</hi> the <hi>Sachim</hi> of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maquid,</hi> and the most of his Towne, both men women &amp; children with him. Hee being still willing to gratifie vs, tooke a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and led our men in the darke a great way for water, but could finde none good: yet brought such as there was on his necke with them. In the meane time the women ioyned hand in hand, singing and dancing before the Shallop, the men also shewing all the kindnes they could, <hi>Iyanough</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe taking a bracelet from about his necke, and hanging it vpon one of vs.</p>
               <p>Againe we set out but to small purpose: for wee gat but little homeward; Our water also was very brackish, and not to be drunke.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:10930:34"/>The next morning, <hi>Iyanough</hi> espied vs againe and ran after vs; we being resolved to goe to <hi>Cummaquid</hi> againe to water, tooke him into the Shallop, whose entertainement was not inferiour vnto the former.</p>
               <p>The soyle at <hi>Nauset</hi> and here is alike, even and sandy, not so good for corne as where wee are; Shipps may safely ride in eyther harbour. In the Summer, they abound with fish. Being now wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, we put forth againe, and by Gods providence, came safely home that night.</p>

               <p>For these ends the Governours chose ten men, fit for the purpose, and sent <hi>Tisquantum,</hi> and two other Salvages to bring vs to speech with the people, and interpret for vs.</p>

There we found many Lobsters that had beene gathered together by the Saluages, which we made ready vnder a cliffe. The Captaine set two Sentinels behind the cliffe to the landward to secure the Shallop, and taking a guide with him, and foure of our company, went to seeke the Inhabitants, where they met a woman comming for her Lobsters, they told her of them, and contented her for them. She told them where the people were; <hi>Tisquantum</hi> went to them, the rest returned, hauing direction which way to bring the Shallop to them.</p>

               <p>On the morrow we went ashore, all but two men and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Armes vp in the Countrey. Hauing gone three myles, we came to a place where Corne had beene newly gathered, a house pulled downe, and the people gone. A myle from hence, <hi>Nanepashemet</hi> their King in his life time had liued.

               <p>About a myle from hence, we came to such another, but seated on the top of an hill: here <hi>Nanepashemet</hi> was killed, none dwelling in it since the time of his death. At this place we stayed, and sent two Saluages to looke the Inhabitants, and to informe them of our ends in comming, that they might not be fearefull of vs: Within a myle of this place they found the women of the place together, with their Corne on heapes, whither we supposed them to be sted for feare of vs, and the more, because in diuers places they had newly pulled downe their houses, and for hast in one place had left some of their Corne couered with a Mat, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with it.</p>

               <p>Hauing well spent the day, we returned to the Shallop, almost all the Women accompanying vs, to trucke, who sold their coats from their backes, and tyed boughes about them, but with great shamefastnesse (for indeed they are more modest then some of our English women are) we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them to come againe to them, and they vs, to keepe their skins.</p>
               <p>Within this Bay, the Salvages say, there are two Riuers; the one whereof we saw, hauing a faire entrance, but we had no time to discouer it. Better harbours for shipping cannot be then here are. At the entrance of the Bay are many Rockes; and in all likelihood very good fishing ground. Many, yea, most of the Ilands haue beene inhabited, some being cleered from end to end, but the people are all dead, or remoued.</p>
