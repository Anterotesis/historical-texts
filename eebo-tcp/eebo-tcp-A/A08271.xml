         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beeing most worthie: I beseech your

as it may sound with your knowen clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
I may receiue pardon for my boldnes.
To commit the first, I had a two folde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,

for two causes, the one, in regard none
hath better power to protect it, beeing in

like authoritie to pardon it, being faultie.
And in these regards especially, my most

sins of the Christians there, were the cause of
all that miserie, and of the feare which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed

And that there was no assurance of the mittigation of that

there were in the Christians humiliation, and a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning

And therfore, vnlesse we will returne from our hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,

which deeming all partes of the bodie well, may bee

when a common wealth is risen to the top of all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
then it is good that all men, but the magistrates

the violence of type mischiefes breede a loathing

with the ashes of drousie securitie, not onelye

seemeth our commonwealth, howsoeuer it seeme to
go in gouernment and true religion before other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
requireth a kinde of necessitie, that this fire bee

of our whole nation. If therefore wee looke to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
safe (howsoeuer slender account wee seeme to

euerie man into himselfe, and the magistrates into
the whole state: so (no doubt) if they be not partyall

               <p>To begin the examination, although I bee the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiest
to call men thereunto, yet in regard I am the
worst, I cannot but acknowledge, and in deed I finde
that in my selfe, whereof woulde God all others were
free, namely, sufficient cause why I wretch should bee
rouzed vp and pursued by this pernitious generation,
&amp; if I should flatter my self, to deserue to be freed from
their tyranies, if I looke vnto my disobedience to God
I should deceiue my selfe: and yet mine imperfections
perchance no farther seene in the world, than of such
as seem to stand in this dangerous time, as men worthy
for their honest, zealous, &amp; religious behauior, in their
owne conceits, to be iustified by the mouths of all their
neighbors. And therefore surely it will hardly appeare
that we haue deserued to be punished, if wee looke no
further tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into other men, &amp; so let our selues passe like
the scape goats: for if euery one couet to find the cause
in others, and prie not into himselfe, there wil be neuer
a free man, yet all free, for euerie man will condemne
all but himselfe, and yet though none will condemne
himselfe, hee shall bee condemned of all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let euerie man acknowledge himselfe worthie to
bee punished, so all men shall be condemned by theyr
owne mouthes, and seeke no further witnesse. And this
(no doubt) is the waie to finde the cause why God
hath called this nation agaynst vs,<note place="margin">Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must looke vnto him selfe, and not vnto others</note> as <hi>Ionah</hi> was founde

and our aduersaries Antichristians, but if wee
looke into the fruites of both, a man may bee in doubt
who is lykest Christ, by the outwarde fruites. And
surely, for that wee haue the fire with vs, and yet shewe
no heate: for that wee are true Gospellers in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
if wee shewe our selues hypocrites in practise,<note place="margin">Our fruits must approue vs.</note>
it must needes bee graunted, that our profession wyll
not excuse vs: then must our fruites approue vs, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
vs. It is as true as the Gospell is true, that wee
haue the Gospell, and as true it is, that there is no true
faith without it, and no saluation without faith in
Christ, which faith if it bee not liuely and bring forth
not onely leaues, but fruit, it is not onely lyke the figge
tree that Christ cursed, but a tree that shall bee hewen
downe and cast into the fire: so shall wee stande in
greater daunger in our account, hauing receiued much,
than the aduersarie that hath receiued lesse. And

to performe all things without scruple, doubt, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

outward action of superstitious zeale, wherein they are
restrayned to wade anie further in knowledge, than

they ought to knowe first, and then to honour him in
spirite as hee is spirit: but vnto the pretended church

is plaine that sinne is the cause in generall, which both
preuenteth well dooing, and arraigneth vs before the
tribunall seat of God, in regard of it selfe. But to make
rehearsall of all the euills which are growen strong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, were a tedious labor, and beyond my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and therefore I will briefely call to our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
some particular sinnes, that seeme to bee as nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series

and yet more lyke Elephants than gnats. Who
seeth not, and yet who considereth the most capitall
sinne of blaspheming GOD? Where is there anie

the maiestie,<note place="margin">Blasphemie no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

name of God? How freely doo the lewde Atheistes
in this lande, such as by theyr liues argue there is no
God, behaue themselues in most vnreuerent taking
into theyr vncircumcised lippes the name of God?
How doo they rent him, as much as in them lyeth, in
peeces? his heart, feete, nayles, soule, bodie, flesh, and
euerie parte and member of him is abused and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
taking therein delight, as in a feast, And this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6381:11"/>
sinne is not without some colour of a vertue. Heere is
great magnanimitie pretended to bee seene in these lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
fellowes, nay, vngodlye wretches and cowardlye, I
would it were free from great persons. And this is as
farre from being punished amongst vs, that he is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
too foolish and too precise, that will argue the same
to bee a fault. God reforme it, for the faulte is greater
than that which wee account fellonie, which robbeth
but man of his goods, and is hanged: and this robbeth
God of his glorie, and our selues of all shewe of the
feare and reuerence of God, &amp; yet is vnpunished. May
not the lyke bee sayde of vnpunished dronkennesse,
which is a most pernitious vice,<note place="margin">Dronkennesse not punished.</note> and the more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
because it hath no shew of vertue, as other vices
haue, and yet of late it hath gotten a coate, but a beastly
coate, yet the best it hath, and that forsooth, in drinking
carouse, it must bee to the health of some greate man,
and sometime great men will vse the name of greater
persons in this swinish sinne, vnder colour of wishing
health to them, as if health could bee maintained by so
grosse a sinne. It is intollerable, yet tollerated to the
high dishonour of God, who of Christians requireth
Christian sobrietie. Doth not this helpe to pull on the
Spaniardes? Yes surely. And is this all that is amisse?
Nay let pride come into the ranke of vnpunished vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">Pride vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</note>
But by your leaue this is a neate vice, it is a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vice, it is a courtly vice, and it is a vice that aboue all
the rest may challenge place with vertue, if vice maye
bee so bolde as nowe a daies it is, and it is so plausible,
that they that should seeke to kill it by spirituall disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
haue taken it by the hand also, and walke as court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6381:11"/>
as the best: the verie clowne will snatch at it too, and
euerie man exceedeth so farre, as if it were one of the
cardinall vertues. And although many lawes seeme to
tend to stop it, such is the force of it in all, that al drinke
of one cup, and like birdes of a feather, holde all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
they strayne curtesie who shall begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, and yet contend who shall exceed in it. I haue
no more to saie, but to assure you that this is one of the
ankers that holdeth fast the shippe of our perill to the
shores of our seas. And are these all? Alasse no. Let not
couetousnesse be forgotten, which is a thirstie sinne, the
sinne of the wiser fellowes, a husbandly sinne, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is not to bee punished in anie case, being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of none but of the beggerly minded, as affirmeth
the vsurer,<note place="margin">Couetousnesse vnpunishable</note> the mannor-monger, the farme buier, the
hoorder of golde and siluer. But alas, what fooles are
these, either they neuer reade it, or neuer heare it, or els
they forget it, that Christ cries <hi>Wo vnto the rich, for that
they haue their consolation heere.</hi> But if this did turne but
to their owne euils, it were the more tollerable. It rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to the ruine of the poorer sorte, and it is seene so
apparantly, &amp; held so dearly amongst vs in these daies,
that it is a fault to be frugall, and therefore to spend all
or spare all, are most imbraced: the one consumeth
what another hath gotten, the other hoordeth vp what
by force and fraud hee can get, and this is meere prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie
in the one, and idolatrie in the other: the one
spends lewdly, &amp; is praysed for a gentlemanlike mind,
and the other keepes wretchedly, and is counted to be
a good husband: two horrible euils, but maiden euills,
for neither of them was euer punished by any lawe, yet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6381:12"/>
meerely against Gods lawe, and argumentes that they
are nothing seasoned with the continuance and long
vse of religion, which teacheth loue: where the rich is
to support, relieue, comfort, and stead the poore that
want his aide. And so farre are they from these vertues,
that they not onely not comfort them, but seeke how
to vncloath them, howe to vncouch them, and howe
to vnfurnish them of landes, liuing, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.
And it is not lightly to be passed ouer, which
by meanes of these cormorants hath euen nowe taken
holde (as in the iudgement of God) vppon this lande:
wherein (no doubt) and as is helde euen of such cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throates
themselues, there is sufficient plentie of
corne, butter, cheese, and all other necessaries, and yet
such is the decay of loue as it will not be brought forth
but vppon prices at their owne wills, as though they
only were Lords of Gods blessings, and that the poore
haue no share in them but to stand at their colde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.<note place="margin">Coldnes of loue appeareth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> present dearth where plentie is.</note>
And thus to rest vnreformed, and the crye
of the poore not heard, is a maine cable to pull the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
vpon vs.</p>
               <p>It is a heauie iudgement of God, when there shall
bee a common dearth in a common plentie, as nowe
there is, and who so affirmeth the contrary is no good
member of the common wealth, but sauoreth allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of priuate gaine, who grinde the faces of the
poore with want of that wherewith they abound. But
surely, as for disobedience to God, there may be a feare
where no feare is, so by our fruitles profession, whose
effectes are loue, there may bee dearth where plenty
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6381:12"/>
is. And surely it were good it were considered why such
a iudgement should light vpon vs in the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and that the decay of loue should appeare so farre,
as to shut vp, not onely Christianitie, but all humanitie
among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Why may not a man glance at a great cause
of this iudgement, which as (no doubt) it is one and the
same with that which calleth our enemies, euen our
sinnes? Yet there is a peculiar cause which stinketh in the
nostrils of God, namely, the consuming of corne, the
meere earthly blessing of God to preserue man,<note place="margin">Spending of corne to make starch, a cause of dearths in plenty in Gods Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> abut
the strengthening of pride, in making of starch. A toe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
intolerable. Woe vnto him that brought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
first into our land. For it crieth out mainly to God,
who will not abide that about our neckes, in pride, that
should bee consumed which should feede our bodies in
penurie. But it is made (they say) with the coursest part
of the wheate. Alas, let not Magistrates bee deceiued, it
is the most purest of the purest corne. Oh that it were
reformed: for it is a wofull euill, drawing with it both
famine and warre: and yet this among many other sins,
trippeth on like a vice that maketh not only the vitious,
but the virtuous to taste of her vanitie. Infinit euils there
accompanie these former vnpunished sinnes, and they
are assuredly the maine winde that filleth as it were the
sailes of the Spanyards to inuade vs, whom the Lord
hath stirred vp either in mercie to reforme vs, or in
iudgement to punish vs. And surely as euery one hath
his hand in these euils, and none can excuse himselfe
from bringing, and heaping one sinne vpon another,
bewraying thereby the breach of al our duties to God in
generall, in not performing what we professe; let vs not
perswade our selues of safetie, vnles wee can frame vs to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6381:13"/>
repentance, and reformation. And as no doubt in this
the negligent Minister hath much to answer, by whose
careles discharge of his dutie,<note place="margin">The negligent minister hath much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note> &amp; function, many of these
euils haue crept in and taken deepe roote: So they must
thinke that now is the time wherein they must redeeme
what they haue long omitted, and so by their new dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
endeuour to roote out sinne, and plant faith, that
there may appeare fruits of euery mans profession; that
the cause of this fearefull <hi>hoobub</hi> being taken away, wee
may still possesse our libertie; and that our religion bee
not in shew onely, but in the simplicitie of our hearts: so
shal it be vnto vs as the bloud of the paschall Lambe, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vpon the shores of our seas, that the destroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
may passe by vs, and cast our enemies into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
gulfe. Yet let mee speake a little more without
suspition of being too officious, or too forward. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the delayes of poore mens causes in our courts of
England,<note place="margin">Delayes of sutes.</note> and the procrastinations of dispatch of causes
before Magistrates, hath a share in this matter, &amp; the free
oppressions of the poore by the rich, without remedie:
doe crye among the rest to God for iustice, and God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
calleth the Spaniards to execute the same. Would
God wee could shew our selues no lesse tractable then
children, who can leaue their wantonnes, if they see but
the rod. And if wee could leaue our vices, and imbrace
religion, God would not proceede further to strike vs,
but like a louing father would cast this his rod into the
fire.</p>

that the cause of this daungerous <hi>hoobub</hi> of
the Spanyard is our sinne, which foldeth vp
our feare as it were in a foure folde mantle,
answerable to the foure folde causes thereof: whereof
two are in the aduersary meerely, and two in our selues,
as before is proued. It is time for vs, in regard of these
dangers, to call our selues home againe, who haue long
strayed in the course of our Christian profession: and
for that we are now found out by the iudgement of him
that seeth vs,<note place="margin">We must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme quickly or be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> being able no longer to dissemble our sins,
but either to reforme them speedily, or to bee punished
for them seuerely. Who seemeth to bee called into the
action against vs? not meeke <hi>Moses,</hi> but blasphemous
<hi>Senacherib,</hi> whose Captaines are more furious then <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restes,</hi>
more hastie then <hi>Aiax,</hi> more tyrannous then
<hi>Phalaris,</hi> more beastly then <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi> But seeing
that religion is the gift of God, and the work of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
spirit, which cannot be brought in, or driuen out, by
the violence of these men; how is it to bee feared that
these wicked ones, out of whose nostrils proceede the
furious flames of madnes, and out of whose mouthes is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
fountaines of blasphemies against our alsufficient
God,<note place="margin">Religion can neither be brought in or driuen out by man.</note> shall preuaile against this pure religion which wee
imbrace? Surely there is nothing more true, then that
the force of man can neither bring it in, or banish it out:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6381:14"/>
for then had the tyrannous Emperours long since, vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ouerthrowne it. But the sinne that we commit, &amp; the
neglect of our calling, hath force and power to lose it
quickly, which hath been many yeares in obtayning.
And though the Gospell be a more inuincible protector
then an inuincible enemie, yet may we by abusing it, be
punished seuerely, and yet the Gospel continue safe. And
therefore there must bee a speedie meane vsed, that sinne
may bee reformed, and godlines imbraced, that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
bee not in shew, but in deede, and in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
But alas will some say, what a world of busines wil

must now looke into our Armories for Munition, into
our stables for horses, into our prouinces for men, and
into our treasuries for monie, to withstand the force of
the aduersarie. Wee haue no leisure to looke into our
thoughts, and actions for sinne, or to measure our liues
by religion, hauing matters of warre in hand. We must
haue more care of Captaines then desire of Preachers;
we must stand to the sword more then to the word; we
must flie to the field to fight, and not to the Church to
pray. These things indeede are to be regarded: but is it
not to be feared that this is the consultation of many in
these dayes, that are awake? And truely the most I feare
are yet slumbring, who see no occasion to steppe out of
their secure thoughts, out of their counting houses, out
of their worldly studies,<note place="margin">The conceyts of the worldly.</note> who think this as merry a time
as euer came. While there is peace they dreame not of
warre: while they be ful, they feare no famine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behoueth that there should be a very diligent care
had, how the people in generall seeme to stand affected,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6381:14"/>
both to warre and peace. And although few haue tasted
the one, and all haue had the fruites of the other: let none
be left secure, and let the least care be of worldly things,<note place="margin">Our duties to God carry with it a great traine of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note>
which no doubt will be well supplied, if there bee due

that efficient duetie, what auaileth all the prouision
beside? which will stand as a man without legges, and
steede vs in fight, as a man without hands. And where it
may seeme an harde thing for vs, being so great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to reforme vs in so short a time before the ariuall of
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which is sayd to bee at this next spring:
Let vs call to minde that <hi>Nineueh,</hi> a bloodie citie full of

3. 4. Yet such was their obedience to the Lords mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
that they generally repented &amp; obtained Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
before the fortie daies came, and were spared. And
shall we thinke that God was more mercifull then, then
he is now? nay his mercie seemeth greater to vs, for that

the huge circuit of the earth, &amp; measure in our thoughts,
the quantitie thereof, distinguishing this little angle from

and in their places, GOD hath most gratiously chosen

place where he was first honored: which indeed might
strike in vs the more admiration of his prouidence,
and the more duetie and reuerence in our callings to

If we should bee found yet in darknes, which is argued
by the fruites of sinne, we could not haue so much hope
of safetie, as they that neuer had the light. Alas shall we
be then more blind then the Papists, who are zealous in
carnall ceremonies? Shall wee suffer the Turke in zeale
of his Mahomet, to go beyond vs in zeale of our Christ?
and shall the Iew bring forth the fruits of the law, more
precisely then we doe the fruites of the Gospell? Surely
if it be so, wee must thinke that God will deale no more
fauourably with vs, then he did with them: whom hee
cast out for not receiuing his sonne, borne among them,
preached, and preaching vnto them, whom they slewe
bodily,<note place="margin">How we kill Christ againe.</note> as we doe spiritually, if we speake of him truely,
and followe him falsely. What then is required of vs
now in this dreadfull hoobub? <hi>England shall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed?</hi>
for that no doubt seedeth the Spanyard that he
may possesse it. The way for vs, is to retire our selues to

to follow, both to the confirming of them that are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

the word of God, ioyned with the reuerent and faithfull
vse of his holie and blessed Sacraments, shall worke our
regeneration, and shape in vs new thoughts, new affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
new endeuours, and new hearts: so that we shall
so faire forget our old vanities and naturall inclinations,
as <hi>Abraham</hi> forgat his owne countrey and his fathers
house: and wee shall haue as longing a desire to frame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6381:16"/>
our selues, according to the will of God, and to goe to
him in well doing, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had to goe to the land
of promise.</p>
               <p>When God would stirre vp the children of Israel to
turne from their iniquities, which in their hearts they
had so long practised: hee vsed no other argument, but
putting them in minde of the miseries wherein they
were borne, namely, in idolatrie, and bondage in <hi>Egypt</hi>
a cursed citie, where they were made slaues, Exod. 3. 10.
and that their fathers were Idolaters, and themselues gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouer to all voluptuousnes and pleasure, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
God, nor seeking his religion. And surely the same
argument may hee make against vs, whom hee hath
brought out of Romish <hi>Egypt,</hi> and spirituall bondage
wherein our fathers liued, and many of vs were borne:
yet God in his diuine loue, beholding vs in this wofull
state, pitied our miserie and thraldome; and when wee
were greedily following our owne destruction in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
he sayd vnto vs as vnto his children of Israel, <hi>ye shall
liue,</hi> and so anew (as it were) breathed into vs his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
light, by giuing vs the free vse of the Gospel. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <hi>Iosua</hi> had brought them into the lande of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as
Queene Elizabeth hath brought vs into the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of truth,
into the light out of darknes, he declared vnto them the
benefits that God had bestowed vpon them, to the ende
that they might bee the more stirred vp by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
thereof, obediently to follow GOD, that had
brought that mightie thing to passe for them.<note place="margin">We must call to minde Gods blessings, which will giue vs cause to reforme out liues.</note> Therfore
let vs also call to mind Gods wonderfull and many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
towards vs, which as they are infinite, so deserueth
he all our studies, thoughts and deuises to be bended to
his glorie. And among the rest of his mercies, let vs not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6381:17"/>
forget how he caused the winds and the sea to fight for
vs, against these pursuers in their former inuincible
strength: and how hee tooke the quarrell into his hand
and determined the same, both to his owne glorie and
our safetie. And if we remember this, we shal auoyd the
occasions to displease so mercifull a God, so louing a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so seuere a Iudge; who dealt with our enemies
as hee did with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoast. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bee reformed in our actions, and renewed in our
mindes. For as GOD no doubt chose vs before wee
thought on him,<note place="margin">God chose vs when wee thought not on him.</note> so he will defend vs, if now we trust in
him, hauing such experience of the riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
wherein he loued vs, euen when wee were dead in
trespasses and sinnes, when wee were Idolaters. Let vs
not shew our selues now dead in sinne, but let vs bee
quickened in all obedience, and let vs no more bee allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the golden cup of our owne vanities, which is
full of poyson within. Is it not a sweete thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that wee were once bound, but now are free?
we haue been in danger, but now are safe, and is not the
contrarie dreadfull? and shall wee by our sinnes, which
are the death of the soule and the subuersion of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
aduenture to liue in them for a moment, and bee
in danger of captiuitie, or the sword here, and after dye
for euer, rather then leauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a moment, bee freed
from this present daunger and liue for euer? Oh let vs
make haste to returne vnto the Lord: let vs not lagger
behinde, and so our captaine <hi>Iehouah</hi> depart from vs,
and we fall into the enemies hand. But to whom doth
it belong to see this weightie and most worthie worke
of the reformation of our liues done?<note place="margin">Euery one hath a court in his owne conscience.</note> Surely to all in
generall, euery one of vs hath a court in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6381:17"/>
wherinto all our thoughts, words and actions
must be presently summoned, and inquisition must bee
strictly made, what error is found in himselfe, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himselfe guiltie of any negligence in performing
his dutie to God commaunded, or pronenes to offende
God in things forbidden, he must as a Iudge farre from
partialitie, giue sentence against himselfe, and commit
the euils done to true and vnfained repentance: &amp; bind
himselfe by the law of obedience, not to sinne agayne.
Which were it performed of al men in particular, there
were no neede of the Magistrates sword, to compell the
same in generall. But sith our corrupt inclinations, doe
fight daily against this godly course,<note place="margin">Now is the time for the Magistrate to shew himselfe zealous in the Lords good.</note> the Magistrate,
who beareth not the sword for nought, must now, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he did, shew himselfe zealous in the Lords cause, for
the good of al the land in general. Which as it seemeth
much missed with negligence of euery mans particular
dutie to God, and his Soueraigne, whereby God is not
honoured of vs as he ought, nor the lawes of the land o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
as they should be, there must be a generall care in
the Ministrie, to teach euery man his duetie: for hee is
bound to teach, to reproue, to approue, and improue, in
season and out of season:<note place="margin">The worde and the swor must concur.</note> and in the Magistrate an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to see euery man performe it, as farre as to his
power and authoritie belongeth, who must compell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by force, that will not doe their dueties in loue. And if
then the vulgar and inferiour sort striue not to amende,
and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme themselues to the word of truth taught,
and to the example of the godly Magistrate, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before them, they shall all dye in their sinnes but the
Minister and Magistrate shall be excused. But if there
appeare negligence in the Ministers, the watchmen of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6381:18"/>
the whole flocke, the people will also bee negligent: if
they be ignorant, the people will be ignorant: if they be
wicked, the people will be wicked: as <hi>Hosea</hi> saith, <hi>Such
priests such people.</hi> Therefore now call your dueties to
minde ye Ministers, and speedily with diligence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the same. And thinke it not enough to bee called
the messengers of God, vnlesse you speake &amp; pronounce
the will of God truely: and disdaine none that shew
their good willes to speake as the occasion of this time
requireth: <hi>For they that feare the Lord vnderstand his
will. The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome.</hi>
And therefore euery one from the highest to the lowest,
Prince and Ministers, Magistrates and subiects,<note place="margin">Euery man must begin his dutie at the feare of God.</note> must
here begin. As a Prince coueting to gouerne prudently:
as Ministers endeuouring to speake truly and boldly: as
Magistrates desiring to rule in their places righteously,
and couragiously: and as people willing to liue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently
and religiously. So shall there bee a most happie
concord, and pleasant harmonie in al estates. There shal
be no want of blessings, no cause to feare the enemie, no
cause to complaine one of anothers wrongs in our land.
Sinne shall beare no sway, but godlines shall flourish in
all parts of this land: and then as we haue alreadie seene,
how God hath fought for vs, so he will giue vs new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.
And as Christ sayd to Nathaniel, <hi>we shall
see greater things then these:</hi> not onely in his fighting
for vs, but in powring out his heart vnto vs, causing vs
to vnderstand his word,<note place="margin">God wil keepe our aduersaries blinde, if we feare God and desire to see.</note> Prou. 1. 23. when yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

hold our aduersaries still blind, that seeing they shall not
see, in hearing they shall not heare, and nothing that
they imagine against vs shall prospet: but all shall turne
to their owne confusion. Therefore let the eyes of vs all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6381:18"/>
be towards the Lord, and with <hi>Dauid let vs all the day
stretch out our hands to him that is one and the same for
euer, louing and powerfull.</hi> And forasmuch as Princes,
and Magistrates, must in this necessary reformation giue
such examples, as may tend to the amendment of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
sort: it behoueth that they be learned and wise,
vertuous, and valorous: so shall the people follow their
steppes, as it were a light in the darke. And therefore
the Magistrate must pray for wisedome,<note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</note> not to seeme
singular in policie, but religious in zeale: applying the
same to the glorie of God, to discerne betwixt good and
euill, that by them sinne (the cause of our daunger) may
bee remoued, and faith and religion, the strength of our
land, may bee increased: that the vngodly bee not more

then vertue: so shall euery Magistrate be able to say
freely, <hi>Be thou my Iudge O Lord, for I haue walked inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently.</hi>
Surely as the Israelites thought themselues hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,<note place="margin">A good song for a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate if he sung it truely.</note>
when they had gotten <hi>Debora</hi> to gouerne them: so

her lieth, to place godly Magistrates vnder her: God
make them apt to answer it. She matcheth <hi>Moses</hi> the
Magistrate with <hi>Aaron</hi> the Minister, the Word and
the Sword: which both truely executed, must needes
make due obedience in the people to the Magistrate, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6381:19"/>
like in the Magistrate to the law, and consequently in all
to God. And then as the Magistrates are placed aboue
other men in authoritie, so they will goe before the rest
in pietie: and then no doubt but our Common-wealth
shall be secure, and bee in the protection of the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible,
who iudgeth them that iudge vnder him, and
he will subdue the disobedient hearts, to loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
rulers, and to fight couragiously against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of our state, as he subdued the people vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi>
and made them all incline to his will: That <hi>whatsoeuer

one would forsake sinne, and conforme himselfe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

suffer this Antichristian power in their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
inuincible, and therein most weake, to preuaile

did good <hi>Hezekia</hi> by helpe of his counsell call together
his captaines and souldiers, preparing them against this
mightie king and huge armie, who were not to come by
sea, as this king Catholique must; but he was come as it
were to the walles of Ierusalem alreadie to besiege it.
But bee strong saith <hi>Hezekia</hi> vnto his people, <hi>Be strong
&amp; couragious, feare not, neither be afraid for the king of
Ashur, neither for al the multitude that is with him: for
there be moe with vs then is with him: with him is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

of Spayne,<note place="margin">Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth goeth forth in person to incourage her people.</note> and in her we are al encouraged to withstand

before she tooke on her the Diademe of gouernment, as

Spanyards (my English subjects) whose strength is flesh, the
Lord is with vs that will fight for vs.</hi> But loe <hi>Hezekia</hi>
prayed against this mightie multitude, and the Lord out
of heauen fought for him, who by his Angell slew all
the valiant men of <hi>Ashur,</hi> the princes, captaines &amp; soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
to the number of 185000. men: and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

and by the breath of his mouth confound them that
stand against his word, to peruert his trueth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Queene Elizabeth (no doubt) humbleth her self in
prayer, as <hi>Hezekia</hi> did, an argument of like victorie, Let
vs all ioyne with her Maiestie therein, and then assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shall that God that sought against <hi>Ashur</hi> for <hi>Israel,</hi>
fight against <hi>Spayne</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> Yet some amongst
our selues, our vnnaturall contrimen, I know, seeke to
put feare in the hearts of our people, saying most blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously
that wee are heretikes, and that God cannot
prosper vs; wee are sinners, and God cannot blesse vs.
These are English Antichristians,<note place="margin">Our secrete Papists dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our people.</note> Spanish hirelings, and
deceiued and deceiuing papists: who lurke amongst vs
as snakes in a corne field, no more deseruing the libertie
of English lawes, her Maiesties protection, or benefits of
our peace, then did the Philistines amongst the children
of Israel, to whom they were as prickes in their eyes, and
thornes in their sides, because they preferred humane
policie in preseruing them to Gods commandements in
extirping them. They argue against our trust in God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to our faces, affirming vs to haue no such cause of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6381:21"/>
hope of our deliuerie as Israel had: and yet say they, and
it is true, Israel was plagued with sword, and captiuitie
for their sinnes, being the peculiar people of God; and
how can we escape that are (as they say) fallen from the
Catholike Church?<note place="margin">Whence we are fallen.</note> Which is false: but from Rome,
which is Babell, from papistrie, which is bondage, and
from the traditions of men, meere idolatrie: and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
worshipping strange gods, was the cause why Israel
was within the space of 339. yeares, six times oppressed
by their enemies: when they went a whoring after
straunge gods, then and not else were they oppressed.
And although, no doubt, wee cannot excuse vs of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our good God, by our manifolde sins, which doth
deserue correction: yet assuredly God is amongst vs,
and by many true Christians of England sincerely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,<note place="margin">In regarde of the truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our sins, God is with vs.</note>
his Gospell truly preached, his word freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and thereunto the liues of many truely confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
And on the contrary, let these Locusts that are
flowen abroad out of the bottomles pit, into this land,
not onely the wicked Iesuits, but also obdurate papists,
who so much obrayd vs with our euill liuing, learne
this, that they only in their idolatrie, blasphemie, &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
whoredome, are aptly compared to Israel in their
falling from God, and not in the weakenes of flesh only
falling, as did <hi>Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and many other, whose
kingdomes in the best seruice of the liuing God, were
not free from sinne, wherein no flesh can be cleered. But
holding the maine point, the Christian and true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
religion sincerely preached amonst vs,<note place="margin">The true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is with vs, an argument of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
imbraced of the most, (vnles it bee of such as like
subtile serpents stoppe their eates) confirmeth strongly
that the presence of God himselfe is still with vs: assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6381:22"/>
vs also that his hand for their rebellion against his
trueth, is turned against them. And therefore let no man
beleeue them, howsoeuer they dispute to defend their
owne holines which is onely outward, their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inwarldly seared with the yron of obstinacie, the
marke of the beast of Rome, deprauing vs by reason of
our frailtie. But it is necessarie such prickes should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, to the ende our liues, but especially our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
should bee the better approued: for trueth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
then most plaine, when it is opposed by error.
How is the Romish religion discouered by the sincere
writings of sundrie learned and deuout men, to bee a
spirituall bondage? who seeking the sincere trueth in
the light of the sacred word, haue left testimonie vnto
all posterities thereof, which the most learned of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
can neuer confute: but in striuing to maintaine
their darknes, they haue vndermined themselues, &amp; are

these are necessarie examples for vs, whereof we may
make a twofold profite; for thereby is seene the power
of God performed in weaknes, which may also bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to a spirituall vse: namely, that as by blowing of
trumpets, and shoutes of men, the walles fell downe: so
by the sounding of the trumpet of the gospell, by the

shall fall, the earthen pitchers, carnall conceits being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

loud Hoobub, the pursuers whereof, no doubt God
hath sent to beginne the way of their own confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the destruction of <hi>Babell.</hi> For a small companie
of the house of faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> will serue, not onely
to withstand this antichristian king, but put downe that

or to procure it to be receiued of others: that fiue

to flight. And therefore assuredly, if we truely serue this
our God, this threatned inuasion shall turne to the glory
of God, and our notable comfort: for God shal no doubt
giue them their deserued hyer, who as they are become
drunke with the wine of Romish inchaunements, so shal
they fall into deserued shame. And their hoped victory
shall turne to their owne ouerthrow, though they haue
alreadie cast lottes of euery mans land: nay the kingdom
it selfe is disposed in conceite, and cunningly by the aide
of some notable diuell intituled falsly, to beare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
colour, as did the French buy and sel our English no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie

of <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. where the French in regarde of their
multitude, and the paucitie of English men, cast lottes for
their furnitures before the victorie: but such was the
power of God in abating their pride, that the English
got the field, and slue a mightie companie of them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the most of their nobilitie slaine, or taken.
This is the reward of pride, let vs therefore so much the

of his inuincible power. And where they seeme to
flatter some with the conceite of our want of militarie
experience, although therein there is no such necessitie,
as that without it there is no hope to stand before these

haue the reward of traytors of them, for your treasons
done against your Queene. It may be, you take view of
some English runnagates, that haue thought themselues
bound by their alleagiance to their holy father, to break
their sworne obedience to their naturall prince, and to
conuey themselues to these people, with aduertisements

you haue a will to follow them in hope of large enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement:
they haue been most coursly handled, euen

then he shall haue no more vse of you, &amp; therfore soone

you desire the subuersion of the state, and

well to your Soueraigne:<note place="margin">There is in al subiects loue or hate, which will show it selfe by the fruits.</note> and in that regard to none els.
If you hate, your hate will be seene by the contrary: and
if your obedience be such as it ought, you wil conforme
you also to her proceedings, which are most holie, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

in your conceits, referre you to the learned and

them of error, your worke is done: and no doubt but
Queene and Councell, Ministers and people, will shake
hands with you, and imbrace that which appeareth by
the trueth to be palpable error. But if they conuince you,
as you are conuinced, become one and the same with
them, and flie from error. Lye not in such secret wayes,

therefore doth policie dismember a bodie, of a legge, an

nor Grecian, bond nor free, Scithian nor Barbarian, but
Iesus Christ is all in all:</hi> yet amongst vs there are stil both
loyall subiects, and couert traytors; good Christians, and

to take them away: &amp; to approue the good and to foster
them.<note place="margin">Inferior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates haue their power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the higher power.</note> And forasmuch as these ciuill offices cannot bee

and how to obey. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, to command
and to obey, are necessarie and profitable. So that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
must learne how to obey the power aboue them,
that they may know the better how to command such
as are vnder them: both which doe tend to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of ciuill iustice,<note place="margin">Ciuill iustice is the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealths pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefite.</note> which is the Common-wealths
publique benefit. And sith it is apparant that religion is
the foundation of all Common-wealths, of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good lawes, of the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of subiects towards
their Magistrates, of their reuerence towards princes, of
mutuall loue among themselues, and of iustice towards
others. And that it hath pleased the Almightie, to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs this sound foundation, let euery one build
thereupon such affections, and such obedience, to God
and man, as may season their places, whether they bee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6381:32"/>
Magistrates to rule, or subiects to be ruled, as may stand
with their allegiance to both: which no doubt may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
appeare in all,<note place="margin">Warre appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the faith all men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their country.</note> euen in the worst, while peace affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all safetie: but warre and the noyse of warre will
approue or reproue what now seemeth indifferent. And
therefore it is to bee carefully considered, how euery of
these before sayd chiefs or heads, ought to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in the time of triall, of their wisedomes, care, and
loyaltie, which will then be seene when any occasion of
sudden tumult among the rude multitude, shall bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Discreet premeditation therfore is of al things most
to be regarded in Magistrates, what, and when they are
to command; and in people what and when they in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to the highest and chiefe head, are to obey: least the
Magistrate discouer his weaknes, by saying, <hi>non putaba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
I did not thinke it would haue fallen out so:<note place="margin">Premeditation of euery mans dutie is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary before the run to far vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
their disloyaltie by their rash and vnaduised tumult,
saying afterward, we did it in a good intent. Therefore
there must appeare neither ouermuch negligence in the
one, nor ouermuch rashnes in the other. But as euery
man hath two eyes in his face to see the things present:
so the Magistrate ought to haue the eye of the mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
open to foresee things to come.<note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats ought to foresee things to come.</note> And this is the
eye of wisedome, and prouidence, that seeth in the time
of peace, what is to bee done against the time of warre:
and in the danger of warre, what is to be done to redeem
peace, or to preuent warre. The rumors of warre are to
the weake fearful, to the rude dreadfull, or desperate, and
to the wise, a cause of watchfulnes. The report then of
inuasion, must of necessitie draw in all men either cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to resist, or a present bewraying of the cowardly
minded. For the examination of euery mans affections
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6381:33"/>
in himselfe, cannot but testifie one of these in him. And
as I take it,<note place="margin">The English alwaies valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> none of our English nation can retaine the
last, sith all their progenitors haue so resolutely in deedes
witnessed the former. And therefore sith all (no doubt)
as it were with one minde, one heart, one hand, and one
consent, will bee readie vpon occasion to encounter the
enemie: so shall their magnanimitie the more bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
by how much they shall proceed by discretion,
and militarie direction: and not by a desperate hardines
according to euery mans conceit,<note place="margin">Rashnes to be auoyded.</note> and inward humour,
whereby they may seeme to couet, to shew their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes:
which being rashly put in execution, without

proceeding, will either discouer them to bee wilfull, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous,
&amp; ouerhastie: or els procure vnto themselues
the daunger of seditious people. For it behoueth vs to

which kinde of practise is new in our thoughts, most
friuolous for his purpose, praised by God. Yet hee that

pull on the vndiscreet multitude, vnder colour of some
publique good for them, or of some imminent daunger
towards them, to runne out like men vnaduised, to the
end they might worke their owne confusion, and yeeld
the more ease to the enemies purpose. And therefore it
highly behoueth all men, both Magistrates, and priuate
people,<note place="margin">Pryuate men must not stirre before the Magistrate.</note> to haue an eye to euery alarum, and not vpon the
sudden to be ouer rash, nor too secure: but to looke into
the cause, and shape their proceedings accordingly: and
in euery of the particular limits, before rehearsed, to play
the Bees, not to swarme before the master Bee: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Magistrate shall sound a call, and enter into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the king of Bees, going forth first, then ought the

wherein whosoeuer, Magistrate, or common person,
shall shew himselfe more forward, then shall be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the superior Magistrate, shal no doubt incur the
danger of disobedience: &amp; therfore must euery inferior
haue an eye vnto the superiour: so by degrees shall there
be true obseruation of dutie in euery place her Maiestie

priuate multitude moue, but as the first mouer shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect:
and which can not immediately bee sensible vnto
them, vntill it bee by the ordinary motious of the other
mouers intimated. And whosoeuer seemeth to moue

of himselfe and to moue others, without this ordinarie
motion, he cannot but bee censured a vsurper of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
an vntimely comet which would shew light being
darknesse it selfe, and therefore to be abondoned out of

and light from the first. It is a daungerous thing in
these daies to admit anie newes of matters of inuasion to

necessarye that truth shuld bee deliuered, to the ende
it may bee apprehended of such especiallie as haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

And because none ought to set his hande vnto the
arke, but he must be called thereunto: so none must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
as of himselfe, to lead any tumultuous crue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
anie supposed alarum, without superiour direction.
And for that the great charge lieth most, yea altogether
vpon the Magistrates: how farre behooueth it them to
be both wise to direct,<note place="margin">Three things to be auoyded in followers.</note> and couragious to goe before the
rest? wherein they must flie three things: <hi>feare,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they should be moued to flie: <hi>cowardlines,</hi> whereby
they may discomfite their followers: &amp; <hi>rashnes,</hi> wherby
they may endaunger themselues and others: but to bee
truely magnanimous, dismaid at no tidings, fearing no
danger, nor admitting no occasion to absent them from
the face of the enemie. For to liue or die are not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

your selues prouident in your charges, and as occasion
serueth, forwarde in true fortitude for your countries
safetie, you shall be reuerenced, and be worthily famous:
and not for desperate running on with a furious crue

wicked and rebellious practises sought to take away:
shewing thereby, oh Lord, that there is no true religion

true zeale in their desires: but all that they doe is by the
power of sinne, as if they should openly vow to preuent

if thou giue them scope, yea but a little to preuaile. And
therefore giue them not the power to worke what they

the bitternes of their tyrannies, to doubt of thy mercies.
But for asmuch as thou broughtest vs out of that cruell
