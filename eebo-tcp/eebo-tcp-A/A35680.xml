            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE World has not been displeas'd to see in <hi>Rinaldo</hi> a Character Resembling Your Grace's, a Character of a Heroe who neither Rants nor Whines, but is great with a solid and real Greatness, very Valiant without Extravagance, and very Human with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Weakness, and deserting Pleasure for Glory. And that Character naturally claims your Protection, which resembling yours has pleas'd all sorts of People: For your Grace
<pb facs="tcp:48880:4"/>
at the same time that you have been the Darling of the Fair, has been the Passion of the Brave, and the Esteem of the Wife. The University of <hi>Oxford</hi> is proud of such a Chancellour, and the Armies of the King of such a Lieutenant General. All who are engag'd in the Cause of Truth, whether they defend her by Force or Argument, are animated and excited by having your Grace at the Head of them. But at the same time that you have been the Darling of the Fair, and the Esteem of the Wise, the Largeness of your Soul, and the Height of your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, the Love of your Country and the Love of Glory, have made you almost the Adoration of the Armies. Whenever you were Encamp'd, the old Officers beheld with Wonder in you a double Portion of the greatness of Soul of the Noble Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> your Grandfather. And whenever you were engag'd in the Field, the old Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Soldiers Review'd with Ravishment the Heroick Courage of your Father, the Brave Earl of <hi>Ossory.</hi> I must confess, My
<pb facs="tcp:48880:4"/>
Lord, the commendation of any Man's Ancestors, is for the most part a Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and a Foreign Praise; But to shew the High Esteem that we have of yours, is to shew the Value that we have for your Grace. I admire indeed the old Noble Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the Brave Earl of <hi>Ossory,</hi> but I admire them most in your Grace. For the Blood of your Illustrious Family, like the Flood of a noble River, becomes more great and more august the farther it descends from its Source.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Ossory</hi> did as much as Man could do at <hi>Mons,</hi> and Success attended his Actions. Your Grace deserv'd to be Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious at <hi>Landen,</hi> but Fortune would not have it so. But 'tis easie, my Lord, to look great in Prosperity; To be great in Adversity that is the Work. Your Grace in yours appear'd so exalted to your Enemies, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most condemn'd that Fortune which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd for them, and blush'd in their Captive to behold their Superior. I am afraid that I have gone too far, while I have ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb facs="tcp:48880:5"/>
to please; For to shew that I am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of your extraordinary Merit, cannot but be pleasing to all the World but your Grace. But to shew that I had rather have your Approbation than that of the World, I here restrain the Passion which I have to proceed, and subscribe my self,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Prologue to this Play is a sort of Preface to it; yet because Prose seems to be more Adapted to Criticism than Verse, I desire the Reader's leave to say something more largely of things which were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned there. I had only the Hint of <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s Character from <hi>Tasso,</hi> but the Character is my own. And if any one objects that by differing from <hi>Tasso,</hi> I offend in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter against the Resemblance of the Manners, to him I answer; That the Manners of <hi>Rinaldo</hi> in <hi>Tasso</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, they are Consequently not well mark'd, and that by Consequence there can be no Character. I was therefore at Liberty to form a Character from <hi>Tasso</hi>'s Hint the most agreeable to my Subject that I could.</p>
            <p>I design'd <hi>Rinaldo</hi> then neither a Languishing nor a Brutal <hi>Heroe</hi>; He is Fond of <hi>Armida</hi> to the last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and yet resolves to leave her; but ow's that Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Strength of his Reason, and not the weakness of his Passion. And as he resolves to leave her out of a sense of his Duty and Honour, and not any Levity or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
<pb facs="tcp:48880:6"/>
of Nature; so upon their meeting in the fourth Act, he demurrs upon executing that Resolution, neither thro' Fear, nor any tender Infirmity, but something that happen'd which seem'd to Require it from his Goodness, and his Humanity.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Armida,</hi> some Gentlemen who have read <hi>Tasso,</hi> may expect to see that wanton alluring delicious Creature who appears in the fourth Canto of the <hi>Gierusalemme,</hi> with all that's tempting in Art; but I desire those Gentlemen to consider that in that Canto she only appears in Masquerade, and Acts a part at the Request of her Vnckle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fa manto del vero ala Menzogna,</hi> making use of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that were contrary to her Nature, in order to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Heroes of Godfrey's Army. The Poet gives her true Character in the <hi>38th</hi> Stanza of the <hi>16th</hi> Canto of that Poem.</p>
            <q>
               <l>E cosi pari al fasto hebbe lo sdegno</l>
               <l>Ch' amo d esser Amata, odiô gli amanti.</l>
            </q>
            <p>She is by Nature a Proud and a disdainful Beauty, Proud of her Triumphs, yet disdaining the Slaves which adorn'd them, and so much the more violent in the Love she bore to <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> because he was the only Person who had touch'd her Soul with tenderness. And therefore I was oblig'd to shew her, as the Nature of her Character and of my Subject requir'd. I say not this to Arraign <hi>Tasso,</hi> who is certainly one of the greatest of Modern Poets; but to defend my self: for I leave it to any Man of Sense to Iudge, whether affectation be becoming of a Poem which
<pb facs="tcp:48880:6"/>
ought only to express Nature; or the little Arts of a Iilt, of the Gravity, and Severity, and Majesty of the Tragick Muse.</p>
            <p>But now 'tis time to answer an Objection. There is, say some Gentlemen, a Softness that is Natural to Love, and only that Softness, say they, should be capable of Engaging <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s Heart; for 'tis hard to conceive, say they, how such a Heroe should be passionately fond of a Woman, who appears always either in a furious disorder, or using of horrible Incantations.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that the Action of the Play begins, but between three and four Hours before the Death of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mida</hi>; That before that, the Lovers had been three Months together in the Enchanted Island, where she had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him with all that is Soft and Engaging in Art and Nature; That the fury of her disorder began but an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Beginning of the Action of the Play, from a Hint which one of her Spirits had given her of the approaching Danger. All this will appear to the discerning Reader from the Play it self, who then may perhaps be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to believe that I have had a little Discretion in my Conduct, and that I have taken up the Story in that very part of it which alone is proper for Tragedy.</p>
            <p>The Action is very Great and Important; upon the last Event of it depends the Success of the most Happy, and most Glorious Croisade, in which ever the Christians engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Infidels. <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Army had Beleaguer'd <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> which, according to the Fable, could not possibly be taken till <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was return'd, and had cut down the
<pb facs="tcp:48880:7"/>
Enchanted <hi>Grove.</hi> As the Action is Great, the Characters are Illustrious, and the Scene is extraordinary. All the Objects that appear to the Agents are almost intirely new; ev'ry thing they see in Nature, being wonderful, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising; ev'ry thing that they see in Art, being Terrible, and Astonishing.</p>
            <p>I resolv'd therefore to do my Endeavour to treat this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with something at least of that Sublime at once and Pathetick Air, which reigns in the renown'd <hi>Sophocles.</hi> I resolv'd to use some Effort to make the Greatness of the Sentiments and of the Images answer to the Height of the Subject, and the Dignity of the Expression to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Sentiments. I design'd in this Poem to make Terror the prevailing Passion, which is likewise the predominant Passion in that admirable <hi>Grecian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Action is not only Regular in the Mechanism, (the Incidents falling without any restraint into the narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Representation) but Decent too, I hope, in the Conduct of it; and (to the Reserve of the Machines to which the necessity of the Subject oblig'd me) reasonable.</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd to shew as much Address as I could in the management of it. The first Act but just opens the Design, and just shews <hi>Armida</hi> in such a Light as was likeliest to prepossess an Audience in her Favour, and make them Espouse her Interests. As soon as I had done that by the mouth of <hi>Urania,</hi> I thought fit to oblige her to kreak off the Narration, according to that Important precept of <hi>Horace.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:48880:7"/>
               <l>Ordinis haec virtus erit et Venus aut ego fallor,</l>
               <l>Ut Jam nunc dicat, Jam nunc debentia dici,</l>
               <l>Pleraque differat, &amp; praesens in Tempus omittat.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Armida</hi> resumes and continues the Narration in the second Act, and by displaying the grounds of her Iealousie, shews the fundamental qualities of <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s Character, and her own; the greatness of her Mind, the Pride of her Soul, the Violence of her Temper, and the Height of her Passion; and prepares what she says and does in the fourth Act, as <hi>Phenissa</hi> by endeavouring in this second Act to bring <hi>Armida</hi> off from her Passion, lays the Foundation of, and prepares the <hi>Catastrophe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may now perhaps be expected that I should say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the defence of the Catastrophe. But the Objection against that being almost Vniversal, I should be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably Presumptuous, if I should Imagine that I could be in the Right, against the Consent of so many Illustrious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies as Composed the Audiences of this Tragedy. All that I shall say in my Defence is this, that perhaps I may one Day Retrench that which displeas'd them, and that I shall be a little more Cautious the next time I am to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them.</p>

            <l>But Proud, Fierce, Stormy, terribly severe,</l>
            <l>Such as the <hi>Italian</hi> has <hi>Armida</hi> shown,</l>
            <l>When by the Worlds disorder, she'd revenge her own.</l>
            <l>To change <hi>Rinaldo</hi>'s manners, we had ground,</l>

            <l>Then in a Moment leaves the Lovesick Dame,</l>
            <l>And only Burns, and only Bleeds for everlasting Fame.</l>

               <l>Could'st thou resolve, then should Heav'n send th' occasion</l>
               <l>To leave this lovely Master-piece of Nature;</l>
               <l>To leave her in this fulness of Desire,</l>
               <l>This height of all thy Furious Wishes;</l>
               <l>When each succeeding Hour</l>
               <l>Adds to her Graces, and sublimes thy Pleasure.</l>
               <l>Can'st thou resolve to see that Face no more;</l>
               <l>And never more to hear that Voice,</l>
               <l>Whose Musick Charms above the Magick Songs</l>

               <l>Can'st thou Resolve? Ay, There's the Dreadful Question!</l>
               <l>For what can be so terrible to Nature</l>
               <l>As to fall all at once from blissful Rapture</l>
               <l>To the Curst State of Wishing without Hope?</l>
               <l>Can'st thou make this Effort and live? No matter,</l>

               <l>See how the Tempest of his Passion tears him!</l>
               <l>But can'st thou hear him thus contrive thy Ruine,</l>
               <l>And yet stand tamely by?</l>
               <l>Thou who can'st crush him in a moment!</l>
               <l>Since thou hast cloy'd him with thy softness,</l>
               <l>What if he heard thee thunder in his Ears,</l>
               <l>With that terrible Voice that untunes Nature,</l>
               <l>And makes th' Inverted Sphears fall into discord?</l>
               <l>But something tender in my Soul restrains me,</l>
               <l>Is it Compassion? No, 'tis something softer,</l>
               <l>Thou lov'st the Traytor still; Lov'st him to madness.</l>
               <l>I do, I will, I must. Can ever Woman</l>
               <l>Behold that Form without a bleeding Heart?</l>
               <l>That Meen that claims the Empire of the Universe?</l>
               <l>With which he may give Laws to Human Kind.</l>
               <l>May the High place with Dignity maintain</l>

               <l>Pleasure flows streaming from those Lovely Eyes,</l>

               <l>Why was I made thus sensible to Pleasure?</l>

            <l>TO some fine Sparks methinks in yonder Rows,</l>
            <l>The Brave <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> a Barbarian shows:</l>
            <l>His leaving for a Camp his Amorous Care,</l>
            <l>Is a rude thing they'l ne're Forgive they swear:</l>
            <l>They ne're could think so barb'rously they say,</l>
            <l>No, that Young Hero's meer Reverse are they:</l>
            <l>On his young Cheeks Love's Charming power abides,</l>
            <l>While in his Manly Breast the God of War resides:</l>
            <l>In their soft Hearts, Ten Thousand Loves have places;</l>
            <l>But Wars stern God dwells on their dreadful Faces:</l>
            <l>While the late War in all it's fury Rag'd,</l>
            <l>They ne're with <hi>Gauls</hi> in <hi>Belgian</hi> Plains Engag'd:</l>
            <l>Nor Towring Fame on <hi>Alpine</hi> Mountains sought,</l>
            <l>But here with Frightful looks, while others Fought,</l>
            <l>They guarded the weak places they had Bought.</l>
            <l>But you, who to your Country and your Fame,</l>
            <l>Great Souls, still sacrific'd your Amorous Flame:</l>
            <l>Who in each Spring, the season of Desire,</l>
            <l>Left the Bright Dames, that set your Souls on Fire;</l>
            <l>To follow <hi>William,</hi> forcing <hi>France</hi> to yeild,</l>
            <l>And hunting Glory thro' the Dusty Field:</l>
            <l>You sure with Pleasure should <hi>Rinaldo</hi> view,</l>
            <l>Who less deserves Immortal Fame than you:</l>
            <l>He flew from a polluted Beauties Arms,</l>
            <l>And from the Influence of malignant Charms.</l>
            <l>You from such Beauty and such Vertue flew,</l>
            <l>As might enamour Gods as well as you.</l>
            <l>And you Bright Nymphs—</l>
            <l>Whom for a time the Noble Youths forsook,</l>
            <l>With Pleasure may on Lost <hi>Armida</hi> Look:</l>
            <l>Since by her weakness, your High merit shines;</l>
            <l>And to your praise, the rudest Hearts inclines.</l>
            <l>She to retain her Hero in her Arms,</l>
            <l>The utmost force exerted of her Charms:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:48880:37"/>You when their Glory Summon'd yours away,</l>
            <l>Your Looks rebated and relax'd your sway,</l>
            <l>By which you force ev'n Savages t' obey.</l>
            <l>Your Countrey's happiness you first design'd,</l>
            <l>To that the Darlings of your Souls resign'd,</l>
            <l>And sent them Death, or Victory to find.</l>
            <l>O Roman Virtue! which it's tryal past,</l>
            <l>Well merits the Reward it meets at last:</l>
            <l>For since with Peace the Noble Youths return'd,</l>
            <l>They for such worth with Double fires have burn'd.</l>
            <l>May long Fruition but foment the Flames,</l>
            <l>And be your Loves Immortal as your Fames.</l>
