            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Gallantry long since retir'd,</l>
               <l>Its City Valour in its Flames expir'd;</l>
               <l>But <hi>London</hi>'s Fame Immortal Glory bears,</l>
               <l>Preservd from wasting Age, and Flames, and Wars;</l>
               <l>Yet though we can a new built City show,</l>
               <l>We had our <hi>Neroes,</hi> and damn'd <hi>Praetors</hi> too,</l>
               <l>Who with the Tyrant Flement Conspir'd,</l>
               <l>And with resistless Rage our City Fir'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40309:3"/>But as the Deluge did o'reflow the Earth,</l>
               <l>Only to give a better World a Birth,</l>
               <l>So from devouring Flames, once caus'd our fear,</l>
               <l>New Houses, and bright Pyramids appear;</l>
               <l>And Warlike Youths, for mighty Deeds arise,</l>
               <l>Their Cities Glory, and their Nations Prize.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Such, such are you, you Mighty Sons of <hi>Mars,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Happy Omens of succeeding Wars!</l>
               <l>In Bloody Fields, the surest Conquest falls,</l>
               <l>Where Heroes March, and Kings are Generals.</l>
               <l>No greater Patriot Mankind could Espouse;</l>
               <l>Great is your Leader, and as good your Cause:</l>
               <l>Tyrants have oft whole Provinces Subdu'd,</l>
               <l>And in their Subjects Blood their Hands Imbru'd.</l>
               <l>Our King does Regal Clemency impart;</l>
               <l>A King that's after God's and's Peoples Heart.</l>
               <l>Methinks I see him Landing on the Strand,</l>
               <l>Lord of the Ocean first, and then of Land;</l>
               <l>Fame runs before him like the Morning-Star,</l>
               <l>And tells his Skill, and Mighty Feats in War:</l>
               <l>The Mighty <hi>Nassaw</hi> shews his Goodness forth;</l>
               <l>The Mighty Nations all Applaud his Worth:</l>
               <l>The Nobler Citizens themselves present,</l>
               <l>To Guard his Person, and his Government.</l>
               <l>No Hireling Souldiers for their Countries good,</l>
               <l>But freely spend their Treasure as their Blood;</l>
               <l>Unlike the Gloomy Days we lately saw,</l>
               <l>When Soveraign Will devourd the Peoples Law;</l>
               <l>When <hi>Irish Teagues</hi> were by its Bounty fed,</l>
               <l>Hir'd to Cut Throats, and Murder for their Bread.</l>
               <l>Now a Serener Ray of Bliss appears,</l>

               <l>Whilst in the Field the Martial Heroe walks,</l>
               <l>Of Wars fierce God, and Blood and Slaughter talks;</l>
               <l>Whilst Warlike Steeds beat with their Hoofs the Ground,</l>
               <l>And Neigh and Prance, to the Shrill Trumpets sound;</l>
               <l>In every Clime, where Heat and Cold do waste,</l>
               <l>Our Mighty Warriours and their Fame shall last.</l>
               <l>Our little <hi>London,</hi> on the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast,</l>
               <l>Can Mighty Wonders, and Brave Actions boast?</l>
               <l>There Warlike <hi>Baker</hi> a firm Bulwark stood,</l>
               <l>Gainst <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> an <hi>Augean</hi> Brood.</l>

               <l>The Mighty <hi>Baker</hi> is the Muses Theam,</l>
               <l>My daily Subject, and my nightly Dream;</l>
               <l>Skilld in the Arts, that do to War belong,</l>
               <l>Soft were his Passions, as his Hand was strong:</l>
               <l>But cursed Fate! we paying Tribute, come</l>
               <l>To his Immortal Worth, and to his Tomb!</l>
               <l>Ah! Partial Destiny! Thou took'st the best;</l>
               <l>Thou Lop'st the Heroe, and thou sav'st the Priest!</l>
               <l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Walker</hi> was only Heir to his Fame.</l>

               <l>Though loss of Charters might deject the mind,</l>

               <l>And when a Papist had forsook the Throne,</l>
               <l>We gave a Juster Monarch the lost Crown.</l>
               <l>With Generous Rage, and Manly Virtue Arm'd,</l>
               <l>With Kingly Goodness, and the Souldier Charm'd,</l>

               <l>Mourning the Bread and Cheese they now must loose,</l>
               <l>But more the Fate of the declining House.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Prince a better Fate must sure attend,</l>
               <l>Whom willing Subjects at their charge Defend;</l>
               <l>Tyrants can't force a Regiment for the Wars,</l>
               <l>Our King Commands large Troops of Voluntiers.</l>
               <l>Such once our former Monarchs did attend,</l>
               <l>And from Invading Foes the Land Defend:</l>
               <l>Hail, Mighty Warriours! Heaven direct your Course,</l>
               <l>Each Man a Knight, a <hi>Pegasus</hi> each Horse;</l>
               <l>Sworn to Destroy the Holds of Hell and <hi>Rome,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For better Ages, and brave Times to come;</l>
               <l>When Peace and Plenty shall surround our Shore,</l>
               <l>And Defunct Tyrants shall be seen no more:</l>
               <l>When Hells devouring Womb shall be quite fill'd,</l>
               <l>With the fat Sacrifice your Swords have kill'd:</l>
               <l>Then you returning from the Scenes of Wars,</l>
               <l>Adorn'd with VVounds, and Beautify'd with Scars,</l>
               <l>Shall by the numerous Crowd receive Applause,</l>
               <l>And tender Virgins bless you as you pass:</l>
               <l>The Ransom'd Nations shall Exalt your Praise,</l>
               <l>Structures of Marble to your Fame shall raise.</l>
