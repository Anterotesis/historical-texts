            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a notion more <hi>Platoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> than <hi>reall</hi> for a private man to thinke he can arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate <hi>Imperiall differences,</hi> and it is rather an act of <hi>Fancie</hi> than <hi>Iudgement,</hi> a policy of <hi>Imagination,</hi> than <hi>State,</hi> for the ſoule of <hi>one</hi> is of no juſt latitude nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion for a <hi>deſigne</hi> of that bredth, as the <hi>Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Kingdome,</hi> and when the judgement proves too narrow for the deſigne, the deſigne muſt needs fall ſhort of the requiſite proportions; and further, they that would intervene in ſuch controverſies, and myſteries of high Accommodations, muſt be ſituated geometrically for both ſides, and ſtand upon ſo much vantage ground, as he may have a full proſpect over all particulars, whether ſpringing or full blowne. As
<pb facs="tcp:54080:4"/>
for inſtance, if you would compoſe the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> you muſt either have a right and cleare cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of both, and ſee almoſt the verieſt atomes in the ſtate of both, or elſe you ſhall doe right to neither; for the leaſt things are of moment in <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,</hi> and I doe beleeve it is impoſſible for any to be ſo <hi>qualified an Arbitrator</hi> for our ſupreme diſputes, being ſo full of new <hi>Revolutions,</hi> and <hi>Interpoſitions,</hi> eſpecially now, when an <hi>Almighty power</hi> ſeemes to mingle, and incorporate his owne <hi>Intereſts</hi> with ours, and engage us upon new <hi>Fundamentals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Accommodation</hi> bee ſuch a ſubject as will gaine both Readers and parties, yet it is of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence, to write unto the ſpirits of men, of things that may retard and ſtay their publick purſuits; eſpecially now in a time of an Iriſh Accommodation; for there are few in ſuch haſte after their enemies, but they will ſtay a while and talke with any that can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and diſcourſe of <hi>Peace</hi>; and the muſick of <hi>Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is ſo ſweet, as many could willingly let their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements fall out of their hands to hearken and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch tunes: we ſhould be farre better <hi>Stateſmen</hi> for theſe times, if wee firſt laboured to finde the true <hi>elevation</hi> of things, for when we have ſuch intrinſecall variations in our State and Church, it cannot bee an act of commenſuration to weigh deſignes at the beam of old <hi>Politicks</hi> and <hi>Conveniences,</hi> and they that would now place us upon old bottomes, are ſuch in whom the old intereſts prevaile more than the new, and if we take hold of them to guide us, they will at length bring us backe into as bad a condition as we have forſaken; although they may ſeeme to lead us about a while
<pb facs="tcp:54080:4"/>
through ſome new and pleaſing conceptions to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine us from obſervation. It was a ſmooth fallacy of the Prophet, who led his enemy ſo farre, as he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not to ſee the miſtake, till he had brought him into the midſt of Samaria. The peace and proſperity we have had, have wrought in us ſuch principles of eaſe and indulgency, as makes us induſtrious in proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings after Pacifications, never looking forward at inconſiſtencies, nor behind at conſequences, nor about us, at the ſeaſon, and other circumſtances.</p>
            <p>For Accommodations in the latitude of the notion, are of ſuch a contexture, and intermingled conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they uſually take in various and equall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from both. Now I appeale to any whether the others Principles either Religious or Civill be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ours now, and whether they be ſuch as can dwell together, or incorporate, whether their eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and operations be not divers, and being ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant as we ſee, and having wrought out each others intereſts into ſeverall independencies and ſtations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, how ſhall theſe be reconciled! unleſſe wee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hereafter to live under thoſe heavenly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall influences, where <hi>Antipathies</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties</hi> are made friends, <hi>Where the Lion and the Lambe lye downe together, and the children play with the Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katrice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Accommodation</hi> is the putting an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly period to our <hi>Reformation,</hi> which by that muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be prevented in the period it aimed at, becauſe it ſeemes to be met in the halfe way, and we beſpeake it to ſtop, and bring with us a new deſigne rather of <hi>diverſion,</hi> than <hi>advancement</hi> or <hi>propagation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54080:5"/>And again, theſe times are ſuch as the <hi>infuoſins</hi> are ſtronger, and the <hi>principles</hi> too, being inabled not only by many <hi>divine influences</hi> and <hi>providences</hi> and <hi>concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies</hi>; but carried on with <hi>Arguments,</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>treatiſes,</hi> which the <hi>conteſtations</hi> of former ages in this Kingdome never knew; each party aſſuring their ſide with a more learned Artifice, ſo as men are now acted aſwell by <hi>conſcience</hi> as <hi>paſsion,</hi> as well by <hi>Iudgement</hi> as <hi>reſolution,</hi> and this is one reaſon with me that not any ſuch <hi>pacification</hi> can well be tranſacted, for both ſides have been ſo <hi>Argumentatively</hi> and <hi>rationally</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and have taken in their owne fundamentalls ſo deeply, and in ſo much divinity, and aſſurance, as it is not poſſible nor probable to mediate a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till you have looſened and unhinged the one; and therefore theſe <hi>Maxims of Moderation</hi> &amp; <hi>Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are rather the iſſues, and ingenious experiments of Melancholy ſpirits, who pleaſe themſelvs and others in theſe ſtormes, and gloomy ſeaſons, by painting twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and calme enterludes; or elſe the ſubtill incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſome that are no right wiſhers to the cauſe: and doe wee not further ſee how the wars and broyles of preceding ages, left alwayes a turbulent and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming remainder in the diſpoſitions of men? ſo as the old differences and effuſions did onely forſake the broader and wider paſſages of Battailes, and ſought out ſtraiter, thoſe of Emulations, Duells, and Quarrells, and men have rather fought the great Contentions over againe in the Abridgements afterwards, ſo as the warre was ſtill the ſame in ſuch unſound Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, onely the method was new, and the bloud of thoſe warme diſtempers flowed downe onely in nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower

            <p>And though the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Pacificating Oath</hi> would perſwade us of the terrours, and judgements, ſuch <hi>Oathes</hi> would caſt upon the <hi>violators,</hi> as if the <hi>violation</hi> brought with it (like a boding Comet) the ſparklings of an heavenly indignation; yet wee muſt know that <hi>Princes</hi> as they are exalted into the divine notion of <hi>Gods,</hi> ſo their Favourites make them beleeve that their politicall <hi>deitie</hi> can ſecure them; and then there are ever ſome State Caſuiſt at hand too who can heale their diſtempers with many a blandiſhment and evaſion, ſo as I know not whether to admire more the glory, or infelicity of a Crowne, for there is a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which is calculated meerly for the Meridian of Princes, and will fit no lower condition; and there is an order of <hi>Prerogative Divines,</hi> who onely ſtudy the <hi>diſintereſſings</hi> and <hi>diſobligings of their Prince:</hi> now I would gladly know what remedy he hath reſerved for us in caſe of violation (it being too apparant how the ſupremeſt may be misinſtructed and abuſed,) all I can find out, is an heavenly indignation &amp; revenge; and he muſt know, this is not an immediate judgment which treades alwayes on the heeles of a tranſgreſsion, but may be powred upon the next ſucceeding <hi>Throne,</hi> or at leaſt in the evening of the offendour; for there are certaine <hi>graduall effluxes of the Divine Wrath,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ſtayes</hi> and <hi>periods</hi> which his Infinite Wiſedome makes, and is not accountable to our Tribunals; and what ſhall a State doe then in this ſpace and intervall to judgement? for being then made paſsive againe, it

            <p>Nor do I think it a deſigne of that happy and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome conſtitution as ſome take it, I mean an oath of Pacification, for ſatisfaction of jealouſies, for there is an art to take away all jealouſies, and in the roome bring deluſions of aſſurance, and ſo thicken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſſate the ſatisfactions, that people ſhall in time forfeite their liberties in a miſt, and ſcarce believe they are oppreſſed, till they be oppreſſed almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a remedy; and this nation hath been ever eaſily carried on into ſuch an incredulity and misbeliefe, and
<pb facs="tcp:54080:7"/>
have often ſerved many yeeres apprentiſhip both of ignorance and bondage.</p>
            <p>Nor will any wiſe man ſuppoſe that to bee a good condition for any State, eſpecially for a government ſo mixt as ours, which ought ever to be looking to the juſt <hi>Intereſts</hi> of one another, eſpecially after a ſeaſon of encroachment and exorbitation: for to take in ſuch a remedy as ſhall leave no Iealouſie behinde it, is to take in ſuch a quantity of <hi>Opium</hi> as will rather bring a Lethargy than a kindly reſt, and rather make a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>ſtupid</hi> than <hi>peaceable</hi>; ſurely thoſe remedies are beſt, which keepe States waken and ſenſible, and the eyes of the Kingdome open. And as there is a jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in ſome which is but a virtuous luxuriancy of love and affection, and tends onely to the preſervation of honor and propriety in the ſuſpected party, ſo there is in the beſt States: &amp; ſure there is no ſuch way to keep things in their owne rights and priviledges, but ſuch a ſollicitous and carefull vigilancy, and wiſe ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>That which I now conceive to be the only Intereſt of our Reformation, is not a Pacification but a Peace. For a Pacification is a more proper and ſafe notion for forraigne States than our owne, for a Pacification is but the accommodating of a difference, and a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeverall principles, and a reſolving to agree with one another, without any further incorporation, but this cannot be intrinſecall nor naturall enough for us of the ſame kingdom, this is no ſuch indiſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication as we ſhould now aim at, and as our new &amp; holy fundamentals cal for: our pureſt &amp; ſoundeſt peace would be from a ſuccumbency &amp; invalidity, when on the worſe part the oppoſition is ſpent &amp; exhaled, then
<pb facs="tcp:54080:8"/>
there is no feare, that there will breake forth any freſh and mutuall <hi>Contendings,</hi> and there muſt needs be more ſecurity in that <hi>peace</hi> where all poſsibility of reſiſtance is taken away, than where there lives <hi>two natures</hi> of proportionall abilities and paſsions, which would prove like the two men in the Fable, who being weary with beating one another, tooke truce for an houres refreſhment, and fell freſh to their blowes againe.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Peace</hi> then and not a <hi>Pacification</hi> is our aſſertion, and I hope all who value a <hi>Reformation</hi> according to their Covenant, will purſue thoſe things which make for that, and ſuffer themſelves not to be taken off their holy and famous reſolutions for <hi>Peace,</hi> by any faire or ſpecious argument for <hi>Pacification, Pacification</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the halfe way to <hi>Peace,</hi> and this I conceive is the <hi>Peace</hi> which will make both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> happy, not ſo much by inventing any new engines to binde <hi>our Kings in chaines, and our Princes in fetters of iron,</hi> but by endeavouring ſuch an extirpation of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Prelacie,</hi> and <hi>malignity,</hi> as our <hi>Peace</hi> may be rather ſecured by a <hi>diſability of contending,</hi> than by any new <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>poſsibility of reſiſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For any further <hi>Criticiſme</hi> upon the <hi>Author</hi> I have none; I confeſſe he reaſons well upon many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and makes his inke riſe high, and daſh handſomly upon thoſe that ſtand about the <hi>Throne,</hi> and had he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched further with his pen even to a Peace, and writ but beyond a Pacification, he had writ well.</p>
