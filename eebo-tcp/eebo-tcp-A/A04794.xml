            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Verse of <hi>Horace</hi> the Poet (right courteous reader) which I my selfe, by my selfe, haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true: for hauyng enured my selfe in my greene and growyng yeares, to readyng of Poetrie (an arte in my mynd and censure both princely and pleasant) in riper yeares I could neither by faire meanes bee allured, nor foule mines procured, from embracyng thereof, so greatly therewith was I linked in loue. Wel might I beare and forbeare, refraine and abstaine for a season, but by and by in the turnyng of an hand, with the tracyng ape should I breake the daunce, and fall a scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng for Nuts. <hi>Naturam expellas furca licet vsque recurrit.</hi> And surely farre discrepant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue I beene from the opinion of those that deeme Poetrie to bryng nought else, but onely a certaine naked and vaine delectation to the life of man: whiche vnworthy and false accusation is well and wisely confuted of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> inueighyng against <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:8433:5"/>
to apply hymselfe to be a maintainer and defender of that false and impudent sclaunder: wherefore of mee thereof needeth no refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now (courteous reader) if I should take in hand to pen and paynt foorth the praise of Poetrie, and Poets inuentions, I feare mee too long my labour would laste: onely thus muche I dare boldly affirme, that no where shalt thou finde profite and pleasure better linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than in the worthy woorkes of prudent Poets. For <hi>Flaccus</hi> sayeth.

                        <l>The price and the praise he gaineth alone,</l>

                     </q>
Wherfore sundrie the most learned of all ages, of all landes and languages, haue bestowed no small labour in the moste laudable practise of Poetrie. For example: amonge the Italians, <hi>Bembus, Pontanus, Flaminius</hi>: Among the French men, <hi>Borbonius, Salmonius, Muretus:</hi> Among the Germans, <hi>Eoba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nus, Stigilius, Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>: Among the Scots, <hi>Bucchananus:</hi> whom <hi>Carolus Vtenhouius</hi> prettily praiseth in his <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stichon,</hi> writyng thus (in <hi>I Sanna. H Francast. A Flam. H Vid. A Nauger. P Bemb. Italos: Mich Hosp. Adr Torneb. Io Aurat. Gallos: &amp; Georg. Buchan. Scotum.</hi>)

                        <l>Three Frenchmen did Italians six</l>
                        <l>for learnyng great excell:</l>
                        <l>But from them all one Scot alone</l>
                        <l>doth heare away the bell.</l>

Now (courteous reader) of all sorts of Poems, &amp; Poesies, none (mee thinketh) are more pithie and pleasant, than pretty, shorte, witty, quicke and quippyng Epigrammes: in the which kind of writyng <hi>Marcus Valerius Martialis</hi> is counted cheefly to excell. Wherfore out of him (as sundrie other most singular authors) haue I translated and taken sundrie short, propper, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie &amp; pleasant verses, and Epigrammes, for thy no little profite, and great delectation: marrie this I must let thee vnderstand, that as well out of <hi>Martial</hi> as the rest, I haue left the lewde, I haue chosen the chaste: I haue weeded away all wanton and woorthlesse woordes: I haue pared away all pernicious patches: I haue chipt &amp; chopt of all beastly boughes and bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, all filthy and fulsom phrases: Which I thinke none will mutter at and mislike, but suche as delight more to drawe of the dregs, than drinke of the delicate liquour.

In the meane tyme take these in good part (I beseche thee) whiche were made of mee.</p>
