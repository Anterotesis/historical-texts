            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it seemes my weake labours were not of the nature of those things, which <hi>decies repetita placebunt</hi>: for the <hi>Rehearser</hi> could not taste them <hi>once,</hi> who rather <hi>hunted</hi> after a prey for his enuie, then to performe the great and pious businesse he vndertooke. Pitty it is, that a Christian, a Scholler, a Preacher, could not thinke me a fellow-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister with him in all, both of the same Church and Gospel! for so the courteous imparting of my Notes to him many dayes before, proues that I reputed him a fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer with me. It may therfore iustly be expected by all that know how sensible I must needs be of so publike and so vndeseru'd a prouocation, that I should pay him again in his owne coine: and how easily could I whet my Penne, and giue the reines to an vnbridled, but iust anger? But <hi>non sic didici Christum,</hi> I haue learn'd of Him to be ready to forgiue, who teacheth vs to beare with wrongs; not because out of <hi>basenesse</hi> wee cannot reuenge, but out of <hi>Religion</hi> we will not. Therefore I will not smite an Hebrew, one that should be of my Brethren; whose memory I neuer intended to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

with more of my Sermon then he pleas'd, nor speake I, because he left out the most part; nay, in effect the whole Sermon in rehearsing: it neither deseru'd, nor did I euer desire an exact rendring; but what was wanting on his part in <hi>memory,</hi> or as himselfe profest in <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> to make vp with malice, shew'd his <hi>zeale</hi> to be voyd of <hi>discretion,</hi> and his <hi>emulation</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> For my expressions, (vpon which he bestow'd some vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming tearmes of derision) I know no reason, why I should euer change one particle of that poore language which God hath lent me, to honour him withall, in hope to be vpon all occasions supplied, out of the <hi>empty store</hi> of <hi>Rheumatick</hi> &amp; <hi>extempory Barbarisme:</hi> yet who-euer shall truly weigh the whole body of my discourse, shall find it, for the most part, squar'd by the comely Phrase of the Scripture, which I shall euer esteeme the <hi>Well-spring</hi> of <hi>Diuinity:</hi> If otherwise, this small worke of mine owne will disapproue me: For I am forst to that which I neuer affected, to put my selfe vpon the iudgement of diuers Readers, whether this Sermon deseru'd the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of that one Rehearser. From whose lame Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I appeale: and let this Sermon speake for it selfe, as it was then spoke by my selfe, who in the Pulpit neuer vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any thought, but with an vnfained intent to honour God, and none but God; and to benefit my Audients <hi>soules</hi> not <hi>eares;</hi>
