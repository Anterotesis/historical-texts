         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord our God (Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable)
who in great mercy
hath caused by his spirit, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Scriptures to be written for
our learning: hath also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that all men shoulde
studdy therin both day &amp; night:
that so by the helpe of the same
spirite, men might write them in their hartes. The ende
hereof is, that thereby they may recouer the Image of
that new man, which againe is created after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God in knowledge and holinesse.</p>
            <p>And while the people of Israel obserued this: they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
peace throughout their borders, and great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
within their Pallaces. And such feare God strocke
into the harts of their enemies round about, that none
durst stirre against them. But at what time they cast off
this, and chose new Gods, and made no account of the
knowledge of the true God, nor of the learned, that
<pb facs="tcp:9326:3"/>
should to them the same God teach: Then was there
warre in the gate, and no peace to any that went in or
out, but great troubles arose to all the inhabitantes of
the earth. For nation destroyed nation, and Cittie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
Cittie, and God troubled them with all maner
of aduersities.</p>
            <p>This standing thus, and God remaining vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
I assure my selfe of all kingdomes (to whom the
worde of God is sent) this may be spoken. That they,
<hi>Elias,</hi> I meane, the men like <hi>Elias: Iosua, Samuel, Dauid,
Daniel,</hi> and such: whose delightes are in the law of
the Lord, are the Horses and Chariots of a kingdome.
O noble Sir, I beseech you therefore consider well
therof: and let those gracious words of good king <hi>Asa,</hi>
when ten hundreth thousand came against him: and
those of King <hi>Abiah,</hi> when eight hundreth thousand
came against him: and those of <hi>Ioab</hi> the Captayne,
when the <hi>Ammonites</hi> &amp; <hi>Aramites</hi> came against <hi>Dauid,</hi>
be writ most sure in your noble hart: that so they may
proceede from your lippes, to the incouragement of
the common sort; whose hartes often fayle in rumors of
troubles. I know your Honor needeth not to be taught,
how Nobilitie giuen to the holy worde, must be the
strongest pillers of the Church. <hi>Israel</hi> through all ages
so stoode firme: but otherwyse fell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iosua</hi> being equall to a Prophet, conquered the land
through his constancie and courage in diuinity. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him great contempt of Religion arose: wherefore
much of their land againe they lost: and greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
was that state, vntill the dayes of <hi>Samuel.</hi> For as
they often fell away, so the Lord often sould them into
<pb facs="tcp:9326:3"/>
the handes of spoylers: whereby in the ende that state
became <hi>Ichabod,</hi> no glory. For the glory of God the
space of seauen moneths departed from them: yet by
meanes of good <hi>Samuel,</hi> faithful in religion, was againe
setled in <hi>Israel:</hi> and so by him, the state was well helde
vp all his dayes: who although he descended from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<hi>Corah,</hi> yet is he for <hi>Leuy</hi> a conquerer of better
then <hi>Sichemites:</hi> and as he, so, or more, did that noble
and valiant <hi>Dauid,</hi> euen by diuinitie, recouer wholy
the land first conquered by <hi>Iosua:</hi> and <hi>Dauids</hi> title is
not so euident for a warryer, as it is for the pleasant in
songs to Israel. For to this day, most sweete is the
voyce of that sweete singer, to all that rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his tune. But he that should vnderstand him to
the full, had need of the spirite of an Apostle. A true
patterne indeed (Right honorable) of true Nobilitie.
But yet full soone was this true patterne lost: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
ten partes of that stately kingdome became in
short time, not onely <hi>Izrael</hi> and <hi>Loruchama,</hi> but <hi>Loam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
also. For full often did the Lord visit them with the
sword, aswell at home, deuouring one an other, as by
the enemy abroad: and in the ende suffered them to
be carryed quite away by the Kings of <hi>Asshur.</hi> And
God tooke no pittie: but euen as they had cast off
him from being their Lord, so he cast of them from
being his people.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> of the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> is set forth as a patterne for discommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to all that followed his wicked steps: so noble
<hi>Dauid</hi> of the house of Iuda, is the patterne set forth for
commendation to all that had care to walke his godly
<pb facs="tcp:9326:4"/>
pathes. Therefore no further in story for sample to true
nobilitie need I here to seeke.</p>
            <p>Yet in so much as the fame of one of your owne
most noble progenatours soundeth in our eares to this
day, I trust it shall of none be thought amisse, yf I lay
him before your Honorable eyes, as an other example.
That noble Earle IOHN TALBOT is the man: who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liued as languishing in idlenes, riot, or excesse: nor
died as hauing surfited with vaine pleasures, and fonde
delyghtes: but of manly woundes receiued in open
feelde, after he had valiantly warred foure &amp; twentie
yeeres in defence of his Princes right: a death and life
most honorable to them that are truely noble and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.
Euen so this worthy peere, togeather with his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Sonne the Lord <hi>Lisle,</hi> in that sore battle fought
at <hi>Castilion</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> their sweete lyues did ende:
where a monument of the Earle remayneth vnto this
day, and this inscription folowing, ingrauen thervpon.</p>
            <p>Heere lyeth the right noble Knight <hi>Iohn Talbot</hi> Earle
of Shrewsburie, Earle of Washford, Waterforth and Valence,
Lorde Talbot of Goodritche and Vrchingfeilde: Lorde
Strange of Blackmeare, Lord Verdon of Alton, Lord Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of Wingfeilde, Lord Louetoft of Worsoppe, Lord Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuall
of Sheffeilde, and Lord Falconbridge, Knight of the
most noble orders of S. George, S. Michael, and the Golden
Fleece, Great Marshall to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixt of his
Realme of Fraunce, who dyed at the battle of Castilion neare
Burdeaux, Anno. 1453.</p>
            <p>Now as this, and other your noble ancestors, haue
been alwayes at home most honorable for their fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
towardes the Crowne of Englande: and for
<pb facs="tcp:9326:4"/>
their seruice both at home, and abrode against the
enemie, in so much that euen the very name of the
<hi>Talbot</hi> to them, hath been tirrible: so no doubt there is,
but that your selfe will shew your selfe, in all nobilitie,
as descended from such. A most noble warryer, and
faithfull subiect vnto his annoynted Prince was he,
whose example therein you follow. Therefore one
poynt more I beseech your honor, learne of that noble
<hi>Dauid</hi> your patterne. And as you and your honorable
fathers haue followed him in the other two most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
quallities of true nobillitie, so let your selfe
surmount them all in the third.</p>
            <p>The point desired, is, his great loue and zeale to the
Church &amp; house of God: which was such, as no scoffes
of wicked contemners could stay him from preferring
of the same: but by how much more he seemed as a
foole, and vaine in the sight of such, for so doing, by so
much more cared not he, to become more vile, &amp; low
in his owne eyes, if by such meanes, he might do good
thereto. Therefore if it might please your honor to
follow him in this, as you haue in the other: you shall
be sure that honour which he there speaketh off, will
follow you with great increase. And moreouer, then
shall that speech which good <hi>Abygall</hi> vsed vnto him
your noble patterne, take full effect in you. For the
Lord hath not onely promised to make my Lord a sure
house, because he is ready to helpe his noble <hi>Deborah</hi>
to fight the Lords battels, and because he is so faithfull
towards his annoynted, that no euill can be found in
him: but also for the third point, that which is much
more; euen the soule of my Lord shall be bound vp
<pb facs="tcp:9326:5"/>
in the bundle of life with the Lord your God, and the
soule of your enemies shall God cast out, as out of the
middle of a Sling.</p>
            <p>Thus, being euery way ouer bould with your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
patience, I craue pardon. I am no Scholler,
but a Draper: therefore not able to contriue my spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in such sort, as willingly I would. My trust is, your
honor will the rather pardon me, and accept the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my hart, and not weigh the rudenesse of my pen.
I was borne in <hi>Whitchurch;</hi> which, as I thinke, is one of
your honors principall Lordships: where my Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
haue of long time beene poore well willers vnto
your noble Progenitors, as at this present my eldest
brother there, and we the rest of his bretheren here in
London, are to your honorable selfe. These things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
together with your honorable inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
good things, made me bolde to make choise of
you, to be the patron of this my smal worke of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the enemy. I beseech your honor accept
thereof, according as the matter requireth, and not as
the skill of the writer deserueth. The matter is good,
though rudely handeled.</p>
            <p>That God, who is able to do both for your Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
selfe, and that vertuous Lady the Countice your
wife, far exceeding abundantly aboue al that I can aske
or thinke, giue vnto you both, all honour, with increase
thereof heere in this lyfe, and in the life to come, that
crowne of glory, which he hath prepared for all those
that loue and honoure him in Christ Iesus. <hi>Amen.</hi>

As some times God reuengeth sinnes, where men little

striketh, when sildome the strocken, consider whose hand it is,
