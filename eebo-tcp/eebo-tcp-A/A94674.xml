         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſo for Honour, as that they promoted the publick above themſelves, Eſtates, or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
inſomuch that their names, and ſucceſſours were truely honoured; who being in
exigencies, Anno 1642. the real Members at their motion were willing to extend
their aſſiſtance, by lending Moneys, Plate, Horſes, raiſing, and maintaining Forces,
as volunteers at their proper Charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The which free offering of the people was
ſo honoured by the God of heaven, that the effect thereof was, and now is the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

(as your Petitioners humbly concieve) untill the juſt, and real publick debts are paid, and are at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

to perform them by Aſſeſments vpon the Revenues, or waſte Lands, Diſcoveries, and forfeitures

where as your Petitioners in their zeal for the Honour of God, and the publick good, did extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the very firſt, and beyond their abilities, being Tradeſ-men (and having no moneys by reaſon
of bad trading) did joyn whole Towns, and divers perſons together, &amp; borrowed money upon intereſt:
And for example, to excite other Counties, Cities, and places, did lend in proportion 10. times more, than
the generality of the people did: But by the continued diſtractions by Wars at Sea, Trading hath been
ſo obſtructed, and your Petitioners ſo diſabled, by the Non-payment of the Debts, due upon the publick
faith (which they depended upon, as the beſt ſecurity in the Common-wealth, being ſo generally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed)
that it hath occaſioned the undoing of thouſands of perſons, and whole families of your
Petitioners; ſome are in priſon, ſome of Traders turned to work men, &amp; others relieved by Alms; &amp; all
impoveriſhed greatly by dammage by Intereſt, and loſſe of credit: Wherefore alſo, for that, as your
Petitioners were Leaders to incite others to lend, ſo they have not been wanting by their importunity
for them, to the ſeveral Repreſentatives for 13 years paſt, (beſides 15. weeks attending during this
preſent Seſſions,) and yet are wholly unpayed, (except by promiſes, and proviſions made by the little
Parliament.) Your Petitioners have expected, that theſe Conceptions would have come to a Birth of
performance before this time, having tendered their free ſervice to ſtate the Accompts at
<hi>Worceſter-houſe:</hi> But there they found Honour abroad, and ſelf-denial not at home, and love to the
publick thereby (for want of Lodging) ſo cold and feeble, that it could not act, nor open the door to
