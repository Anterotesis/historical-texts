            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE under-written <hi>Envoyée Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
of His moſt Sacred Majeſty
of <hi>Great Britain, &amp;c.</hi> having ſent
to the King His Maſter a certain
Book printed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and
Entituled, <hi>Succinct Remarks and Deductions made
by the Deputies of the</hi> Eſtates General <hi>of the</hi>
United Provinces, <hi>upon his laſt Memorial,</hi> and
approved by the ſaid Eſtates, and ordered by
them to be delivered by their <hi>Agent de Heyde</hi> to
the Miniſters of ſeveral Kings reſiding here,
and to be ſent to their Miniſters abroad with this
Direction and Inſtruction, pag. 3. <hi>To the End,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94181:3"/>
that they continue duly to inform thoſe Kings of the
foundation of the Alliance which this State hath
with them, and of the true State of Affairs; and
to the End that they do cauſe Their Majeſties to
comprehend the ſincerity of their Intentions and
Procedure.</hi> And His Majeſty having alſo been
informed, That the ſaid Book hath accordingly
been ſent and delivered, hath commanded him
His Miniſter to ſay thereupon, by way of <hi>Reply,</hi>
as followeth.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as to the bitter Invectives, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and foul and railing Language where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the ſaid Book is ſtuffed from the beginning
to the End; It is to be remarked, that it is an
uſual thing here (however ſtrange it may ſeem
elſewhere) to revenge themſelves in this kind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any with whom they have Diſputes. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reſolutions hath he ſeen of the <hi>Eſtates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
wherein the Subjects of other Princes having
addreſſed themſelves to the Kings their Maſters,
upon their juſt Complaints againſt the People of
this Country, and the ſaid Complaints thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
brought to them in their Name, and by their
Order, they have not contented themſelves with
the not doing them Juſtice, but fallen upon their
Perſons with railing Language, treating them
with the Title of Impudent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having
had lately a Diſpute with the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi>
a Prince of the Empire, they thought it not
enough to take the Sconce or Place in Queſtion,
but in their Letter to the Emperor of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>June 1664.</hi> and which was printed and ſold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94181:3"/>
here at the <hi>Hague,</hi> they treated the ſaid
Biſhop with the Titles and Characters of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, great Impudence, and that his humour
rendred him incompatible, if not to His own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
yet at leaſt to all His Neighbours:</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
'tis a practice very little to the reputation
or advantage of any that uſe it: Such as have a
good Cauſe in hand to plead, will not ſpoil it by
railing Language, which renders ſuſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is ſaid, as proceeding from Paſſion, and not
from Reaſon; but ſuch as have an ill one, when
they cannot anſwer <hi>ad Argumentum,</hi> they turn
themſelves <hi>ad Hominem:</hi> And as to himſelf, he is
not here as a particular Perſon, but as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of the King his Maſter: And he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to ſay, that there was not one word in his
ſaid Memorial, that paſſed the bounds and limits
either of his Orders, or of Civility, and good
Manners: And as whatever Evil Treatment by
Word or Deed is done to any publick Miniſter
reſiding in any Court in the Execution of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Inſtructions, is done to his Maſter, That
His Majeſty takes them all as ſaid againſt his own
Royal Perſon, Crown, and Dignity, and looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as a piece of Turciſm, and of the way of thoſe
of <hi>Algiers,</hi> where when any Diſpute ariſes between
them and any other Prince or State that hath a
Miniſter reſiding there, they ſometimes revenge
themſelves upon the Miniſter firſt, with reviling
Words, and then with blows; and the one is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as the other: Nor is the King Himſelf, His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the whole Nation in General, better
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94181:4"/>
treated therein than he; and is this the way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
matters? or is this a proper prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
and Introduction to that Extraordinary
Embaſſy from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England</hi> for that End?</p>
            <p>And as to the matter of the ſaid Book, page 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The Deputies endeavour to juſtifie the Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of the <hi>Eſtates General,</hi> in not communicating
to him their Reſolution, to which his laſt <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
was an Anſwer, upon this double ground;
Firſt, That if he the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary</hi>
would have had it, or any Copy of it, that he
ought to have ſent to their <hi>Secretary</hi> for it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>That it was not their intention to anſwer to
his</hi> Memorial, <hi>and that he had nothing to do with
that</hi> Reſolution. As to the firſt: Every Court hath
its Cuſtoms; and he doth declare, That to his
beſt remembrance in the many years he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
here, he never received any one <hi>Reſolution</hi> of
the <hi>Eſtates,</hi> but what was ſent to him by their
Agent <hi>de Heyde,</hi> or ſome other Officer of theirs;
and that having once for haſt ſent to their <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
for the Copy of a Paper that did concern him,
anſwer was made, That they could give none
till they had order; and that when they had
ſuch order it ſhould be ſent. As to the Second:
Was not the ſaid <hi>Reſolution</hi> Entituled, <hi>Extract
out of the Regiſter of the Reſolutions of the</hi> Eſtates
General, <hi>upon the</hi> Memorial <hi>of Sir</hi> George
Downing? And doth it not begin, <hi>Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated
by way of Reſumption upon the</hi> Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<hi>of Sir</hi> George Downing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And was not
the whole Body thereof, <hi>To make appear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94181:4"/>
of what had been by him alleadged in his
ſaid</hi> Memorial? And how is it then, <hi>That he had
nothing to do with it?</hi> Was he not here upon
the accompt of the King his Maſter, to do his
buſineſs, to maintain his Cauſe upon the accompt
of the Diſputes between him and this State?
And ſhall ſuch a <hi>Reſolution</hi> be Printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
and given to other Miniſters by them,
and can it be ſaid that he had nothing to do
with it? Whereas in truth he was the principal,
and concerned in the firſt place, and other
Miniſters only Secondarily; and that their
Communicating the ſame to them, and not to
him, lookt rather like a Surpriſal of them and
their Maſter, then otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>For what is further ſaid, page 6th, of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſtributed his <hi>Memorial,</hi> 'twas not he
but the King his Maſter that ſent it to other
King, and Princes: All he did was to give it
to ſome other Miniſters: And what is more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
and conſtantly practis'd, here and in
other Courts, then for publick Miniſters upon
occaſion to give one another Copies of their
<hi>Memorials</hi> and <hi>Papers?</hi> But this was not done till
it had been firſt given to the <hi>Eſtates General;</hi>
and they in printing and publiſhing their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
without delivering them to him or the
King his Maſter, did thereby break off all further
Treaty between him and them; and to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of the firſt, ſecond or third ranck makes
no difference as to this, they are alike ſent to
the State, and to deliver their Papers in the firſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94181:5"/>
place to them, and they theirs reciprocally to
the ſaid Miniſters; and when this Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
is broken off, it ceaſeth to be any
further a Negotiation or Treating, and becomes
a declaring againſt each other, and an appeal to
others thereupon. And ſo is this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Page the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. In anſwer to what he
had ſaid of his Majeſties having as a perpetual
mark of his kindneſs towards this Country,
ſuffered many antient pretences of his Subjects
to be blotted out, the <hi>Deputies</hi> are pleaſed to
ſay, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which there is to be conſidered, that
if this abolition of all antient pretences be a mark
of affection, the pretences of the Subjects of this
State, and of the State it ſelf, were much greater
in number and quality then thoſe of the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>(as appears by the LISTS exchanged on both ſides),
they deſired that all the Piratories done by</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal
<hi>Commiſſions ſhould have been forgotten,
and</hi> de facto <hi>your Lordſhips have testified ſo much
more affection then the King of</hi> England, <hi>for
that you have yielded more of your Right then
he; for that which ought to be principally conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
here is, that it will not be found that even before
the concluſion of the ſaid Treaty, any one</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Ship hath been taken by the Inhabitants of theſe
Provinces, or their Armes, which the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>could reclaim, as belonging really to them.</hi> Whereas
the ſaid LISTS of dammages did not conſiſt of,
or intermedle with, or contain in them any
thing that was blotted out by the ſaid Treaty,
but onely ſuch matters as were reſerved by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94181:5"/>
the ſame. And as to any thing pretended to be
done by <hi>Portugal</hi> Commiſſions, thoſe were alſo
all matters that had happened ſince the year
1654. and ſo alſo not mortified, but reſerved
by the ſaid Treaty. And how then do the
Deputies bring theſe two inſtances, as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that this State had forgiven more than his
Majeſty? And as to their third Argument, which
they call their main one, <hi>viz. That it will not be
found that even before the concluſion of the ſaid
Treaty, any one</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ship hath been taken by
the Inhabitants of theſe Provinces or their
Armes, which the</hi> Engliſh <hi>could reclaim as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
really to them:</hi> and which is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
page 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>For that the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<hi>cannot complain, that ſince that time (to
wit, the time of the General abolition) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the concluſion of the ſaid Treaty, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of theſe Provinces have taken any one
Ship Effectually belonging to Engliſh.</hi> What may
not be ſaid by them that will publiſh to the
World, deliver to foreign Miniſters here, and
cauſe to be delivered by their Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to Kings and Princes, a Paper with ſuch
an Affirmation as this? What, not one Ship
taken before the Treaty, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could
reclaim as belonging Effectually to them? Was
not the Ship <hi>Experience</hi> built in <hi>England!</hi> and
belonging wholly to <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Sailed wholly by
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> taken <hi>Anno 1660.</hi> upon the Coaſt of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> with her lading worth between four
and five Tun of Gold, by one <hi>Quaerts,</hi> and others
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94181:6"/>
of <hi>Zealand?</hi> Was not the Ship <hi>Charles,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Captain <hi>Spragg,</hi> and others his Majeſties
Subjects, and whereof he was Commander, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as ſhe was peaceably at an Anchor in the
Road of St <hi>Martins</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Caſtle, in the Month of <hi>July 1660,</hi>
by three Men of War of this State, and then
in their Service, Commanded by one Captain
<hi>Enno doedeſon Starre,</hi> and the men barbarouſly
treated? And ſo all that great Roll of Ships
ſpecified and ſet down in the LIST of the
Dammages of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> delivered by him
unto them, and all taken ſince the General
Abolition, and before the concluſion of the late
Treaty, and the Times and Places, and by whom
there particularly ſpecified? And is this (as is
ſaid pag. 3.) <hi>To inform duly the Kings their Allies
of the true Estate of Affairs between the King His
Maſter, and them?</hi> And have they not great
Reaſon to expect, That upon ſuch Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they ſhould break with the King his Maſter,
to joyn with them? Nor is it to be wondred,
ſince their Papers contain in them ſuch Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as theſe, that they paſs by the King His
Maſter, and Him His Miniſter, and give them no
Copies of them, and are ſo angry, that they take
any notice of them.</p>
            <p>For what is further ſaid, pag. 7, 8. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Liſts</hi> of <hi>Damages, That the</hi> Liſts <hi>were
exchanged in time convenient; that he the ſaid</hi>Envoyée <hi>had ſo much leſs Reaſon to complain upon
this accompt; for that their</hi> Lordſhips <hi>were ſooner
ready than he.</hi>

As to the firſt, The Treaty was concluded
upon the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September, 1662. St. Vet.</hi> and
the <hi>Liſts</hi> of <hi>Damages</hi> were not exchanged till
the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, 1664. St. Vet.</hi> which was near
two years after; and was that a convenient time
to be ſpent meerly for the giving in of what they
had to demand? or did it look like a deſire of
haſtning to a Concluſion, and determining thoſe
Matters that had been the Cauſe of ſo much ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
between the Nations?</p>
            <p>As to the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> their being ready
ſooner than Him, having ſeveral times by word
of Mouth earneſtly ſollicited the Exchange of
thoſe LISTS; upon the 11th. of <hi>September,
1663.</hi> Old St. he gave a <hi>Memorial</hi> to the <hi>States
General,</hi> wherein he declared, That he was
then ready on his part to exchange the ſaid
LISTS, aud did from time to time after preſs
the Exchange thereof, giving in alſo ſome
other Memorials to that End; and yet it was
near a year after, e're he could obtain the ſame:
And when about fourteen dayes before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
thereof the <hi>Agent de Heyde</hi> came to him
to ſpeak to him about the exchanging of them.
Which was the firſt Summons that ever he had
about that Matter; He returned for Anſwer, that
it had been ſo long ſince he had been ready, that
his Papers were neer muſty with lying by; that
he would look them out, and attend at the day
ſhould be appointed for the Exchange of them:
And when within a few dayes after, <hi>viz.</hi> upon
the 16th. day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he came to a conference
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94181:7"/>
with the Deputies, theirs was not yet ready,
for that they had it only in <hi>Dutch</hi> (whereas it
hath been a conſtant Cuſtom between them, as
with other Miniſters alſo, to deliver all Matters in
ſome common Language, or at leaſt a Copy.)
And ſo that meeting loſt, and the Exchange not
made till the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, as above-ſaid.</p>
            <p>Pag. 8, 9. The Deputies ſay, <hi>To purſue from
ſtep to ſtep the Text of the Treaty, immediatly after
the Exchange of the LISTS, and before the
ſpeaking of any accommodement, or deciſion of the
Matters therein, two things were to be examined:
First, Whether the Pretenſions ſet down therein,
were not more ancient than the times limited by the
ſaid Treaty? Secondly, Whether they were of ſuch a
Nature and Quality as may be thought fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to ſuch Arbitration? Whereupon, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
about this Matter, their Deputies made
only one Remark upon the</hi> Engliſh <hi>LIST, to wit,
upon a matter hapned in the</hi> Indies, <hi>and known at</hi>London, <hi>the</hi> 20th. <hi>of</hi> January, 1659. <hi>And it
was accordingly exchanged by him the ſaid</hi> Envoy,<hi>and in the preliminary Conferences, only theſe two
things could be conſidered: However, it pleaſed the
ſaid</hi> Envoy <hi>to proceed otherwiſe, imploying to no
purpoſe, in the examining matters, to the bottom, the
time in which the ſaid LISTS might have been
perfected, whereby it appears, That, if the ſaid
LISTS have not been perfected, the ſaid</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voye<hi>is the Cauſe thereof, and not your</hi> Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</p>
            <p>With their favour there is a third thing,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94181:7"/>
which by the Text of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article was alſo
to be conſidered in the Preliminary Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and which is the foundation of the other
two, <hi>viz.</hi> That they be ſuch matters as the one
Party hath ſuffered or can pretend to have
ſuffered from the other; nothing was to ſtand
in the LISTS, which, ſuppoſing the fact to be
true, could not yet be charged upon the other;
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> LIST was ſo carefully and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
penn'd, that the Deputies (as is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed)
made but one only Exception againſt
it, though the <hi>Eſtates</hi> had ſent it to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
to all the Admiralties, and to the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
and <hi>West India</hi> Companies, to be Examined and
conſidered. And he the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
had proceeded with that Frankneſs and
Candour, as to tell the Deputies at the time
he delivered the ſaid LIST, that that Article
was lyable to Exception; and that he ſhould not
have offered it, but that there were ſeveral
notable circumſtances that did wholly differ it
from others of the like Nature. And when in the
next Conference upon the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>O. St.</hi> the ſaid Deputies did demand to
have it Expunged, in the enſuing Conference
after, which was upon the 8th of <hi>November</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>O. St.</hi> he conſented thereunto; and
withall demanded of them if they had any
other Exception to make againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
LIST, to which they replyed, No: and then
aſked them whether the ſaid LIST was not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94181:8"/>
then fully agreed by them, to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
Yes.</p>
            <p>And whereas they do impute to him, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Remarques made by him upon their
LIST, that he ſhould have uſeleſly ſpent the
time in Examining matters to the bottom, he
went not beyond the three rules above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
but whereas ſuch care had been uſed in
the penning of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> LIST, as that but
onely one Exception could be made againſt the
ſame, as above-ſaid: the truth is, there were very
few Articles in theirs that were not lyable to
Exception by the ſaid rules. For Example, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
&amp;c. no time mentioned, whereby it could not
be diſtinguiſhed, whether they were matters that
happen'd within the time limited or not. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Articles the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
35<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 43<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 47<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 71, 72<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 73<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,
&amp;c. no perſon named that ſhould have done
the injuries there complained of; and ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
not whether thoſe matters had been
done by <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or other Nations; and <hi>de facto</hi>
in ſeveral Articles, the perſons named and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
againſt were no <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor had we
any thing to do with them, as Article 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,
20th, 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 68<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &amp;c. and ſo they might as well
have inſerted whatever Ships had been taken
from them by the <hi>Turks.</hi> And a notorious Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
call'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ryborn,</hi> who had no Commiſſion,
and who preyed indifferently upon all Nations,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94181:8"/>
having taken a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship near <hi>Cuba,</hi> and coming
therewith by accident to the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the
Governor there immediatly ſeized him, and clap'd
him and his Company in Irons as Pirats, and
ſent five of them in Irons to <hi>London,</hi> to be tryed
for their lives; ſet the <hi>Dutch</hi> men that he found
on board him at liberty, and reſtored them
their Ship, ſupplyed them freely with neceſſaries
for their Voyage out of his Majeſties Stores,
and gave the Maſter of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel money
to go to <hi>London</hi> to proſecute him, and provided
him with a Paſſage; and the ſaid Pirate is ſince
hang'd, and yet this is inſerted among others
to augment the number of their pretences.
And for the pretences of the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India</hi>
Company, he ſhewed that they were ſo far
from being of ſuch a Nature, as to be fit to be
referred to ſuch an Arbitrage by Commiſſioners
and Umpires, &amp;c. or to any Arbitrage, as that
in truth the very inſerting of them was a plain
and downright Mocquery and Deriſion of the
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> for Example, Article the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Whereas
<hi>Anno 1661.</hi> the <hi>States General,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt
India</hi> Company having given their Orders to
the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt India</hi> Company to receive poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Iſland of <hi>Poleron,</hi> (which of right
was theirs) and thereupon the ſaid Company
put themſelves to a great Expence in ſending
Shipping, Men, and all neceſſaries for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
and planting the ſame; they content
not themſelves with the Non-delivery thereof,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94181:9"/>
and their fruſtrating thereby all that Expence,
but here demand reparation for their going to
receive the ſame. So, Article the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
reparation from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe their
<hi>Eaſt India</hi> Fleets return every year round <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and becauſe they every year ſend a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
for the ſecuring of them. Whereas what
is this to the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> Do not other Ships alſo
that return in the Summer from other long
Voyages, by reaſon of the largeneſs of thoſe
Seas, and the length of the dayes, return that
way alſo? And do they not here conſtantly,
even in time of peace, grant Convoy to their
Shipping for the <hi>Baltick,</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and for
<hi>London</hi> it ſelf? and why do they not by the
ſame rule demand ſatisfaction from the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
for them alſo, and in the concluſion make them
bear their whole Naval Charge? If they think
fit to return that way, and to be at the Expence
of Convoyes for their Shipping, What is that
to the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> So Article the Seventh, They
ſay they command all their Ships outward bound
for the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> not to enter into any Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or caſt Anchor in any Road of <hi>England,</hi>
and demand ſatisfaction for the ſame from
the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They may if they pleaſe give ſuch
Orders to all their Shipping, and that as well
inward as outward bound, and by the ſame Rule
demand ſatisfaction for the ſame. Article the
Eighth they ſay. That while they were in War
with the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and kept ſome Ships
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94181:9"/>
before the ſaid place for the blocking of it up,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> notwithſtanding thereof did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Trade there. Is this a buſineſs to be
referr'd to ſuch, or to any Arbitrage? If the
<hi>Dutch</hi> be in War with any Country, and have
a few Ships Riding before a place, without
a Land Force to block up the ſame, Is it not
lawfull for <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Trade there? Yea in
<hi>Anno 1659.</hi> did not the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India</hi>
Company make ſatisfaction to the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt
India</hi> Company, for three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships that
they had then taken upon the accompt of
their having Traded at that place? Article
the Ninth, They ſay they had a Contract with
the Queen of <hi>Achin</hi> for the ſole buying of her
Pepper, and ſome other Commodities in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
places; and yet that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the ſaid places for the ſaid Commodities:
Whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were no Parties to the
ſaid Contract, and ſo not bound up therewith,
and conſequently no Action againſt them if they
did ſo Trade. Moreover, that there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Articles concerning Ships taken for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at His Majeſties Plantations contrary to
the Laws of His Kingdoms, and in the ſaid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
it is acknowledged that they did Trade there,
and that a great many of the ſaid Articles
were concerning matters which in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
themſelves they acknowledge to have
been ended between the parties themſelves,
and thereupon the money paid, yet therein
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94181:10"/>
revived, and payment again demanded for them
from the ſame Parties: And theſe, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
of the like Nature having been made by
him in the Conferences laſt mentioned, to this
day, he hath never ſince heard from them: And
how is it then that they are pleaſed to ſay, That
he the ſaid <hi>Envoyée Extraordinary,</hi> and not their
<hi>Lordſhips,</hi> hath been the cauſe the ſaid LISTS
are not perfected?</p>
            <p>Pag. 9, 10, &amp; 11. Concerning <hi>the Hopewell,
Leopard, Charles, James, Mary,</hi> &amp;c. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
ſay, <hi>That they were only hindred from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in certain places that were either formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
or blocked up by Sea; that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>can
demand no other Satifaction, but only for the loſs
of the profit of their Voyage, and ſo that theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
cannot be very conſiderable; that the</hi>Engliſh <hi>themſelves have done the like in ſeveral
rencounters, and that yet this</hi> State <hi>hath offered to
His Majeſty to ſatisfie the Perſons intereſſed, and to
make a Reglement for the future.</hi> Suppoſe the
Caſe as is here ſuggeſted, and as they put it, that
the places where thoſe Ships would have traded,
had been really, and <hi>bona fide,</hi> blocked up by
Sea, without being alſo blocked up by Land
(which they do not ſo much as pretend to affirm)
how freſh and pregnant are the Inſtances of
the practice of this State againſt ſuch a Maxim
as that?</p>
            <p>When the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had of late years a
great Number of Ships of War upon the Coaſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94181:10"/>
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and before the Town of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> for
the blocking of it up by Sea: and though he
had at that time a great Land Army in the
Bowels of that Kingdom, yet did they not ſend
their Men of War thither, and that not onely
to force their Trade, but alſo to take thoſe
Men of War of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the ſame? And when the late King of
<hi>Sweden</hi> did formerly beſiege the Town of
<hi>Dantzick</hi> with a great Fleet of Men of War,
and had alſo at the ſame time conſiderable
Land Forces in thoſe parts; yet did they not
ſend a Fleet from hence, and by force open
their Trade there? whereby they have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
let the World ſee how little they will
endure that Rule to be practiſed againſt them
which they impoſe upon others: and let it but be
taken for granted that they may thus do, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
all the Trade in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> or upon the
Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> or upon any of thoſe remote
parts, for any other Nation but themſelves.</p>
            <p>But with their favour, this is not the Caſe:
As to the <hi>Hopewel</hi> and <hi>Leopard;</hi> Hath it not been
made out in ſeveral Conferences, in the preſence
of the Directors of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company,
not only by authentick Copies of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Inſtructions of the Captains of the ſaid
Ships, the proteſts made by them, but under the
hand of the Commander in Chief of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet before <hi>Couchin,</hi> that the <hi>Hopewell</hi> was upon
her way from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Porca,</hi> and ſtopped in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94181:11"/>
the open Sea as ſhe was paſſing by <hi>Couchin</hi> to go
thither, and not ſuffered to purſue her Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
and that whereas the <hi>Leopard,</hi> being one
of his Majeſties own Ships, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
ſhe had to that Effect, came of her
own accord in her way to an Anchor before
<hi>Couchin,</hi> to acquaint the ſame Commander with
her deſign for <hi>Porca,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
then a ſetled Factory, to which the ſaid Ships
were conſigned; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> at neither of
thoſe times had either a Land Soldier within
the Kingdom of <hi>Porca,</hi> or a Man of War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Town, nor upon the whole Coaſt of
that Kingdome; that notwithſtanding thereof,
they were both ſtopped by him, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to purſue their Voyages thither. And
here (if the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary</hi> would
give himſelf the liberty) might he not juſtly
retort on them their railing and reviling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
for affirming, as is here affirmed, that they
were only hindred from Trading in places blocked
up by Sea?</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Charles, James,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> hath
it not been made out at ſeveral Conferences by
Authentick and undeniable proofs, that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they were hindred from Trade were
not beſieged or blocked up by Sea? but only
the <hi>Dutch Weſt India</hi> Company kept conſtantly
about <hi>Caſtle Delmina</hi> three or four Men of
War; who aſſoon as they heard that any Ship
belonging to <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or any other Nation, was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94181:11"/>
come upon that Coaſt for Trade, one or more of
them was ſent to ride before ſuch place where
they were to Trade, and then they muſt not
trade there becauſe it was a place block't up; and
if the ſaid Ship weighed Anchor to go to any other
place, then the ſaid Men of War weighed Anchor
alſo, and followed them to ſuch place, &amp; then they
muſt not Trade there neither, becauſe that was a
place block't up; and ſo from place to place. This
is the truth as to thoſe Ships, and yet they ſhot at,
and took their Boats with their ladings, wherever
they endeavoured to ſend them on ſhoare, taking
alſo the men priſoners; and in like manner ſhot at
the Boats or Canoes of the Natives, which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to come on board them; and this in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had neither Fort nor Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
and where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had not onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Trade, but ſetled Factories, and at pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where other Chriſtian Nations had their
Forts, and with whom we were in Amity, and had
a free Trade; as namely at <hi>Fredricksburgh</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Danes:</hi> and let them ſhew that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
have done the like to them in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Deputies ſay, that the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
could not be very great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince it was but the
hindring of ſome Ships from their Trade, and not
the taking of them. Is the defeating of ſo many
Ships of <hi>Eaſt India</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Voyages a ſmall
matter? Yet this is not the main, but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
hereof, which was no leſs then the utter
overthrow of the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade in thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94181:12"/>
parts. For if the ſaid Companies might upon ſuch
pretences as theſe are, defeat ſuch Ships as were
ſent thither, of their Voyages, without making
good and juſt ſatisfaction, who would adventure
any more, or to what purpoſe? And what might
then <hi>France</hi> expect of their new <hi>Eaſt India</hi> &amp; <hi>Weſt
India</hi> Companies, but that their Ships return as
theſe with their Empty Holds, Proviſion ſpent,
Tackle worn out, Mens wages to pay over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and yet the moſt Chriſtian King muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
by this <hi>State</hi> even to break with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
becauſe of his oppoſing theſe miſchievous
practiſes.</p>
            <p>And as to what they ſay that ſatisfaction was
offer'd, 'tis true, that after many Memorials, long
and tedious Conferences, and many Months de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies,
ſeeing His Majeſty and His Parliament: net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and alarm'd in the higheſt degree with theſe
and orher the Inſolencies of the Subjects of this
State, they do in their Reſolutions of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>June</hi> laſt, New Stile, promiſe, that they would ſo
direct matters as that ſatisfaction ſhould be made;
but nothing followed thereupon. And whereas
they would impute the cauſe thereof to the want
of ſome Body to purſue it on the behalf of the
perſons intereſſed, did not he the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> from
day to day with all vehemence and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
continue to preſs them in their Name and on
their behalf? and yet what doth their Reſolution
of the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> ſay more then their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?
And whereas the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the late
Treaty requires expreſly, that ſatisfaction be made
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94181:12"/>
within 12 months for all matters on this ſide the
<hi>Cape de Boneſperance,</hi> that ſhould have happen'd
after the concluſion of the ſaid Treaty, the ſaid 12
Months did expire, and nothing done, Complaint
having been made by <hi>Memorial,</hi> concerning the
Ships <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> on the 17th. of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1663. Old Stile,</hi> concerning the Ships <hi>Hope-well</hi>
and <hi>Leopard</hi> on <hi>November 7.</hi> following,
and concerning the Ship <hi>Mary</hi> on <hi>February 16.</hi> of
the year 1663. <hi>Old St.</hi> and yet to this day no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
given, whereby the Treaty broke;
and in the mean while, daily new Complaints;
the <hi>Hope-well</hi> hindred in a ſecond Voyage to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi>
the <hi>Samſon, Hopefull-Adventure, Speed-well,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Bartwick</hi>'s Ship, and in a word,
every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that went to trade upon the
Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> that they could maſter, in like
manner defeated in their Voyage, as the <hi>Charles,
James,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and not ſo much as Satisfaction
promiſed for any of thoſe; and which is above
all to be remarked, That whereas we had been ſo
long held in Expectation of our mony, now at
laſt inſtead thereof, it is added in the afore-ſaid
Reſolution, <hi>That the Caſe is diſputable;</hi> ſo that we
were now further off our payment then in the
beginning of the Summer; or, if it had been
given Us, (which it is not) yet being done in
this manner, that is to ſay, not as of Juſtice and
due, but only as out of particular Courteſie
and Complaisance to His Majeſty for that time,
What would it have avail'd us? The <hi>Dutch East-India</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94181:13"/>
Company did in the year 1659. make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the <hi>Poſtilion, Frederick, Francis,</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> (as above-ſaid) taken upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of their having traded to <hi>Bantam,</hi> then
block't up by Sea by them; and there was added
in the Treaty concerning thoſe Matters, <hi>That
the two Nations ſhould for the future rencounter
one another with all peaceableneſs and perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
as well within the</hi> Eaſt-Indies <hi>as elſewhere.</hi>
Yet ſo great is the advantage that the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
have made by practices of this kind, as
notwithſtanding the ſaid ſatisfaction and promiſe
of the State they have continued ever ſince to
do the like (as appears by the many Complaints
of this kind of the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſpecified in the <hi>Engliſt LIST</hi> of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)</hi>
for that by hindring other Nations from
trading, they inforce the Natives to compact with
them for the whole Product of their Countries;
and ſo though they do make ſatisfaction for the
particular Ships ſtopped, yet they thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
infinite Gainers; and then not ſuffering
any Nation to Trade there, becauſe they ſay,
they have agreed for the whole. Nor hath their
preſent Grandeur ariſen ſo much from their
Meſnage, or any thing of that kind, as from
theſe violent and indirect Means: And if theſe
things were practiſed by the ſaid Companies,
while diſowned and diſcouraged by the <hi>State,</hi> and
promiſe made that the like ſhould not be done
for the future, What was now to be expected
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94181:13"/>
from them when it was ſaid by the State, that it
was diſputable whether they might not do ſo?
yea, in the <hi>Dutch Liſt</hi> of <hi>Damages,</hi> as above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
ſatisfaction demanded from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
for having traded in Places block'd up by them
by Sea (as they call it?) And thus whereas this
Diſpute had hitherto been only between the
Companies of each ſide, it was now become a
Diſpute immediatly between his Majeſty, and
this <hi>State,</hi> they patrocinating and maintaining
what the ſaid Companies had done: And do not
the Deputies ſay in this Book, pag. the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>That
Theſe Pretenſions are not ſo clear, but that they may
be diſputed?</hi> And pag. 18. they ſay, <hi>We do avow,
and We do maintain, that it might be done.</hi> And
thereby all hopes of any quiet Trade, or good
Underſtanding in thoſe Parts for the future ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
cut off; and not only ſo, but what Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
nearer home? Do not the Deputies ſay in
pag. 17. <hi>That which is juſt in the Indies, cannot
be unjuſt in</hi> Europe? And is not that a fair Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all the Kings of Chriſtendom, to let them
know what they are in time to expect in theſe
Parts alſo? that is to ſay, to be handled by thoſe
of this Country, as their ſaid Companies now
handle the Kings of the <hi>Indies;</hi> to be told, that
unleſs they will ſell them the whole product of
their Countries, they ſhall ſell them to no body, and
to have Fleets plac'd upon their Coaſts for the
effecting thereof? And as to what is ſaid of their
having proffered a Reglement for the future, he
refers to what is ſaid by him concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his <hi>Reply</hi> to pag. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94181:14"/>
And as to what is ſaid, pag. 11. concerning
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Envoyée Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
could wiſh, that with what ever Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
the Deputies had pleaſed to treat him,
that they had been more ſparing as to them.
They ſay there, <hi>That the Propoſition which the
Parliament made to His Majeſty, was, That He ought
to attacque this</hi> State, <hi>and to make War upon
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Houſes of Parliament (as is known
to all that underſtand the Government of that
Kingdom) are they to whom the People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
do ordinarily in great greivances addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and it is their Natural way for relief;
and the ſaid Houſes upon ſuch Complaints, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tranſact or treat with any Forraign Prince or
State, (that being the Prerogative of the Crown)
and ſo humbly applyed to His Majeſty, That he
would be pleaſed to interpoſe, for the obtaining
ſatisfaction in thoſe numerous and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
but as to the attacquing of this <hi>State,</hi>
or making War with them, that there is not a
word of any ſuch matter in the ſaid Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but it hereby appears, what is in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
ſenſe attacquing of this <hi>State, viz.</hi> Let
never ſo many Injuries be done by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Country to others, if after never
ſo many years patience, and utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for obtaining ſatisfaction in an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
way, ſerious and real Conſideration be
at laſt had for obtaining the ſame, This is
attacquing them, and becoming an Aggreſſour;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94181:14"/>
and they are pleaſed to add as to the Reaſon
and Ground thereof, <hi>It muſt neceſſarily be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that this Propoſition proceeded from an insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
appetite, that they had to raviſh the Goods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and from a depraved</hi> Guſto, <hi>that they found
in the Taking, Robbing, and Depraedation of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of theſe Provinces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very uncharitable conſtruction, and ſuch a
one as none but the Deputies of this State would
ever have made. Suppoſe never ſo much to be
taken from the People of this <hi>Country,</hi> What Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
could the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> have
thereby, or what could they expect by a <hi>War</hi> as to
their own particular Accounts, but only to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributors
largely with the reſt of the Kingdome
out of their own Fortunes towards the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thereof, as if one would take the Liberty
of Retorting, might it not be ſaid, and with much
more Reaſon, that the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies</hi>
of this Country, durſt not preſume to do as
they do, but becauſe ſo great a part, at leaſt, of the
Governours thereof are concerned in them, and
that it ariſeth from the ſame ground, that it is
ſo difficult, and almoſt an impoſſible thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Juſtice and Satisfaction for any Injury
done by them, be the Caſe never ſo Clear and
Evident.</p>
            <p>For what is further ſaid, in page 11. <hi>The ſaid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
Declares poſſitively, that he hath Order from the
King His Maſter, to aſſure this State, that His Majesty
will not permit that His Subjects do Attaque or Surprize
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94181:15"/>
as Sea the Ships of the Inhabitants of theſe Provinces;
And that the King would do them no hurt till he had
Advertiſed them by a Formal and Preallable Declaration
of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, he doth Reply, that he cannot but
wonder that the Deputies do Affirm, that he doth
Declare thus much, the words of his Memorial
being as followeth; <hi>That the King his Maſter did
the laſt Spring (to take away from them all Umbrage,
which might cauſe any Extraordinary Equipping at that
time) give him Order to Aſſure them (as he then did
in a Publique Conference with their Deputies) That
His Majeſty would not trouble or hinder their Fleets,
which they then expected out of the</hi> Streights, <hi>and the</hi>Eaſt-Indies, <hi>nor thoſe then at the Fiſheries upon His
Coaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And was not all that made good to them to a
puncto, and is it not a very ill requital for ſo
franck and ſeaſonable a Declaration as that was
at that time, (and which the King His Maſter
was no way obliged to make to them) and which
was made good, thus to miſrecite his Words?</p>
            <p>For the Juſtification of the Extraordinary
Equipage in theſe Parts the laſt Summer, the
Deputies ſay, page 11, and 12. <hi>They Take, they
ſtop in the Havens of</hi> England, <hi>and Confiſcate with
their Merchandizes the Ships of this Country by Expreſs
Order of the King, and yet cry out againſt their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
though but ſmall, and ſuch as had been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made; So that it was impoſſible that the ſaid
Equipage could give any Umbrage to the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> Great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94181:15"/>
Brittain, <hi>Eſpecially after they had aſſured His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
by their Letter of the Twenty fourth of</hi> July, <hi>that
their Reall Intention and Conſtant Reſolution was to do
no hurt to His Subjects, and that it would be fitting
not to ſuffer that the ſaid Fleets ſhould go off their
Reſpective Coaſts, and Havens, and that the King ſaid
to the Ambaſſadour of this State, in the Audience He
had about this Matter, That His Majeſty would let
Him know His Mind concerning this Matter in Three
Dayes in Writing, which yet he hath not done to this
day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be Remarked, that they here Alledge
the Taking, Stopping, and Confiſcating of the
Ships and Goods of this Country in theſe Parts,
for a ground to Juſtifie the late Extraordinary
Equipage; Whereas that Equipage was Ordered
and Equipped in the beginning of the Summer,
and the Taking, and Stopping of the ſaid Ships
was not till <hi>November</hi> following, nor any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated
till <hi>February</hi> after: And as to what they
ſay that that Equipage was but very ſmall, and
that they had formerly made the like; Did they
not reſolve in the beginning of Summer to
Equippe Thirty of their Capital Ships over and
above their Fleet under <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> and ſuch as
were fitted out for the Convoy of their <hi>East-India</hi>
Ships, and what for <hi>Guiny?</hi> And was this
a ſmall Equipage? And were not hundreds of
Carpenters ſent on a ſuddaine to work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
ſparing (as is ſaid in his Memorial) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Holy Day, nor Work a Day, Moon-light,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94181:16"/>
nor Sun-light, as if it had been upon the moſt
Preſſing and Urgent Neceſſity that could have
fallen out; and this in a time when they had no
Diſpute with any other Nation that could give
any imaginable Occaſion or Pretenſe for the
ſame; Nor had the King His Maſter, at that
time above Seven or Eight Men of Warr in
theſe Seas, nor any further Equipage in hand;
And he had Declared in His Anſwer to His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which was well known here, that He
would yet Endeavour the Accommodating of
Matters with this State in an Amicable way,
and give Orders to him His Miniſter to that
Effect: And how can it then be here ſaid, <hi>That
it was impoſſible that this Equipage could give any Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
to His Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, how was it poſſible, but
that it ſhould give him the utmoſt Umbrage, it
being very well known that their Lordſhips are
too good <hi>Meſnagers</hi> to put themſelves to ſuch
an Extraordinary Expence <hi>in a Frolick,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome proportionable Deſign, and to be ſure
ſuch Deſign could not be with Reflection upon
any other then himſelf.</p>
            <p>And as to the Letter to His Majeſty above
mentioned, they do here Confeſſe, page 12, and
13. (as was Alledged by him in his ſaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall)
That they had one Fleet Actually out
and gone to His Majeſties Coaſts at the time of
the Writing of that Letter, and ſo would have
been out of that Engagement, and it was as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94181:16"/>
Numerous as that of His Majeſties, for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof within Doors they were ſo So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous.
And whereas they ſay; <hi>That this</hi>
State <hi>had no other Fleet at Sea that was Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Act, for that thoſe that they had at Sea
were onely Destinated for the Convoy accuſtomed
to be ſent every Year for their Fleet out of the</hi>
Eaſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>It is not uſual to ſend every year ſuch a <hi>Fleet</hi> as
that for the convoying home of their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> men,
and there is not one Word in the ſaid Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that <hi>Fleet,</hi> much leſs to aſſure him of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and intention thereof, and why they <hi>umbraged</hi>
as His Majeſties having Sixteen or Seventeen Men of
War together in the <hi>Downs,</hi> His own Port, and
where he is wont ordinarily, even in times of the
greateſt Quiet, to have as many for the Honour and
Grandent of His Kingdom; and he in the mean
while not <hi>umbraged</hi> at their ſending as many upon
His Coaſts, when they had alſo at the ſame time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Conſiderable <hi>Fleet</hi> in Readineſs at Home;
And ſuppoſe they had aſſured His Majeſty in their
ſaid Letter to Him, with all the Fine Words Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
that this <hi>Fleet</hi> had been onely Deſtinated
for the Convoy of their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, had they
not in like manner aſſured Him when they ſent <hi>De
Ruſter</hi> into the <hi>Streights,</hi> that he was Deſtinated only
againſt the Pirates of <hi>Algiers</hi> and thoſe Parts; and
yet it was after found that he was capable to Act elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and upon other accompts; And if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
about what time thoſe Orders muſt have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94181:17"/>
been ſent to him: It will appear that his going to
<hi>Guiny,</hi> muſt have been in Deſign and Agitation
about the very time of the delivery of this Letter
to His Majeſty, for that He received them about
the beginning of <hi>September, New Stile.</hi> And at
the ſame time they had alſo in Agitation the
Preparing of another <hi>Fleet,</hi> under the Notion of
ſending thither, which alſo was out of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
in the ſaid Letter, and yet the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
would have it thought that the <hi>States</hi> had
Proceeded with ſuch Incomparable and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable
Candour and Frankneſſe towards His
Majeſty in Relation to theſe Matters; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in Truth, all their Overtures to Him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Diſpoſitions of <hi>Fleets,</hi> had Deſigns
and Catches with them. And on the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
His Majeſty to ſhew His Reall, Peaceable
Intentions, had from the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
about theſe Equipages, Earneſtly preſſed
that the ſame might not be, and that no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Equipage upon either ſide ſhould be
made, for that then to be ſure there could not
be any thing of ill Ren-counter, Surprize or
Jealouſie.</p>
            <p>And as to what they ſay, Page the Thirteenth,
<hi>That they did pay them off ſo ſoon as their</hi> Eaſt-India
<hi>Fleet was Arrived.</hi> Was not <hi>Tromp</hi> (Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that <hi>Fleet)</hi> and others of them after the
Arrival of their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, Re-victualled and
ſent to joyn with their Lievtenant Admiral <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
before the <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> and continued with him
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94181:17"/>
a long time after. And as to what is ſaid or
His Majeſties having promiſed to give them
His Anſwer in Writing in Three Days, It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
hereby how Exact their Lordſhips are in
taking notice of, and Expecting the Fulfilling
of whatſoever is ſaid to them, even to the leaſt
Circumſtance and Puncto, and to take Advantage
thereupon. It were well if ſuch Miniſters as
Reſide here, could obtain in many Months, that
which often times is promiſed to be given them
in a few days; but if they Pleaſe to Examine
firſt the Memorial of the Ambaſſadour of This
<hi>State</hi> to His Majeſty of the 11/31 th. of <hi>July</hi> laſt,
They will find it therein ſaid, that His Majeſty
had even then by Word of Mouth given him
His Anſwer as to this point, the VVords being;
<hi>That his Majeſty had been Pleaſed to Anſwer upon
the First Point Touching the Keeping of the</hi> Fleet
<hi>from going to Sea, that the Numbers which were Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Prepared on His Majeſties Side were no way
Extraordinary, but onely for Common and Cuſtomary
Uſe, and without Deſigne of bringing any Dammage
and Inconvenience upon the Inhabitants of the</hi> United
Provinces, <hi>and that though they did goe out, that He
would give ſuch Order to the Chief Commander
thereof, that this</hi> State <hi>ſhould have no cauſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
any Sinister Encounters from the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon the Fifth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following,
His Majeſty gave the ſaid Ambaſſadour an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
in VVriting to the like Effect; And how
is it then here affirmed, <hi>That His Majeſty hath
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94181:18"/>
not to this day made known to their Ambaſſadour
in Writing His intention concerning this Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may it not Juſtly be ſaid, that he that
was the Penner of this Book, was either very
little acquainted with hath paſſed between
His Majeſty and this <hi>State,</hi> or very ill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>
            <p>For, VVhat follows, Page the Thirteenth,<hi>Hereby may be Judged, the Candour and Sincerity of
the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>for that before the time of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiping
(which they would have to be thought the
Immediate Cauſe of the Violences they have done,
the King of</hi> England) <hi>had already given Order
to Attacque, and take by Force the Places and Forts
belonging to this</hi> State, <hi>ſo that in ſerving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of this Pretext, for the Covering of their
manifest Violences, they give themſelves inſenſibly
into a Ridiculous Contradiction, producing for an
Effect, that which had its being a long time before
its Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to how farr His Majeſty is from being
lyable to be Charged or Blamed upon the
Accompt of any of theſe Matters, appears by
what follows, where they are Treated of at
Large; but as to the Purpoſe, for which they
are here Produced, <hi>viz.</hi> As if they had been
made a Foundation, for what had been done
afterwards by His Majeſty here in <hi>Europe;</hi> If
it had been ſo, it had indeed been very Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
but all the uſe that is made by Him
in His Memorial of that Extraordinary Equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94181:18"/>
was to ſhew that they did thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
His Majeſty to Arme alſo, the Words
being Page the Fifth; <hi>Seeing himſelf Menaced
with theſe Equipages, which could not be but with
regard to the KING Himſelf, was at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
(though very contrary to His Inclinations)
to Arme Alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So they might alſo have ſaved the Labour of
ſaying afterward, Page the Thirteenth and
Fourteenth; <hi>It cannot be ſaid theſe Orders were
given becauſe of the Equipage made in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or becauſe of the Voyage of</hi> De Ruyter <hi>to the
Coaſt of</hi> Africa, <hi>ſeeing they were Executed before
the ſaid Equippage was made here, and long before
the Voyage of</hi> De Ruyter.</p>
            <p>He was not ſo Ridiculous as to make that
which had hapned after, to be the Cauſe of
what had been done ſeveral Months before,
and when, and where, and by ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as could have no manner of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof; Nor was ever the ſaid Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
or <hi>De Ruyter</hi>'s going to <hi>Guiny,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for the Juſtifying of what was done
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there; and therefore one
would think ſome more Grounded Occaſion
at leaſt ſhould have been found out, if
they had had a minde to take to themſelves
the Liberty of falling upon the whole <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Nation with ſuch Reproachful and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful
Language, and which it may be is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94181:19"/>
not elſwhere to be found, no not upon
the Realleſt of Occaſions to have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by any State to a Nation in General;
And to ſay no more, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
better from this Country and State,
and what if it ſhould be Retorted.</p>
            <q>Hereby may one Judge of the Candour
and Sincerity of the Hollanders, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Page the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
Concerning the Ship St. <hi>Jacob,</hi> Laden
at <hi>Gottenburgh</hi> and bound for <hi>England,</hi> the
Deputies are pleaſed to ſay;</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſaid Envoy hath the Impudence
to ſay, that This State are the Aggreſſors in
<hi>Europe,</hi> for that they Stopped in their Ports a
Certain Ship which came from <hi>Sweden</hi> Laden
with Masts. That which he ſaith is ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
and the Reaſon wherewith he backs
it ſo Impertinent, that none but Sir <hi>George
Downing</hi> would have affirmed the one or made
uſe of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Seeing the Ship concerning the
stopping whereof he complains was of <hi>Gotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi>
What had he the ſaid Envoy to do to
Intermeddle therein?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:94181:19"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This State had Defended the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting
out of the Country of all ſorts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
ſerving for the Equipping of Ships, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Publication of theſe Defences, this Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Ship of <hi>Gottenburgh</hi> hapning to be in one of

that She had a Particular Permiſſion from the States
to go out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Liberty was granted Her to go
out, and it depended onely upon them to be
gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That during the being of this Ship in

            <p>As to the Firſt with your Favour; He is
not the onely Perſon, or the Firſt that Affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to be the Firſt Aggreſſors in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and that among other Reaſons upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt

given to His Parliament in the Month of
<hi>November,</hi> and therein among other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
alleadged the buſineſs of this Ship; So
that 'tis His Majeſty upon whom theſe Incivil

            <p>As to the Second, The ſaid Ship was Laden
upon the Accompt of one Sir <hi>William Warren</hi> an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> man and Merchant of <hi>London,</hi> and
Bound for <hi>England;</hi> and thoſe of the ſaid Ship
with whom the ſaid Lading was Intruſted, did
apply themſelves to him the ſaid Envoy upon
her ſtop for his aſſiſtance for the obtaining of
her Releaſment, as well as to the Miniſter of
<hi>Sweaden</hi> upon the accompt that ſhe came from
<hi>Gottenburgh,</hi> and the Maſter a Burger of that
Town; And can it then be doubted; whether
he the ſaid Envoy Extraordinary had to do
with the Buſineſs or not, or did he need Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation
from <hi>Sweaden,</hi> or was it Intermedling
with the Intereſts of another Crown, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Releaſement of a Ship Laden upon the
Accompt of His Majeſties Subjects and Bound
for <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the Third, Their Defence was
againſt the Tranſporting of ſuch kind of Goods
if Laden and taken in this Country, but this
Caſe was quite otherwiſe, for that this was a
Ship which was driven in by much foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ſhe had met withall at Sea, and ſo not
in the leaſt within the Compaſs or Queſtion
of the ſaid defence, nor lyable by the Treaty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94181:20"/>
between His Majeſty and this State to any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation
or ſearch; There are many ſorts of
Commodities that are prohibited by the Laws of
<hi>England</hi> to be imported into that Kingdome or
exported out of the ſame by the People of this
Country; yet ſuch ſhips as are onely driven in
thither by ſtorme, or other neceſſity, and do not
break Bulk, are not, nor cannot be queſtioned
thereupon; and that is this Caſe, and ſo that
the Defence aforeſaid cannot in the leaſt juſtifie
the ſtopping and detaining this ſhip.</p>
            <p>As to the Fourth, The Maſter and Others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with the Lading of the ſaid ſhip, were
here ſolliciting at the time, of the granting the
Order for her Releaſement, and went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
away therewith, but coming to their
ſhip, and preparing to ſet ſayle, they were not
ſuffered ſo to do, but threatned to be ſhot at, and
ſo were forced to return back to the <hi>Hague</hi>
again.</p>
            <p>As to the Fifth, It is not here confeſſed, that
while that Ship was in this Country, they had
Adviſe of the Stopping, and Taking of their
Ships in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo there needs no more
then this their own Confeſſion, to prove who
firſt began to ſtop Ships in <hi>Europe;</hi> And what
though ſhe were afterwards ſet at Liberty?
The Rupture was begun, and then there were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94181:21"/>
other things alſo to be Remedied as well as
that.</p>
            <p>And as to what is ſaid, Page the Sixteenth,
concerning the Confiſcating of their Ships;
There was no Ship Confiſcated or Condemned
in <hi>England,</hi> till the firſt of <hi>February, Old Stile,</hi>
which was long after the Newes was Arrived
at <hi>London,</hi> of <hi>De Ruyters</hi> having Seized all the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Ships that he had met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
to a conſiderable Number and Value, and
having actually broken Bulk, and taken out
their Ladings, and Appropriated them to the
<hi>Dutch Weſt-India Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the Reglement for the future,
the Deputies ſay, Page Seventeen, <hi>The ſaid
Envoy knows that they were alwayes ready to go
about the making of a Generall Reglement, and
Treaty Marine, but that he did alwayes excuſe it, and
alwayes Declare, when he was Summoned to Confer
about this Matter, that he had no Order concerning
the ſame, but onely to ſtick to the Termes of his
Project.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this he doth Reply, that the Diſcourſe
concerning this Matter aroſe in Conferences
with the Deputies of this State about ſeveral
Injuries done to the <hi>Engliſh East-India,</hi> and
<hi>African</hi> Companies, by the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi>
Companies of this Country, that thereupon for
Prevention of the like for the Future, His
Majeſty did Command him to tender to this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94181:21"/>
State a Concept of a Reglement, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he did; Nor are there wanting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of particular Tranſactions of that kind
before, between <hi>England</hi> and this Country, and
many things are proper for thoſe Remote
Parts which are not applicable nearer Home;
That he did daily preſſe the State for their
Anſwer thereupon, both by Word of Mouth,
and in ſeverall Memorialls given in by him
from time to time to that Effect: But as to
what they ſay, that he was Summoned to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
about the ſame, he doth utterly deny it,
much more that he ſhould have refuſed the
coming to Conference about thoſe Matters;
nor did he, ever Declare that his Orders were
to abide onely by the Terms of the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
nor ever any ſuch thing Imagined or
Intended, but onely that the ſaid Concept
ſhould be a Ground-Work to work upon, and
that they might make their Exceptions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and that there ſhould be added thereto,
or taken there-from, as ſhould appear reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and fitting upon debate; but that he could
never make the leaſt-advance therein, nor
ever had (as is ſaid in his Memorial) one
word of Anſwer from them concerning this
matter.</p>
            <p>As to the near Twenty Ships that he had
affirmed in his Memoriall to have been taken
in few years before the Concluſion of the late
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94181:22"/>
Treaty upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> only by the
<hi>West-India</hi> Company of this Country, they ſay
in the Seventeenth page, <hi>That they are imaginary,
as well as that he ſaith of the Evil Treatments
done to the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>Exaggerating them to the
Terms of a</hi> Romance, <hi>with which he muſt have his
Fancy Working at the time he Penn'd that Article,
he doth wrong to the Truth when he ſpeaks after
that manner;</hi> Very ſevere cenſures if Juſtly
Charged. Was not the Ship <hi>Brother-Hood</hi> of
<hi>London</hi> taken upon the Coaſt of <hi>Guiny</hi> in the

called the <hi>Amſterdam</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> whereof <hi>Aaron
Couzens</hi> was Commander; beſides ſeveral others
taken by them there and elſe-where: And how is
it then that they ſay, that thoſe ſhips were but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,
and it appears (by the reſpective times of
their being taken above cited) that theſe were all
matters of a freſh date; and ſuch as are not blotted
out, but reſerved by the late Treaty. And as to the
evil treatments and Cruelties complained of by
him the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> to have been done to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
in thoſe Parts, they are pleaſed to ſay of them
alſo that they are imaginary, and would make the
World believe that all that was but <hi>Romances</hi> of
his inventing; whereas the Depoſitions taken and
ſworn in the <hi>High Court of Admiralty of England,</hi> the
<hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, 1662.</hi> concerning the Ship <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

Van Huyſen <hi>(General for the</hi> Weſt-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<hi>of this Country) where ſeveral of them famiſhed
to death, and the reſt that were ſet at Liberty after a cruel
Impriſonment, the moſt of them never ſince heard of;
The Company of the Ship</hi> Paragon <hi>after like cruel Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94181:24"/>
turn'd to ſhift for themſelves amongſt the
Wild Beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Company of the Ship <hi>Brother-Hood,</hi> having
been ſtript and plundred of all, turn'd on ſhore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Wild Natives,</hi> about <hi>Cape Lopez,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing of relief or ſuſtenance, where ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of them periſhed for want; and had it not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God, that after their having been there in a
miſerable condition 20 dayes, a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ship, called the <hi>Happy Fortune,</hi> whereof one <hi>James
Peperel</hi> was Maſter, came thither accidentally, in
which they obtained paſſage, the reſt had periſhed
alſo, nor had it ſo much as been known what had
become of them.</p>
            <p>The Company of the ſhip <hi>Black-Boy</hi> carried to
<hi>Caſtel-Delmina,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Colours</hi> with ſcorn and
contempt trampled under-foot, the men miſerably
treated, ſo as that the Maſter and ſix of the ſaid
<hi>Company</hi> died (as was verily believed of poiſon) the
reſt turn'd on ſhore to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Company of the Ship <hi>Brazil Frigot,</hi> nine of
them turn'd upon a ſhore that was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited,
and no victuals to relieve them, very
few cloaths to cover them (as appears by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
taken in the ſaid <hi>High Court of Admiralty,</hi>
the <hi>16th.</hi> day of <hi>April, 1663.)</hi> and much more of
this kind could he inſtance, done within theſe few
years upon the ſame Coaſt, beſides what elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
all tranſmitted to him the ſaid <hi>Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
under the Oaths of many of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
themſelves that felt them, to whom, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94181:24"/>
reſt of their Comrades, the ſaid evil treatments,
and cruelties, were more then Imaginations and
Romances.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay further, Page the 17th.<hi>We have never heard of thoſe pretended Cruelties and
Barbariſms, nor hath ſo much as Complaint been ever
made, that the</hi> Weſt-India <hi>Company had taken any one
ship that had truly belonged to the</hi> Engliſh.</p>
            <p>He did acquaint the Deputies for the Affairs of
<hi>England</hi> (by whom this Book is Compil'd) with
theſe Cruelties in the Conferences held with
them concerning the Liſts of Damages, and the
ſaid Ships are all particularly mentioned and ſet
down in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liſt, ſo long ſince delivered by
him to them; How is it then that they here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Ignorance of the one and the other? And
whereas, as to the Ships they would Evade under
the Notion of the Words, <hi>Truly belonging to the</hi>
Engliſh.</p>
            <p>This is a very Excellent and eaſy <hi>Evaſion,</hi> and
upon this accompt their Companies may take
what they pleaſe from Us, and it is but for them
to affirm, <hi>That it did not truly belong to the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
            <p>Thoſe many Families of His Majeſties Subjects
at <hi>London</hi> and elſwhere that felt thoſe Loſſes, and
many of which are thereby utterly ruined and
Banckrupt are Living and too true Monuments to
whom the ſaid Ships did belong. And if they
could clear themſelves upon ſo eaſie a Score,
VVhy is it that we have been kept off theſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94181:25"/>
two years and a half ſince the Concluſion of the
Late Treaty? So as that we have not yet been
able to come ſo farr, as to begin to make out ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Propriety therein, or the value of the
Damages ſuſtained thereby: And whereas theſe
Suggeſtions are no doubt brought them from their
Companies, it may not be amiſs here to put the
Deputies in minde with what Confidence it was
Affirmed and Maintained by the Directors of
the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company before them, that the
<hi>Hope-well</hi> and <hi>Leopard</hi> were deſigned for <hi>Couchin,</hi>
a place then Beſeiged both by Land and Sea, and
not to <hi>Porca</hi> which was not Block't up by Land nor
Sea; and yet when it came to the Scanning of
thoſe Matters, he the ſaid Envoy made out under
the very hand of the Commander in chief of thoſe
Ships that ſtopt them in their Voyage, that he
ſtopt them from going to <hi>Porca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what they ſay further, Page the 17th. <hi>We
know not to what purpoſe the ſaid Envoy ſpeaks of thoſe
ſaid near Twenty Ships.</hi> The purpoſe was very
clearly ſet down in his <hi>Memorial, viz.</hi> That
whereas all the Complaints that were Mentioned
in the Reſolution of the Eſtates-General, to which
it was an Anſwer (as to what out of <hi>Europe)</hi> were
only of matters pretended to be done againſt the
<hi>Weſt-India Company,</hi> thereby to ſhew what great
Reaſon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had to be offended with them,
and to be the more ſenſible of the Injuries done to
them ſince the concluſion of the Late Treaty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how they had from time to time been
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94181:25"/>
handled by thoſe of that <hi>Company</hi> before the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, having in a few years ſpace (as ſaid)
taken near Twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships in thoſe Parts
only, and not only no ſatisfaction given for the
ſaid Ships, but new Injuries heaped upon them,
and the ſame Deſignes carried on, to the utter
Ruine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>And whereas Page the 18th. the Deputies
would excuſe what had been done by the ſaid
Company ſince the concluſion of the ſaid Treaty;
for that ſay they, Firſt, <hi>He confeſſeth Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that ſince the Concluſion of the Late Treaty, there
hath not been one</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ship taken.</hi> Secondly,<hi>That all that hath been done is, that they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
the</hi> Engliſh <hi>to enter into Places Aſſeiged by the
Armes of this State, or Blocked up by Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo that that could not Juſtifie what had
been done by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt Them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidering the Reſolutions of the Fifth of <hi>June</hi>
and Twenty fifth of <hi>September,</hi> wherein they had
declared that they would cauſe Satisfaction to be
made to the Perſons concerned in the Ships, <hi>Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
Leopard, Charles, James,</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaid or confeſſed, that no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship had been
taken ſince the Concluſion of the Late Treaty,
and the contrary is acknowledged Page the
Twenty ſeventh of this very Book; But that
which was ſaid in his <hi>Memorial,</hi> was onely that
thoſe of the <hi>West-India</hi> Company had not taken
any in thoſe Parts of <hi>Affrica</hi> ſince the concluſion
of the Late Treaty; And as to their Pretences,
that what they had done as to the hindring of our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94181:26"/>
Ships from Trading there, was onely in places
Beſieged, and that they had promiſed Satisfaction;
Theſe Allegations and Excuſes have been ſo Fully
anſwered before, that it were but miſpence of time
to ſay any more concerning them, but as to that
which was the force of his Argument, they
Anſwer not at all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Queſtion
was not about the <hi>Charles, James,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>
onely, but that what was done to them, was in
like manner done to Every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that
came upon thoſe Coaſts by Men of War, kept
there on purpoſe to that End; Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
that what was done to them had not
been upon ſome accidental Rencounter, but
upon Deſign, and that this Practice was as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Pernicious and Deſtructive to the Trade
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as the Taking of their Ships, and
more diſcouraging to the Merchant (as hath been
afore-ſhewen) and ſo that either ſome Courſe
muſt be taken by His Majeſty, not onely for
the obtaining of ſatisfaction for thoſe Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Ships, but for the Securing in General of
the Trade of His Subjects in thoſe Parts, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
that they muſt give it quite over.</p>
            <p>Page the Ninteenth, They ſay that he ſhould
have ſaid in His <hi>Memorial; That one muſt not
doubt of the Truth of all he ſaith concerning theſe
Pretended Hinderances of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>from Trade
and Evil Treatments of them; for that the ſame
doth appear by the Complaints he had Order from
time to time to make to this State concerning the
ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94181:26"/>
The Deputies deal here with him as in other parts
of their Book, miſrecite the words of his <hi>Memorial,</hi>
and then deſcant upon them after <hi>their faſhion;</hi> the
words thereof were not, <hi>For the ſame doth appear,</hi> &amp;c.
nor did it ever enter into his imagination, that his
<hi>bare affirmation</hi> ſhould be taken for a juridical proof:
but his words are, <hi>As it doth appear by the Complaints,</hi>
&amp;c. That is to ſay, taking them as they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Examinations upon Oath of the
Maſters and other Officers of the ſaid Ships, and
which were alſo by him produced to the ſaid Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with other authentick Documents, which were
juridical proofs: &amp; ſo might it not juſtly be ſaid, that
thoſe matters were made appear by him in his
Complaints concerning the ſame? And what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
given for all thoſe reviling expreſſions which
they are pleaſed here to make uſe of? But whereas
they ſay, <hi>If the Complaints of Sir</hi> George Downing
<hi>could ſerve for juridical proofs, the Inhabitants of theſe
Provinces had long ago deſerved the treatment which they
have received from the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and the hoſtilities which
have been committed against them had been eaſily juſtified.</hi>
If then by this Reply it ſhall appear (as it will)
that nothing was complained of by him, but what
was upon good and real ground; it follows by the
Deputies own confeſſion, that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> is juſtified
in what hath been done againſt the people of this
Country, and that he hath had ſufficient ground
and reaſon for the doing thereof.</p>
            <p>Page the 19, Concerning the Remonſtrance or
Declaration of <hi>Valckenburgh,</hi> they ſay, <hi>The 14 of</hi>Auguſt <hi>laſt, the ſaid</hi> Envoy <hi>preſented a</hi> Memorial <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94181:27"/>
the ſame ſubject, upon which this</hi> State <hi>made a
very conſiderable anſwer the 8 of</hi> October <hi>following; ſo
that he is in the wrong to ſay, that ſatisfaction hath not
been given him. It is therein ſaid, that</hi> Valckenburgh,<hi>Director General for the</hi> Weſt-India <hi>Company upon the
coaſt of</hi> Guiny, <hi>doth not conclude in his Declaration to
cauſe all other Nations to be gone out of all thoſe Quarters.</hi>'Twas not ſaid by him in his <hi>Memorial,</hi> that they
had given him no anſwer, but, <hi>That a Remonſtrance or
Declaration had been publiſhed as well in the name of the</hi>States General, <hi>as of the ſaid</hi> Company; <hi>wherein was
deduced their claim and pretended right to all that whole
coaſt, to the excluſion of all other Nations.</hi> And that,<hi>The ſaid Declaration was not yet diſavowed, nor ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
given thereupon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hath not ſuch a Declaration been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
And did not he the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> give this <hi>State</hi> a
Copy thereof at their deſire? And can they ſay,
that in the forementioned anſwer it is diſavowed?
And could it be call'd, giving us ſatisfaction, that
when we complain that a Remonſtrance is iſſued
out by a Governour-General, and that not only in
the name of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company, but in the
name, and on the behalf of the Eſtates General
themſelves, claiming a whole Country wherein we
have conſiderable Forts, Lodges and Factories, and
a conſiderable Trade; and which Remonſtrance had
been formerly ſent and notified by the ſaid <hi>Valcken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
to the chief Agent of the <hi>Engliſh African-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
at their principal Fort, to tell us, that he doth not
therein conclude to bid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be gone? What
though he had not therein bid us be gone out of any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94181:27"/>
place? is not ſuch a claim, and the notifying thereof,
a great injury, and which His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to complain on, and to expect ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed
by the <hi>State,</hi> whereby his Subjects might be
put out of apprehenſion of being diſturbed in their
quiet and peaceable poſſeſſions and Trade? But he
doth in the ſaid Remonſtrance, not only claim the
whole, but therein actually commands the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
to be immediately gone out of <hi>Tacorari</hi> and <hi>Cabo
Corſo,</hi> two places in which they had not only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Trade, but ſetled Factories, at the very time of
the iſſuing out the ſaid Remonſtrance (as is therein
confeſſed) and acknowledged by him the ſaid
<hi>Valckenburgh)</hi> and not only commanded them out
of them, but upon thoſe very grounds and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon which he therein claimed the whole.
And the Deputies will have it thought, that the
<hi>State</hi> hath given them ſatisfaction, when they ſay
in their deduction aforeſaid, <hi>That it doth not conclude
to cauſe all other Nations to be gone out of all thoſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
So far from diſavowing their pretended right
to the whole, or the commanding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
out of thoſe two Factories and places, as
that they will have it to be judged abundant ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to them, that they have time given them to
diſlodge by degrees, firſt out of thoſe places, <hi>and not
at once</hi> commanded <hi>to be gone out of all thoſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is to be remarked, that the ſaid <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi>
was iſſued out the 7 of <hi>June, 1663.</hi> and ſo long
after the concluſion of the late Treaty; whereby it
appears, that ſince the concluſion thereof, His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:94181:28"/>
Subjects were not onely diſturb'd at Sea, by
the Shipping of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>-Company, under the
Command, and by the Orders of the ſaid <hi>Valcken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
their General; but alſo the whole Country
claimed from them, and actually commanded to
quit immediately two of their ſetled and principal
<hi>Factories.</hi> And for what they ſay that Captain
<hi>Holmes</hi> ſhould have ſent to one <hi>Henry Williamſon Cop,
That Captain</hi> Holmes <hi>had ſent three perſons of condition
to one</hi> Henry Williamſon Cop <hi>that commanded at</hi>
Cape Verd <hi>for the Weſt-India-Company, who ſaid to him
from</hi> Holmes, <hi>that he had expreſs Order from the King
his Master to let all know, that the right of Trading upon
the coaſt of</hi> Africa, <hi>from</hi> Cape Verd <hi>to the Cape of</hi> Bona
Eſperanza, <hi>belonged to him onely, to the excluſion of all
other Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhew this State a formal <hi>Writing,</hi> and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
which may fall, and which may poſſibly not
be well remembred, or miſtaken, or ſtretched beyond
the intent and meaning of them that ſaid them. And
ſo was this Caſe: yet what a mighty buſineſs did
this <hi>State</hi> make hereof! writing a <hi>Letter</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to his <hi>Majestie</hi> expreſly about it, and cauſing
their <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> to complain highly thereof in an
<hi>Audience</hi> demanded for that effect. If we ſhould
make ſuch ado about all the high words and threats
in thoſe parts, and in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and elſewhere,
of thoſe employed by the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West-India</hi>-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;
we ſhould be able to do little elſe. Beſides,
thoſe diſcourſes are here acknowledged to have been
upon the 12 of <hi>March 1661.</hi> and ſo, long before
the concluſion of the late <hi>Treaty,</hi> and ſo upon which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94181:28"/>
the <hi>Deputies</hi> cannot juſtifie any thing done by them
ſince: whereas this <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of <hi>Val<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kenburgh</hi>
was, as aboveſaid, long after the concluſion of the
ſaid <hi>Treaty,</hi> and ſo a new <hi>Breach:</hi> and above all, it is
to be remarked, that the <hi>Deputies</hi> do here confeſs,
That whatever it was that ſhould have been ſaid by
<hi>Holmes,</hi> or his order, that it was immediately upon
complaint, as aforeſaid, diſavowed by his <hi>Majestie,</hi>
as is here acknowledged, page the 20. <hi>which their
Lordſhips having repreſented to the King of</hi> Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>as well by their Letter of the 28 of</hi> July 1662, <hi>as
by word of Mouth by their Ambaſſadours Extraordinary
which were then at</hi> London; <hi>His Majeſtie diſavowed that
Action of</hi> Holmes, <hi>in his Anſwer of the 24 of</hi> Auguſt
<hi>of the ſame year.</hi> And ſo ſuppoſe ſuch words had
been ſpoken, and that ſince the laſt <hi>Treaty,</hi> yet they
would have been ſo far from being to be imputed to
his <hi>Majestie,</hi> or to be made uſe of for the juſtifying
of any <hi>Hoſtilities</hi> againſt his Subjects, as that on the
contrary, this <hi>State</hi> had all the reaſon in the world to
be highly ſatisfied with his <hi>Majeſties</hi> generous and
frank proceeding therein; and themſelves thereby
ſo much the more condemned, that when ſuch a
<hi>Remonſtrance</hi> publiſhed in their Name, and which a
freſh breach, being ſince the concluſion of the late
<hi>Treaty;</hi> and having been preſſed ſo often, and for
ſo long time together concerning the ſame, that yet
to this day it is not diſavowed by them: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we are told that we ought to take it for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that what is therein declared, was not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
at once: yea, the <hi>Deputies</hi> will not admit that
there was therein ſo much as an offenſive word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:94181:29"/>
And for what is ſaid of <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s <hi>Paper,</hi> page the
21. that could not have cauſed <hi>Valckenburgh</hi>'s <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,</hi>
for that it was written after, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
thereunto; putting him in minde alſo of many
outragious hoſtile actions done by him againſt the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> deſiring they might quietly continue in
their <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Factories,</hi> and telling him that they
had more reaſon to bid him quit places he poſſeſſed,
then he them, for that he did at that very time poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
ſeveral places which did of Right belong to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> mentioning the ſame, and particularly <hi>Cabo
Corſo;</hi> and ſo that if they muſt come to diſlodging,
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had more reaſon to expect that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould diſlodge, then they the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page the 21, 22, 23, 24. concerning the buſineſs
of the King of <hi>Fantine,</hi> they ſay, firſt, <hi>That he the
ſaid Envoy hath never produced any proofs.</hi> Secondly,
<hi>That he doth not adde any particularities or circumſtances
that can give the leaſt colour or appearance of truth thereto.</hi>
What he gave them, was out of an <hi>Original Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
taken in the high Court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and ſent him by ſpecial Order of the <hi>King</hi> his
Maſter, with command to acquaint the <hi>State</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
and how is it them they are pleaſed to ſay,
that he hath given them no proofs, or out of a <hi>meer
looſe Paper?</hi> Nor was what he gave them (as they
are pleas'd to call it, pag. 23.) <hi>The ſaying of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
onely,</hi> but atteſted alſo by one <hi>Dobſon,</hi> a principal
perſon in thoſe parts: and what ground then, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for all theſe moſt injurious and reproachful
terms which they are pleaſed upon this occaſion to
laviſh out withal, and ſpend a couple of leaves of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94181:29"/>
paper upon, ſuch as no man would give to his
Foot-man? and might they not be retorted in the
higheſt manner, if one took pleaſure in ſullying his
Mouth or Pen?</p>
            <p>And as to the Second: Had there indeed been no
circumſtances to make good the intention of ſuch a
Deſigne, it might have paſſed like the Stories writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to them by their Officers in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> of
the deſignes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to beſiege <hi>Batavia,</hi> (which
are ridiculous in the very imagination of them.)
But could there be more pregnant circumſtances
then thoſe ſuggeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> did
actually pay down to the <hi>Natives</hi> a ſum of money
for their encouragement? Secondly, That they did
furniſh them with ſtore of Muskets and Powder
from <hi>Aga;</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having notice of, ſent
Souldiers to a certain Village thereby, who <hi>(de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto)</hi>
did ſurpriſe a part of them, and bring them to
<hi>Cormantine.</hi> Thirdly, That the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were to block it up by Sea, while attacqued by
the <hi>Natives</hi> by Land, and that accordingly two of
their Ships were actually upon their way, and come
as far as <hi>Cabo Corſo</hi> in order thereunto; but that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the failer of the deſigne of the <hi>Fantiners,</hi> they
immediately returned.</p>
            <p>Page the 24, 25, 26, 27. concerning the buſineſs
of <hi>Cabo Corſo,</hi> they ſay,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That it was attacqued and taken, not by any
rencounter that happened in thoſe parts, and which might
have provoked Captain</hi> Holmes <hi>to thoſe violences; but by
expreſs Order of the King of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own Confeſsion and Declaration.</hi> Secondly,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94181:30"/>
               <hi>That the Engliſh have not pretended that</hi> Cabo Corſo <hi>did
belong unto them, but ſince that they had carried their
Arms thither, and ſince that they have taken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, he hath expreſs and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Orders</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter to declare,
That his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> did never avow or ſay that he had
given Orders to <hi>Holmes</hi> for the taking of that place:
That in his Anſwer of the 5th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt given
in writing to the <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> of this <hi>State,</hi> there is
this following Clauſe: <hi>Concerning Captain</hi> Holmes,
<hi>We have with great ſincerity aſſured the ſaid Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
that he had no Commiſsion to take</hi> Cape Verd,
<hi>nor any other place belonging to the Dutch, or to do any
act of Hoſtility upon any of the Subjects of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
that was not for the defence of Our Subjects, and
their Trade in thoſe parts.</hi> That all he ever ſaid to the
ſaid Ambaſſadour concerning <hi>Cabo Corſo,</hi> was, that
he looked upon the Caſe as to that place, to be very
much differing from that of <hi>Cabo Verd;</hi> and ſo
much, as that if he had given Order for the taking
thereof, very much might have been ſaid for the
juſtification thereof. And to the like effect doth
he the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary</hi> ſpeak in his <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial:</hi>
That ſuppoſe his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> hath permitted his
Subjects to endeavour to recover the poſſeſſion
thereof, it could not be thought ſtrange, not could
this <hi>State</hi> have had any juſt cauſe of Complaint or
Grievance threat: for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had not onely a
bare liberty of <hi>Trading,</hi> or of having a <hi>Factory</hi> at
that place, (as at ſeveral others upon that Coaſt)
but one <hi>Thomas Criſpe,</hi> chief Agent for the <hi>Engliſh
Guiny</hi>-Company, at the earneſt invitation of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94181:30"/>
King of <hi>Fetu,</hi> whoſe Land that was, went thither
about the end of the year 1649. and purchaſed the
ſame of the ſaid King, and paid for it: And after
all things were concluded, the Kings Officers ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
all the Natives thereof by the beat of Drum,
both men, women and children, to a very great
number; and when they were all come together,
publike and ſolemn <hi>Proclamation</hi> was then and there
made, That the King of <hi>Fetu,</hi> with the conſent of
his <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Great Men,</hi> had ſold the Land of
<hi>Cabo Corſo</hi> to him the ſaid <hi>Criſpe.</hi> Whereupon the
people gave ſeveral great ſhouts, throwing the
duſt up into the air, and cryed, that that was
<hi>Criſpe</hi>'s Land. And the ſaid <hi>Criſpe</hi> is yet alive, and
now at <hi>London,</hi> and hath by ſpecial Order of the
<hi>King</hi> his Maſter ſent to him the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> the
Contents hereof under his own Hand, with the
Teſtimony of others that were then in thoſe parts,
and know the ſame to be true. And ſome time
after, a party of the Natives of that Country
falling upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſe there, and robbing
and plundering the ſame, and ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
for the preſent, the <hi>Swedes</hi> came thither, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed
what had been there built by them, and
built a Fort upon the ground which the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had purchaſed. Afterwards the <hi>Danes</hi> drove out
the <hi>Swedes,</hi> during the late War between thoſe
Crowns; and then the <hi>Dutch</hi> got the place from
the <hi>Danes.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Dutch</hi> deriving from the
<hi>Danes,</hi> can have no better Title then the <hi>Danes;</hi>
and the <hi>Danes</hi> deriving from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> can have
no better Title then that of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94181:31"/>
onely Poſſeſſion, and having built upon the Land
of another without their conſent; and ſo the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is ſingly, Whether the Land ſhould follow
the Fort or Houſe, or the Houſe the Land; and
whether a Poſſeſſion of ſo late a date, can create
a Title againſt a clear and undoubted Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay, page 26, <hi>That they had
bought that Fort from the Danes;</hi> It is very well
known, That the Miniſters of <hi>Denmark</hi> do ſay and
maintain, that the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>-Company of this
Country did nevery buy them out, but onely that
during the late Siege of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and in the time
of the low eſtate of that Kingdom, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour-General
for the Dutch <hi>Weſt-India</hi>-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
called <hi>Van Huyſen,</hi> did debauch and corrupt
one <hi>Samuel Smith,</hi> (who then commanded the
ſaid place for the King of <hi>Denmark)</hi> to put the
ſame into his hands for a Bribe of ſeven or eight
thouſand <hi>Gilders:</hi> And that this was without the
knowledge, permiſſion, or order of the ſaid <hi>King.</hi>
And this is their Title to this place, about which
they make ſo much ado. Nor did they content
themſelves with the ſaid Fort, but (as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places) having once got footing, they fell
immediately to the utter expelling of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
from all ſhare or intereſt there: And whereas
they had re-built themſelves a Houſe or <hi>Factory</hi>
there, ſome belonging to the Dutch <hi>Weſt-India</hi>-Company,
and in their Service, did on the firſt
of <hi>May 1659.</hi> attacque the ſame, and burn it,
with all the Moveables and Merchandizes. And
it being afterwards re-built by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94181:31"/>
hired others to ſet upon it, and burnt it again,
with all the Merchandizes therein; nor would ſo
much as permit them to come and trade there
with their Shipping. And the ſaid <hi>Deputies</hi> Rule
is, page 7, <hi>That one may retake by Arms, that which
hath been gained by Arms.</hi> But this Caſe had been
otherwiſe: for the <hi>Dutch</hi> having got into the ſaid
Fort in manner aboveſaid, were a little after dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out by one <hi>Jan Claes,</hi> who was General for the
Natives; and the ſaid <hi>Claes</hi> having driven them out,
and knowing well that the undoubted Right of
that place did belong to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their <hi>Agent</hi> in thoſe parts to reſtore the ſame
to them: but he was neither provided at that time
with men, nor other neceſſaries for the receiving
thereof; and before they came to him from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the ſaid <hi>Jan Claes</hi> died. Afterwards, (and
while the <hi>Dutch</hi> were ſtill out of the poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
the Government of that Country ſent a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>Minister</hi> to <hi>Cormantine,</hi> to treat with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Agent</hi> there, about putting of the ſaid place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into their hands: and a <hi>Treaty</hi> was perfected
and compleated between the Governour of <hi>Fetu,</hi>
and Commiſſioners ſent thither by the ſaid <hi>Agent,</hi>
and a ſum of money paid in hand according to the
ſaid Conditions. Nor was there ſo much as any
certain knowledge in <hi>England</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had
re-poſſeſſed themſelves thereof, at the time when
<hi>Holmes</hi> his Orders and Inſtructions were made, nor
other News thereof then a report which came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that time out of this Country. And ſuppoſing
it to be true, yet that could not alter ſuch a <hi>Treaty</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:94181:32"/>
made while out of their hands: and that Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus, if his <hi>Majestie</hi> had given him ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
what could they have to ſay againſt the ſame?
And whereas it had been ſaid by him in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial,</hi>
that his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> had been ſo much the
more juſtifiable in letting his Subjects take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereof, becauſe of the little effect that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
made here in his Name in other matters had
had: The <hi>Deputies</hi> are pleaſed to miſ-recite the
clauſe in his <hi>Memorial,</hi> and then deſcant thereupon
<hi>after their faſhion.</hi> The Clauſe (as recited by them)
is, <hi>For ſeeing that his Majeſtie hath not been able by
all endeavours and inſtances to get out of their hands
one Ship, or the value of a peny of Goods ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his Kingdom; what hope was there that ſuch a
place ſhould have been reſtored?</hi> And they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to comment thereupon: <hi>This is a ſtrange confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the ſaid</hi> Envoy, <hi>to put in writing, and to
publiſh among forraign Princes and Ministers, and to
preſent to your</hi> Aſſembly <hi>a thing, of the contrary
whereof he hath been ſo convinced by the Deduction which
ye made the</hi> 9th of October <hi>last, upon the King of</hi>
Great Britain'<hi>s Anſwer in Writing; where your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
have made clearly appear, by the reſtitution of the
Ship</hi> Handmaid, <hi>and of the Shaloup taken by Captain</hi>
Banckert, <hi>and by ſeveral other particularities, That
what the ſaid</hi> Envoy <hi>ſaith here, is not true: ſo that he
might have ſpared the giving occaſion to have himſelf
contradicted here.</hi> Whereas the words of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi>
are, <hi>And in truth if his Majeſtie hath not
been able, by all his endeavours and inſtances, to get
out of their hands any one Ship, or the value of a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94181:32"/>
peny of Goods ſince his return to his Kingdoms, which
had been taken by violence from his Subjects, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which he the ſaid</hi> Envoy <hi>had made complaint
heretofore; what hopes that ſuch a place would have
been restored?</hi> But their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> leave out all the
middle thereof, <hi>viz. Which had been taken by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
from his Subjects, concerning which he the ſaid</hi>
Envoy <hi>had made complaint heretofore,</hi> whereby the
ſenſe is quite changed; and then apply inſtances
thereto, which would no wayes ſute therewith,
taking the intire ſentence together. For as to
the Ship <hi>Hand maid,</hi> it is true, that that buſineſs
did paſs his hands, but that Ship had not been
<hi>taken by violence from the Subjects of His Majesty:</hi>
The <hi>Turks</hi> had taken her from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
the <hi>Dutch</hi> only reſcued her from the <hi>Turks.</hi> And
as to the Shaloup taken by <hi>Banckert,</hi> 'twas not
a matter whereof <hi>the ſaid</hi> Envoy <hi>had made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,</hi>
for that it was a buſineſs managed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
by His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Miniſters there, though there
was ſcarce another inſtance of that kinde that
paſſed not his hands; and he doth here again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the truth of the ſaid Clauſe in his ſaid <hi>Memorial.</hi>
Whereas in the Letter of the <hi>States,</hi> of the 26 of
<hi>January 1664.</hi> to the King his Maſter, their
words are, <hi>That His Majeſty had very often cauſed
juſtice to be done upon their complaints, ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the</hi> Treaty <hi>between him and this State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>ſecond:</hi> Did not the Agent <hi>Selwyn,</hi> in
his letter above-mentioned to <hi>Valckenburgh,</hi> of the
14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>June, 1663.</hi> remonſtrate the right of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to that place, and proteſt againſt the detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94181:33"/>
the ſame from them? And did not he the ſaid
<hi>Envoy</hi> Extraordinary, in a conference held with the
Deputies of this <hi>State,</hi> upon the 12 of <hi>Feb. 1663.
Old ſtile,</hi> deduce and make out the right of the
<hi>Engliſh African</hi>-Company to that place? and it was
not taken by <hi>Holmes</hi> till the 9 of <hi>May</hi> following (as
is here confeſſed, Page the 24.) And how is it then,
that they ſay here, <hi>That the Engliſh did not claim it till
they had got the poſſeſsion of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas Page the 25 they ſay, <hi>He himſelf
did interpoſe in the ſaid difference between the</hi> Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia-<hi>Company
of this Country, and the</hi> African-<hi>Company
of</hi> Denmark, <hi>concerning this place, as he hath often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled
with ſeveral matters, wherein neither He, nor
the King his Maſter, had to do: And in the</hi> Memorial
<hi>which he preſented concerning this matter, he backs
the pretenſions of the</hi> Danes, <hi>and ſpeaks not at all of
thoſe of the</hi> Engliſh; <hi>from whence an infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be drawn, That the King of</hi> England <hi>(whom
he brings in ſpeaking in his</hi> Memorial) <hi>did not at that

before made appear in the Letter of <hi>Selwyn</hi>
above mentioned: and the Conference aforeſaid,
wherein he the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> had made out the right
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the ſaid place, was but within
three or four dayes after the date of this <hi>Memorial.</hi>
And whereas they ſay, <hi>That he doth therein back the
pretenſions of the</hi> Danes, <hi>and ſpeaks not at all of thoſe of
Engliſh;</hi> Are not the words of the ſaid <hi>Memorial,
That his Majesty holds himſelf obliged to intermeddle
therein with the ſame zeal and fervour, and to the ſame
degree, as for the injuries done to himſelf and his own
Subjects in the ſame parts, and by the ſame Company?</hi>
And whereas they are pleaſed to ſay, <hi>As he hath
often meddled in ſeveral matters, wherein neither He
nor the King his Maſter had to do;</hi> They would
thereby inſinuate, as if the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
had of his own head given in that <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi>
whereas it was in purſuance of a Letter
from the King his Maſter to him, expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him to do it, and of which he knew
nothing, till it was put into his hands by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nybal
Scheſtedt, High Treaſurer of Denmark,</hi> who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94181:34"/>
had procured the ſame, and brought it out of
<hi>England</hi> with him. And to what is there ſaid,
<hi>That the King his Master hath nothing to do therein,</hi>
they know better; and that (as is ſaid in the ſaid
<hi>Memorial)</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is obliged by all the bonds
of Honour, Friendſhip, Blood, Gratitude and
<hi>Treaty,</hi> to interpoſe himſelf in the concerns of
that King.</p>
            <p>Page the 27 and 28. Concerning the Iſland
of <hi>Polerone,</hi> their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> make no reply to what
hath been ſaid in his <hi>Memorial, viz. That the ſaid
place ought to have been restored to the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>by
vertue of a ſolemn</hi> Treaty <hi>in the year 1623, and yet
we know not to this day that it is reſtored.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no anſwer in ſuch a caſe was the beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
and it is to be obſerved, that by the ſaid
<hi>Treaty</hi> it was ſtipulated, not only that the ſaid
Iſland ſhould have been reſtored, but the words
thereof are, <hi>That the ſame ſhould be reſtored in the
ſame eſtate and condition the</hi> Engliſh <hi>had formerly
injoyed it.</hi> Whereas it was not only not reſtored,
but thoſe of the <hi>East-India</hi>-Company did cut
down, and grub up by the roots all the Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg-trees
and Plants in the ſaid Iſland, and have
done the like ſeveral times ſince; whereby in
caſe it ſhould at any time come to be reſtored,
it ſhould be (at leaſt for many years) altogether
uſeleſs and unprofitable to them.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Treaty</hi> of 1654. they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the ſaid Iſland was adjudged to be
reſtored to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the ſentence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
on both ſides appointed by that <hi>Treaty;</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:94181:34"/>
but ſay, that Orders were then accordingly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the receiving the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
thereof, and ſo that if they had it not,
they had none to blame but themſelves: but
if giving Orders here in <hi>Europe</hi> were enough,
we had had it long before. And I pray, had
not the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi>-Company again in the
year 1660, Orders both from the <hi>Eſtates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi>-Company, both to
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Governour-General in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
to the Governour of the <hi>Banda</hi> Iſlands (of which
that is one) for the delivery of poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to them, and of which he the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi>
Extraordinary hath Copies by him? but yet
when the ſaid Company had put themſelves to
between twenty and thirty thouſand pounds
<hi>ſterling</hi> Charge, in ſending Men and Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
accordingly for the receiving the ſame, and
the ſaid Orders were tendered to the ſaid Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour-General,
together with His <hi>Majeſties</hi>
Commiſſion to the like effect, he laught at them;
nor would give them any Order to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>Banda</hi>-Iſlands for the delivery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
notwithſtanding to take off all pretence of
failer on their part, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> continued their
Voyage from <hi>Batavia</hi> to <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erone,</hi> and did there
demand the ſaid Iſland, with their Letters to
the Governour and Council over the <hi>Banda</hi>-Iſlands;
but anſwer was made them, that they
ſhould not have it, and Souldiers were drawn
up along the ſhore, and they were let know, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94181:35"/>
if they offered to come on ſhore they would fire
at them.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid, page the 28, <hi>That
the Revolution which happened in</hi> England <hi>by the
Re-eſtabliſhment of his Majeſty, did ſo change af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
that what had been only ſtipulated in the name
of</hi> Protector <hi>could not be any further executed; that
there muſt be another Adjuſtment made with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
before new Orders could be given for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
thereof.</hi> And ſo would upon that
accompt excuſe the non-rendition thereof, till
the concluſion of the <hi>Treaty</hi> in the year 1662.
Whereas thoſe Letters were written about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
months after the Return of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to
his Kingdoms; and in that of the <hi>Eſtates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>to the Governour and Council of the <hi>Banda-</hi>Iſlands,
there is expreſs mention and reference
made to the aforeſaid Award of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners:
The Letter being to this effect: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Governours and Directors of the</hi> Engliſh
Eaſt-India<hi>-Company are now intended to go and
take poſſeſsion of the Iſland of</hi> Polerone, <hi>ſo we have
found it expedient by theſe preſents, to write unto
you, that according to the Award given up by the
Commiſsioners on both ſides, thoſe who ſhall come to
appear from the aforeſaid</hi> Engliſh <hi>Company with due
Authority and Qualifications in the Iſlands of</hi>Banda, <hi>ye ſhall give place, and deliver over the
aforeſaid Iſland of</hi> Polerone. <hi>Whereupon we rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>&amp;c. <hi>In the</hi> Hague, <hi>the 17 of</hi> December,
1660.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:94181:35"/>
And it is to be remarked, that the <hi>Deputies</hi> in
reciting (page 27) the clauſe of his <hi>Memorial</hi>
concerning <hi>Polerone,</hi> wholly omit that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
relating to theſe Orders.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Treaty</hi> of 1662. they ſay,<hi>'Twas he himſelf that delivered to this</hi> State <hi>a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the King his Maſter, of the 22 of</hi> Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
1663. <hi>in which His Majeſty ſaith expreſly, That
he was intirely ſatisfied with their procedure in this
matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the fifteenth <hi>Article</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Treaty,</hi> it
was agreed, That immediately after the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
thereof, Orders ſhould be given by
the <hi>States General,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi>-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
for the delivery of the Iſland of <hi>Polerone</hi>
to the Engliſh <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Company: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after the Ratification thereof, His <hi>Majeſty</hi>
wrote to the <hi>States General,</hi> demanding the ſaid
Orders; which being accordingly ſent hence
for <hi>London,</hi> as His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had demanded the
ſame by Letter, ſo He was pleaſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Letter to acknowledge the receipt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and that with very civil and obliging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
well hoping that for the future, all
things would have gone after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
then before the concluſion of the ſaid <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And this is the Letter here mentioned:
nor doth it contain any more in relation to
this buſineſs, nor indeed could it, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
not above fourteen weeks after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the ſaid <hi>Treaty,</hi> being dated <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:94181:36"/>
the 22 of <hi>January 1662.</hi> Whereas the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties</hi>
ſay in this their Book, That it was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the 22 of <hi>January 1663.</hi> which is above
fifteen months after the concluſion of the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
whereby they would have it thought, that
this Letter had been written upon ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
procedure in relation to this buſineſs, and
upon ſome advice out of the <hi>Indies</hi> concerning
the ſame. Nor will the excuſe of <hi>New ſtile</hi> or
<hi>Old ſtile</hi> ſerve the turn; for if they had meant
<hi>New Stile,</hi> then it muſt have been dated the
firſt of <hi>February 1663.</hi> and not the 22 of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
1663.</hi> And the King his Maſter doth by
no means underſtand this manner of proceeding
with him.</p>
            <p>And now, I pray, doth this Letter contradict
or interfere, in the leaſt, with what had been
ſaid by him in his <hi>Memorial?</hi> Had he therein
ſaid, That they had not given Orders for the
delivery thereof, or more then that, <hi>Yet we
do not know to this day, that the ſaid place is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And was not that then true? And what
ground or occaſion given for them, to ſay, Page
the 28, <hi>The ſaid</hi> Envoy <hi>doth hereby make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the wrong he doth, in forming Complaints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a matter, concerning which the King himſelf
had thanked the State?</hi> Had he complained,
that this <hi>State</hi> had not given Orders for the
reſtoring that place; or ſaid more then
as above-ſaid, That we did not yet know
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94181:36"/>
that that place was reſtored? and can any of
them ſay yet to this day, that it is reſtored?
But if he had thought he ſhould have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up ſo ſhort, he would have added (as he
then could) that the ſaid Orders, together with
His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Commiſſion, under his Great Seal
of <hi>England,</hi> had been actually <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>endred and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Governour-General at <hi>Batavia;</hi>
and that he had made ſport therewith, as with
the Orders of the year 1660. asking how he could
know that piece of Wax from another piece of
wax? and how he could know the King's Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and image thereupon from another? with
many vaunting and inſolent expreſſions; though
he did acknowledge that he knew of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the ſaid <hi>Treaty;</hi> and that thereby the ſaid
Iſland was to be reſtored, and that the Orders
by them preſented, as from the <hi>Eſtates General,</hi>
and <hi>East-India</hi>-Company, were really their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and that they who tendred them, were the
Factors and Servants of the <hi>Engliſh East-India</hi>-Company,
and ſo that there could be no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that it ought to be delivered to them.
And ſo, what though His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Commiſſion
ſhould not have been kept ſo perfectly clean,
that could raiſe no queſtion: but it's a ſigne how
exact the <hi>Deputies</hi> informations concerning this
matter are, and what credit is to be given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
for that they call it a Paper, Page the 28.
<hi>Preſenting to them a Paper that was ſo foul:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is very well known, that the Broad-Seal of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94181:37"/>
               <hi>England</hi> is never put to Paper, but to Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only: nor do themſelves alleadge, that the
Orders of the <hi>Eſtates General,</hi> or <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi>-Company
were ſullied, or thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh
Eaſt-India</hi>-Company. And when they had ſpent
much time in deſcanting upon the Commiſſion
and Orders, then the ſaid <hi>General</hi> would have
them to give an Acquittance, wherein ſhould be
inſerted ſuch a Clauſe as was directly repugnant
to the Treaty, and no way in their power to
ſigne, and wherein they muſt in writing give
thanks for the reſtoring of the ſaid Iſland to them,
as if of grace, and not a thing agreed by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be done, and of due, and which had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years been unjuſtly kept from them, and now
to be delivered with the trees again utterly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
and deſtroyed, whereas at the time of its
taking it was well planted; and what other or
further Devices may afterwards be made, either
there, or by the Governour and Council of the
<hi>Banda</hi>-Iſlands, Time muſt ſhew: we have cauſe
to fear the worſt; and if it be not delivered, it
will appear to have been cauſed upon ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and not (as is here ſuggeſted) upon the
want of Shipping, or other neceſſaries on the
ſide of the Engliſh for the receiving thereof,
though they had no great encouragement to be
over-forward in providing them, conſidering
what the like Orders had coſt them in the year
1660, and to what effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:94181:37"/>
And whereas they ſay, That the aforeſaid
Letter of the 22th of <hi>January</hi> was delivered to
this State by him the ſaid Envoy; The Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have very much forgot themſelves: the ſaid
Letter was not delivered by him, nor could be,
for that he was at that time in <hi>England,</hi> nor had
been in <hi>Holland</hi> ſome months before, nor returned
thither till ſeveral months after.</p>
            <p>Page the 29 and 30, concerning the buſineſs
of <hi>New Netherlands,</hi> they argue,</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the ſignification of the word <hi>Octroy,</hi>which, ſay they, <hi>Is onely an Advantage accorded to
ſome particular Subjects, to the general excluſion of
all other Subjects of the ſame Soveraign, but which
doth not at all oblige the Subjects of other Princes and
States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly: <hi>And though the</hi> Octroy <hi>or Patent
which the King of</hi> England <hi>had given to his Subjects,
did comprehend</hi> New Netherland, <hi>yet that could not
give the</hi> Engliſh <hi>any Right to the Places and Lands
which the Subjects of this State had poſſeſſed peaceably
for fourty or fifty years, and which they had occupied
whilst it was deſerted and uninhabited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, As to what was alleadged of their
endeavouring to uſurp ſtill more upon the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and to impoſe their Laws and Cuſtoms
upon them, and to raiſe Contributions from
them: They ſay, <hi>We judge that this is a producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Imagination, and dare ſay that there is nothing
of truth therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:94181:38"/>
Fourthly: That if his <hi>Majestie</hi> had thought
that his Subjects had any pretence to this place,<hi>would not his Majesties Commiſsioners, during the
whole time that the Ambaſſadours of this State were in</hi>England, <hi>have ſpoken one word concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
however, ſince they have not done it, it ought to
be put among the number of thoſe that are mortified by
the ſaid Treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt, He doth reply, That he did
not argue in his <hi>Memorial</hi> from the Grammatical
ſignification of the word <hi>Octroy,</hi> but from the
matter and ſubſtance of the <hi>Octroys,</hi> Patents or
Charters granted by his Majeſties Royal Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
concerning thoſe parts. The Deputies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that they muſt be after the Model of the
<hi>Octroys</hi> of the Dutch <hi>East-India</hi> and <hi>West-India</hi>-Companies,
which do not give the Soveraignty
of all the Lands within the limits thereof to the
ſaid Companies, but onely certain Priviledges
therein, to the excluſion of the reſt of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this State: And ſome ſuch there are in
<hi>England</hi> alſo, as of the Engliſh <hi>East-India, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,
African, Moſcovian</hi> Companies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
theſe are quite of another nature; they do grant
the Soveraignty of the Lands within their Limits
to the Grantees, under a certain Model and
Form of Government, and under certain Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Juriſdictions therein ſet down and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94181:38"/>
And as to the ſecond, the <hi>Deputies</hi> doe not deny
that this Land called <hi>New Netherlands</hi> is within the
<hi>Patents</hi> granted by his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and
he the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> doth affirme that it is.</p>
            <p>And let thoſe of the <hi>Weſt-India Company</hi> produce
an antienter <hi>Patent</hi> for the ſame, but he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they can produce any at all, other then that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>Octroy</hi> (which as aboveſaid) grants not the
<hi>Soveraignty</hi> of all Lands within the Limits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And as to the point of Poſſeſſion, there is nothing
more cleare and certaine then that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did take
poſſeſſion of and inhabit the <hi>Lands</hi> within the Limits
of the ſaid <hi>patents,</hi> long before any <hi>Dutch</hi> were there.
'Tis not to ſay, (nor is it requiſite that it ſhould be
ſaid) that they did inhabite every <hi>Individuall Spot,</hi>
within the Limits of them. It is enough that their
<hi>patent</hi> is the firſt, and that in purſuance thereof,
they had taken poſſeſſion, and did inhabite and dwell
within the ſame, and made conſiderable <hi>Towns, Forts,</hi>
and <hi>Plantations</hi> therein before the <hi>Dutch</hi> came to dwell
there: Is it to be imagined that the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India-Company</hi>
have fully Peopled and <hi>cultivated</hi>
the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and other their great <hi>Colonies</hi> in
the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and yet if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould upon
ſuch pretence, endeavour to ſettle there without
their conſent. Would they approve thereof, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the ſame? or accompt their Title there to be
good, or other then <hi>Precarious;</hi> and the ſetling
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>New Netherlands</hi> (ſo called) was
upon permiſſion graunted them by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for
their <hi>Shipping,</hi> to take in Wood, and Water,
there, and other Proviſions for their reliefe,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94181:39"/>
when they ſhould come into thoſe Parts, but
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did never grant unto them the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty</hi>
thereof, but that the ſaid <hi>Company</hi> (as
they doe elſewhere) did upon this <hi>precarious</hi> admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and connivance, incroach from time to time upon
the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whereas they ſay <hi>Page 29. The ſaid</hi> Envoy<hi>ſaith, that the</hi> Dutch <hi>ought every year to demand the
confirmation of their poſſeſſions,</hi> and deſcant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon:<hi>But we have above obſerved, that there is very
little to be built upon what he ſaith, that it ought not to
be believed but upon very good proofe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very hard meaſure, that the <hi>Deputies</hi> ſtill
take to themſelves the Liberty of miſreciting the
Words, and Clauſes of his <hi>Memorial,</hi> and make it
ſpeak what it never did, and yet withall fall upon
him with reproachfull, and diſdainfull Language,
for having ſaid and Written that which is no where
(that he knows of) to be found but in this
Book. The clauſe in his <hi>Memorial</hi> was; <hi>That thoſe</hi>
Hollanders <hi>which were there, did dwell there ſimply
by permiſſion, and not by any Right that they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to that place, and that that had been declared to
them from time, to time, and from year to year.</hi>
And is not there a great difference between, <hi>That
it had been declared to them from year to year, that
they had no right to dwell there,</hi> and <hi>That they ought
every year to demand the confirmation of their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
And are not the very next words of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial,
But ſo as that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were content to have
ſuffered them to dwell there, provided they would have
demeaned themſelves Peaceably.</hi> So far from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94181:39"/>
ſaid that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did expect that they ſhould
every year demand a confirmation of their poſſeſſions,
as that on the contrary what he ſaid was, that though
their poſſeſſion was but <hi>procarious,</hi> yet that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
were contented to let them live there and enjoy the
ſame, upon condition of their demeaning themſelves
quietly; And was it not ſo that about the year 1654,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were about granting them certain <hi>Limits,</hi>
and the ſame had taken Effect and been <hi>ratified;</hi> if
their continued <hi>New Inſolencies</hi> had not diverted the
ſame: yet it ſhall be far from him to retort any ſuch
unhandſome Expreſſions. And as to the Argument
whereby they would prove that they were more then
few in Number, for that <hi>It is not probable that a
few</hi> Hollanders <hi>ſhould have ſo fallen upon many</hi> Engliſh.</p>
            <p>That they were but <hi>few</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
is a fact too known to need proving; but the argument
may be thus well Retorted, How great was their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
to have attempted thoſe Inſolencies, which
they did from time to time attempt, being ſo few in
Number, and how great the patience of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
who are ſo Numerous and ſtrong in thoſe parts, being
able to bring many ſcores of thouſands of able fighting
men into the field, that they ſhould yet ſo long have
ſuffered the ſame. And this lead's me to the third
particular, It would have been a boldneſs and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
indeed in him the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> to have fained
theſe <hi>Allegations,</hi> &amp; endeavoured to have impoſed them
upon their Lordſhips and the world, that they had from
time to time injur'd the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and uſurped upon
them in thoſe parts if it had not been ſo; But I pray
was not One <hi>How,</hi> ſent by His late <hi>Majeſty of Bleſſed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94181:40"/>
Memory</hi> into thoſe parts about twenty five years agone,
and did not the <hi>Dutch</hi> there ſeize him and his <hi>Company,</hi>
and keep them <hi>Priſoners,</hi> and were not great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
thereof brought to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and
which were highly reſented? And did not the <hi>Dutch</hi>
about twenty years agone come to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town
called <hi>Stanford,</hi> where none but <hi>Engliſh</hi> lived, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
them to come under their obedience and pay
them contribution, and ſet up the <hi>Dutch Armes</hi> there,
and all along the late times of diſorders in <hi>England,</hi>
were there not continually high complaints brought
over againſt them? did they not ſend armed Men to an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Town called <hi>Greenwitch,</hi> and force the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
there to come under them? And was not one <hi>Deyer</hi>
ſent in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s time to ſtop their Inſolencies, and
who did Free the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of them in ſeverall places.
Moreover did not the laſt Governour of <hi>New-Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
(ſo called) lately come with Armed men to a
certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town called <hi>Weſt-Cheſter,</hi> within the
bounds of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, and where they had
bought the Land of the <hi>Natives</hi> (as is their Cuſtome,
not to ſettle any where in thoſe parts without firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
with them) and by force compelled them to
come under their obedience, and to pay them contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions,
or elſe to quit their dwellings in two Month's
time, and Named the place <hi>Ooſtdorp.</hi> And about three
years ago, upon freſh complaints of their <hi>Uſurpations</hi>
by Land, and moreover that they did ſtop and hinder
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping from their <hi>Trade</hi> in thoſe parts,
Was not one <hi>Scot</hi> ſent to warn them to live quietly,
and not to injure the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or otherwiſe that ſome
other Courſe ſhould be taken with them, and yet the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94181:40"/>
               <hi>Deputies</hi> would have it thought that there hath been
nothing of this kind, and that what hath of late been
done to the <hi>Dutch</hi> in thoſe parts, ſhould have been a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
without any thing of provocation, or occaſion
given.</p>
            <p>And as to the fourth Particular more needs not
be ſaid, then what is in his <hi>Memorial,</hi> viz. That
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had by their <hi>Charter Jura Belli</hi> in thoſe
parts, without appealing firſt into <hi>Europe;</hi> but if it can
be made good that they have done any injury to
the People of this <hi>Country,</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi> will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ready to ſee that right be done. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
their Lordſhips doe in ſeverall places of this Book,
ſay, that His <hi>Majesty</hi> ſhould have confeſſed, that the
taking of <hi>New Netherland,</hi> (ſo called) ſhould be done
by his order. He is commanded to ſay, that his
<hi>Majesty</hi> never ſaid more concerning this, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Cape Corſe,</hi> and that he did never ſay to the
Ambaſſador of this <hi>State,</hi> that he had given any ſuch
Order: Nor did he give it, nor was the ſaid place
taken by any Order of his. And if the <hi>Deputies</hi> had
pleaſed to have minded the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of the <hi>States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
of the ninth of <hi>October</hi> laſt; given to His <hi>Majeſty</hi>
by their Ambaſſador, They would therein have
found, that the ſaid <hi>Eſtates</hi> doe not impute the taking
of <hi>New Netherland</hi> to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> but to his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
in thoſe parts, the words being, <hi>That their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
have made complaint, that His</hi> Majeſties <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in</hi> New Netherland, <hi>had with Violence driven
the Subjects of this State out of their Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was after <hi>De Ruyter</hi> was actually gone for
<hi>Guiny,</hi> nor was ſo much as any thing known in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94181:41"/>
               <hi>Europe</hi> concerning the taking of <hi>Cabo Corſo,</hi> till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſame time. And how then theſe matters,
and His <hi>Majesty</hi> having ſaid that they were done by
his Order throughout this Book, produced to juſtify
the ſending him thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 30,</hi> and 31. Concerning what had been ſaid by
him the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> that the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article
doth onely Mortify <hi>matters of Piracy, and the
like, and not of Rights and Inheritances of Lands.</hi>
They ſay, <hi>It is hard to ſay whether the ſaid Envoy
doe faign the ignorant or be ſo in Effect.</hi> And for the
diſproving of what had been ſaid by him, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the inſtance of the Iſland of <hi>Polerone,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which they ſay, <hi>That it being ſtipulated by the ſaid
Articles, that the ſaid place ſhould be reſtored, that
conſequently all other matters of that kind muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
mortified;</hi> for that <hi>Exceptio firmat Regulam.</hi> And
add this harſh expreſſion, <hi>A ſtrange blindneſs, if it be
not willfull;</hi> Whereas that clauſe of the Treaty
run's, that by the reſtitution of the ſaid <hi>Iſland,</hi> all
actions, and pretenſions for loſſes, injuries, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
committed upon each other in <hi>India,</hi> and known in
theſe parts, the 10/<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>0 of <hi>January 1658/9</hi> ſhould ceaſe, be
extinguiſhed, and annulled: Moreover the <hi>Deputies</hi> offer
no anſwer to the inſtance given by him in his <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi>
concerning the caſe of Sir <hi>William Lower,</hi> which
was a Caſe depending in their own Courts of Juſtice,
concerning an Inheritance of Land long before the
years 1654, or 1659, (which are the reſpective times
of the generall abolition in the ſaid <hi>Article)</hi> and
yet ſince the concluſion of the late <hi>Treaty,</hi> that caſe
hath not been aboliſhed but ſtill proceeded in,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94181:41"/>
and continued as before. And how many other
caſes and actions are there of the like nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
diſputes concerning the Inheritances of Land
depending in the Courts of both ſides, as alſo
concerning Morgages, and other reall Engagements,
and concerning Wills, and Teſtaments, Bonds, Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and Merchnts accompts of antienter Date
then the tearms preſcribed in that <hi>Article.</hi> Let but
the Deduction of the <hi>States Generall</hi> of the ninth of
<hi>November</hi> laſt be looked upon, and they will find
therein enough of this kind; and how ſtrange and
monſtrous an <hi>Article</hi> would that have been, that
ſhould have aboliſhed all Men's actions of theſe
kinds. And further to ſhew that it was the meaning
of thoſe that made the <hi>Treaty,</hi> at the time when
they Penn'd it, that that <hi>Article</hi> ſhould not have ſo
vaſt an extent, but only to reach to matters of <hi>Piracy</hi>
and the like. The <hi>Deputies</hi> might have remembred, that
during the Negotiation thereof, this very Objection
was made by the Ambaſſadours of this <hi>State,</hi> upon the
debate of this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> that it might be of too
large and generall extent, and his <hi>Majesties</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
did returne to them for anſwer as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<hi>Their Excellencies have already ſeen a Catalogue
of the complaint, of divers of His</hi> Majeſties <hi>Subjects for
injuries done to them by the</hi> Dutch, <hi>ſo that if they pleaſe
to call the ſame to mind, there can be no ſuch incerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in the Article concerning Commiſſioners, as their
Papers would ſeem to intimate. Moreover it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that this Article of Commiſſioners is not deſired for
buſineſſes of Lands and Houſes, but for matters of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateries,
and Merchandizes taken by force, which we deſire
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94181:42"/>
ſhould be ſo Examined and determined, for the avoiding
the charge and delay of Juridicall Proceedings.</hi> And
upon this account His <hi>Majeſtey</hi> did not, nor needed
not make mention of this buſineſſe during the Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of that <hi>Treaty,</hi> and upon the ſame account His
<hi>Majeſty</hi> did not think fit to inſert in the Liſt of <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi>
this pretence of His <hi>Subjects</hi> thereto, nor to the
Fort of <hi>Cabo Corſo,</hi> though as to the ſpoile and
burning of their Goods there, he did cauſe that to be
put into it.</p>
            <p>Beſides (as hath been ſhewen above) there were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many and great provocations done in thoſe parts
call'd <hi>New Netherlands</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the late <hi>Treaty,</hi> and ſo though the <hi>Treaty</hi>
were to be conſtrued as they would have it, yet it doth
not help them concerning the buſineſſe of <hi>Guiana.</hi>
They ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> the 31. <hi>The Digreſſion which the ſaid</hi>
Envoy <hi>makes as to the buſineſs of Guiana is from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
for that ſay they, he hath nothing to doe to trouble
himſelf how this <hi>State</hi> will make off this matter with
<hi>France;</hi> he did not mention that buſineſs as intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
betwen the <hi>French</hi> and them, but if at this time
they have ſent a <hi>Miniſter</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to decry the
King his Maſter, and his Affairs, and to ſtirre up that
Crown againſt him, and particularly upon the account
of his having (as they pretended) given Orders for the
taking <hi>Cabo Corſo,</hi> and <hi>New Netherlands</hi> (to which His
<hi>Majesties Subjects</hi> have ſo clear and undoubted a Title)
Was it <hi>from the purpoſe</hi> for him to ſay, that ſuppoſe
His <hi>Majesty</hi> hath given ſuch Orders, can any <hi>Prince</hi>
think it ſtrange, or be ſurpriſed thereat, <hi>much leſſe the
moſt Chriſtian King</hi> (as the words of his <hi>Memorial)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94181:42"/>
ſeeing it hath pleaſed the ſame King that very year to
Order or ſuffer his Subjects to repoſſeſſe themſelves in the
ſame manner by Armes and force, of a certain place called</hi>
Guiana, <hi>which they pretend to have been unjuſtly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and detained from them by the ſaid Weſt-India-Company.</hi>
And if that were a Digreſſion, the <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
muſt give him leave to make another of the like
kind, and to put them in mind of the late <hi>Edict,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all the <hi>Shipping</hi> of this <hi>Country</hi> in the <hi>Havens</hi> of that
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> were arreſted and ſeized, upon the ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the having ſeized in this <hi>Conntry,</hi> two <hi>Ships</hi>
belonging to the <hi>French Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> and
though the ſaid <hi>Ships</hi> were built here and but newly
bought, and that the pretence of ſeizing them, was the
Service of the <hi>State</hi> and payment proffered, and that
the diſpute about them had been but of a few weeks
ſtanding. <hi>Pag. 32, 33.</hi> concerning the buſineſs of <hi>Cabe
verd,</hi> and the Ships of the <hi>Weſt-India-Company</hi> taken
by Captain <hi>Holmes</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Guiny,</hi> Whereas he
the ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> had ſaid thereto, Firſt, that His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
had not only diſavowed his having given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Order for the doing thereof, but alſo diſowned the
<hi>Acts</hi> themſelves; Secondly, that by the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Article</hi> of
the late <hi>Treaty,</hi> 12 Months time is given for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Juſtice</hi> upon what ſhould happen either by Sea
or Land upon that Coaſt ſince the concluſion of the
late <hi>Treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Firſt, the Deputies ſay, that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had
in like manner before diſavowed the taking the Fort
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Andre</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Holmes,</hi> but yet that nothing
followed thereupon. This is fully anſwered before,
and thereby made appear that it is to themſelves, and
not His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to whom it is to be imputed, that
no further Progreſs had been made in that matter;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94181:43"/>
Yet it may not be amiſs (ſince the Deputies do ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
make mention of this buſineſs, and make ſo great
Outcry concerning the ſame) to add how little the
Concern of this State is therein, or in what had been
done concerning it; For that that Fort did not belong
to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company of this Country, but to
the Duke of <hi>Courland,</hi> and that they had but
lately ſhufled themſelves into it, (as they do into the
Poſſeſſions of every one under one pretence or other)
Nor were they in it upon their own account but His,
and under pretence to keep it for him, and ſo that the
cauſe of complaint was not properly by them, but the
ſaid Duke, and though all poſsible Endeavours have
been ſince uſed by them to draw him to their Party, they
have not been able to prevail therein, but the ſaid
Duke hath applyed himſelf to the King his Maſter,
and His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and He, are come to an Agreement,
concerning the ſame, and the ſaid Agreement conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and ſealed, and ſo neither the <hi>West-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
nor the <hi>State,</hi> have any thing to do therein.
And whereas they ſay, that His <hi>Majeſties anſwer</hi> was
onely in <hi>Generall Terms,</hi> but that he doth not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
promiſe reſtitution and reparation: could more
be ſaid by him upon the firſt complaint; yea (as is
ſaid in his <hi>Memoriall)</hi> could any further anſwer have
been expected from the meaneſt of their own Courts
of Juſtice in any Caſe that ſhould come before them?
And were it not injuſtice to condemne the moſt crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
perſon before he were heard, or at leaſt a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
time given for his appearance; and did not His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
ſay withall, that <hi>Holmes</hi> had order to return, and
was expected very ſpeedily in theſe parts, and that
ſo ſoon as he ſhould be returned, he would cauſe the
matter to be examined, Juſtice done, and the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94181:43"/>
puniſhed. And however the <hi>Deputies</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuare
as if that had been but an <hi>Eluſion,</hi> yet did he
not return accordingly, and upon his arrivall, was he
not immediately by his <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſpeciall Order carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> (a place where none are put
for any private diſputes, or for any Offences, but
wherein the <hi>King</hi> Himſelfe is concern'd) in order to
his examination about theſe Matters.</p>
            <p>But whereas the <hi>Deputies</hi> would have it be believed
that the ſaid <hi>Holmes</hi> is ſo Monſtrous a Perſon, and
that all he had done had been without any provocation,
It may not be amiſs to give here a touch of what he
doth alleadge for his own juſtification.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, as to the Fort S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Andre,</hi> he ſaith, that
comming in the year 1661, into the River of <hi>Gambia</hi>
to trade there, (as formerly the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done)
that thoſe of the ſaid <hi>Fort</hi> fired at him, and would not
permit him to paſs up the ſaid <hi>River.</hi> Whereupon
he fell upon them</p>
            <p>As to the buſineſs of <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> he ſaith, that
comming again upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> and going
to the River of <hi>Gambia</hi> near <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that a little before his arrivall there, one that was
Commander of the Ship <hi>Black Eagle,</hi> and an <hi>Agent</hi>
for the <hi>Dutch Weſt-India Company</hi> in thoſe parts, had
ſtirred up and engaged the King of <hi>Barra</hi> to make War
againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and had actually joyned himſelf
and Ship with the ſaid <hi>Kings Forces</hi> for the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his deſigns, and this was confeſſed to the ſaid
<hi>Holmes</hi> by the ſaid King of <hi>Barra</hi> (as he hath to ſhew
under the Hands of many credible Witneſſes who heard
the ſame) Moreover that the ſaid <hi>Agent</hi> had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſummes of Mony, and other Rewards, to corrupt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94181:44"/>
the Officers of the <hi>Royall Company</hi> to deliver into his
Hands, for the uſe of the <hi>Dutch Weſt-Indiae Company,</hi>
the Places, and Factories then in the poſſeſſion of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe Parts, and that hath been ſince made
good by the Oath of ſome of the ſaid Officers, lately
taken before the Lord Mayor of <hi>London.</hi> Moreover
that at a certain place called <hi>Ventam</hi> he had told Captain
<hi>Manuel Vaſſe de Fraiula</hi> Commander in Chief for the
King of <hi>Portugall</hi> in the River of <hi>Gambia,</hi> and <hi>Manuel
Alves de Britto,</hi> and divers other <hi>Portugall</hi> Merchants,
that they were reſolved to beat out the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> That
hereupon he went to <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> not with deſign to
attaque the ſame, or commit the leaſt Hoſtility againſt
it, but onely to ſpeake with the Governour of that
place, and to endeavour to compoſe matters for the
preſent and untill finall Order ſhould be taken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſame here in <hi>Europe;</hi> but comming thither,
(without the leaſt provocation given by him) he was
immediately ſhot at from the ſaid Fort, whereupon
he fired at them again, and ſeverall ſhot having paſſed
between them, whereby his Ship was much dammaged,
his Maſt ſhot through, and much weakned, his Maſter,
and ſeverall of his Men wounded and kill'd, he drew
off to a further diſtance, where being enforced to come
to an Anchor for the repairing of his Ship and Maſt,
without any thoughts of returning thither again, or
purſuing the matter any further, while they were
mending their Maſt, the Governour hung out a white
Flag, and ſent a Boat on board him, tendering the
Surrender of the ſaid Place; that paſsing thence and
calling at <hi>Leſtus,</hi> he was there informed by the King of
the Country, that a certain <hi>Holland</hi>'s Ship called the <hi>Unity</hi>
had been there but ſome days before, and endeavoured
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94181:44"/>
to perſwade him to expel the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from trading there, and
that he having refuſed to conſent thereunto, that the Captain
of the ſaid Ship had ſeized all the ſaid Kings Subjects that
were come on board him, to trade (according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of that Country) as alſo all ſuch Fiſhers as they found
upon the Coaſt, making them Slaves, and carrying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Moreover that the <hi>Dutch</hi> comming to ſeverall places,
had put out <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours, and having thereby inticed the
Natives on board them, carried them away and made them
Slaves, leaving the <hi>Odium</hi> upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that ſailing thence
to <hi>Anta,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had then a Factory, he found
that one Captain <hi>Frome</hi> belonging to the ſaid <hi>Dutch Weſt-India
Company,</hi> had but a little before compelled the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
there to take in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours that were wont to be
diſplayed there; that ſailing forward on the <hi>Gold Coaſt,</hi> he
found, that not onely thoſe Ships of the Royall <hi>Company</hi> had
been hindered in their Trade, concerning which complaint had
been come to <hi>England</hi> before his departure thence) but that
<hi>Valckenburgh,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Weſt-India Company</hi> there, had,
and did, continue hindring every Ship of the ſaid Royall <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
from Trade there, That he had publiſhed the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
above mentioned, wherein he claimed the whole Coaſt and
the whole Trade thereof, and wherein he had commanded
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to quitt immediatly two of their principall <hi>Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
viz. <hi>Tacorari,</hi> and <hi>Cabo Corſo</hi> as above ſaid. Moreover that
he was informed by the <hi>Natives</hi> all along the Coaſt, that
the ſaid <hi>Valckenburgh</hi> had proffered to them a <hi>Bendy</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi>
for every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man's head that they ſhould bring unto
him, and greater ſumms for ſuch as were Commanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. That thereupon he ſailed to <hi>Castel delmina</hi> to
ſpeak with him, where he found one Captain <hi>Cubit</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in chief of a Squadron of the Royall Companies <hi>Ships</hi>
upon that Coaſt, who told him that he had already written
to him to the ſame effect, and deſiring that they might live
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94181:45"/>
and <hi>Trade</hi> peaceably each by the other, but that he had
utterly refuſed to hearken to any thing of that kinde;
whereupon Sailing thence to <hi>Cabo Corſo</hi> (where the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had a <hi>Factory)</hi> and where alſo on the other ſide of the Water
the <hi>Danes</hi> had a <hi>Fort</hi> call'd <hi>Fredericksbergh,</hi> and having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of annoying the <hi>Dutch,</hi> nor offering them the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
nor ſo much as going aſhore on that ſide that they
were, but on the other ſide where the <hi>Danes</hi> were, and with
whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in a perfect good underſtanding, and
had a Free Trade, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> within the <hi>Fort</hi> of <hi>Cabo
Corſo</hi> did ſeverall times ſhoot at him, and very much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
him; that hereupon (and not upon the account of any
Orders from His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which he denyes that he ever had)
he call'd a Councell of War, where it was reſolved to <hi>attaque</hi>
the ſaid Fort. He ſaith further, that having ſent for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Inaſhang</hi> (an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory) to come to him to
<hi>Cormantine,</hi> that being to paſſe by a place call'd <hi>Aga,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi>
there ſhot at him and wounded ſeverall of his Company.
Moreover that ſending a Drum with a Letter to <hi>Anna Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa,</hi>
a Garriſon of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that they moſt inhumanly fell
upon the Meſſenger under the Wall of their Caſtle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

cut him, mangled him, and ſtript him, leaving him dead

            <p>Concerning the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the 14<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h <hi>Article,</hi> they ſay <hi>Page</hi>
the 33. <hi>The ſaid</hi> Envoy <hi>gives a Sence thereof according to his
mode, but that the Article ſaith the quite contrary to that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to infer;</hi> Whereas in truth he barely repeated that clauſe
of the ſaid <hi>Article,</hi> which ſaith that twelve months time ſhall
be given for the doing of Juſtice upon any Complaint of any
thing done upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> by Land or Sea, ſince the
concluſion of the ſaid <hi>Treaty,</hi> as was the buſineſs of <hi>Cape Verde,</hi>
and what elſe complained of againſt <hi>Holms,</hi> without making any
conſtruction thereof at all, nor did there need any, the words
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94181:45"/>
being of themſelves as plain &amp; full as words could be made for
the purpoſe they are cited by him, that is to ſay, to ſhew
that ways of Force were not to be made uſe of in ſuch caſes, till
the Expiration of twelve months time after Complaint and
Demand of Juſtice; But the <hi>Deputies</hi> do here repeat a clauſe of
the ſaid Article, <hi>Viz. That it ſaith, that if any one doth any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that he alone ſhall be puniſhed and no other;</hi> And do make a
conſtruction thereof, and ſuch a one as whoever would take
upon him the liberty of retorting, might well ſay <hi>a Sence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
according to their Mode, and that the Article ſaith quite the
contrary,</hi> &amp;c. For ſay they, <hi>That is to ſay, that the party offended or
hurt, cannot reſent it or revenge himſelf but only againſt him that
hath done the hurt or offence, &amp; that Letters of Repriſal which may
reach to others as well as the parties offending, cannot be given till
the Expiration of a year after complaint.</hi> Whereby they do infer
from the ſaid Clauſe, that indeed as to Letters of Repriſal which
do Extend beyond the perſons that had committed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that thoſe cannot be granted till a year after complaint,
but that as to ſuch way of force as reacheth only to the perſons
that had committed the offence, that the party offended might
in the mean while make uſe thereof, and ſo nothing in this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
that derogates from or reſtrains the Law of Nature, which
teacheth to repell Force with Force; Whereas nothing can be
more clear, then that the true intent and meaning of the ſaid
<hi>Article</hi> is, not only that no Letters of <hi>Mart</hi> can be granted du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the twelve Months therein mentioned, wherby others then
the perſons offending may come to ſuffer, but that during that
time the offendors themſelves are not to be proceeded againſt
by force and <hi>Violence;</hi> but in a <hi>Judiciary</hi> way, the words thereof
being, <hi>That twelve Months time ſhall be given for the doing of
Juſtice and giving of Satisfaction:</hi> and it follows immediately
after in the ſaid <hi>Article, In caſe the offendors againſt this Treaty
do not appear and ſubmit themſelves to Judgment, and give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
within the time above expreſſed, that then their Eſtates,
Goods and Revenues whatſoever, ſhall be confiſcated for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94181:46"/>
and wrongs by them offered, and be lyable to further perſonall
puniſhment,</hi> ſo that the ſaid twelve Months is given, not for
<hi>ſending Fleetes</hi> and Armies to Fight againſt them, but for
their appearance and ſubmitting to Judgement, and for the
giving of ſatisfaction, not the taking of it by force, and then
if it be not thus given (and not before) their Eſtates, Goods
and Revenues in generall liable to be ſeized, but not by the
Arbitrary and Violent proceedings of <hi>Vice Admirals,</hi> but by
a lawfull ſentence by way of confiſcation, the words being,
<hi>Their Eſtates, Goods and Revenues whatſover ſhall be confiſcated
for due and full ſatisfaction of the injuries and wrongs by them
offred;</hi> And if there be a failer herein and that <hi>Juſtice</hi> is either
denyed or delayed, then, and not till then, is the door open for
wayes of Force againſt them.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> the 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>That it is not eaſie to
make paſs for the injuries of particular perſons, ſuch Hoſtilities as
have been done with the Armes, and under the Pavilion of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</hi>
It is true that the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Article</hi> doth reach only to ſuch
matters as ſhould be done by the <hi>Subjects</hi> and inhabitants of
either ſide, and not to ſuch things as ſhould be done by His
<hi>Majeſty</hi> on the one ſide, or this <hi>State</hi> on the other; but ſuppoſe
an offence be committed under the <hi>Flagg</hi> of either ſide, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is not a ſufficient argument to make it to be an act of the
<hi>Government</hi> of either ſide: for example, <hi>Enno Doedeſtarre</hi> took
the <hi>Charles</hi> aforeſaid in the year 1660, in the Road of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> with three Men of War of this <hi>State,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their <hi>Flagg.</hi> And Captain <hi>Banckert</hi> of <hi>Zeland</hi> did ſince
take in the Channell with one of their Men of War under
their <hi>Flagg,</hi> His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Shaloup aforementioned then in his
ſervice. And the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India-Companies</hi> of this <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
do proceed and act in the Name of the <hi>States General,</hi> and
<hi>Valckenburg</hi>'s Declaration was in their Name, yet hath the
King his Maſter charged any of theſe actions upon the <hi>State</hi>
as done by them, meerly becauſe done under their <hi>Flagg,</hi> or
be their Authority in generall? No more can <hi>Holmes</hi> his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by upon that account imputed to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that were
done without His Order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:94181:46"/>
And whereas they ſay, <hi>pag. 33.</hi> that then <hi>The ſame
Article would authorize theſe violences, which is pretends
to hinder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there no <hi>medium</hi> between authoriſing of them, and the
forbidding the having recourſe to force for a certain
time? Is the ſubmitting them for a certain time to a courſe
of Juſtice, an authoriſing of them? And when entail'd with
ſo ſevere a puniſhment in the iſſue, as the Confiſcation of
their whole Eſtate, declaring their perſons to be enemies,
and further perſonal puniſhment, and an Obligation upon
him whoſe ſubject he is, for the taking care that Juſtice be
accordingly done, for that otherwiſe the 23 Article of
the ſame Treaty, gives them liberty of having recourſe to
force.</p>
            <p>And for what is ſaid, <hi>Pag. 34. It is not enough to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow
an action, and to protect him that hath done it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is inſiſting that the perſon offending be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
according as it is ſet down in the Treaty, a protecting
of him? By the ſame Rule, the maintaining of any Courts
of Juſtice, or form of proceeding againſt Criminals, and
the not ſuffering them to be taken in a violent manner out
of their hands, and tumultuarily fallen upon, may be called
a Protecting them. His Majeſty was alwayes farr from
protecting of <hi>Holmes;</hi> on the contrary, he alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that ſo ſoon as he returned He would have him
puniſhed in caſe it ſhould appear he had done amiſs; and
if they would have had the patience to have expected the
fruits of H<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Majeſties Juſtice, but that it ought to be done
according to the way in the Treaty; that is to ſay, that he
ought to have a time to appear, and ſubmit himſelf to
Juſtice, and not a Fleet ſent immediately to fall upon him
Right or Wrong. And if it ſhall be Objected, <hi>That great
inconveniencies might follow, if this rule ſhould be kept to.</hi>
With their favour it is reciprocal, and ſo as much danger
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94181:47"/>
to the one as the other, and yet the King his Maſter hath
kept up himſelf Religiouſly thereto; He did not, upon the
complaints made by his Subjects to him, concerning the
injuries done to them in thoſe parts, or the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
ſince the late Treaty, ſend a Fleet to thoſe Coaſts, to fall
upon the Subjects of this State, and yet the Argument <hi>Of
fear of other Violences and Pirateries to follow without end,</hi>
was much more ſtrong on his ſide, then it could be on
theirs (conſidering how his Subjects have been from time
to time treated in thoſe parts) but made and continued his
complaints here, and expected their doing him Juſtice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſaid Article. And ſuppoſe ſuch an Article
had not been made, would not the inconveniences and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
have been greater on the other hand? the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on both ſides, being then lyable to be engaged upon
every complaint and ſuggeſtion, to the ſending of Fleets
and Forces to the attacquing and falling upon the ſhips,
and Subjects, and Poſſeſſions of each other; and ſo it would
be impoſſible at any time to continue ſix Months in Peace
with one another: Or though it ſhould be true, that the
inconveniencies might be greater with this Article, then
without; yet the Treaty being now ratified, there is no
place to object the ſame. But under favour, this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lies not at all againſt the ſaid Article, nor doth at all
reach the caſe in diſpute; for the Article doth not hinder
the providing againſt future Violencies and Robberies: It
doth not forbid the ſending Force to protect and defend for
the time to come, as was alſo declared by his Majeſty to
the Ambaſſadour of this State, and that ſuch, and ſuch only
were his Orders to <hi>Holmes:</hi> all it forbids is, that if any
injuries have been actually done, that force cannot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
(nor till the expiration of 12 Months) be ſent for
the revenge thereof, or for procuring Right thereupon,
of which nature were the Orders of this State to <hi>Van Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi>
and <hi>De Ruyter.</hi>

Whereas they ſay, <hi>Pag. 33, &amp; 34. If Sir</hi> George
Downing <hi>would take the pains to look over his Memorial,
and to hearken to reaſon, he would not have the boldneſs to
give here an Explanation directly contrary to the Maxime
which himſelf avowed in his Memorial of the 13 of</hi> Febr.
1664. <hi>Wherein he endeavours to juſtifie the action of Five
Engliſh men of Warr that had taken ſince the concluſion of
the late Treaty, a</hi> Dutch <hi>Ship called the</hi> Arms of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,<hi>which he pretended to be an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ship, and to
have been taken by thoſe of the</hi> Weſt-India <hi>Company
of this Country before the Treaty, and ſaith, that it is
not ſtrange, that they had endeavoured to retake by
force, that which had been by force unjuſtly taken from
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eſtates General had written a long Letter to the
King his Maſter, dated the 26 of <hi>January 1664. N. S.</hi>
making a very long complaint to him concerning the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a certain <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhip belonging to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>
Company of this Country, called the <hi>Arms of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
Moreover, they had communicated the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to him the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> with a large
deduction concerning the ſame, making a huge noiſe
about it; which he the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
narrowly, and looking into the buſineſs found out
that the ſaid Ship called the <hi>Arms of Amſterdam,</hi> was in
truth an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip belonging wholly to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of <hi>London,</hi> and that her true Name was the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Delight,</hi> and that having ſailed from <hi>Dover</hi> in the
year 1660. upon a trading Voyage to the Coaſt of <hi>Guiny,</hi>
under the command of one C. <hi>Bonner</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> ſhe had
been there ſeized in an hoſtile manner, by a certain ſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the ſaid Company called the <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one <hi>Aaron Couſens</hi> was Commander, in or about the
Month of <hi>Aug. 1661.</hi> and carried by her to <hi>Jaſper van Huy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:94181:48"/>
then General for the ſaid Company at <hi>Caſtle Delmina.</hi>
And although the ſaid <hi>Bonner</hi> did declare to the ſaid <hi>Van
Huyſen,</hi> that himſelf and Company were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
that the ſhip with her lading belonged to one <hi>John Young,</hi>
and other Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> and verified the ſame by
authentick Writings and Papers; yet that he kept the
ſaid ſhip and lading, evilly treated the men, altered and
new named the ſhip, calling her the <hi>Arms of Amſterdam,</hi>
that thereby ſhe might be the leſs ſubject to be known
wherever ſhe ſhould be met by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that he
had order long before from the King his Maſter in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to complain to the States General concerning the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of that very ſhip from his Subjects, and for which
yet no ſatisfaction had been made: Hereupon he took the
liberty to inform them of the truth of the matter in his ſaid
Memorial, and to tell them that the Caſe was not ſo
ſtrange and ill as they put it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
taken a <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhip, but only that they had by force retaken
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip that had been by force taken from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thereby to excuſe <hi>à tanto.</hi> And what can now be ſaid for
the juſtification and defence of the ſending <hi>Van Campen</hi>
and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> for <hi>Guiny.</hi> Was not the buſineſs of <hi>Cabo
Verde,</hi> and what elſe complained of, matters hapned ſince
the concluſion of the late Treaty, and ſo directly within
the compaſs of that Article? And was not the reſolution
for the ſending of <hi>Van Campen</hi> (as is ſaid in his Memorial)
taken within about 6 or 7 weeks after complaint made by
this State to his Majeſty, concerning the taking of <hi>Cabo
Verde,</hi> and the actual ſending <hi>De Ruyter</hi> within a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and doth it not appear by the expreſs words of <hi>Van
Campen's</hi> Inſtructions, that his being ſent thither, was not
only upon the defenſive, to perſerve the places and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of this Country in thoſe parts, but in direct and down-right
terms to fall upon his Majeſties Subjects, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94181:48"/>
them, revenging themſelves by force againſt ſuch
whom they pretended to have done them hurt. Nor is it
therein ſaid that they might fall upon <hi>Holmes</hi> only, who
was the only perſon complained of; but the words are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and dubious, <hi>viz That thoſe to whom the Command
of the ſaid Fleet was given, in caſe that upon the ſaid Coaſt
they ſhould find, or rencounter any ſhips or Subjects of his
Majeſties, that they ſhould take care not to endammage them,
or to trouble, or incommodate them in their Traffique; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they had not already, or did not then do any dammage
to this State, or its good Inhabitants.</hi> Whereby it is left in
their conſtruction and diſcretion whom they are to fall
upon, <hi>viz.</hi> whomever they ſhould judge to have done, or
to be doing any hurt to this State, or any of their Subjects.
And this Reſolution is put into his Majeſties hands by the
Ambaſſadou<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> this Country, and not only ſo, but given
to ſeveral other Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> his Friends and Allies.
And its withall declared that this Fleet ſhall paſs the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
before his Ports, and that under the Convoy of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Fleet of Capital ſhips of War under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Lieutenant Admiral of this State. And was
it poſſible for his Majeſty longer to ſit ſtill and to remain
<hi>without doing any thing.</hi> Hitherto the diſpute had been
only between the Subjects and Inhabitants of both ſides,
but now this State had hereby engaged it ſelf: whereby
the Diſpute was come to be immediately between the
King his Maſter and them; and though while this State
intermeddled not, neither did the King his Maſter upon
the other hand interpoſe, but with patience expected ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to be done by them to his Subjects, according to the
terms of the Treaty; but they on the other hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon
the firſt complaint of any injury done in thoſe very parts
to their Subjects, breaking through the Rules and Bonds of
the Treaty; what now remained, but the oppoſing of
force to force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:94181:49"/>
And whereas the Deputies would have it thought no
indignity or affront to his Majeſty, for that Fleet to have
paſſed, for that, ſay they, <hi>The Sea is open to all the World.</hi>
It may not be amiſs to mark that however they plead ſo
much for the <hi>the Seas being free</hi> in theſe parts, yet that the
contrary is practiſed where the people of this Country
have the power: witneſs the late Declaration of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Eaſt-India Company (not yet diſavowed by this
State) wherein they claim a whole great Sea to themſelves.
And witneſs the uſage, of the Weſt-India Company at
<hi>Cape Blaneo</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> where they will
not ſuffer any Nation to fiſh in the open Sea without
their permiſſion, and paying them the tenth fiſh, and the
Governour there within theſe few years, ſeized and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip called the <hi>Leopard,</hi> for having
fiſhed there, but here in this Caſe there was no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
about their Liberty of paſſing the Sea, but about their
paſſing with ſuch a Reſolution and to ſuch an End. And
could a greater affront be done to a King, then when he
had done what was poſſible for the ſatisfaction of this
State and more then requiſite, that notwithſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he ſhall be told by them, that they are reſolved to fall
upon his Subjects, and not naming whom, whereby not any
of them were in ſurety, eſpecially conſidering they queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
our trading even at our own Factories in thoſe parts
(as hath been afore ſhewn) and call it a hurting them.
Moreover it is to be conſidered that at the very time when
this reſolution was put into his Majeſties hands, there were
juſt Reaſons to ſurmiſe and believe, that <hi>De Ruyter</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
already gon, or upon the point of going to <hi>Guiny,</hi>
and ſo that all this declaring of their intent of ſending <hi>Van
Campen</hi> was but a meer <hi>Grimaſse,</hi> whereby to colour the
preparing ſo conſiderable a Fleet, as they were then gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
together under the Notion of <hi>Van Campen's</hi> going to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94181:49"/>
               <hi>Guiny</hi> and the convoying of him, but that in truth the real
intent and meaning was to make uſe thereof nearer home;
for it had been ſaid and written by this State to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
That <hi>De Ruyters</hi> imployment was to be againſt the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of <hi>Algiers</hi> and thoſe parts, and not a word of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to <hi>Guiny;</hi> and the Deputies ſay, <hi>pag. 36. That it
had been very rediculous to have made known his Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it muſt neceſſarily follow, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to ſend <hi>Van Campen</hi> thither upon the ſame
ground, becauſe this State did declare and give out that he
was to go thither: And yet it is not to be imagined that
this State would have been at the charge of preparing ſuch
a Fleet as this for nothing, or without ſome proportionable
deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo his Majeſty had juſt reaſon of jealouſie, that
as they had ſent <hi>De Ruyter</hi> to fall upon him in <hi>Guiny,</hi> that
in truth this Fleet was deſigned to have fallen upon him in
theſe parts, as was done in the beginning of the late War
with <hi>England,</hi> if he had not in time provided for his own
ſafety and defence, which was no ſooner done, but the
noiſe of <hi>Campen's</hi> going to <hi>Guiny</hi> was immediately out of
doors, and the great Fleet which they had ſo long kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſeparated. And let the words of the inſtruction to
<hi>Van Campen</hi> aforementioned be conſidered, and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the ſame did reach as well to theſe parts as the
Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> the words being, <hi>In caſe that upon the ſaid
Coaſt, or in their way thither, they ſhould find or rencounter
any ſhips or ſubjects of his Majeſties, that had already done,
or were then doing any hurt to this State or its ſubjects:</hi> So
that the ſaid inſtruction reached to his whole way, <hi>viz.</hi>
from the <hi>Maes</hi> to <hi>Guiny,</hi> and ſo was no other then a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of War againſt <hi>His Majeſty as well in Europe as upon
the Coaſt of Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the reproach caſt upon this State, upon the
accompt of their ſending <hi>De Ruyter</hi> to <hi>Guiny, viz.</hi> that they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94181:50"/>
had invited His Majeſty to ſend a Fleet to act with theirs
againſt the Pirates of <hi>Algiers</hi> and thoſe parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay <hi>pag.</hi> the 35th. <hi>He ſuppoſeth as if there ſhould
have been ſome kind of Treaty or Promiſe to act conjoyntly
againſt the Pirates of</hi> Barbary, <hi>but it will not be found that
there was any Treaty to that effect, nor yet any Negotiation
conducing thereunto.</hi> Is not this Clauſe in their Letter of
<hi>January, 1664.</hi> N. S. wherein they invite His Majeſty
to ſend his Fleet to act with theirs, <hi>viz. That their Fleet
ſhould ſtay in the Mediterranean Sea and thereabouts, until
it had cleared the ſame of all thoſe Pirates that ruined the
Negotiation and the Trade there.</hi> And doth it not follow
in the ſaid Letter? <hi>We are intirely reſolved ſo to do, and not
to recal our Fleet until we have reduced them to reaſon.</hi>
And did not His Majeſty by word of mouth, and He his
Envoy Extraordinary, after by his Order declare unto
them in his Memorial of the 3d. of <hi>February, 1663.</hi> O. S.
his acceptance of that their invitation, and his ſending Sir
<hi>John Lawſon</hi> with a Fleet againſt thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and
that it ſhould act with all good correſpondence with theirs?
and did they not do it accordingly until the time of <hi>De
Ruyters</hi> quitting thoſe parts? and yet the Deputies would
have it thought as if there had been nothing of a promiſe
on the part of this State to continue <hi>De Ruyter</hi> againſt thoſe
Pirates, and that there had been nothing of any Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or <hi>Eſpece</hi> of Treaty or Promiſe concerniug that matter:
And had they ſo much upon any accompt to ſay againſt
the King his Maſter, as he hath to ſay againſt the Eſtates
General in this, as well upon the accompt of the unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs,
as of the unwarrantableneſs of the action, what
an Out-cry would they make? and what accompt is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be made of any of their Declarations as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of their Fleets?</p>
            <p>And whereas it follows, <hi>pag.</hi> the 35th. <hi>That the Engliſh
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94181:50"/>
have made two different Treaties with thoſe Pirates, without
giving notice to this State.</hi> The firſt Treaty was made
long before the writing of that Letter; yea the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
refers thereunto: And for the ſecond Treaty, it was
not made till long after <hi>De Ruyter</hi> had abandoned that
work, and was gon for <hi>Guiny;</hi> and how then could His
Majeſties Fleet communicate with him? and as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> His Majeſty was under no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
concerning that matter with any of them.</p>
            <p>They ſay further, <hi>pag. 35. It would ſeem that it was the
intention of the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>to imploy the Forces of this State
alone againſt thoſe Pirates, while they carried their Armes
upon the Coaſt of</hi> Africa, <hi>there to ruine the Commerce of the
Inhabitants thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas (as appears by the fore-ſaid Letter) His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
did not put this State upon ſending againſt the ſaid
Pirates, but they put him upon it; ſo that if there were any
deſigns, it muſt be in them by vertue of that their ſolemn
Letter and Engagement, to put his Majeſty out of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of jealouſies or ſuſpicion of their diverting that Fleet,
that ſo it might the more ſecurely ſteal away for <hi>Guiny:</hi>
Nor is it altogether unworthy the remarking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there
were laid up before hand in readineſs about <hi>Cadix,</hi> all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Proviſions and Neceſſaries for ſuch a Voyage. And
(I pray) whereas it is ſaid in the Reſolution of the Eſtates
General of the 20th. of <hi>September</hi> laſt, That the reaſon of
the communicating to him their intention of ſending <hi>Van
Campen</hi> was, <hi>That His Majeſty may be intirely aſſured of the
ſincerity of their intention for the conſervation of peace, and
of all good underſtanding with him.</hi> Yet when at the ſame
time His Majeſty preſt to know whether <hi>De Ruyter</hi> was
gone, (who was in truth the perſon deſign'd thither) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would be made known to him or confeſſed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſame: Yea, the Deputies ſay as aforeſaid, <hi>It
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94181:51"/>
would have been a ridiculous action to have let the ſame to
be made known, and that the Ambaſſador of this State him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
had no knowledge thereof.</hi> And when they had as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
ſent out a conſiderable number of Ships of War
to his Majeſties Coaſts, preſently after the Eſtates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
write to him, to keep in his Fleet, and they would keep
in theirs, and preſs vehemently by their Ambaſſador an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
anſwer; and if His Majeſty had yielded thereto,
he had been their catcht alſo.</p>
            <p>They ſay further, <hi>pag. 36.</hi> concerning the inſtruction of
<hi>De Ruyter,</hi> That he is ſent onely <hi>to puniſh the Authors of
theſe Violencies and Hoſtilities:</hi> whereby it is alſo avowed
concerning him, as well as <hi>Van Campen,</hi> that his ſending to
<hi>Guiny</hi> was not upon the defenſive, but alſo to fall upon His
Majeſties Subjects. But whereas the words are, That he
ſhould fall upon onely <hi>the Authors of theſe violencies.</hi> And
Monſieur <hi>Van Benningen</hi> in his late Paper publiſhed here
in Print, intituled, <hi>The ſubſtance of what Monſieur</hi> Van Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen
<hi>Envoye from the States General to the moſt</hi> Chriſtian
<hi>King, had repreſented to him in his Audience of</hi> September,
1664. ſaith, <hi>That the States had ſent a Fleet to</hi> Guiny, <hi>not
to attacque reciprocally the Forts, Ships, and Goods of the
Subjects of</hi> England, <hi>but to re-take that which had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
taken from them.</hi> Whereas no ſooner was <hi>De Ruyter</hi>
come into thoſe parts, but finding there 8 Merchants ſhips
that had not been arrived there above 7 or 8 dayes before,
and had no hand nor ſhare in any thing done againſt the
People of this Countrey, yet he immediately ſeized them,
broke bulk, unlading them, and appropriating their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
to the uſe of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company. And in ſtead
of declaring, That they would puniſh <hi>De Ruyter</hi> for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, he is ſince the coming of that News advanced
from being Vice-Admiral of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to be one of the
Lieutenant Admirals of <hi>Holland.</hi> And the Deputies ſay
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94181:51"/>
here, <hi>We judge that there is no body that will not praiſe and
commend the prudent conduct of this State, and that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
deſign that they had to cauſe</hi> De Ruyter <hi>to go from the</hi>
Streights <hi>to</hi> Guiny. Nor is there any thing ſaid for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſigned for the Coaſt of <hi>Guiny</hi> onely; and ſo he may
be deſigned for the attacquing of His Majeſties Subjects
in other parts of the World as well as there.</p>
            <p>And now what occaſion was there for the inſerting of all
thoſe calumnies and reviling expreſſions in the Deputies
Remarks, much leſs for the State to have owned them, and
ſtamped their Authority upon them. Is there ſo much as
one incivil or indecent word challenged in any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to have been in his Memorial, and doth it not now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that there was alſo nothing therein but what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to truth.</p>
            <p>And can it now be doubted by any who hath been the
Aggreſſor and the Cauſe of all the preſent Diſorders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Nations. Firſt, as to what before the Treaty, to
ſay nothing of the <hi>Bonne Eſperanza</hi> and <hi>Bonne Adventure,</hi>
and how His Majeſty hath been dealt withal in relation to
them (that having been already Printed and Publiſhed at
large.) As to the Liſts of Damages, 'twas as appears near
24 moneths after the Signing of the late Treaty ere he the
ſaid Envoye could obtain the Exchange thereof, and then
coming to the Examination of them according to the 15
<hi>Article.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liſt was ſo ſoberly Penn'd,
that but one Exception was made thereunto. The <hi>Dutch</hi>
Liſt on the other hand was ſo compoſed, as that ſcarce an
<hi>Article</hi> thereof but liable to exception. And that they had
excepted againſt in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liſt was at the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
expunged, and ſo the ſaid Liſt agreed, and ready
to be proceeded upon. On the contrary, as to the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made againſt theirs, to this day no anſwer returned,
whereby it remains at their doors, that no farther proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94181:52"/>
hath been for the adjuſting and determining thoſe
matters. And as to what hath hapned ſince the Treaty,
the <hi>Hope-well, Leopard, Charles</hi> and <hi>James, &amp;c.</hi> had not only
been ſtopped and defeated in their Voyages, before any
thing attempted by <hi>Holmes,</hi> but the news thereof was come
into <hi>England</hi> before he went thence; nor was any thing
done by him upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> till it plainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the ſtopping of every other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that came
upon theſe Coaſts, that what was done was not done by
accidental rencounters, but out of deſign; nor till <hi>Valken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
had actually commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Cabo,
Corſo,</hi> and <hi>Tacorary,</hi> two of their principal Factories, under
a penalty of a great ſum of money for every moneth that
they ſhould remain there after the ſaid notification; and
this done in a Declaration, wherein he deduced the
Right of this State to the reſt alſo, and ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
could not but believe that the next News muſt be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to quit intirely the whole Coaſt. Yet
(as he ſaith for himſelf) he did not go about to take upon
him the revenging thereof, nor had done what he did but
upon immediate Attacques and Provocations upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
places occaſioning the ſame; and ſuppoſe it had
been otherwiſe, yet upon complaint made by this State,
can they ſay that His Majeſty did by them as they did by
him in the buſineſs of <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> viz. give them no anſwer
at all, or ſuch a one as they gave him in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the ſtopping the ſaid Ships and of the ſaid
Declaration; yea, did he not immediately diſavow
what had been done by the ſaid <hi>Holmes,</hi> and declare
that he had no Orders from him for the doing thereof, and
that ſo ſoon as poſſible matters could be examined, he
would do therein according to Juſtice and Reaſon; yet
contrary to the Expreſs Letter of the 14 Article, which
gives a twelve Moneths time upon complaints in thoſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94181:52"/>
parts, this State within 6 or 7 weeks after complaint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to ſend a Fleet of Men of War of their own thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and within about as many weeks more put a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into his Majeſties hands; whereby it appears, that
their Orders were not to be upon the Defenſive only, and
to convoy and protect their Subjects and ſhipping from
further injuries; but to attacque and fall upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Subjects, and not ſome one or more of them by
Name; but under ſuch general words, as from the reach
whereof none of them were ſecure: and that not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> only, but even here in <hi>Europe,</hi> in
the Channel before his own Ports. And what though
there had been no other Provocation but this very Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?
was not this alone enough to have warranted his
Majeſty to have fallen upon them, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where?
If any King or State ſend a Declaration to another
King or State, letting them know that they have prepared
a Fleet, and have actually given orders to the Commanders
thereof to fall upon their Subjects, and that it appears that
nothing but wind and weather hinders the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
ſuppoſe the ſaid King or State to whom ſuch intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been given, ſhall thereupon (and while God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
by his Providence hinders the execution of the ſaid
Orders) attempt ſomething againſt them or their Subjects;
Shall not yet the other that gave the ſaid Denunciation be
looked upon as the Aggreſſor? Yet his Majeſty remained
ſtill only upon the defenſive doing nothing againſt them:
yea whereas 12 Months were now expired ſince the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
made by his Majeſty concerning the <hi>Charles</hi> and
<hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. and nothing of ſatisfaction given; whereby the
ſaid Article, upon that account, was alſo expreſly broken by
them, and his Majeſty at liberty to have righted himſelf:
yet notwithſtanding he did not do it, and that though they
on the other hand, had (as aforeſaid) in relation to their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94181:53"/>
pretences, broken in upon the ſaid Article, indeavouring
to right themſelves by force within the time limited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereunto: Nor did his Majeſty intermeddle or give
order for the offering the leaſt offence to their Subjects, till
he certainly knew that <hi>De Ruyter</hi> had quitted that Coaſt and
work he was ſent hence about; and that his Majeſty had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
&amp; again demanded of the Ambaſſadour of this State,
reſiding in his Court, to be ſatisfied whether he was gone,
and upon what deſign, which he had reaſon to demand and
expect to be ſatisfied in: Firſt, becauſe the work was not
then done with thoſe of <hi>Algiers,</hi> and that this State had (as
is above ſhewn) engaged to his Majeſty that that Fleet
ſhould continue there till an iſſue thereof: And ſecondly,
becauſe that being in ſuch a manner gone away, 'twas not
to be imagined, in that conjuncture of Affairs, that it could
be upon any other account then to go to <hi>Guiny</hi> to fall upon
his Subjects there. Nor is it an anſwer to ſay, <hi>That their
Ambaſſadour did not know it:</hi> He was their Ambaſſadour,
and his Majeſty did demand it of him, and if they did not
think fit, either by him, or otherwiſe to ſatisfie his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
concerning the ſame, and conſidering their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they had put into his hands concerning <hi>Van Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi>
and yet in which they make ſuch Proteſtations to his
Majeſty, of proceeding ſo frankly with him; what could
he then conclude, but that while they were here amuſing
him under the notion of <hi>Van Campens</hi> going to <hi>Guiny,</hi> that
<hi>De Ruyter</hi> was gone thither to execute what was threatned
to be done by <hi>Van Campen.</hi> Moreover, that themſelves had
actually begun the ſtopping of ſhips in thoſe parts, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the ſhip from <hi>Gottenburg,</hi> bound for <hi>London:</hi> and
now, and not till now, did the King his Maſter intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
by way of Force; and yet only ſtopping and ſeizing
their ſhips, and that only till ſuch time as he ſhould come
to be ſatisfied concerning the deſignes and acting of <hi>De
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94181:53"/>
Ruyter,</hi> as was ſeveral times declared by him to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
of this State: Nor was any diſpoſition made of
any of the ſaid ſhips or their ladings, or any of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Prize until the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> O. S. which was
long after his Majeſty had certain News that <hi>De Ruyter</hi>
was arrived in <hi>Guiny,</hi> and had taken a whole Fleet of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
ſhips of his Subjects, unladen the Goods, and which
were ſhips that had not done any thing againſt this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and the ſaid ſhips were ſeized upon the 13 <hi>October,
O. S.</hi> and upon the 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, of the
ſame Moneth, he did unlade the ſame into his own ſhips:
whereas his Majeſties order for the ſeizing of the ſhips of
this Country, was not till the 9 of <hi>November</hi> following, of
the ſame <hi>ſtile,</hi> nor any ſhips ſtopped or ſeized thereupon
till a day or two after; ſo that <hi>De Ruyter</hi> had actually ſeized
and unladen a whole Fleet of <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips, long before
his Majeſty had ſo much as given order for the intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with any ſhips of this Countrey, or doing any thing
againſt them: Nor were any Letter of <hi>Mart</hi> granted by
his Majeſty, till long after they had been granted by this
State againſt his Subjects; nor Trade prohibited between
both Nations by him, till the like firſt done here. And
whereas the Deputies do ſo often in this Book charge his
Majeſty with having done what he did, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Denunciation or Declaration, he did not denounce
before hand to them, the doing of what was done by
<hi>Holmes,</hi> nor what was done in <hi>New Netherlands;</hi> nor could
he, theſe being actions done without his Order; but as to
what was done by his Order, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking and ſeizing of
their ſhips in theſe parts, to ſay that this was done without
any preceeding Denunciation, is like the reſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
in this their Book. Not to mention what paſſed
between his Majeſty and the Ambaſſadour of this State
upon this account: was not the <hi>Memorial</hi> of him the ſaid
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94181:54"/>
               <hi>Envoye</hi> to the States General of the 27 of <hi>July</hi> laſt, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His moſt Sacred Majeſty of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>&amp;c. being
deſirous to omit nothing that may in any wiſe contribute on
his part, for the prevention of any miſunderſtanding or
breach between Him and this State, hath by His laſt Poſt
expreſly commanded him His Envoye Extraordinary, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to their Lordſhips the Eſtates General of the</hi> United
Provinces; <hi>that His Majeſty hath given order to examine
the Complaints that have been made unto him in their
Name, againſt one certain Captain</hi> Holmes, <hi>for matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be done by him on the Coaſt of</hi> Guiny, <hi>and will upon
full information and hearing of both parties, do according
to Reaſon and Juſtice. But if their Lordſhips ſhall not think
fit to expect the doing thereof, but contrary to the ſtile and
practice of all Nations, and particularly of his Majeſty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, whom yet (to ſay no more) He hath not found
over-quick in the diſpatch of Juſtice towards his Subjects,
and expreſly againſt the letter of the Fourteenth Article of
the late Treaty with Him, having made their complaint,
ſhall think fit immediately to have recourſe to Force for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
they might as well have ſpared the labour of making
their Complaint, and the King his Maſter will hold himſelf
obliged to oppoſe Force to Force.</hi>
