         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LION's COMPLAINT
AGAINST
The Wild BEASTS of the Forreſt.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHen Fiſh and Fowl, and Wild Beaſts of the Wood,</l>
               <l>Thought, Acted, Spoke, and likewiſe Underſtood,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Bear of Rome</hi> brought forth a Whelp or Son,</l>
               <l>That was both Heir and King of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But O! that bloody <hi>Bitch,</hi> that's void of Fear,</l>
               <l>Forc'd him his Subject-Beaſts in pieces tear,</l>
               <l>Until a Herd of Foxes, Sheep and Geeſe,</l>
               <l>With other Grumblers, of the Golden Fleece,</l>
               <l>Went ſlily, and their Grief, with Mourning Eye,</l>
               <l>Made known unto a Neighbouring <hi>Lyon</hi> by,</l>
               <l>Who reſcu'd them out of the Tyrant's Paws,</l>
               <l>Secur'd their Lives, and did restore their Laws.</l>
               <l>But now theſe <hi>Bruits,</hi> that never chew the Cud,</l>
               <l>(Or rather Monſters of Ingratitude)</l>
               <l>They prove perfidious, falſe, and would devour</l>
               <l>Him whom they're bound by Nature to Adore:</l>
               <l>Wherefore the Royal Lyon, in diſdain,</l>
               <l>Againſt the thankleſs <hi>Beaſts</hi> doth thus complain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>AS I lay ſilent, coutching in my Den,</l>
               <l>Belov'd of Beaſts, of Fiſhes, Fowls and Men,</l>
               <l>A Herd of Bullocks, Foxes, Wolves and Hogs,</l>
               <l>With Maſtives, Mungrels, Curs, &amp; other Dogs,</l>
               <l>Approach'd my Court, with more than mournful eyes,</l>
               <l>And made my Den to Eccho with their Cries;</l>
               <l>A thing ſo ſtrange, to ſee ſuch beaſts agree,</l>
               <l>Surpriz'd my watchful <hi>Lioneſs</hi> and me.</l>
               <l>But, ſtupify'd, I ſtept aſide, and then</l>
               <l>I ſaw them beaſts, but rational like men.</l>
               <l>And as I ſtood amaz'd, with bended knee,</l>
               <l>One of the Drove, with Tears, Petition'd me.</l>
               <l>Brave <hi>Prince,</hi> deſcended of the ſtem of <hi>Kings,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of whoſe great Valour every Forreſt rings,</l>
               <l>Vouchſafe to hear our more than ſad complaint,</l>
               <l>Which we, in ſtrains of ſorrow, do preſent.</l>
               <l>We're chas'd from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> our Native Soil,</l>
               <l>Poor, destitute, and broke with Grief and Toil;</l>
               <l>Our King's turn'd Tyrant both and Cannibal,</l>
               <l>And, in a moment, would devour us all.</l>
               <l>He's got the <hi>Bear of Rome</hi> upon his back,</l>
               <l>And now outdoes the Inquiſition-Rack.</l>
               <l>Our ſelves he tears to pieces, and our Dams,</l>
               <l>He Heads and Hangs, and after burns in Flames.</l>
               <l>Our Young he keeps in Arms, at every Tree,</l>
               <l>To kill their Fathers, if occaſion be;</l>
               <l>And, if he takes offence at any Whelp,</l>
               <l>He ties him to a Rope, and makes him yelp.</l>
               <l>Our Lives, our Laws, our Liberties and all,</l>
               <l>Unleſs ſupported ſuddenly will fall,</l>
               <l>For he doth roar and ſwear that we ſhall go</l>
               <l>To <hi>Italy,</hi> and kiſs the Dragon's Toe.</l>
               <l>Now, all the Beaſts of <hi>Lebanon</hi> declare,</l>
               <l>That, after him, your <hi>Lioneſs</hi> is Heir;</l>
               <l>But he, to fruſtrate both your Rights, hath bought</l>
               <l>A little <hi>Cub,</hi> which he hath ſlily brought</l>
               <l>Into his Den; and now doth ſwear that he</l>
               <l>Shall Heir the Wood, from Shrub to Cedar-Tree;</l>
               <l>Although he looks not like a Lion's Whelp,</l>
               <l>But ſome <hi>Curs Puppy,</hi> if you heard him yelp.</l>
               <l>My Dam, a Mid-Bitch of a noble kin,</l>
               <l>Can tell you how the <hi>Lioneſs</hi> lay in.</l>
               <l>Now, mighty <hi>Prince,</hi> this is our woful Caſe,</l>
               <l>Sick at the heart, tho chearful in the face;</l>
               <l>Protect us from the bloody <hi>Roman Elf,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In ſaving us, you do but ſerve your ſelf.</l>
               <l>I ſtood amaz'd, and nothing had to ſay,</l>
               <l>But drave the Proud, Rebellious beaſts away,</l>
               <l>Not thinking that the <hi>Lion</hi> had the Face</l>
               <l>To cheat his own, to ſerve the <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Race.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But ſtill they lurked near my pleaſant Den,</l>
               <l>And with their cries moleſted birds and men,</l>
               <l>Till I (inform'd that what they ſpoke was true)</l>
               <l>Call'd them <hi>poor Bruits,</hi> and no <hi>Rebellious Crew:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I muſter'd then my forces of the Wood,</l>
               <l>And ſwam the Sea, to do the poor beaſts good,</l>
               <l>Intending things to tryal firſt to bring,</l>
               <l>And reconcile the Subject to his King.</l>
               <l>But, when I entrance in the Forreſt made,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Lion, Lioneſs,</hi> and <hi>Cub,</hi> were fled,</l>
               <l>And, in their flight, t'accompliſh their deſire,</l>
               <l>Set all the Trees of <hi>Lebanon</hi> in fire.</l>
               <l>I quench'd the flames, conven'd the beaſts, to ſee</l>
               <l>What was their aim, and who their King ſhould be;</l>
               <l>They proffer'd me the Crown, but I deny'd</l>
               <l>So weighty Care, whilſt all the Herd reply'd,</l>
               <l>Great Prince, if you refuſe to be our King,</l>
               <l>This Forreſt to <hi>Democracy</hi> we'll bring,</l>
               <l>We can chooſe whom we will for King, now, ſince</l>
               <l>Our former's turn'd an <hi>Abdicated Prince;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And, tho you take our proffer in diſdain,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Lebanon</hi> he's ne'r be King again.</l>
               <l>Thus with their wheedling, cringing at my feet,</l>
               <l>I did accept the weighty, ſowre, and ſweet;</l>
               <l>But when I had this <hi>Diadem</hi> put on,</l>
               <l>And ſcarce was ſeated on the Royal Throne,</l>
               <l>The old <hi>Red Lion,</hi> with a crew of Dogs,</l>
               <l>Invaded me, to kill my harmleſs Hogs:</l>
               <l>But I, in Perſon, went for their defence,</l>
               <l>And chas'd the Red, Old, Raging <hi>Lion</hi> thence.</l>
               <l>All that I had, both Fortune, Life and Blood,</l>
               <l>I hazarded, to do my Subjects good;</l>
               <l>And, in returning home, I did redreſs</l>
               <l>Their injuries, and cur'd their grievances,</l>
               <l>And, ever ſince, have ready been to grant</l>
               <l>All their Requeſts, according to their want.</l>
               <l>I'm ſtriving now their Int'reſts to advance,</l>
               <l>To ſave them harmleſs from the <hi>Bear of France,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That Beast of Prey, <hi>the Apoſtate of</hi> Rome,</l>
               <l>The Scourge of <hi>Europe,</hi> Curſe of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I'm not profuſe, to keep the Forreſt poor,</l>
               <l>I keep no Cracks, no Wanton Bitch nor Whore;</l>
               <l>I lead the Lame, I help the beaſts that Halt,</l>
               <l>I cover Crimes, and pardon every fault;</l>
               <l>And ever ſince I to their Forreſt came,</l>
               <l>I have ſtill ſeem'd more <hi>Lion,</hi> than a <hi>Lamb.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And yet, altho they have their whole deſire,</l>
               <l>Ungrateful beaſts! againſt me do conſpire.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Leopard,</hi> and <hi>Panther,</hi> firſt were they,</l>
               <l>Who with their ſugared Words for aid did pray,</l>
               <l>Now they're the firſt that ſtrive me to betray.</l>
               <l>They make my <hi>Star of Vertue</hi> ſeem a <hi>Comet,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And, Dog-like, would drink up their own Vomit.</l>
               <l>Now let all beaſts, that in the Forreſt be,</l>
               <l>Be Judge betwixt my cruel bruits and me.</l>
               <l>But hear, proud beaſts; now, ſince my paw is in,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Acts of Grace</hi> your favour cannot win,</l>
               <l>I'll imp my Rage with <hi>Furies,</hi> like your ſelves,</l>
               <l>And be reveng'd on all deceitful <hi>Elves.</hi>

               <l>And run no further upon Juſtice ſcore.</l>
