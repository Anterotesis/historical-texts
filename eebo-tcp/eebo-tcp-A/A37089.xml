            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Glories</hi> of your
Name, make me
<hi>ambitious</hi> to give
you a <hi>testimony</hi> of my duty &amp;
observance. There be some
whose <hi>vain-glory</hi> prompts
them to think they by <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56653:3"/>
honor their <hi>Patrons,</hi>
but the whole world will
judge me free from such <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
when they shall perceive
I have made my addresses to
a Person, who besides his
height of <hi>Nobility,</hi> is arrived
at such a <hi>sublimity</hi> of Worth,
Vertue, and Learning, that
not onely the greatest <hi>Wits</hi> of
the Age are bound to <hi>honor</hi>
him; but must confess they
receive their <hi>splendor</hi> and <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre</hi>
from him.</p>
            <p>Yet thus (my Lord) I make
my self <hi>guilty</hi> of an almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable
<hi>presumption:</hi> the
<hi>wisest</hi> of men may as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:56653:3"/>
somewhat worthy a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,</hi>
as I any thing which may
<hi>deserve</hi> your LORDSHIPS
<hi>thoughts.</hi> It is not fit a <hi>Pigmy</hi>
should call down a IOVE to
protect him; but where there
is so much <hi>worth,</hi> there must
needs be an insuperable <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
nor can he be justly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
who onely <hi>aspires</hi> at the
influence of a <hi>benevolent</hi> Star.</p>
            <p>I want the <hi>confidence</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
your Lordship to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi>
this VVork, the <hi>honor</hi>
will be sufficient if you <hi>accept</hi>
it, as a pledge of that <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>
which all men are <hi>bound</hi>
to pay you. I know your
<pb facs="tcp:56653:4"/>
Lordship not only to be vers't
in all <hi>History,</hi> but (to your
<hi>glory</hi> be it spoken) to have
always studied the most <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
Authors. And <hi>History</hi> is
indeed a <hi>Treasure</hi> not onely
<hi>enriching</hi> mens mindes with
noble thoughts, but <hi>enanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
them to great and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Actions.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships endeavors
to make an <hi>Alliance</hi> between
the two Renowned Crowns
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> may
justly claim all that can be
said of that Kingdom, as a
due <hi>Offering.</hi> This, though
but a <hi>Breviate</hi> of the Story
<pb facs="tcp:56653:4"/>
of it, may perchance <hi>contain</hi>
somewhat, though not at all
<hi>worthy</hi> your Lordship, yet
not wholly <hi>unworthy</hi> observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I hope may <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade</hi>
your Generosity and

               <hi>England,</hi> my Lord, and

great wisdom; but should I
undertake to praise all those
noble Vertues for which you
deserve their loves, that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
which <hi>ballances</hi> all your
actions; that <hi>Prudence</hi> which
a whole Nation hath <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi>
that <hi>Magnanimity</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:56653:5"/>
hath rendred you <hi>unalterable</hi>
in all the frowns and smiles
of <hi>Fortune;</hi> that <hi>Liberality</hi>
which hath made you <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi>
and that <hi>Temperance</hi>
which shown in the height
of <hi>Heavens,</hi> and <hi>Heavens-Vice-gerents</hi>
favours, hath
made you <hi>God-like,</hi> I should
be enforced to unite the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<hi>Encomiums,</hi> and lay
them down as a due tribute,
at the feet of your <hi>thrice-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned</hi>
Fame.</p>
            <p>But (my Lord) I dare one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Let it suffice then,
that whilst all strive to offer

            <head>A
Short and Compendious
HISTORY
Of the
KINGDOM
Of
PORTUGAL</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Proverb very vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
amongst them, terming the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses,
Pocos y Locos,</hi> few and fools,
spoken I suppose rather out of derision,
and disdain of that Nation, then that its peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and inhabitants really are so, for whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall read their actions, will judge them to
be managed with as much prudence, as the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> can boast of; nor will any one believe
that they could bring to perfection so great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
as they have done with onely a
<hi>simple</hi> valor.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I believe them to be less numerous
then the <hi>Castilians,</hi> and yet I am not of the
opinion that they are so few, or their Kingdom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56653:10"/>
so inconsiderable, as the <hi>Spanish</hi> Proverb seems
to make them, which one may easily imagine,
when one considers that the <hi>Romans</hi> accounted
<hi>Lusitania</hi> (that is <hi>Portugal</hi> by it self, when its
bounds did not extend so far as now they do,
and without the addition of <hi>Algarve,</hi> or <hi>Regnum
Algarbiorum)</hi> to be one third part of <hi>Spain;</hi>
much less can we think it so now, when not
onely its proper bounds are enlarged, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve</hi> added, besides
the Island in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> sea, and their great
conquests in <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the Kingdom it self, and its
original various fortunes after the decay and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was it subject
unto, before it was setled under a Prince of its
own. The <hi>Alani</hi> were the first that preyed upon
it, and endeavored to plant in it, but had
scarce begun to do so, but themselves were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out by the <hi>Swemans,</hi> and constrained to
go seek another habitation; these for some time
enjoyed it peaceably, making <hi>Braga</hi> their Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
City, till in the general Inundation of the
overflowing <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> they with the
rest of that part of the continent, which is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed
by the sea, and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
became vassals to these irresistable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
who living a long time in quiet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
their conquest, and were the first that in
these parts entertained the Christian Religion,
till the <hi>Moors</hi> like a more violent flood, fell in
upon them, and with the greatest part of <hi>Spain,</hi>
possessed themselves likewise of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56653:10"/>
But some parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> after many years sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
strugling for their liberty, this Kingdom
was in part recovered by the King of <hi>Castile,</hi>
and by them enjoyed, till at length it gained a
King of its own, the maner thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the second Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom
some affirm to be Nephew to <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bolloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne,</hi>
(though others differ both in the person and
his alliance to him) flying from the fury of <hi>Henry</hi>
the fifth Emperor, came into <hi>Spain,</hi> where (moved
with a generous emulation of his Uncle, who
was gone to the conquest of <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> offered
his service the subjection of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and in
short time arrived by his valorous atchievements
against those enemies of the Christian Religion,
grew into so much repute with <hi>Alfonso</hi> the 6.
King of <hi>Castile,</hi> that he gave him his base
daughter <hi>Teresia</hi> in marriage, with his whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quists
in <hi>Portugal</hi> for her dower, though with no
other title then that of <hi>Counte,</hi> or Earl, some
further addition he made to his Dominions, and
in the year 1094. had a son, who after his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
was named <hi>Alphonso,</hi> at last overborn
with the burden of seventy seven years, he
died in the year 1112.</p>
            <div type="biography">
               <head>ALFONSO the I.
First King of Portugal.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALfonso</hi> his son, who from his very child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
had been bred up under his father
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56653:11"/>
in Military excercise, after his death valorously
prosecuted his victories against the <hi>Moors,</hi> and
against the Kings of <hi>Leon;</hi> which Wars he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with so much courage as was admirable
in a Prince so young. The Count of <hi>Trastama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rense</hi>
despising his youth, took to wife his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Teresia,</hi> and from that marriage drew occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to wage War with him; <hi>Alfonso</hi> to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his sleightings, cheerfully encountred him,
and after the diverse accidents of several bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
took him prisoner, and forced him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
his liberty to give him to wife his sister
<hi>Uracca,</hi> with that part of the land for her Dower,
which had been the occasion of the War. Yet
some there be that differ both in the occasion of
the marriage and the contest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonso</hi> likewise fought several battels with
his Grand-father <hi>Alfonso</hi> the 6. King of <hi>Castile,</hi>
and in one battel took him prisoner near one of
his Castles called <hi>Arcos del val de vez,</hi> upon
whose release he had conferred upon him the
title of Duke of <hi>Portugal;</hi> he afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his forces against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> from
whom he took <hi>Leirida, Torre Naova,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other places.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King <hi>Ismaurus,</hi> who was the
most powerful amongst all the <hi>Mauritamans,</hi>
calling to his assistance four other Kings, with
an Army of four hundred thousand men, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Portugal,</hi> but his fortune corresponded not
with his numbers, for <hi>Alfonso</hi> encountring this
great power with a small Army, overthrew them,
and slew, or took prisoners all the five Kings;

bore five Escutchions in his Arms though others
are pleased to affirm it was in memory of the

               <p>The soldiers made proud with this ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>raordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
success, thinking the title of <hi>Duke</hi> too
low for their Commander, saluted <hi>Alphonso</hi>
with the tile of King, which <hi>Alphonso</hi> accepted;
and returning home enriched with spoils, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
himself to the exercise of his Regal power,
by calling a general Council of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
to wit, the Clergy, Nobility, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
for the better establishing (by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the whole people) that Crown upon his
head, which the Soldiers love had conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his merit.</p>
               <p>This general Assembly being met in the City
of <hi>Lamego,</hi> and in the Church of St. <hi>Almacave,</hi>
the King came thither, and seating himself
upon the Royal Throne, but as yet unadorned
with his Ensigns of Majesty, according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deputy <hi>Don Lorenzo Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negas,</hi>
spake to the Estates as followeth, You
are here assembled by the Authority of King
<hi>Alphonso,</hi> to see the Popes Letters and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
to confirm him for your King: Whereat
the whole Estates with one voice cried, We
will that he shall be our King. Upon which the
Deputy demanded, shall he only be your King,
and not his sons after him? They all answered,
he so long as he lives shall be our King, and
after his death his sons shall succeed. Give him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56653:12"/>
then the Royal Ensigns, said the Deputy. They
answered, we give them in the name of God,
and therewithall the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Braga</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Crown upon the Kings head, and gave
him the Scepter in his hand, with all accustomed
Ceremonies; which done, his Majesty rose up,
and drawing his sword spake to this effect,
<hi>Blessed be God that hath been my helper, with this
sword I have delivered you, and overcome our
enemies, and now that you have made me your
King, let us make Laws for the government of the
Kingdom.</hi> They answered, so we will, dread
Soveraign, we will make such Laws as shall
seem good and convenient to you, and we and
all our children and posterity will be wholly at
your command.</p>
               <p>And accordingly several Laws were then and
there immediately made; the sum of which
were:</p>
               <p>1. That King <hi>Alfonso</hi> should be Master of the
Kingdom, and that after him there might be no
troubles in the choosing of a King, his Son should
reign after him, his Grand-childe, and so from
Father to Son in <hi>secula seculorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That if the eldest Son should dye during the
life of the Father, the next brother should be King,
and so forward.</p>
               <p>3. That if the King should dye without issue,
having a brother he should succeed, but not his
sons without consent of the Estates.</p>
               <p>4. That if the King should have onely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the eldest should be Queen after her father,
upon condition that she be married to a native of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56653:12"/>
Kingdom, and that he be a Nobleman, who should
not have the power to take upon him the name of
King, until he had a son born, nor should he till
then wear a Crown on his head, or take the right
hand of his wife.</p>
               <p>5. That it should be for ever held for a Law
among the <hi>Portugals,</hi> that the Kings eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
should marry a Native of the Country, that so
the Crown might never descend to Forreigners, and
that in case she should marry a Forreign Prince,
she should be excluded from her right of succession,
for they would not have that Kingdom, which
themselves by their own valor, and by the effusion
of their own blood, without the aid or assistance of
any strangers, had made, so go out of the race of
the <hi>Portugals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Crown by these Laws and Statutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<hi>Alfonso</hi> as he was advanced in Title,
so he addicted himself to higher and greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,
in five moneths siege he added the
great and populous City of <hi>Lisbone</hi> to his Crown,
not without the loss of thousands of valiant sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and as many hazards of his own life;
some affirm that in this War the number of the
slain amounted to no less then two hundred
thousand men.</p>
               <p>This magnanimous King likewise made innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
acquists both of one side and the other
of the <hi>Tagus,</hi> he slew both the Kings of <hi>Leon,</hi>
and <hi>Castile,</hi> but at length wounded in a battel,
he was no longer able to follow the Wars in
person, for what with his wound, and what
with age, being now sixty six years old, he had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56653:13"/>
not strength enough to mount on horseback, he
therefore bequeathed his command over his
Armies to his eldest son <hi>Sanctius</hi> or <hi>Sancho,</hi> but
still reserving to himself the superintendency
of all.</p>
               <p>Having thus relinquished the Wars, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
himself wholly to works of piety, and
to endeavor the flourishing of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
he built within his Kingdom one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Churches and Monasteries, all
which he enriched with great revenues.</p>
               <p>Amongst the rest he built that at <hi>Conimbria,</hi>
from whence that famous University, called,
<hi>Academia Conimbricense</hi> had its Original. In
this Monastery, called that of the <hi>Holy Cross,</hi>
he died, at ninety one years of age, on the 9. of
<hi>December</hi> Anno 1185. and here he remained,
buried in a little Tomb, scituated in an Angle
of that Church, till such time as King <hi>Emanuel,</hi>
affected with the Fame of his Sanctity, erected
for him a most stately Monument, which is at
this day to be seen.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Uracca</hi> his first wife, daughter to the
Count <hi>Trastamarense,</hi> he had no children, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
at fifty two years of age, and in the seventh
year of his reign, he took to wife <hi>Mafalda,</hi> sister
to <hi>Amadeo</hi> Earl of <hi>Morenna,</hi> by whom he had
many children, <hi>Henry</hi> the first died in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
<hi>Sancho</hi> who succeeded him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<hi>Uracca</hi> who was married to <hi>Ferdinando</hi>
King of <hi>Leon,</hi> though this match was again made
void, the Pope not approving of it; <hi>Therasia,</hi>
whom some Historians have likewise called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56653:13"/>
married to <hi>Phillip</hi> the first Earl of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
He had likewise diverse natural children,
amongst whom one named <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> who was
great Master of the Knights of <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Alphonso</hi> was certainly a great soldier,
a valiant Captain, and a magnanimous King;
in all his words and actions there appeared a
kinde of Majesty, and sublimity of minde; his
liberality and justice made him feared by his
enemies, and adored by his subjects; strength
of body, and greatness of minde, concurred in
him to make him the most worthy and admired
of the age he lived in; he never undertook any
War, but either to right his injured subjects, or
to propagate the Christian Religion; amongst
his greatest facts of Arms he never forgot acts of
piety, but always before any battel used with
vows and prayers, to beg the protection of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
He died, having arrived at the highest
pitch of glory, wept for by his people, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the very <hi>Moors</hi> themselves, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him; thus topt with all triumph, happy in
a numerous and as generous an issue, weary of
worldly vanities; he departed this life, in hopes
to receive in heaven the reward of his piety and
vertue.</p>

Second King of Portugal.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAncho</hi> his eldest son (indeed the onely legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
son he had living) succeeded to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso,</hi>
he was born at <hi>Conimbria</hi> the 11. of
<hi>November</hi> Anno 1154. where he was likewise
educated until the fourteenth year of his age in
all those studies and exercises, which are proper
for a Prince born to command; he afterwards
profited under his fathers tutorage in the Art
Military, in which emulating his fathers valor,
and greatness, he did things worthy of himself,
gaining love from the soldiery, and respect from
the people; he accompanied his father in three
Victories, in which he nobly adventured his
life.</p>
               <p>His father being dead, he took upon him the
government of the Kingdom, and was Crowned
the 12. of <hi>December</hi> 1185. three days after his
fathers death, being aged two and thirty years,
and finding the Kingdom at the beginning of
his reign freed from the incursions of the <hi>Moors,</hi>
he applied himself wholly to make the peace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by his Kingdom, profitable to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
he caused a multitude of fields to be til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
most of which were before a receptacle for
wilde beasts, and part of them laid waste by the
late Wars, with so much diligence did he addict
himself to these things, that by the vulgar he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56653:14"/>
was called the <hi>King of Husbandmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He applied himself afterwards with the same
industry to restore publique edifices and stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
he rebuilt all Castles which had either
been destroyed by the <hi>Moors,</hi> or spoiled by
other accidents of the War; he restored the
Cities, Towns, and Fortresses, to their pristine
splendor, enriching them with new edifices,
and supplying them with new inhabitants; he
gave likewise great Revenues to all the orders
of Knight-hood, but principally to that of <hi>Saint
Giacomo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilest thus he took care of his subjects good,
and the increasing the Revenue of his Crown,
there were driven by contrary winds and raging
seas into the Port of <hi>Lisbone</hi> a fleet of thirteen
sail of ships belonging to several Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
going to the Holy War, with the assistance
of these King <hi>Sancho,</hi> invaded the Kingdom of
<hi>Algarve,</hi> then possessed by the Moors, making
this compact with the Christian Princes that
commanded the Navy, that they should enjoy
the whole spoil of the enemy, whilest he reserved
for himself onely the Cities and the glory.</p>
               <p>The Impress proved not very difficult, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the City of <hi>Sylva</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the
Kingdom, made a long and obstinate resistance,
for at length it yielded; but he enjoyed not
quietly the possession of this Kingdom for the
<hi>Moors,</hi> uniting themselves to revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
done to their Nation, he was constrain'd
to flie to a defence of himself so much the more
dangerous, by how much the more unequal; and

lost likewise his native kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> if
God of his mercy had not bridled and curbed
the fury of the <hi>Moors</hi> by a merciless devouring
Pestilence, which made them with the loss of
two hundred thousand soldiers, return flying
home.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Sancho</hi> was no sooner freed from
these dangers, but another almost over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his kingdom, by continual rains, most part
of the land was overflown, by reason of which
it not being possible to till the ground, a famine
ensued, and that at length brought forth the
plague, so that the whole kingdom was almost
destroyed, the Cities and Towns were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated,
the Country remained unmanured;
nor was there to be seen over the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
other but spectacles of ruine and misery.</p>
               <p>This sad condition of the Christians made the
<hi>Moors</hi> once more adventure in the field, and
without any resistance possess themselves of the
greatest part of the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve;</hi> the
City of <hi>Sylva</hi> was rendred at discretion, whilest
the necessities of the King forced him to buy
five years of truce, or cessation, upon low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>In the mean time he would have sent assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of ships and men to the Christian Princes,
who fought against the <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Palestina,</hi>
but the miseries of his kingdom would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him, yet he assigned to the Knights, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars,
and Hospitallers, who were sometime
before come into <hi>Portugal,</hi> great Revenues,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56653:15"/>
giving unto them many Castles and Lands.</p>
               <p>The truce was not yet expired when the King
either finding, or taking occasion to break it,
in the midst of winter assaulted the Cities of the
<hi>Moors</hi> with so much fury, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi>
not expecting so sudden an assault, were easily
driven, not onely out of the Confines of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
but out of the best part of the kingdom of
<hi>Algarve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Sancho</hi> had for wife the daughter of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
Berengario,</hi> Count of <hi>Barchinona,</hi> called
<hi>Aldonsa,</hi> by her he had nine children, of whom
eight outlived their father, to wit, three sons
and five daughters, the sons were <hi>Alfonso,</hi> who
succeeded in the kingdom; <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> who for
his singular vertues was called into <hi>Flanders</hi> to
marry the Countess <hi>Ioanna;</hi> and <hi>Pietro</hi> who was
Count <hi>Iregelense,</hi> and Lord of the <hi>Bateares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The five daughters were <hi>Therasia, Mefalda,
Sancha, Bianca,</hi> and <hi>Beringhella; Therasia</hi> was
married with <hi>Alfonso</hi> King of <hi>Leon</hi> her Cousin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german,
but this marriage not being assented
to by the Pope, was esteemed void, so that after
having born three children, she was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>Portugal,</hi> where being shut up in a
Monastery, she spent the rest of her life in pious
meditations: it is reported by some that her
Sepulchre being opened in the year 1617. her
body was found whole, and as it were incorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that many who were sick, or otherwise
had incurable diseases, by vowing to her, and
touching her corps, were healed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mafalda</hi> was espoused to <hi>Henry</hi> the first, King
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56653:16"/>
of <hi>Castile,</hi> although allied to him in a forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
degree, wherefore this marriage was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
declared void; and she emulating her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
built a Monastery of the <hi>Cistercian</hi> Order,
and is reported likewise to have done many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
particularly in the year 1627. when her
Tomb was opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancha</hi> the third daughter became a Nun of
the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who lived about this
time. <hi>Bianca</hi> and <hi>Beringella</hi> died young, and
were buried in <hi>Conimbria,</hi> right against their
fathers Tombe, though some write otherwise.</p>
               <p>After the death of the Queen <hi>Aldonsa,</hi> which
happened in the year 1138. King <hi>Sancho</hi> gave
himself over to the love of diverse Ladies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

most of them his greatest vexation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
for the pleasures of the senses do not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
but in the sence of grief. At last arrived
at the age of 57. years, in the 26. year of his
reign, oppressed in <hi>Conimbria</hi> by an incurable
disease, he took leave of this world.</p>
               <p>He was buried in the Church of the <hi>Holy
Cross,</hi> on the left side of the Altar, in the
great Chappel, where King <hi>Emanuel</hi> built him a
Sepulchre, like to that of his father, he left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
riches, which by his Will he divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all his children, making no difference
between the legitimate and the illegitimate; he
by his Will supplicated Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the
fourth to be his Executor, for which he left in
Legacy a hundred weight of Gold, a gift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt worth his pains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56653:16"/>
King <hi>Sancho</hi> was for vertue and for goodness
singular in his age, a worthy son of so renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a father; he proved fortunate in the utmost
events of War, and then did his triumphs flow
in upon him when he dispaired of Victory; he
left it yet in doubt whether he were more wise,
or more valiant; he always snowed himself so
great an enemy to sloth and idleness, that to
avoid it he would not disdain sometimes to
throw down the Scepter, and hold the plow;
Fortune who was his friend in War, was his foe
in Peace, for then, besides the vexation that
he could not vex his enemies, he was likewise
enforced to bear the injuries of the Land, Sea,
and Skies; in sum, he was a King worthy the
greatest <hi>Incomiums,</hi> if he had not too much
drowned all his other vertues in illicite Loves.</p>

first, he was born in <hi>Conimbria</hi> on St.
<hi>Georges</hi> day anno 1185. At 27. years old he was
Crowned King with the envy of his brothers,
who little younger then he, could hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
themselves within the bounds of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and to their discontents did the Legacies
left by <hi>Sancho,</hi> give new motives for <hi>Alphonso,</hi>
either out of avaritious desire of riches, or out of
obstinacy, detained from them a great part
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56653:17"/>
of what was left them by their father.</p>
               <p>These sinister thoughts of the then Prince
<hi>Alphonso,</hi> were discerned by his father before his
death, which made him leave to the brothers,
beside some Cities and Castles, five hundred
thousand Crowns in gold.</p>
               <p>But scarce was his father dead, but he began to
contend with his brothers and sisters about their
inheritance, and because his brothers were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into <hi>Elginera</hi> and <hi>Alenquar</hi> Fortresses, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them by their father, he under pretence
that they could not be allienated from the
Crown, gathered together an Army to possess
himself of them, which he easily performed, his
brothers wanting money to hire soldiers, and so
not being able to make the least resistance.</p>
               <p>His brothers thus driven out of the kingdom,
fled to the Pope for redress, then in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
because he then pursued no other interest
but justice, who commanded <hi>Alfonso</hi> to remit
the difference to indifferent Judges, who neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to obey, chose rather to accommodate
the business with indifferent Judges, then to run
the hazard of a sentence.</p>
               <p>He employed himself afterwards by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Matthew</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> to fight
against the <hi>Moors,</hi> and though these came assisted
with ninety five thousand men, yet were they
forced to yield the Victory to him, with the
loss of thirty thousand soldiers, and four Kings
who were slain in the battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonso</hi> for some years prosecuted this War,
but in time he grew so extream fat, that he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56653:17"/>
was unable to perform, not only those great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
incumbent on a soldier, but every sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
motion of the body; yet for all that he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to apply himself with extream diligence
to prosecute the greatest affairs of State, and
where he could not in person he present, to send
such commands as shewed him to be both of
great experience and wisdom.</p>
               <p>He married with <hi>Uracca</hi> daughter to <hi>Alfonso</hi>
the eighth (or as others say the ninth) King of
<hi>Castile,</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> or <hi>Elinor,</hi> daughter to
<hi>Henry</hi> the second King of <hi>England,</hi> by her he
had divers children, the first was <hi>Sancho,</hi> who
succeeded his father in the kingdom. <hi>Alfonso</hi>
the second son, whom by right of his wife, was
chosen Duke of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and afterwards came
to be King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The third son was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who obtained the principality of
<hi>Serpa,</hi> and married <hi>Sancia Fernandez,</hi> daughter
of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Count of <hi>Castile.</hi> The fourth died
a childe, called <hi>Vincenzo.</hi> The last was a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
called <hi>Leonora,</hi> and was married to the
King of <hi>Dacia. Alfonso</hi> arrived to the eight
and fortieth year of his age, and one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of his kingdom, when in the year 1233.
he was constrained to pay the last debt to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He was buried in <hi>Alobaccia</hi> in a little
Church built by himself, more for devotion then
magnificence. But after many years the Abbot
<hi>Giorgio di Melo</hi> causing that little Church to be
demolished, carried his bones to that of St.
<hi>Vincenzo,</hi> where they now repose in a most
sumptuous sepulcher.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56653:18"/>
Under this King (as many affirm) lived for
certain time St. <hi>Antonio,</hi> Protector of the City
of <hi>Padona,</hi> a Saint held in great veneration
among the Roman Catholiques, he was a native

               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonso,</hi> taking away his extream fatness, was
a man of a very comely presence, and of singular
eloquence, his nature did make him pleasant
with all, but onely those of his own blood, which
fault in him did much diminish his subjects
love, and that general respect was due to him;
though he was a man noted for covetousness,
yet he oftentimes gave great gifts to his friends,
and always consumed the greatest part of the
revenue of the kingdom. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> while
his father was alive, did extreamly desire him
for their King but did not at all now lament his
death; either because new things always please
the people, or else because he after his fathers
death, shewed himself indifferent from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or from what they thought him; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not being wholly like his Progenitors, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed

<hi>Alfanso,</hi> was born in <hi>Conimbria</hi> the eighth
day of <hi>September</hi> 1207. bringing from the womb
such mortal infirmities, as made most believe
he would sooner arrive at the grave then the
Crown, his mother having tried all humane
remedies, applied her self to divine, making a
vow to God that if he lived past his adolescency,
she would make him pass the hood of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which vow she afterwards inviolably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
whence he was by the vulgar as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
in words, as judgement, called <hi>Sancho
Cucullato,</hi> or the hooded <hi>Sancho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He took upon him the administration of the
Scepter at twenty six years of age, not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the footsteps of his Predecessors, in studying
ways to govern the kingdom, but spending all
his time either in Hot-house, or in a Bath, or
inventing other ways to recover his health.</p>
               <p>Thus his infirmity having rendred him unapt
to command, and the weakness of his body
having likewise weakned his wit and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he left both the rule of the kingdom and
of himself to Ministers, who governing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56653:19"/>
to their proper affections, let him enjoy no
more then the bare name of King.</p>
               <p>He joyned himself in marriage with <hi>Messa
Lopez,</hi> who although she were of blood Royal,
yet was by much too inferior a match for King
<hi>Sancho,</hi> so much the rather in that she was
widow to <hi>Alvaro de Castro,</hi> a Cavalier of an
ancient and Royal family, but not to compare
with the Kings of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he himself assented to this match, more
to satisfie his favorites, then to any affection
that he had to it; which made the new Queen
either to show her self grateful to those had
wish'd her so well, or rather because she nurst
in her bosom some dishonest desire, applied her
self extreamly to favor the favorites of the
King.</p>
               <p>And these made proud by the love both of
the King and Queen, omitted no way to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the subjects, to the prejudice of justice,
to the destruction of the State: many of the
prime Nobility made their complaints to the
King, representing to him the calamities of
the people, the oppression of the Nobles, and
the ruine of the kingdom, if he did not with a
resolute hand put a stop to the rashness of those
wicked men, who were bringing a deluge of
miseries upon his Dominions.</p>
               <p>The King at these complaints was extreamly
moved, and overcome by the goodness of his
own nature, had resolved to chastise to publick
a crime with a publique punishment; but the
Queen with her Artifices easily changed the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56653:19"/>
opinion of her husband, and made him believe
that those accusations proceeded from envy,
not from truth, whereupon laying the complaints
of the other aside, these State-mothes onely
triumph in his love and in his faith.</p>
               <p>This made several Prelates incontaminated
with their own interest, but moved out of a
real affection to their Country, acquaint the
Pope with the weakness of the King, and the
plots of the Queen, adjoyning that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was celebrated in a prohibited degree,
there being between them too near consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that nevertheless they had not sought
to the <hi>Apostolick</hi> seat for a dispensation.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, with exhortations
and admonitions prefixed a time to king <hi>Sancho</hi>
to free himself from his wife, and withall to
this purpose sends as his Legat Apostolique, the
Bishop of <hi>Sabina.</hi> At the appearance of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
the King made show of an humble and
ready obedience; but he being returned, he
again receives his Queen into his embraces, from
whence the simple believed that he was either
bewitched, or had had some amorous potion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
to him.</p>
               <p>The Queens favorites now again restored,
gave themselves over to exercise the greatest
insolencies imaginable, they despoiled the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
disposed Offices at pleasure, made Justice
it self follow their humors, nor did there remain
any thing either humane, or divine, which was
not contaminated either by their cruelty, or
avarice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56653:20"/>
Hereupon a great part of the Commonalty
no longer able to comport their insolencies, led
on by <hi>Rannondo Viego,</hi> took Arms, and coming
in a tumultuous maner to the Palace, forced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Queen, carrying her prisoner to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
upon the confines of the kingdom, where
they did not fear neither the authority, nor
force of the King.</p>
               <p>And because not onely the licentiousness of
the Queen, but the weakness of the King, did
concur to the destruction of the kingdom; some
Prelates had again recourse to the Pope, who
in a Synod then sitting, with the consent of all,
decreed, That <hi>Alfonso</hi> brother of the King,
should be called from <hi>Bologna</hi> to govern the
kingdom, and to remedy those disorders which
had near brought it to utter destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonso</hi> comes, and with Arms in his hand,
possesses himself of the greatest part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whilest <hi>Sancho</hi> seeing himself abandoned
of all, and hopeless of any help from the <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Army, cast down in minde, he gives leave
to those few soldiers which were with him, to
depart, and retires to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where addicting
himself wholly to devotion, with an admirable
patience, seems to rejoyce at his private life.</p>
               <p>Being setled in <hi>Toledo,</hi> he dispences with a
large hand to the poor those riches he had
brought from <hi>Portugal;</hi> he builds a little Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
wherein day and night with uninterrupted
supplications, he recommends himself to God,
and implores his mercy; there never issuing out
of his mouth a word of resentment, or grief, for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56653:20"/>
his change of condition; and although provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by the insolencies of some who despised
Royal Majesty without a kingdom, he never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
himself but in words of mildness and
goodness.</p>
               <p>Whilest he in <hi>Toledo</hi> exercised these actions of
true patience, many of his Subjects did demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
signs of as great fidelity. The Governors
left by him would never abandon his service, nor
yield up those places they had received in charge
from him, neither could the prayers of their
fellow-subjects, nor the spiritual thundrings of
his Holiness the Pope, nor the vigorous Arms
of Don <hi>Alfonso,</hi> remove them from their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
with a generous faith they sustained all
the Dangers and Disasters of long and tedious
Sieges, till they received Advice of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s
Death.</p>
               <p>The one of these was <hi>Ferdinando Paceico,</hi> who
resolved to die before he would render up the
Fortress to him consigned. The other named
<hi>Martino Freira,</hi> who after a years being besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in <hi>Conimbria,</hi> being advised by <hi>Alfonso</hi> of
his brothers death, he desiring a Truce, posted
to <hi>Toledo,</hi> and causing the Sepulchre of King
<hi>Sancho</hi> to be opened, put the key of the Castle
into his hand, and afterwards returning, gives it
to <hi>Alfonso,</hi> excusing himself that he could not
before show the desires of his heart to serve him,
he being obliged to what he did by his oath, and
by his faith. <hi>Alfonso</hi> perceiving this noble ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
in him, confirmed him in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
without seeking any further of him than
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56653:21"/>
an inviolable Sacrament: <hi>Martino</hi> returned
thanks to the king for his so great love, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the Government.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Sancho</hi> the Second, died in the year
1245. at 39 years of age, having reigned thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen;
He was a man of a most noble aspect,
carrying in his face, and in his eyes, no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Majesty; his nose was somewhat of the
biggest, yet did not at all disfigure him, he was
very curious in trimming his beard, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
inclined to red; his countenance was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
earthy, his continual indispositions having
made a paleness inherent to him.</p>
               <p>His piety was his principal ornament, nor
was there any crime which did more incense his
goodness, than that which was dyed in blood.
There wanted nothing in him to render him
worthy the greatest <hi>Encomiums,</hi> but health and
the counsel of prudent men, by whom he might
have been served without design, and without
self-interest. Want of these two things were
the occasion that a most just man, wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of goodness, fell into those miscarriages
which made him in the conceit of men impious
and unjust.</p>
               <p>He was buried in that Regal Chappel built by
himself at <hi>Toledo:</hi> True it is, that most Writers
disagree whereabouts his Tomb was placed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Chappel being rebuilt and made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Sepulchres were over-turned, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on the side of the wall without Elegies or
Epitaphs, so that you can have no other then
mens opinions for that, without any certain foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

of <hi>May,</hi> An: 1210. he was by his father, by reason

of <hi>Fillippio Crispo,</hi> and Daughter of <hi>Fillippio
Augustino: Alfonso</hi> was at the time of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
twenty seven years, and being of stature
great, strong of body, and of an invincible
courage of minde, he was by the Pope elected
Captain of those Knights of the <hi>Cruciada,</hi> who
from <hi>France</hi> and other Provinces, were thought
worthy to carry their valor to the <hi>Holy War;</hi> but
he was diverted this Honor, by the necessity of
his return into <hi>Portugal,</hi> to put an end to those
Troubles, which were moved by the ambition
of some, who presuming upon <hi>Sancho</hi>'s pliable
nature, were to act a fell Tragedy upon the

               <p>At his first arrival he appeased those Tumults

severity, to purge away those vices which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  </gap>s being quite pacified, he gave
his minde to the increasing and adorning of his
kingdom; many places destroyed by continual
Wars with the <hi>Moors,</hi> he peopled with noble
Colonies, re-edifying many decayed Towers,
and building many new Edifices: He likewise
with an extraordinary liberality, erected most
stately Temples and Monasteries: He instituted
for the increasing of Commerce with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
kingdoms, several solemn Fairs, delighting
much in Traffick, and for the encouragement of
it, remitting his Customs.</p>
               <p>But these singular vertues of <hi>Alfonso</hi> were
darkned by a thick shadow of lust, not abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for to satisfie his sense from seducing the
most noble to his pleasures. Interest of State
making him afraid to repudiate his wife, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
a most nefarious Marriage with <hi>Beatrice</hi>
the illegitimate daughter of <hi>Alphonso</hi> the Ninth
king of <hi>Castile,</hi> and his Concubine <hi>Maria Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
This <hi>Beatrice</hi> was brought up with greater
love, charge, and attendance, than any of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso</hi>'s
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56653:22"/>
children. <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth then
Pope, moved with the tears of the Countess of
<hi>Bologna,</hi> the complaints of her friends, and the
indignity of the action it self, admonished him
first by Letters to remember both his wife and
his duty as a Christian, but those saving docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
prevailed nothing with the shut ears of
deaf <hi>Alfonso;</hi> whereupon the Pope fulminated
forth an excommunication against him and his
kingdom, prohibiting divine service throughout
all his Dominions, hoping that these celestial
arms might soften <hi>Alfonso</hi>'s obdurate brest; but
it prevailed nothing, till at length the death of
the Dutchess procured his pardon, which <hi>Urban</hi>
the sixth granted, rather to satisfie the clamors
of the people, then out of his own genius, or
that <hi>Alfonso</hi> desired it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beatrice</hi> now Crowned Queen, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
confirmed by the birth of two children,
<hi>Alfonso</hi> had a desire to prosecute a War against

King of the confining Countries, still posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

from the Confines, increasing his kingdoms
glory, and his own reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonso</hi> had by <hi>Beatrice</hi> three sons, <hi>Dyonisio</hi>

Knights Templars; <hi>Alfonso, Dionysio,</hi> or <hi>Denys,</hi>
married to <hi>Maria Rivera;</hi> and lastly <hi>Leonora,</hi>
wife to Count <hi>D. Gazzia de Souza,</hi> a man no
less potent by his great riches, then friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonso</hi> was blest with a most comely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
sparkling eyes, a most comely propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of body, but so large that it struck no small
admiration into the King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> when he
made him be taken out of his Sepulchre; yet
was not his body more large then his soul was
sublime; he was extream profuse in gifts, which
made him beloved by those who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
benifited by them; his prudence was by
all admired, and amongst his vertues there was
nothing wanting but a more serious veneration
of Religion, greater gratitude towards his first
wife <hi>Matilda,</hi> and less dishonesty in his loves;
in his latter days he was extreamly troubled
with the gout, which so tormented him, that
impatient of his pain, he permitted himself to be
transported by excess of passion.</p>
               <p>He died in <hi>Lisbon</hi> in the year 1279. at sixty
nine years of age, and in the two and thirtieth
year of his reign, not accounting till the death
of his brother <hi>Sancho,</hi> he was buried in the
Church of St. <hi>Dominica,</hi> from whence his body
was removed to that of St. <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> and laid
in a great, but no curious, Tomb; on the other
part of the Church is to this day to be seen the

preserved by Balsoms, is to be shown in the

who was born in the year 1260.
and called <hi>Dionysio</hi> because born on the day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to that great Areopagite; when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to age fitting, he was instructed in those
Sciences which are necessary to adorn a Royal
minde; he could perfectly speak many forreign
Languages, but applied himself chiefly to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Poesie, and may be said to be the best Poet
of any King; he endeavored to reduce the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
Muse, before rude and inharmonious, to a
smooth and sweet verse; he published many
Elegies and Epigrams, which as they attest to
posterity his Kingly learning, so they stirred up
in others a glorious emulation.</p>
               <p>He was about twenty years of age when his
father died, and was immediately admitted to
the government, to the great displeasure of his
mother, who was in hopes to have been made
Queen Regent, and was either, because she
thought, that she who by her pains and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
had united several Cities to the Crown
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was slighted, or because she feared
lest her son being unexperienced, should either
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56653:24"/>
perswaded out of a youthful folly, or drawn by
the flattery of Courtiers, consume with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming
liberality the riches of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Yet her anger could not move him to admit
her a share in the government, for he was often
used to say, <hi>That man was blame-worthy who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
past eleven years of age, could not moderate
himself without the help of others; but that of all
things it was most base to desire the assistance of a
woman.</hi> The forces of <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi>
father of <hi>Beatrice,</hi> could not prevail to make
him change his opinion; but between mother
and son these discords were easily accorded, and
she at length being brought to the utmost pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of her life, he piously went into <hi>Castile</hi> to
visit her, and comfort her at her last gasp.</p>
               <p>But though he accorded with his mother, he
did not so easily adjust things with his brother
<hi>Alfonso,</hi> and with <hi>Sancio</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> with
whom he fought many battels; the War out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<hi>Sancho</hi>'s life, but from those cruel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
at length a happy peace was produced,
which to render perpetual, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of
<hi>Castile</hi> took for wife <hi>Constanza</hi> daughter to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisio:</hi>
and on the other side <hi>Alfonso</hi> espoused

               <p>The discords between the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi>
and <hi>Castile</hi> were remitted to this Kings pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
in composing of which, and making those
kingdoms happy in peace, he showed admirable
effects of his wisdom.</p>
               <p>His liberality gained him the love of all men,
and made him equally respected both of subjects
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56653:24"/>
and strangers; he commanded that the waste
fields should be distributed amongst the poorest
Country people, assenting that it should be
freed from all taxes: there were none poor but
such who were not able to gain their living, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weakned by age, or some other infirmity,
and these were maintained at the Kings char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>He never oppressed the subjects either with
tribute or taxes, yet left to his heirs a full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer:
he made many Laws, which to this
day are in force, his Successors after him form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into Statutes; amongst other things
he made a Law for the preventing tediousness
in Law suites, assigning certain prefixed days
to end all differences, both taking thereby away
a great unnecessary expence of time and money,
for which very act this King is to this day reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
among the vulgar.</p>
               <p>In his time the Order of the Knights <hi>Templars</hi>
was extinct, whereupon in stead of them, he
instituted another under the name of the Order
OF CHRIST, to whom he gave many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Lands for their maintenance; their
Roab was a black Cassack under a white Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
over which a red Cross stroaked in the
middle with a white line; their duty was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Batica,</hi> the next adjacent
Country, they have since been famous for many
memorable acts.</p>
               <p>He first instituted the University at <hi>Conim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi>
called <hi>Academia Conimbricense,</hi> which he
enriched with the most learned men of that age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56653:25"/>
He took to wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to <hi>Peter</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This bastard son was affected by his father
with such a tenderness of Love, that he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him before all his other children; which the
Prince <hi>Alphonso</hi> ill comporting, there grew at
first a hatred between the brothers, in which the
fathers indulgence taking part with the base
son, so exasperated <hi>Alphonso,</hi> that it raised a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

               <p>
                  <hi>Dionisio</hi> had many other sons by diverse <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
women, they with feminine glory boasting
themselves great with childe by the King, one
amongst the rest was <hi>Peter Count of Barcello,</hi>
who writ a book of the chief <hi>Portugal</hi> families;
others there were who grew up to the disturbance
of the kingdom, the oppression of the subjects,
and discontent of their father, in his old age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a low estate, and afflicted with the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars, he was forced by the Prince his son
to flie as it were an exile into <hi>Castile:</hi> with his
departure the dissentions seemed to cease, but
<hi>Alphonso</hi>'s heart was not at all mollified towards

These advertisements more free then secure,

ready he was to have 'chastised their freedom,
who would be governed by a King, and not by a
Huntsman; but at length considering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the truths they had spoken, he pardoned
the liberty of their Speech, and took them into
the number of his dearest friends.</p>
               <p>And that he did esteem them so, appeared by
his taking their counsel, wholly leaving off his
hunting, and addressing all his endeavors to the
government of the kingdom: the first of his
impresses were against those who had furiously
armed themselves against his father <hi>Dionisio:</hi>
and because those affections good or bad which
have once had growth in the minde, are very
hardly rooted out, the hatred that he bore to his
brother <hi>Sancho</hi> whilest he was Prince, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
whilest he was King.</p>
               <p>For whilest his brother was absent, he caused
several wicked men, who flattered the fortune
of the King, to testifie against his brother, and
charged him with all the imagined thoughts of
soul, as crimes committed, during his fathers
life; upon which <hi>Sancho</hi> was by the Judges, in
complyance to the Royal will, deprived of all
his honors in <hi>Portugal,</hi> banished the Country,
and all his goods confiscate. <hi>Sancho</hi> was at
<hi>Castile,</hi> when hearing of this sentence, he by
Letters intreats his brother to restore him to his
grace, promising that he would serve him not
onely as his brother, but as his King.</p>
               <p>But his prayers not at all softning his obstinate

<hi>Castile,</hi> takes Arms, resolving to force that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

could not obtain: In fine, after a long
continuance of War, in which the subjects were
made subject to infinite oppression, he made
with his brother a peace more necessary then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>D. Iuan Emanuel,</hi> son to the

               <p>The King of <hi>Castile</hi> either out of vexation
that she whom he had repudiated, should still be

threatning indeed the ruine of all <hi>Spain,</hi>
when <hi>Alphonso</hi> by the advice of his Councel,
sent to desire assistance of his father in Law the
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that he might the better

the messenger: who willingly heard and listned
to the Ambassie, and not onely promised assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of men to further this expedition, but to
go himself in person.</p>
               <p>Being arrived according to his promise, it was
determined that they should on both sides
assault the Moors, which accordingly they did,
and that with so prosperous success to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that after an innumerable slaughter of
the <hi>Saracens,</hi> they gained one of the most rich
and most glorious Victories that has been in the
memories of man, so great quantities of silver

had been transported into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason of the Barbarians transporting

of the assurance of Victory, which they flattered
themselves withall; they had designed <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56653:28"/>
for their Country, and thereupon all those who
had thoughts of planting there, brought over all
that could either better, or conserve their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>This Victory was gained nigh to the River of
<hi>Saledo,</hi> the two Kings gave part of their spoils
to Pope <hi>Benedict,</hi> who then resided in <hi>Avignion,</hi>
giving him likewise four and twenty Colours ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the enemy, among which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Standard of <hi>Alboacen</hi> King of <hi>Marocco,</hi> with
many horses, and many Moorish Princes, taken
prisoners in the battel.</p>
               <p>For his own portion of the prey, <hi>Alphonso</hi>
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> brought home the son of King

he likewise with his own hand placed five Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
taken from the enemy, in the Church of
St. <hi>Vincenso,</hi> that posterity might behold them
as a memorial of his valor and glory.</p>
               <p>Scarce was he returned into <hi>Portugal,</hi> but he
permitted himself to be overcome by certain

years.</p>
               <p>He was the onely male-childe that lived of
four, and some danger there was of him in his
youth, he being very sickly till he arrived to
about eighteen years of age, which made his
father to be assured of a Successor for his Crown,
to defer the marriage of <hi>Leonora</hi> his youngest
daughter to <hi>Pedro</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> till he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him in a perfect measure of health.</p>
               <p>

married to <hi>Constance</hi> daughter to <hi>D. Iuan Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
by whom he had onely one son named
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who succeeded him in the kingdom,
and she, as if she had onely come into the world
to bear him, and having performed that task,
died.</p>
               <p>After the death of the Infante, <hi>D. Pedro</hi> fell
in love with <hi>Agnesa de Castro,</hi> a most beautiful
woman, and descended of the blood Royal, by
her he had many children, amongst whom one
was <hi>Iohn,</hi> who afterward was the first of that

to King <hi>Alphonso</hi> at his return from his great
Victory over the Moors nigh the River <hi>Saledo,</hi>
was by him (for what crimes is unknown) put to
death, which so incensed <hi>Pedro</hi> that he took up
those Arms against his father, which he laid not
down till his death.</p>
               <p>As soon as he was come to the Crown, he
brought to condigne punishment those who had

to desist from further prosecuting the War,
which he for the present obeys: but soon after
upon a slight pretence, again enters into <hi>Castile</hi>

<hi>Conimbricense</hi> University, where he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
himself to all those studies which became
a Prince, though 'tis to be supposed at that

               </p>
               <p>When he was grown to the age of about three

a chief Commander of his Armies, in which

so much courage and magnanimity, as was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable;
his valor soon gained the love of the

uncapable of succession by reason of her

illegitimate, when afterwards the Councel of
Estates, finding that if they should refuse him,
they might perchance choose one less deserving,
conferred the Crown upon him, yet so as he
should receive it not as his indubitable right by
birth, but as given him by election.</p>
               <p>Yet some Writers there be that affirm, that
there were several legitimate sons of his father
King <hi>Pedro</hi> then alive, who all laid their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
claims to the Crown, as of right belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them before him, but that he being at
the time of his brothers death General of the
Armies in <hi>Algarve,</hi> and having gained so much
upon the soldiers and people, presuming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their affection, and his desert, laid claim to
the Crown, which they being no way able to
resist, were forced to rest content, and permit
him to enjoy what was likewise willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

willingly have performed the task himself, and
excused his Lord from the toil, if it had been

set out with a great fleet in or about the year

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56653:37"/>
for his subjects felicity, as of parents for
their children, whilest according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>He that does not take care for his family,
was worse then an infidel;</hi> that for want of his
superintendency the kingdom was posting into
the road of destruction, by reason of the ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of his Ministers, that according to
his duty he could not but advise him to free
them from oppression, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These Speeches of the Arch Bishop extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stirred up the Kings affections to his people,
both because he was sensible of the great love
the Arch Bishop bore him, and because he
knew what he had spoken was truth; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
takes the Helm of State into his own hands,
calls those unjust Steward to account, frees the
people from their oppresses, where he finds
cause punishes them severely, and finally, makes
several Laws for the good and benefit of the
people, whose affections he in short time so far
gained, that they surnamed him <hi>the Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having thus setled his kingdom to the
content of his subjects at home, he next applies
his minde to the aggrandising of it, to which
purpose in the year 1500. he fitted out a great
number of ships, which he divided into three
Fleets, sending one towards the East, the second
towards the West, and the third towards the
South, to make discoveries.</p>
               <p>That, which steered their couse towards the
East, were the first Christian Fleet that ever pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> and found out the
passage by Sea into the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> that towards
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56653:38"/>
the West, made discovery and took possession
of <hi>Brazile</hi> in <hi>America;</hi> that towards the South,
reinforced and added to their former Conquests
in the kingdoms of <hi>Conga.</hi> and <hi>Angola.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These happy discoveries thus made at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the fleet from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> a more
potent was sent out with a convenient Land Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to take possession of some places in the
Country; these discomfited the great Armies
of the Turks and Sultan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> possessed
themselves of the Island of <hi>Ormus</hi> in the <hi>Persian</hi>
Gulf, an Island so rich and well situated, that
the <hi>Arabians</hi> used to say, that if the whole
world were a ring, that would be like the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
in it; many other Forts and Places upon
the Sea-coast they likewise subjected, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and returned home richly laden.</p>
               <p>Thus were the riches of <hi>India,</hi> which before
had been brought over the vast <hi>Arabian</hi> deserts
upon the backs of Camels, to <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and from thence by Sea transported to
<hi>Venice,</hi> and so dispersed over these parts of the
World, were now brought home by Sea, a longer,
but less chargeable and far quicker way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emanuel,</hi> while his Fleets were performing
these glorious services abroad, governed his
kingdoms in peace and prosperity at home, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with a noble and numerous Issue, to wit,
six sons and two daughters; the sons were first,
Prince <hi>Iohn,</hi> who succeeded him in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
secondly, the Infante <hi>D. Lewis:</hi> thirdly,
the Infante <hi>D. Alfonso,</hi> who was after a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,

and Arch-Bishop of <hi>Braga:</hi> fifthly, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante
<hi>D. Fernando:</hi> sixthly, the Infante <hi>D. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
The daughters were first the Infante <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
who was married to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth that
famous Emperor, and King of <hi>Spain:</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Infante <hi>Beatrice,</hi> married to <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>
Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emanuel</hi> having long governed this Nation
to his great glory and renown, at last in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
third year of his life, and forty first of
his Empire, yielded to fate at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in, or
about the year 1435. and was buried in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
of that City amongst many of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</p>
               <p>He was a Prince in whom the Divinity seem'd
to have been at a strife, whether his body or
minde should be made more amiable, for the
features of his face were worthily to be admired,
yet his outward part could not boast more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then his soul could, that imbellisher of man,
vertue; I can not well say whether he was
more severe, or merciful, but where he met
with offences that he could not pardon, he was
always pitiful; in sum, he so lived, and so ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that he deservedly merited that Glorious
Name of <hi>Emanuel the Good.</hi>

to divert all Designs in prejudice of his

of <hi>Braganza</hi> might not by <hi>Henry</hi> be declared to
be the next Heir apparent; which he conscious
of the justice of the Title, was very willing to
have done.</p>
               <p>And whilest these two Fathers prosecuted his
interest there with the old, and almost doting
King <hi>Henry,</hi> the vigilant <hi>Phillip</hi> provided an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

designs of the Popes, this crafty Spanish Fox
circumvented, for having pre-advice of it, and
resolving to pursue his own intentions of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to himself the kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
yet approve himself an obedient Son of the
Church, he gave order in all places where the
Legat was to pass, he should be most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
entertained, so that by such sumptuous
Treatments, the time might be dexterously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
and he possessed of that kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Legat arrived at Court; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done, and the Legat returned thanks
for his magnificent Entertainments, though he
was displeased at the ill success of his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the maner of his possessing
himself of this kingdom: No sooner did the
News arrive at the Spanish Court of the death
of King <hi>Henry,</hi> but <hi>Ferdinand de Teledo,</hi> Duke
<hi>D' Alva,</hi> was commanded with an Army of
twenty thousand men to march toward <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
and in the Name and Right of his Catholick
Majesty, to make Conquest of the kingdom, if
he found opposition.</p>
               <p>But all the appearance of opposition which he
found, was made by <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the Bastard
Son of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Infante, who having got into
<hi>Lisbon</hi> in the Head of a tumultuary Rabble, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a well-formed Army, endeavored at
first to make some resistance, but was soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited,
and the suburbs of <hi>Lisbon</hi> being sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to satisfie the soldiers, the City was surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to him, whither soon after the King came,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56653:46"/>
and so by a mixt Title of Descent and Arms, took
possession of the kingdom, <hi>Anno 1510. Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
Dutchess of <hi>Braganza</hi> being enforced to
surrender to him all her interest and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>The Nobility and People of <hi>Portugal</hi> were
without doubt extreamly amazed to see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so suddenly surprized, and made subject
to a Forein Prince, and especially to a Prince of
that Nation against whom they had a natural
Antipathy: but finding themselves in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not able to make any resistance, they thought
they should gain more by submitting freely to
that King, than by being forced to it; and
therefore they made their humble submission,
which <hi>Phillip</hi> met as it were half way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended

                  <hi>These Articles were shut up, or concluded,
with a blessing upon such kings as should observe
and keep them, and a curse on those who should
break or violate them. And some Authors like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
affirm, that there was another Clause ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them, signifying,</hi> That in case (which
God forbid) that the King which then was, or his
Successors, should not observe this Agreement, or
should procure a Dispensation for this Oath, the
three States of the kingdom might freely deny sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and obedience to the King, without being
guilty, either of Perjury or Treason:</p>
               <p>Though these Articles were thus sworn to,
and the Cardinal <hi>Albertus</hi> Archduke of <hi>Austria</hi>
son to the Emperor, and Nephew to the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> appointed Vice-king of <hi>Portugal, Phillip</hi>
the second durst not inperson yet leave the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for he perceived by their murmurs and
visible discontents, that their submission to him
proceeded more out of fear then love, and that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56653:47"/>
as he had in a moment gained that kingdom, so
he should as soon loose it; if he should but give
them the least opportunity.</p>
               <p>For that the people were highly discontented,
might easily appear by their attentive listning
after old prophesies, among which was one of an
old Hermit who told <hi>Alphonso</hi> the first King of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> of the great victory that he should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
over the five Kings of the Moors, that he
and his posterity should reign happily King of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> but that in the sixteenth generation his
line should fail, but that God at length should
have mercy again upon them, and restore them.</p>
               <p>Others had respect to a Letter written by St.
<hi>Bernard</hi> to the same King <hi>Alphonso,</hi> (the original
of which is reported to have been given to the
<hi>Portugal</hi> Embassadors, by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth,
King of <hi>France, Anno 1641.)</hi> the substance of
which was to this effect: That he rendred thanks
to him for the Lands bestowed upon him, that
in recompence thereof, God had declared unto
him, that there should not fail a Native of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
to sit upon that Throne, unless for the
greatness of their sins, God would chastise them
for a time; but that this time of Chastisement
should not last above sixty years.</p>
               <p>Other Prophesies there were of this nature,
and to this effect, which put the people in hopes
of a Deliverance; and many of them flattered
themselves that Don <hi>Sebastian</hi> was yet alive, and
would come and deliver them; nay, so foolish
were some of them, that though they believed
him slain at the battel of <hi>Alcazar</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56653:47"/>
yet they thought he should live again, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
come to redeem them.</p>
               <p>But that which most of all expressed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Discontents, was what was publickly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the mouthes of their Orators the Priests,
in their Pulpits, who would ordinarily in their
Sermons utter speeches much in prejudice of the
Spaniards Title, and in favor of the Dutchess
of <hi>Braganza,</hi> nor were they sparing to do so in
the presence of the King himself, who would
therefore often say, <hi>That the Portuguez Clergy
had made the sharpest war with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Father <hi>Lewis Alvarez</hi> a Jesuite, preaching
one day before the Vice-Roy, took his Text,
<hi>Surge, tolle Grabatum tuum, &amp; ambula,</hi> and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himself to the Duke, said, Sir, the meaning
of that is, <hi>Arise, take up your pack, and be gone
home.</hi> But above all this, might the Discontents
be perceived in the Noblemens Chappels, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi>'s, where they
were wont to sing the <hi>Lamentations of Ieremy,</hi>
applying all the scorn and reproach of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
to themselves, as <hi>Aquam nostram pecunia
bibimus,</hi> because of the Excize put by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
upon Wine, and other necessaries: And
that, <hi>Servi Dominati sunt in nos;</hi> and that, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit
Corona Capitis nostri,</hi> most commonly end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with this Invocation, <hi>Recordare Domine,
Quid acciderit nobis Intuere &amp; respice opprobrium
nostrum: Haereditas nostra versa est ad alienos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet did king <hi>Phillip</hi> bear all these Affronts
with an incomparable patience, dissembling with
an admirable prudence his passion (if he had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56653:48"/>
any) for these Discontents; for he knew the
onely way to win this Nation to an obedience
and complyance, must be lenity at first, what
ever he intended to practice afterwards, and
that he had by his exact keeping of his Word and
Oath, won much upon this people, appears in
that during his whole Reign, and the Reign of
his Successor <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, who followed his
fathers foot-steps, though not with that craft
and dissimulation, they made no attempts, nor
were inclinable to a Revolt, which the ensuing
Story will evidence.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Antonio</hi> Prior of <hi>Crato,</hi> the base born son
of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Infante, who had by the tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Rabble, on the Death of King <hi>Henry,</hi> been
elected King, being expulsed <hi>Lisbon</hi> by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> fled from thence into
<hi>France,</hi> to the protection of that Queen, who
(in regard that her Claim was exploded both by
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>Portugal,</hi> as an outworn
Title, and injurious to all the kings of <hi>Portugal</hi>
ever since, as unjust Possessors) had long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to excite Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
against the Spaniard, and to forewarn her and
other Princes to beware of his increasing power,
who now enriched with the addition of <hi>Portugal,
East-India,</hi> and many Isles in the <hi>Atlantique</hi>
sea, might in time overshadow all his neighbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Princes, and therefore advising that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved
them to think of some way to curb his
Ambition betimes, and restrain his too far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Power into some reasonable limits.</p>
               <p>Which advice of hers, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> easily
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56653:48"/>
listned too, being always providently careful of
her own, and her Subjects safety, fore-seeing
how dangerous the over-swelling Power of that
Prince would be, both to Her and her Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and therefore though she then entred not
into a present War with him, yet when Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi>
came over to her with Recommendations
from the French Queen, she bountifully relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, which she then thought she might do
without offence, considering that she acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
him her Kinsman, descended of the Blood
Royal of <hi>England,</hi> and of the House of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
nor was there ever any promise made in
any League between the English and Spaniard,
that the <hi>Portugals</hi> should not be received into
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then Don <hi>Antonio</hi> resided, till (the
Wars breaking forth between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
after the Spaniard had received that nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Overthrow of his <hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> to
whose power and puissance the whole World
thought <hi>England</hi> would have been but a morsel.
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> judging it more honorable to
assail her Enemy, then again to be assailed by
him, suffered a Fleet to be set forth against
<hi>Spain,</hi> which Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis
Drake,</hi> with some other private persons, to their
eternal honor, rigged and set out at their own
charge, requiring nothing of the Queen but some
few Ships of War; and she granted to them,
that the Ships and spoils taken should be divided
amongst them. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> likewise to this
Fleet joyned some Ships, so that the number
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56653:49"/>
of the whole Fleet was about eleven thousand
Soldiers, and fifteen hundred Mariners.</p>
               <p>With this Fleet Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> with some few
<hi>Portugals</hi> set Sayl out of <hi>England,</hi> having before
loaden the English with great promises of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of this kingdom, assuring them that the
<hi>Portugueses</hi> would be ready upon his appearance
to revolt from the <hi>Spainiard,</hi> and that <hi>Muley
Hamet</hi> King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> would assist him with
twenty thousand men.</p>
               <p>The first place that the English Fleet put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
was the <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>Gallicia,</hi> the base town of
which they easily took, but attempting the higher
town were twice repulsed, and forced to raise
their siege, upon advice, that the <hi>Condy di
Andrada</hi> had gathered Forces at <hi>Burges Bridge,</hi>
and that the <hi>Condy di Altamira</hi> was coming
with more, purposing to besiege them in the
base town, and so cut off their way to their
ships; which <hi>Norris</hi> resolved to prevent, and
therefore with a sufficient force marched
against them, overthrew them, and had the
slaughter of them for three miles together, and
two days after having burnt and pillaged the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
they put to sea, steering their course
towards <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whilst they laboured with contrary winds,
plying to and fro at Sea, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> fell
in amongst them, who being very young, had out
of the heat of Military glory, hatred of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and commiseration of <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the pleasures of the Court, and committed
himself to Sea, without the knowledge, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56653:49"/>
against the Queens mind, in hopes by
reason of the influence he had over most of the
Commanders of the Land-Forces, to be made
their General.</p>
               <p>Two days after his being joyned with them,
they with much trouble arrived in <hi>Penicha</hi> a
town of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which with the loss of some
drowned in landing, they became masters of the
Castle, being likewise immediately rendred to
<hi>Don Antonio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the Land-forces under the Command
of Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> marched directly, and with
all possible speed towards <hi>Lisbon,</hi> about Sixty
miles distant, <hi>Drake</hi> promising to follow with
the Fleet by the way of the River <hi>Tagus.</hi> The
Army being arrived at <hi>Lixbon,</hi> though they had
before at a Councel of War, determined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
on the East-side of the town, the better to
bar succours from coming out of <hi>Spain,</hi> now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their own resolutions, sat down before
St. <hi>Kathermes</hi> suburbs on the West-side, where
as at first they found no resistance, so they found
little help, but what the prayers of some few dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
men gave them, who now and then cried
out, <hi>God save the King Antonio:</hi> and indeed other
help they could not afford him, <hi>Albertus</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
of <hi>Austria</hi> the Vice-Roy having before dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
the <hi>Portugals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day when the English, weary with
their long march, betook themselves to their
rest, the Spanish Garison sallied out upon them,
who were at first resisted by <hi>Bret</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
till more coming up to their assistance,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56653:50"/>
forced the Spaniards to give back the valiant
Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> chasing them to the very gates;
but the English had several Commanders of
note, and no small quantity of private soldiers
slain.</p>
               <p>In sum, when they had now stayed two days
before the town, and perceived that the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
notwithstanding the great brags and fair
promises of <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> did not at all incline to
a Revolt, and that no advice came of any assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> King of <hi>Morocco;</hi>
but that instead of them, fresh Forces flocked in
great numbers from the East parrs into the City,
whilst their Army was lessened by a violent sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
their Provision and Amunition failed, and
their great Guns for battery arrived not, they
raysed their siege, and took their way towards
<hi>Cascais,</hi> a small town at the mouth of the river,
the Spaniards following them at a distance, but
not ever daring to fall into their Rear. The
town of <hi>Cascais</hi> they took, blew up the Castle,
and so, notwithstanding all the intreaties of <hi>Don
Antonio,</hi> set Sayl for <hi>England,</hi> firing in their way
<hi>Vigo</hi> a Port-town deserted of its inhabitants.</p>
               <p>This and some small bustles with one or two
Counterfeit <hi>Sebastians</hi> not worth mentioning,
were the onely storms, that hapned in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
during the reigns of <hi>Phillip</hi> the second, and
third; for they keeping their words in most
things, though some of their priviledges they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed,
had almost brought the people to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to be their slaves, whereas <hi>Phillip</hi> the
fourth committing the whole charge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56653:50"/>
to Count <hi>Olivares,</hi> (who though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt an able Statesman, yet would seem to
have a way in policy by himself, which no body
else could understand the reasons of) lost the
whole kingdom, and all its Territories.</p>
               <p>For such was the new rigorous ways which he
would prescribe in the Government of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
and <hi>Portugal,</hi> both people very tender of
their Priviledges, the least breach of which
should have been seconded by a potent Force
to have suppressed them, in case they should
attempt an Insurrection, when in stead of having
such power in readiness, the <hi>Catalonians</hi> had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opportunity given them to rebel, and spurs
to provoke them to make use of the opportunity;
for some soldiers being scatteringly quartered
among them, but too few to curb them, they
looked upon that as a greater intrenchment upon
their Liberties than any before, and a design
utterly to enslave them: wherefore converting
their patience into fury, they took Arms, massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
those soldiers, slew their Viceroy, and put
themselves under the <hi>French</hi> Protection.</p>
               <p>This Revolt of the <hi>Catalonians</hi> was a president
to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who had extreamly suffered
under the breach of their Priviledges: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the second Article sworn to by King
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, which said, <hi>That the Viceroy
or Governor, should be either Son, Brother, Uncle,
or Nephew to the King of</hi> Spain: The <hi>Infanta
Margarita di Mantoua,</hi> who had no relation at
all to the kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> was made Governess,
which they might, and perhaps would have born,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56653:51"/>
had they not been incensed by a more feeling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<hi>Anno.</hi> 1636. when the Tax of a fifth part
was imposed upon all the Subjects of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
an intollerable grievance, and thought so
insufferable by the Southern parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they rose in Arms to oppose it, and
had set the whole kingdom in a combustion, had
it not been timely quenched by the timely care
and industry of the then Governess, the <hi>Infanta
Margarita</hi> of <hi>Mantoua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this small stir gave an <hi>Item</hi> to the Court
of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the readiness of the people to revolt,
which made <hi>Olivarez</hi> endeavor by all ways pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to cut off the means of their being able to
do, but whilest he endeavored to prevent them,
he gave them the means to do it, though he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not to make use of those courses which in
probability might ensure that kingdom; the chief
of which was, the endeavoring to allure from
thence the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> whom the people
of <hi>Portugal</hi> looked upon as the person who of
right ought to be their king, and who was the
onely Native of the kingdom who might restore
again the Line of <hi>Alphonso;</hi> besides, he was a
Prince, who for Power, Riches, and Number of
Tenants, not onely exceeded all the Nobles of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> but even of <hi>Spain</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was one
of the most glorious Subjects in <hi>Europe,</hi> being
allied to most Kings in Christendom; which
made the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> though they were
Competitors for the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> treat
this Family with more honor than any other of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56653:51"/>
his Grandees, receiving them almost with as
much respect, as if they were Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which appeared in <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who
most of all desired to abase this Family, yet
would always when the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> came
to visit him, meet him in the middle of the room,
and not permitting him to kiss his hand, seat him
with himself under the Canopy of Estate.</p>
               <p>To draw him therefore out of that kingdom,
<hi>Olivarez</hi> first politickly offered him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Milan,</hi> a place of great trust and honor,
but he modestly refused it, as not in a condition
at that present to undertake so great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and indeed expressing an unwil ingness
to go out of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his unwillingness to go from thence, made
the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> the more
willing to draw him from thence, it was therefore
given out, That the king himself was resolved
to go in person to reduce the revolted <hi>Cataloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and that therefore all the Nobility should
be in a readiness in four moneths time to attend
his Majesty in that Expedition. But the Duke
of <hi>Braganza</hi> being suspicious of the Spaniards,
because he knew himself suspected by them, and
likely to be whilest the <hi>Portugueses</hi> so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
him, to assure himself of the ones love,
and to avoid, if possible, the others suspect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
himself to his Countrey-house at <hi>Villa Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosa,</hi>
and there follows his sports of Hunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
not at all regarding matters of State, withal sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56653:52"/>
an Excuse to Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> that his affairs
at present were in so low and mean a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he could not appear to attend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in that pomp and splendor that became a
Person of his quality, and that therefore he
should do his Majesty more service in staying at
home, when the other Nobles were abroad, then
he could possibly do by attending him.</p>
               <p>This Plot thus failing, made the Court of
<hi>Spain</hi> more suspicious of the Duke then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> therefore resolves to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his utmost art of dissimulation to entrap
him, which he sets upon by a fetch so far about,
that to the eye of reason it might put the Duke
into ambitious thoughts of endeavoring to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
his Throne, and in a way to accomplish
those thoughts, rather than any way prejudice
him: but it appeared afterwards that <hi>Olivarez</hi>
design in so far trusting the Duke, was onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Duke should trust him.</p>
               <p>In answer to <hi>Braganza</hi>'s Letter of Excuse, the
<hi>Conde</hi> assures him that his Majesty was very well
satisfied with his reasons of not attending him in
the intended Expedition against <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and
that he was very sensible of his good inclinations
to his service; That for his own part, he was
verry sorry that his affairs were in so low a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
for he could not but commiserate his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
as his own. That his Majesty, to let him
know how great confidence he reposed in his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
had appointed him General of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
of that kingdom, and had for his present
supply sent him Sixty thousand Crowns, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56653:52"/>
it to his choice to reside in what place near
<hi>Lisbon</hi> he pleased.</p>
               <p>This strange confidence put in the Duke by
the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> much amazed the greatest
Politicians, who thought it reasonable that the
Spaniard should have permitted the Duke still
to have kept retired in the Countrey, rather
then have given him such a Command, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to <hi>Lisbon</hi> into the continual view of the
people, who looking upon him as the Heir of
that House which had been ever represented to
have the onely right to the Crown, might easily
be enflamed with a desire to have a king of their
own.</p>
               <p>And these things was the Princess of <hi>Mantoua</hi>
very sensible of, and therefore continually soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the King to know his reason, or to desire
him to remove those apparent opportunities
which he had given the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a Revolt. But she not onely received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
and enigmatical Answers from the King
and Duke <hi>D'Olivarez,</hi> but likewise had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
actions seconded with one, which made her
of opinion that his Catholick Majesty had a mind
to toss the kingdom into <hi>Braganza</hi>'s hands whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would or no; for on a sudden, without
any notice given to her, all the Spanish Garison
in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Castle, which commanded the City
of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and indeed upon the strength of which
the whole safety and security of the kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
were suddenly drawn forth, and the
Castle left to the disposure of Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Braganza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56653:53"/>
But this was the last act of Count <hi>Olivarez</hi>
confidence in the Duke; for by trusting him so
much, he now thought that he could not but reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
repose confidence in him; and therefore
next Summer <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. he again by Letters
sollicites him to leave <hi>Portugal,</hi> and come to
<hi>Madrid,</hi> first telling him, that his Catholick
Majesty gave him many thanks, and greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
his Loyalty in the Exercise of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of General, and was very sensible of the
good effects which his Authority had wrought
over the <hi>Portugals:</hi> Next he represented unto
him the present declining condition of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Monarchy, not onely by reason of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the preparations
of the <hi>Turk,</hi> but more especially for that their
most potent Enemies the <hi>French,</hi> were now in
assistance of the revolted <hi>Catalonians,</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spain:</hi> That it highly concerned his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Majesty to drive these out of his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which could not be effected but by a very
powerful Force; that he being one of the prime
Grandees of the Kingdom, might by his presence
in the Head of a good number of his Tenants,
encourage others to a sutable assistance: That to
that purpose his Catholick Majesty expected
him every moment, having designed for him
great Honors, Priviledges and Dignities, suitable
to his merit.</p>
               <p>But as cunning an Angler as <hi>Olivarez</hi> was,
yet he failed of his mark, the bait would not yet
hook in the Fish; for though the Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza</hi>
was accounted no very great Politician,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56653:53"/>
yet his own safety taught him to know that all
these Trusts, and fair promises were but gilded
Allurments to draw him to his destruction;
Having therefore supplied the King with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
number of his Tenants and friends, he
found excuses for his own not going in person;
and to take off all suspicion of jealousy or
thoughts, that he had any design against the
State, he retired again to his country house.
Thus did these two great personages, by craft
and dissumulation endeavour to supplant each
other, onely the one strove the others destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the other onely studied his own safety and
preservation:</p>
               <p>During all these passages, the Vice-Queen
<hi>Margarita</hi> of <hi>Mantoua</hi> was very vigilant in her
Government, &amp; foreseeing what in reason might
be the issue of these proceedings, wrote very
importunately to the king, assuring him, that if it
were not suddenly prevented, the kingdom
would infallibly be lost. To which his Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
her no answer: and <hi>Olivarez</hi> in his (sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her judgement, as fitter to govern a private
house then a kingdom,) desired her, that if her
Capacity would not reach to the height and
drift of those mysteries of State, yet that her
wisedom would prompt her not to discover
them.</p>
               <p>Yet without doubt <hi>Olivarez</hi> was inwardly
perplexed to see all his plots thus fail, and foul
means he durst not openly attempt, such was
both the Dukes potency, and the great love the
people bore him, he therefore at last has recourse
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56653:54"/>
to treachery, and to that intent gives secret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to <hi>Don Lopez d'Ossis,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio D'O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo,</hi>
that when they had relieved <hi>Flanders</hi>
with men and mony, they should with the
whole Fleet put into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and then as soon
as the Duke should according to the duty of his
new place and office come aboard, they should
immediately set Sail, and bring him away to
<hi>Callis;</hi> but this plot was by a strange divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
prevented, for that Fleet was totally
routed by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon the Coast of
<hi>England.</hi>

               <head>JOHN the IV.
The One and twentieth KING of
PORTVGAL.</head>
               <p>NOw was the time come wherein, according
to St. <hi>Bernards</hi> prophecy, the kingdom of
<hi>Portugal</hi> was to be released from the tyranny of
strangers, and restored again to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Native King, to which all things
seemed so well to quadrate, that we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
there was less then a divine hand in it; for
though (all Plots failing against the Duke of
<hi>Braganza,)</hi> the Spaniards beginning to fear
somewhat, drew out as many of the Native
soldiers out of the kingdom as conveniently they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56653:54"/>
could, thinking thereby to lessen the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
which beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n now to appear, yet they did
thereby onely the more stir up and enflame those
discontents which were taken at <hi>Vasconsellos</hi>
managing all Affairs of State.</p>
               <p>For although the most Illustrious <hi>Infanta
Margarita</hi> of <hi>Mantoua</hi> was a Princess of great
judgement and knowledge in State-affairs, yet
she permitted her self to be so much over-ruled
by <hi>Vasconsellos</hi> Secretary of State, or at least was
so much over-ruled by him, whether she would
or no, that he either by some secret consent of
his Catholick Majesty, or led on by his own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
spirit, confiding in the great favour he
had at Court, never permitted the <hi>Infanta</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
other then the title of Vice-Queen.</p>
               <p>And insufferable was the Government of <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consellos</hi>
to the <hi>Portuguesses,</hi> who as much hated
his obscure birth, as they did his evil Customs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he was a man wholly composed of pride, cruelty,
and avarice, that knew no moderation but in
excesses: small lapses were by him made capital
crimes, chastising with all severity those whom
he did, but suppose dissatisfied with his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
And exercising with all rigor the <hi>Spanish
Inquisition,</hi> punished not onely the actions, but
the very thoughts of men. The infringing of
the greatest priviledges of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation
seemed to him but a trifle; which continued
oppressions, in the end so exasperated the whole
people, that animated by the knowledge of their
own strength, by the many diversions of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, by the late example of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonians,</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56653:55"/>
and incited by the absolute ruine which
they saw hung over their heads, whilst six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them were yearly listed and forced to
serve the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his forreign wars, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to loose his yoke from off their Necks,
and to disclaim his obedience, by the election of
a King of their own.</p>
               <p>Some have been of opinion, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
was at least of ten years standing, agreed
and assented to by most of the Grandees of
<hi>Portugal:</hi> I dare not affirm it, nor deny it; for
such great actions of State do resemble light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which once past leave but the greater
darkness: the Air of State-mysteries is not to be
flown in by less then Eagles, I shall therefore
omit to search into so great a Privacy, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recount the publique action.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the first of <hi>February, Anno</hi> 1640.
(and <hi>Saturday's</hi> have been often observed to be
propitious to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation,) all the
Nobility of the Kingdom, led on by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses
of <hi>Ferrera,</hi> &amp; the Count of <hi>Vimioso,</hi> took
Arms, and accompanied with a great multitude
of the inhabitants of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and some <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>
soldiers came to the Castle, which sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
in the middest of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> serves both for
a Palace and a Castle: this was the residence of
the Vice-Queen, and hither assembled all the
Magistrates for Governing of the Kingdom, the
guards which were two Companies of <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and two of high <hi>Dutch,</hi> either before gained by
secret intelligence, or frighted with the great
numbers of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> or desire of Novelty,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56653:55"/>
or else perhaps unwilling to make resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those to whom they were most of them
joyned by friendship or marriage, without the
least opposition, abandoning their post, gave
them free admittance.</p>
               <p>Whilest these things had happened, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Vasconsellos</hi> was in the Chambers of his
Office (upon some reasons he had by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of the people, to suspect an Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
at that instant writing into <hi>Spain,</hi> of the
Alienation of the mindes of the Nobility from
the Spanish Government, and earnestly pressing
that some rigorous Resolution might be taken to
prevent it; which Letters afterwards taken, did
sufficiently demonstrate his ill will to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguese</hi>
Nation.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was thus busied, the confused noise
of the Soldiers pierced his ears, at which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
not so much at the tumult, as at what
should be the cause of it, being accompanied
onely with a Dutch man, and another of the
Guard, he would have gone down, but was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who came running up,
crying, <hi>Kill the Traytor, Kill the enemy of our
Blood;</hi> whereupon not knowing where to save
himself, he fled, with those two accompanying
him, into an inner chamber, and there with his
sword in his hand, accompanied and assisted by
those two that were with him, disposed himself
to sell his Life at the dearest rare he could: but
his valor stood him in no stead, for those two
who endeavored to defend him, being slain with
two Musquet-shot, he seeing it vain to defend
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56653:56"/>
himself there longer, leapt desperately out of
the window, rather to seek his death, than out
of any hopes to save his life; for no sooner was
he down, but numberless swords were embrued
in his blood, the very women and children run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to tear in pieces his dead body, with the
same alacrity as he used to torment them, when
alive.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Marquess of <hi>Ferrera</hi>
was gone to secure the Vice-Queen, whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
committed to the Guard of two hundred
Musquetteers, he calls a Council, and in a
short Discourse sets forth the miseries the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
had endured whilest it lay subject to the
Spanish Government, who had sought no other
end but their destruction: Then putting them
in minde of the Valor and Merits of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he exhorts them to condescend to the
Election of a New King, nominating to them
the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> as the most worthy of the
Crown, not so much for his Power, Riches, or the
greatness of his House, as because the kingdom
was his indubitable Right; he being the onely
Person left of that Stock, which for so many
years had gloriously governed <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A long Discourse was superfluous to those
who were before perswaded. A publick shout
interrupted the Marquesses Speech, all of them
crying with a loud voice, <hi>That they would have</hi>
John <hi>Duke of</hi> Braganza <hi>for their King.</hi> In the
whole multitude there was not a face, much less
a voice that did gainsay this general Vote; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because they did all really rejoyce to see
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56653:56"/>
that they should again have a king of their own
Nation, or because none could without danger
oppose themselves to the torrent of so a publick
Will.</p>
               <p>The Duke was at this time at his Countrey-house
at <hi>Villa Vitiosa,</hi> whether by accident, or
because he would always have had occasion to
excuse himself, if the business should not have
succeeded, I cannot guess: but by reason of his
absence they thought fit to make choice of two
Governors, whom, to avoid the pretences of
others, they nominated to be the Archbishops
of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Braganza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These began immediately to exercise their
Command, and were obeyed with so much qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
that in all that great and populous City of
<hi>Lisbon</hi> there was none slain, but onely those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned;
the prisons were opened nor
was there any that suffered any wrong, either in
their goods or life: All the Shops were opened
as if there had not happened any Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Onely the house of <hi>Vasconsellos</hi> was sackt, with
so much anger and despite, that they did not
pardon the very Doors and Windows; nay, such
was the fury of the people, that had they not
been hindred by the soldiers of the Guard, they
had levelled it with the ground. As for his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case,
it suffered all those disgraces which a people
wronged both in their liberties and esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, could
inflict: they ran like mad men to express living
sentiments of Revenge upon his dead and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Corpse, vaunting who could invent the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56653:57"/>
newest ways of disgrace and scorn, till at length
almost wearied with their inhumane sport, they
left it in the street so mangled, that it did not
seem to have the least resemblance of a man;
from whence it was the next day carried by the
Fraternity <hi>della misericordia,</hi> and thrown into
the Burying-place of the Moors.</p>
               <p>The Marquess of <hi>Alemquer,</hi> after he had by
command from the Governor assured the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
posts of the City, sent several Soldiers into
the streets, crying, <hi>Long live King</hi> John <hi>the
Fourth;</hi> which the people hearing, distracted as
it were with very joy, leaving their Trades, ran
up and down proclaiming him with voices of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee,</hi>
the greatest part through excess of passion,
not being able to refrain from tears.</p>
               <p>The Messengers did not run, but flie to the
Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> to give him notice of his
promotion to the Crown: The first arrived on
Sunday morning before day; he feigned a great
alteration at this Advice, whereupon some have
presumed to say, that he had not any knowledge
of the Design. He seemed at first not to believe
it, but told the Messengers, that though he might
have desert, and a spirit fit for the Crown of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> yet he had neither will nor ambition
to desire. That his enemies wronged him, by
tempting him with Stratagems as far from his
Genius, as his Faith. But at the arrival of the
Count of <hi>Monte Santo,</hi> who came to accompany
him to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he seemed of another minde; and
having been with him in private discourse for
the space of about two hours, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56653:57"/>
delay, then what the relating the business
to his Wife, and to the Prince his son, made, he
departed with the Count from <hi>Villa Vizosa,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with about five hundred persons.</p>
               <p>Yet others there be that affirm, that he was
not onely acquainted with the design of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
but of Council about it, and that some
time before the Nobility having had a private
Meeting at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> it was at first propounded,
That they should reduce the kingdom into the
form of a Commonwealth; but that not being
approved of by the major part, the Archbishop
of <hi>Lisbon</hi> stood up, and in a most eloquent
Speech having laid before them the miseries they
had endured under the Spanish yoke, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto them <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> as
the indubitable Heir of the Crown, and their
rightful Soverign.</p>
               <p>This Motion needed not to be seconded with
many Arguments to induce a general Consent,
they all most willingly assented to it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to send <hi>Gaston Cotigno,</hi> a man of a fluent
and voluble tongue, to acquaint the Duke with
their intentions, and to perswade him to accept
the Crown, and free his Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaston</hi> being arrived, with many well-coucht
words acquaints him, That there was now a
pregnant opportunity offered to recover the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable
right of his Ancestors to the Crown of
<hi>Portugal:</hi> That the Nobility and Clergy were
wholly inclined to redeem themselves from the
tyranny of the <hi>Castilians,</hi> by securing the Crown
upon his head: That the universal <hi>odium</hi> of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56653:58"/>
whole people to the Spanish Government, the
present low condition of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi>
distracted on every side with War; the assured
Assistance that <hi>France</hi> and other Nations, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing
the greatness of <hi>Spain,</hi> would lend, were
as so many Motives to perswade them not to let
slip so fair an opportunity to regain their liberty:
That if he by refusal, should be the sole enemy
to his Countreys freedom, they would effect it
themselves, and reduce it into a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
with many other Arguments used he,
which his love to the House of <hi>Braganza,</hi> his
hatred to the <hi>Castilians,</hi> or his own ingenuity
prompted to him.</p>
               <p>The Duke's amazement permitted him not to
return a sudden Answer: but after a little pause,
he replied, That he was highly obliged both to
him and all the Nobility, for their affections
to him, but that this was a Business required
great deliberation: That there was no <hi>Medium</hi>
between a Throne and a Chair of Execution,
that therefore he would first advise with himself,
and not rashly attempt so hazardous a business.</p>
               <p>He therefore communicates the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to his Dutchess <hi>Donna Lucia,</hi> sister to the
Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> a woman of a noble,
heroick, and masculine Spirit, with her he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
whether he were best accept of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of the Nobility, or to prevent all hazards
go to <hi>Madrid:</hi> and being anxious what course
to take, his wife nobly told him: <hi>My friend, if
thou goest to</hi> Madrid, <hi>thou dost incurre the danger
of loosing thy life; and if thou acceptest the Crown,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56653:58"/>
thou dost no more: consider then whether it be not
better to dye nobly at home, then basely abroad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words of his Ladies (say some) ainma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to a resolution to accept the Crown; so
he returned <hi>Gaston</hi> in answer, That he would
conform himself to the councels of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
resolving to live and run all hazards what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
with them, for the regaining of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
liberty.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Marquess of <hi>Ferreira</hi> used
his utmost endeavors for the reducing of those
Castles which still heldout for his Catholique
Majesty. The first day the Castle of <hi>Colline</hi>
was rendred, which for its situation was judged
in expugnable, yet the Captain of it no sooner
saw it besieged, but moved either with Gold or
fear, he delivered it up on Articles. The tower
of <hi>Belem,</hi> and that <hi>De la Cabera</hi> were suddainly
surprized before they within had any notice of
what was done; The strong Fortress of Saint
<hi>Giuliano,</hi> a modern Fortification, and built to
defend the mouth of the river, was ready to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
when a <hi>Castellane,</hi> who was there a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
and under sentence of death, for the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry
of a Fort in <hi>Brazile,</hi> shut out the captain,
who was gone to parly with the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and
resolved to defend it many days: he might have
held it out the siege, but finding neither ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
nor provision, consumed, as was believed,
on purpose by the Captain, who unwilling to
have the blot of a Traytor cast upon him, for so
suddain a delivery, thought it fitter to be forced
by necessity to open the gates to the Marquess.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56653:59"/>
After the surrendry of Fort <hi>San Giuliano,</hi> the
Marquess of <hi>Ferreira</hi> in the name of the King,
gave the Sacrament of Fidelity, or an Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to all the Orders, to wit, to the Clergy,
Nobility and Commons, which was received
with so much readiness, that had not the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
seen the necessary orders observed, the
people had run into certain inconveniences, so
much they strived to prevent one another in
willingness to perform this duty.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thursday</hi> the sixth of <hi>February,</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
made his entrance into <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with all
these applauses that a beloved King can expect
from his most loving Subjects. The rich Liveries
given by the Nobles, the Triumphal Arches,
the Streets hung with Tapestry, the multitudes of
the people flocking to see him, and the excellent
Fire-works, (which were so many that a Spaniard
cryed out, <hi>Es possible que se quita un Reyno a el

King <hi>Phillip</hi> should be deprived of a Kingdom,
with onely lights and Fire-works without a
powerful Army! certainly this is an evident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that 'tis the Almighty hand of God,) were
the least demonstrations of that Cities love and
joy: so great was the concourse of those that floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to see their new king, that though his Majesty
entred into the City by Noon, he could not
through the throng arrive at the Palace till two
hours after Sun-set: curiosity and love which
usually have the force to stir up all affections,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56653:59"/>
made this people flock so fast to the sight of their
Prince. And because it is prudence in a publique
joy, to accomodate ones self to the will of the
most, even those who either for envy, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause, hated the house of <hi>Braganza,</hi> did not
cease to make some demonstration of reverence
and mirth, and by how much the more they
thought themselves observed, by so much the
more they strove to seem other then they were.</p>
               <p>His Majesty being arrived at the Palace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of reposing himself, addicted himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to consult about carrying on the war; knowing
well that onely labour produces true rest. The
first consultations were concerning the expugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Tower of <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> which of all the
Forts in the kingdom only held out for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
King. To reduce this Cittadel, the Marquess
of <hi>Ferreira</hi> was sent in person with a numerous
Army, though for the most part tumultuary, and
ill ordered; but what they wanted in discipline
they supplyed in affection, not refusing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
themselves in the extreamest dangers: for
two days the Marquess found strong resistance,
but on the third day it yeilded, as it is supposed,
forced rather by bullets of Gold, then of Iron.
<hi>Don Antonio de Mascarendas,</hi> with a <hi>Portuguese</hi>
garrison was appointed commander of this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
which he very diligently repaired, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the dammages now received by Battery,
but with other necessary fortifications, to bring
it to greater perfection.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom thus suddenly reduced to the
devotion of <hi>King Iohn</hi> the fourth, the several
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56653:60"/>
Governors were commanded to their Countries
to levy Forces, who listed the inhabitants indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
from the age of Eighteen to Sixty; in
whom they found so much disposition, that many
offered their estates, and their lives, and would
follow the Colours, although they had licence
to depart.</p>
               <p>On the 25 of the same month, followed the
a Coronation of His Majesty, accompanied with
all those applauses and demonstrations of joy,
which could proceed from a people of infinite
Riches, who weary of the Command of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
were consequently ambitious of a King of
their own Nation.</p>
               <p>In the publique Place before the Palace upon
a most sumptuous Theater, was erected a great
Stage, and upon that a less, upon the top of which
but three steps higher, stood a Chair of State un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Canopy, all covered over with Cloth of
Gold. About noon His Majesty came forth of
his Palace Royal in a Suite of Chesnut colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Velvet embroidered with Gold, and buttons
richly set with Diamonds: about his neck was a
Collar of great vallue, whereunto hung the
badge of the chief Order of Knight-hood, called
<hi>El Ordine di Christo.</hi> He was girded with a gilt
Sword, his Robe was Cloth of Gold lined with
white wrought with Gold and flowers, the
Sword was born before him by <hi>Don Francisco De
Alello</hi> Marquis of <hi>Ferreira,</hi> High Constable of the
Kingdom; and before him was the Kings Banner
displayed by <hi>Fernando Telles de Meneses</hi> Earl
Marshal, before him went <hi>D. Manrique De Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56653:60"/>
Marquess of <hi>Govea,</hi> Steward of the Kings

Pursevants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majesty being ascended the Stage, and
having placed himself in the Chair of Estate,
had the Crown set upon his Head, and the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
delivered to him, with the accustomed Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
by the Archbishop of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> which done,
he spoke to His Majesty to this effect.</p>
               <p>Behold, O most Sacred Majesty, these your
Subjects who do more rejoyce to see this day, then of
all the days of their lives: They rejoyce to see the
Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> returned into its Ancient
stock, they rejoyce to have found a Father who will
govern them like Children, not Tyrannize over them
like slaves. They here, Great SIR, offer their estates,
their lives, and oblige themselves to run through
all the accidents of fortunes, to establish that
Crown upon your Head, which now with so much
devotion, with so much readiness they have placed
upon it. They cannot sufficiently express their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to Your Majesty; could they bring their
hearts, and lay them down at your Majesties feet,
they would not refuse to do it, so sure are they that
they have found a King all goodness, all love, who
will not let slip any means for the Establishing of
the Crown, for the quiet of His Subjects, for aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
his Dominions, and for the conservation of
those priviledges which have been written with the
blood of our progenitors: Be your Majesty gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleased to accept this common resentment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56653:61"/>
pressed by my mouth, there being nothing that more
comforts the mindes of good Subjects, than the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their Prince.</p>
               <p>The good old Prelate spoke these words with
so much feeling, that the tears of his eyes testified
the affection of his heart.</p>
               <p>To this speech of the Archbishops, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
returned answer, in expressions equal to his
love and greatness: That the weight of the
Scepter, and subjection to the Crown, were
things always dissonant to his Genius; That he
had of late years given them sufficient testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of it, whilst they were not more affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in offering, then he was ready to deny the
taking upon him the weight of the Kingdom.
That his now condescending to their desires,
was onely to provide for the kingdom, which
had been acquisted, and agrandized with the
blood of his Predecessors, and to take it from
the hands of those, who besides their unjustly
possessing it, had rendred themselves unworthy
of it, by endeavouring by all means to ruine it:
in sum, he concluded with thanks for their love,
offering himself ready to adventure his health,
and life, for their preservation, the redeeming
them from slavery, and maintaining of their
priviledges.</p>
               <p>This short discourse ended, His Majesty went
to the great Church in the same order as before,
where being set in a Chair of Estate, raised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Stage for that purpose, with a Christal
Scepter in his right hand, at which stood the
Lord <hi>Constable,</hi> and behind him the Lord <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56653:61"/>
there was placed before him a Table
Covered with Cloth of Gold, and a Cushion
thereon, upon the Cushion lay a Gold Crucifix
and a Messal. Here the Archbishops of <hi>Lisbon</hi>
and <hi>Braga,</hi> administred the ensuing Oath to the
King.</p>
               <p>WE swear and promise by the grace of God,
to rule and govern you well, and justly,
and to administer justice as far as humane frailty
will permit, to maintain unto you your Customs,
Priviledges, and liberties, granted unto you by the
Kings our Predecessors. So God help us God,
and this his holy Gospel.</p>
               <p>This Oath being administred, the three Estates,
to wit, the <hi>Clergy, Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> took
the following Oath of Allegiance to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
one for every one of the Estates, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
these words.</p>
               <p>I Swear by this holy Gospel of God, touching
corporally with my hand, That I receive for our
King and lawful Soveraign, the High and Mighty
King <hi>Don John</hi> the fourth, our Soveraign, and
do homage unto him, according to the use and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of his Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>This, and the Ceremonies attendant ended,
his Majesty, accompanied with all his Nobles,
returned to his Palace, whether notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it was a very great rain, all the <hi>Grandees</hi>
went bare-headed, where there was a most sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Banquet prepared, but his Majesty gave
himself wholly to consult of preparations for the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56653:62"/>
War, shewing thereby that Kings in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
felicity and delights, should not forget
affairs of State, and taking care for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Subjects.</p>
               <p>But amongst debates of the War abroad, there
happened one of an affair neer home, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the placing or displacing Officers of State;
and because His Majesty knew that the charge
of such Officers, must needs be with the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of many, and that there is nothing more
alienates the minds of men, then to see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
undeservedly deprived of their honors,
he took away onely the places of two, to wit,
that of the <hi>Providitore</hi> of the Custom-house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was Son in Law to <hi>Diego Soarez,</hi> and
brother in Law to <hi>Vasconsellos</hi> the late deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
slain Secretary; and that of the Count of
<hi>Castanhie,</hi> who was President of the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> or
Court of Conscience, because he was too much
interessed with His Catholick Majesty.</p>
               <p>As for the Infanta <hi>Margarita di Mantoua,</hi>
late Vice-Queen, and the Marquess <hi>Della Puebla</hi>
kinsman to <hi>Olivarez,</hi> the Castle called <hi>Pasos de
Angiobregas,</hi> was assigned them, with fourteen
thousand Crowns a year for maintenance. An
honorable prison it was, nor could they desire
any thing but liberty, which show'd a great
nobleness of minde in King <hi>Iohn:</hi> but Princes
always do like Princes, and much it demonstrates
the Magnanimity of the mind, to honor our
enemies, though they be our prisoners.</p>
               <p>Nor must we here forget the magnanimous,
and couragious Carriage of the Dutchess of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56653:62"/>
                  <hi>Mantoua</hi> late Vice-Queen; during these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
and distractions, for King <hi>Iohn</hi> sending
to ascertain her; that she should want none of
those civilities that were suitable to a Princess
of her high birth, provided she would forbear all
discourse and practises which might infuse into
any an ill opinion of his present Government.
She returned thanks to the Duke, (for she would
not stile him King) for his complement: but
withal fell into a grave Exhortation to those
Nobles that carried the message, telling them,
<hi>That they should lay aside all vain hopes, and not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
themselves, but return to their old Allegiance,
according as they were obliged by Oath, which if
they did, she doubted not to finde them all pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rest of the <hi>Castilians</hi> of Authority were
confined in the Castle, and all the souldiers
took the <hi>Portuguese</hi> pay, either because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
doing so, to be most for their interest, or
else because being most of them linkt in paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
with the <hi>Portugusses,</hi> they believed the
<hi>Portugal</hi> interest to be their own.</p>
               <p>Shortly after <hi>Lucia,</hi> now Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
Sister to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> with her
Son the Prince <hi>Theodosio</hi> arrived at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> who
were received with all imaginable expressions
of joy: the Queen was soon after solemnly
crowned, and the Prince installed, at whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallation,
the Nobles and Grandees of the
Realm, took to him the following Oath.</p>
               <p>WE acknowledge, and receive for our true
and natural Prince, the high and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56653:63"/>
Prince <hi>D. Theodosio,</hi> as Son, Heir, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
of our Soveraign Lord the King; and as his
true and natural Subjects, we do him homage in
the hands of the King, and after the death of our
true and natural King and Soveraign of these
Kingdomes of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Algarve,</hi> and beyond
Sea in <hi>Affrica,</hi> Lord of <hi>Guiana;</hi> of the Conquests,
Navigations, and Commerce in <hi>Ethiopia, Arabia,
Persia, India,</hi> &amp;c. we will obey his Commands
and Decrees in all, and through all, both high and
low: we will make War and maintain Peace with
all those that His Highness shall Command us:
And all this we swear to God upon the holy Cross,
and the holy Gospel.</p>
               <p>These Ceremonies performed withal fitting
solemnity, the King, to show that the good of
His Subjects was his onely care, called an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the three Estates of the Kingdom,
who being convened, and the King seated in His
Royal Throne, <hi>Don Emanuel D' Acugna</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Elvas</hi> made a Speech to them, to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purpose.</p>
               <p>THat one of the first laws of nature was, the
uniting of men together, from whence Cities
and Kingdoms had their Original, and by which
they after defended themselves in War, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
themselves in Peace; That for that cause
His Majesty had called this assembly to consult for
the better service of God, defence in War, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in Peace: That there could be no service
of God without union of Religion, no defence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
union amongst men, no Regular Government
without union of Councils: That His Majesty did
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56653:63"/>
expect to be informed by his loyal Subjects what was
for the good of the State; That they were to render
thanks to the Almighty, who had given them a king
that would govern them by known Laws; That his
Majesty did not esteem those Tributes lawfull that
were paid with tears, and therefore did from that
present, take off from His Subjects all Tributes that
had been imposed by the Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> because
His Majesty would not Reign over their goods,
nor over their heads, nor over their priviledges,
but over their hearts, hoping that they would find
out a sweet expedient, to defend their country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their potent enemy, who threatned to make
them all slaves, and to destroy, and to annihilate
their Nation. That they would therefore, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
His Majesties goodness and their own honor,
manifest at once unto the world, That as never
Subjects had such a gracious King, so never King
had such loyal Subjects.</p>
               <p>The Bishop having ended his Speech, the
most ancient Officer of the Chamber of <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
stood up, &amp; in the name of all the three Estates,
(who stood up likewise,) returned humble
thankes to His Majesty, for this gracious boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
heartily professing that they did not onely
offer up their goods, but their lives to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
service, earnestly intreating His Majesty to
dispose both of the one and the other, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And to manifest that their hearts and their
mouths concorded in this free offer of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
to His Majesty, they presently voted that
two Millions should be immediately raised by
the Kingdom: but His Majesty wisely and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politickly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56653:64"/>
declined the imposing of a Tax upon
his subjects, chusing rather to accept of their
benevolence; which made every one strive who
should offer most; so in stead of the two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there was in short time brought into the
Treasury four Millions of Gold.</p>
               <p>Nor was this money intended by them, nor
employed to any other use then to maintain the
<hi>Grandezza</hi> and Splendor of the King and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
there being no need of money for the
payment of Soldiers, every one offering to
serve freely, and at their own charge, against
their vow'd enemies the <hi>Castilians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us for some time leave the Assembly
sitting, and give an account how this action was
resented into the</hi> Spanish <hi>Court: Most mens
minds were struck with consternation, but</hi> Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares
<hi>came smiling to the King, saying; Sir,</hi> I
pray give me <hi>las Albricias</hi> to hansel the good news,
for now you are more absolute King of <hi>Portugal</hi>
then ever, for the people have forfeited all their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
by this Rebellion, besides the Estate of the
Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> with all his Complices are yours,
by right of confiscation, so that you have enough to
distribute among your loyal subjects by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<hi>But however</hi> Olivares <hi>seemed thus to
dissemble his passion; it was believed that this
news struck deeper into him then any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> upon the first news of the
Proclamation of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> sent a Letter to him
to this purpose:</p>

               <p>Thus was this kingdom utterly lost to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Monarchy, and not onely it, but with it all
that they enjoyed by that kingdom in the East-<hi>Indies,</hi>
the <hi>Tercera</hi> Islands, and other Islands
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56653:65"/>
in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, the kingdom of <hi>Algarve,
Brazile,</hi> together with all they had in <hi>Africa,</hi>
except the Town of <hi>Cexta,</hi> which was the whole
remained to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation of all those great
Dominions.</p>
               <p>But that all men might know the greatness of
their loss, and what the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
abroad, take here a brief narration:</p>
               <p>First, those Islands of the <hi>Tercera, Madera,</hi>
and <hi>St. Michael,</hi> so long time possessed by the
<hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, which though inconsiderable
to their other Dominions, yet deserve to be
mentioned; next those many strong places of
which they have made themselves masters in
<hi>Africa,</hi> as in <hi>Guiana,</hi> in the kingdoms of <hi>Congo</hi>
and <hi>Angola,</hi> the great Island of <hi>St. Laurence,</hi>
of <hi>Soffola</hi> and <hi>Mozambique:</hi> on the continent
thence passing the mouth of the Red Sea, they
have setled a Trade with <hi>Socatra</hi> and <hi>Calaite;</hi>
thence passing the Bay of <hi>Persia,</hi> to the mouth
of the River <hi>Indus,</hi> they subdued <hi>Calecut, Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
&amp;c. the Island of <hi>Goa, Ciaul, Daman,</hi>
&amp;c. thence toward the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> they
possessed <hi>Ceilam, Malacca, Sumatra, Solon, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantuca,</hi>
&amp;c. Thence farther they were entred
into the kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> into <hi>Iava-ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or,</hi>
and <hi>Minor,</hi> into the kingdom of <hi>China</hi> where
they fortified <hi>Macoa:</hi> In sum, the Kingdoms,
Provinces, Islands, and Cities, that the <hi>Portugal</hi>
Nation had conquered, and were possessed of
abroad, may in some measure be compared to
the Antient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; nor was their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
much inferior to the <hi>Romans,</hi> if we consider
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56653:65"/>
the War they made with the King of <hi>Cambaia,</hi>
who for puissance and Military courage, or
numbers of men of War, did exceed <hi>Xerxes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
or <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> the battels they had with <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malucco,</hi>
and <hi>Idaliam</hi> in the kingdom of <hi>Decam,</hi>
both equal to mighty Kings and their Armies,
consisting of the best Warriors of the East; the
War they have waged with the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca,
Sumatra,</hi> and <hi>Molucco,</hi> as also with the
Kings of <hi>Bengala, Peug,</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> &amp;c. with
many other formidable powers. Many of those
places most certain it is, were lost while the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
King had possession of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but
with it he likewise lost, and King <hi>Iohn</hi> the IV.
had possession of above fifty Towns and Forts
accounted impregnable, such were, <hi>Mozambique,
Cuama, Monomotasca, Mombaza, Masiala, Dui,
Damam, Bazaine, Chiaul, Onor, Barcelor, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galor,
Cananor, Cranganor, Cochim Conlan,
Negapatan, Meliapor,</hi> the Isle of <hi>Ceilam,</hi> the
kingdom of <hi>Iafanapalan,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Manac,</hi>
and <hi>Nombrede Iesu;</hi> then more Northward,
<hi>Azarim, Danue Agazim, Maim Trapor,</hi> and
many other places, in all which were maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Governors and Soldiers, and a Vice-Roy,
residing at <hi>Goa,</hi> with Courts of Justice, &amp;c.
hither many Kings of the East used to send Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to maintain amity with the King of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> and to bring Tribute to him; thus
the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade in the East extendeth it self
no less then four thousand Leagues, by which
Trade all the Garrisons are maintained, and all
the Ships, (whereof they are oftentimes two or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56653:66"/>
three Fleets) and much wealth sent home every
year; besides those aforementioned, the Crown
of <hi>Portugal</hi> has several Towns on the Coast of
<hi>Africa,</hi> so strongly fortified, that the Moors of
the Country could never yet recover them, such
as <hi>Tangeer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In <hi>America</hi> they possess the famous Country
of <hi>Brazile,</hi> which stretcheth it self one thousand
four hundred leagues upon the Sea coast, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
fourteen Governments, and many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Cities, <hi>St. Salvador, Pernambuco,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus great a loss did the Spanish Monarchy
suffer by the revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
King <hi>Phillip</hi> the fourth was very solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to recover, and to that end and purpose
did not onely consult with the greatest States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at home, but likewise with those abroad,
from one of whom he to that effect received
the ensuing Letter.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <p>BY the Letter which your Majesty was
pleased to write to me on the 6. of
<hi>March</hi> past, I am commanded to deliver my
advice touching the best expedient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of <hi>Portugal;</hi> Sir, the clemency used
by King <hi>Phillip</hi> the second, your Majesties
Grand-father, towards the kingdom of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
was a fatal presage of the present calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and future destruction, not onely of
<hi>Spain,</hi> but the whole <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that kingdom was onely in name, but
never really conquered, remaining rich, and
abundant with the same, if not greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56653:66"/>
then before: the Grandees and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
at home, the people not at all crushed,
and (which is more then all) the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the hands of Natives, and all his
Majesties other Subjects excluded from all
places of Power, Honor, or Profit. Sir, the
Holy Scripture, which is the mirror and rule of
our actions, teacheth, that when <hi>Salmanazar</hi>
conquered the kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> he did carry
away, not onely the Royal Family, but trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
all the Nobility and people into divers
Provinces of his kingdoms, and into the new
Conquests sent new Inhabitants; yet the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
were never such inveterate enemies to
the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> as the <hi>Portugals</hi> with devilish
madness have shewed themselves against the
Interest and conveniencies of this Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in the same Scripture it is read,
that <hi>Nebuchadonosor</hi> having conquered <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
transplanted all that he found in that
kingdom, leaving onely a few miserable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>le
people to remain there.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Athalia</hi> Queen of <hi>Iudah</hi> saw no other
way to preserve a kingdom newly conquered,
but by extinguishing all the Generation, upon
whom the Jews could cast their eyes in hopes
of revolt.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Iehu,</hi> King elected by God, extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Family of <hi>Ahab,</hi> together with all
his dependants, friends, and acquaintance, not
sparing so much as the Priests.</p>
                     <p>These Sir, are the Rules that the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
teacheth to be practised upon the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56653:67"/>
and people that abhor the Dominion of
their own Soveraigns.</p>
                     <p>It was, Sir, very fatal to stand expecting
and hoping for better times and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for the securing of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year 1639. observing the ill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Nation, my advice was, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any delay that kingdom was to be secured
by force of Arms; others were of the same
judgements, but fate would have it that (for
fear of new troubles) by delays way should
be made for Rebellion, then which there could
not have been a greater, although that form
of Government, which was expedient for the
<hi>Spanish Monarchy,</hi> and was always held neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for the preserving that Crown, had been
put in execution with the greatest violence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
                     <p>But when a Jewel is gone, the main inquery
should be by what means it may be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
not how it came to be lost.</p>
                     <p>The first means of recovering that Crown
may be (what your Majesties Grand-father
made use of) to buy your rights of your own
subjects by gifts and promises, wherein your
Majesty is to be as Prodigal, as the <hi>Portugals</hi>
are insolent in expecting or demanding, and
indeed experience teacheth that that Nation is
so addicted to their own Interest, that more
may be effected this way, then by a powerful
Army: to him will they be subject who will
give most, or from whom most can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
herein, prodigality will be good husbandry;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56653:67"/>
for when <hi>Portugal</hi> shall be returned to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of your Majesty, all that wealth which
hath been bestowed amongst them, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
likewise.</p>
                     <p>The second means is by course of Arms, but
this will be difficult at present, by reason of
the several engagements of this Monarchy
elsewhere; I suppose Sir, that in case <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
should be conquered by force, all their
Conquests in the East <hi>Indies,</hi> &amp;c. will remain
in their hands, for thither will they all flye,
and from thence will they be always ready to
assist our enemies: wherefore it would be very
expedient for your Majesties service, that a
Truce were first made with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition that they make War upon the
<hi>Portugal</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and have what ever
they can conquer, whence will arise this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
that they will want the wealth of their
Conquests, your Majesty being disengaged
with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> will sooner conquer them
at home, and the <hi>Hollander</hi> will onely come to
receive to day at the hand of your Majesty,
what to morrow the <hi>Portugal</hi> must deliver up
to them: At the same time the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
and <hi>Flemings</hi> may scour the Coast of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and the <hi>English</hi> may be invited to a more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Navigation in the East <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>China,</hi>
whereby the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade may easily be
ruined.</p>
                     <p>The third way is, that the <hi>Pope</hi> be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to thunder his Excommunications against
the house of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and against the whole
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56653:68"/>
kingdom, as perjured and perturbators of the
publique Peace, animating all Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to assist in the regaining that kingdom, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence of advancing the Catholique
Faith.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, diffidencies and jealousies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
may easily be fomented by means of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
Strangers, and by <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
under the name of <hi>French.</hi> And to effect
these diffidencies the better, a Treaty may
really be begun with the Duke, which being
discovered by the people (though it be before
the Duke could know thereof) they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him and all his Family, and in such case
the civil dissentions will open a way for your
Majesty to recover your rights: desperate evils
must have desperate remedies, the kingdom of
<hi>Portugal</hi> is the Canter of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
therefore,</p>

                     <p>Let not your Majesty defer the right remedy,
the greatest rigor is here the greatest Charity;
and to have no Charity, is to have much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
to bury this <hi>Hydra</hi> in its own ashes,
will be triumph enough; to live without this
arm, will be better then to have it employed
against ones own head: Let your Majesty ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
believe, or hope better of that Nation, then
you have seen these 60. years past; never
think to keep that Country, if not planted with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56653:68"/>
other people; the detestation against your
Majesties Government, is hereditary.</p>
                     <p>The Interest of the King, Sir, is very ample,
and hath no bounds against Rebels, every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is just and honourable that tends to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Kings right.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, a Truce is to be made with the
<hi>Catalonians,</hi> whereby they being freed from
the tumultuous courses of War, will have time
to take notice of the <hi>French</hi> insolencies, and
growing weary of that yoake, will at length
ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ily embrace the next opportunity to return
to their obedience, which once effected, will
make the people of <hi>Portugal</hi> waver betwixt
hopes and fears, and beget variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
amongst them, which for the Conquering
of kingdoms (the Emperor <hi>Iulian</hi> used to say)
was much more advantageous then the force
of an Army, as the Grand-father of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
found in the Succession of <hi>Portugal:</hi> To
this may be added, that it will be very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
that your Majesty name Bishops to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of all Governments, and Offices of the
Crown, to the most confiding persons in that
kingdom, for this will beget distrust amongst
them all, and the ignorant people not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom to trust, will put all into confusion,
whereby your Majesties service will be more
easily advanced.</p>
                     <p>This in obedience to your Majesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
I have imparted my weak advice,
wherein if I have erred, your Majesties good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will attribute it to my want of abilities,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56653:69"/>
not of affection: God preserve the Catholick

               <p>But notwithstanding all these endeavors, and
these proposed Artifices, nothing prevailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s recovery of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
nor was it probable that any of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
ever should, whilest is considered the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
love and affection which the whole
Nation of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> bore to the Family of
their present King, and the inveterate hatred
which did, and always have born to the <hi>Castili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which was so exceeding great, that it is
believed they would rather have suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be extirpated and routed out, then
again submit their necks to the <hi>Spanish</hi> yoake.</p>
               <p>And that ever the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it per force, is incredible, if we either
consider the Union and unanimity of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
Nation, and their resolutions to undergo
the greatest miseries of War can inflict, or the
Interest of all the other Princes of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who may justly suspect the encroaching
greatness of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
rather to lop off more limbs from that
great body, then suffer this to be rejoyned.</p>
               <p>But it is now high time to return to a review
of the actions of the Grand Assembly of the
Estates of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who next resolved to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
Ambassadors to all States of Christendom,
to enter into confederacies, for the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and establishment of the kingdom, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56653:69"/>
for the glory and reputation of the King.</p>
               <p>In the first place the Father <hi>Ignatius Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renas</hi>
a Jesuite, with another Father of the same
Order, was sent into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> to offer them
all assistance and supplies for their maintainance,
and defence against the Catholique King, for
very well did the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> know that
it highly did import his Interest to correspond
with them, that so they might joyntly, not onely
defend, but also offend the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose
Country lying betwixt them both, they might
at pleasure invade, or molest it, either by Sea or
Land.</p>
               <p>This Embassie of King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s so rejoyced
and encouraged the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> that the very
next day after the Ambassadors had audience,
they obtained a most signal Victory in their own
defence against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with an Army of twenty five thousand
men under the Command of the Marquis <hi>De los
Veles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after that the Father <hi>Ignatius Masca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renas</hi>
was dispatched to the <hi>Catalonians, D. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco
de Mello,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio Caelle Carra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallio</hi>
(persons both of excellent and admired
abilities, the one for his great experience and
judgement in State-affairs, and the other for
his noble Spirit, and eminent knowledge in the
Civil Law) to go on a solemn Embassie to the
most Christian King <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth of
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These attended with a Stately and most Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent
Train, landed soon after at <hi>Rochel,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:56653:70"/>
and on the fifteenth of <hi>March</hi> 1641. made a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Entrance into <hi>Paris,</hi> being met and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in by a great number of Coaches, filled
with the Grandees of the Kingdom, besides
numbers of the French Nobility, who came to
attend them on horse-back.</p>
               <p>Thus accompanied, they were conducted to
the Palace appointed for the Entertainment of
the Extraordinary Ambassadors, where they
were in a sumptuous and magnificent maner fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
at the Kings charges.</p>
               <p>From thence they were by the Duke of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereux,</hi>
and the Count <hi>de Brulon,</hi> conducted in
the Kings Coaches unto his Majesty then at
St. <hi>Germains,</hi> to receive the first Audience;
which was performed with extraordinary shows
of love and respect: for upon the entrance of
the Ambassadors into the place appointed for
their Audience, the King rose out of his Chair
of Estate, and went forward three steps to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, nor would he permit them to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Embassie with their Hats off, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
so low, as to kiss his hands at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but in stead of that Ceremony, he affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately
embraced them in his Arms, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them the greatest Assistance his Power was
able to give.</p>
               <p>They were from the Kings presence conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a sumptuous Dinner provided for them,
and after that brought to the Queens Lodging,
who was set to expect their coming: at their
entrance she likewise rose, and advanced three
steps to meet them, receiving them with a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56653:70"/>
cheerful and courteous countenance, and not
permitting them to be uncovered.</p>
               <p>Amongst other Discourses which they had
with her, <hi>D. Francisco de Mello</hi> told her, That he
feared his Embassie might not be acceptable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the King his Master had deprived her
Brother of one of his kingdoms. Whereunto
she readily replyed, <hi>That though she was sister to
the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>yet she was wife to the King of</hi>
France.</p>
               <p>After some Discourse in <hi>French,</hi> her Majesty
began to speak to them in <hi>Spanish;</hi> which they
observing, desired to know wherefore her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had not vouchsafed them that favor soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
it being a Language by them better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood?
To which the Queen jestingly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
For fear they should be frighted to hear her
speak <hi>Spanish;</hi> and the Embassador to improve
the jest, replyed, <hi>Como a tam Grand Signora si,
pero como a Castiliano no,</hi> that it was true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
her Greatness, but not her Countrey:
The Queen smilingly went on, promising them
all assistance possible, and wishing all prosperity
to King <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Queen; and so they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
delivered her Majesty a Letter from the
Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> took their leave.</p>
               <p>From her Majesty they went to visit his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
the Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
of their coming, came forward to the
third Chamber to meet them, where he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them with expressions of great affection,
and promises and proffers of services, and from
thence conducted them to his own Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56653:71"/>
Being all three sate, the Cardinal (who was
the most experienced and greatest Statesman of
his time) discoursed with them of divers affairs
of great importance, and they endeavored to
explain to his Eminence what was before his
sentiment, that it very much imported the two
Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> to be united by
an indissoluble League, considering that it was
the chief and principal end and aim of the House
of <hi>Austria,</hi> (whose branches were spread over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all <hi>Europe)</hi> not onely to be the greatest,
but to be the sole and onely Monarch of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom:</hi>
That to effect those ambitious desires,
he had never made scruple to usurp and seize
upon Kingdoms and States upon the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
imaginable, as had appeared in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Naples, Sicily, Navarre,</hi> the Dutchy of
<hi>Millan,</hi> and lately several States in <hi>Germany,</hi> sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
upon the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> whereby they had a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
open to lead an Army of <hi>Germans</hi> into
<hi>Italy</hi> at pleasure.</p>
               <p>That considering the vast power and interest
that this Family had, not onely in <hi>Europe,</hi> but
also in <hi>America,</hi> it could not but be confessed
that they had a large foundation of their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
universal Monarchy; but that nothing
gave them so great hopes, as the possession of
<hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by the addition of that Kingdom to the
Crown of <hi>Castile,</hi> they became absolute Masters
not onely of all <hi>Spain,</hi> but of all the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>
of all the Eastern Trade of <hi>Ethiopia, Persia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,
China, Iapan,</hi> and all that incredible
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56653:71"/>
wealth that was raised out of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
whereby the <hi>Austrian</hi> Greatness (if not their
Monarchy) was principally sustained, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it concerned all States whatsoever, not
onely to put a stop to the raving Tyranny of
this devouring Monster, but to suppress and
lessen his Power by all means possible.</p>
               <p>That to do this, none was more concerned,
or more able, than the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with that of <hi>Portugal:</hi> That this having bin
called the Right Arm (as <hi>Catalonia</hi> the Left) of
that great <hi>Austrian Colossus,</hi> now both being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from it, and united to <hi>France,</hi> will be
able to do greater service against it, than they
were ever forced to do for it, not onely by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting
the Spaniard within his own doors, but
by intercepting the <hi>Plate-Fleet;</hi> which in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> it being necessarily
forced to pass by the <hi>Tercera</hi> Islands, must run in
danger of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Fleet, or be forced to
be at the charge of an extraordinary Convoy.</p>
               <p>These were the sum of the Ambassadors dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
to the Cardinal: In answer to which, his
Eminence made offer, not onely of all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the most Christian King his Master,
but that he would disburse himself for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> promising that he
would presently send thither a Fleet of twenty
Sayl with his Nephew, Admiral and Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
Extraordinary.</p>
               <p>This Treatment thus ended, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
took their leaves, his Eminence waiting
upon them as far as the Stairs; which when they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56653:72"/>
endeavored to hinder, he replyed, That the
Ambassadors of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> were to be
treated with as much respect as those of the
<hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Few days after, a <hi>Iuncto</hi> of the King of <hi>France</hi>
his Council, were appointed to treat with the
Ambassadors in the House of the Lord High
Chancellor of the kingdom, where a Peace
was fully concluded between the two Kingdoms
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other Ambassadors were (about the same
time that the afore-mentioned were sent into
<hi>France)</hi> dispatched into <hi>England;</hi> for it very
much concerned the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> to
maintain a good Correspondence with the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> both in regard of the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and Commerce of both States, and also
the better to break that Amity and good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
which was now held between the
Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and that State. Hither there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were sent Don <hi>Antonio D' Almado,</hi> and Don
<hi>Francisco D' Averado Leilon,</hi> both persons of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
parts; who, notwithstanding that the
Dunkirkers chased them, arrived safe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for all the sturdy endeavors of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Ambassadors, they were received on shore
with abundance of respect; yet His Majesty of
<hi>England</hi> would not give them Audience, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the Ambassage from the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
so tender was He of His Honor and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
till Don <hi>Antonio de Sosa</hi> their Secretary,
had drawn up a Paper, to satisfie him of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56653:72"/>
Right and Title of the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> to the
Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The sum of which was:</p>
               <p>Vpon the Death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal,
without Issue, many pretended (together with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta
Donna Catherina</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Braganza,</hi>
and Grandmother to this present King) to the Crown
of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but all their pretences wanting foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
soon fell, except that of <hi>Philip</hi> the second,
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who propt up his with force.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> was Vncle, equally near to both, but
with this difference; <hi>Catherine</hi> was the Daughter
of a Son named <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> was the son of
a daughter named <hi>Isabella,</hi> brother and sister to King
<hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> pleaded, That he being in equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with <hi>Catherine,</hi> was to be preferred for his Sex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catherine</hi> replyed, That the constitution of that
Kingdom allowing Females to succeed, and withal
the benefit of Representation in all Inheritances, she
representing <hi>Edward,</hi> must exclude <hi>Philip</hi> by the
very same right that her father (if he were living)
would exclude <hi>Philips</hi> mother.</p>
               <p>This Conclusion is infallible in <hi>Jure:</hi> whereto <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
answered, That successiou of Kingdoms descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jure sanguinis,</hi> there was allowed no Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catherine</hi> destroyed that foundation, alledging,
That the Succession by the death of the last King, was
derived <hi>Jure haereditatis, &amp; non sanguinis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Succession of Kingdoms was to be regulated
by that ancient way, whereby all things descended by
Inheritance; the other way of Succession being not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56653:73"/>
known until later Ages, nor ever practised either in
<hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal</hi> in such cases.</p>
               <p>Briefly in behalf of <hi>Catherine</hi> it was urged,
(which by the <hi>Castilians</hi> can never be denied, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered)
That she was no stranger, but a Native of
the Kingdom, to whom alone (according to the Laws
of <hi>Lamego)</hi> the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> can appertain.</p>
               <p>The King having perused and deliberated
upon this Paper, gave immediately order they
should be presently conducted to <hi>London,</hi> which
was done withal convenient Solemnity, and they
logded in a Palace ready prepared for them:
soon after with great ceremony they received
audience of His Majesty, in a fair and stately
Hall prepared for that purpose, where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
sat upon a Throne raised two steps, and at
the entrance of the Ambassador pulled off his
Hat, nor would be covered till they were so
too.</p>
               <p>To the Propositions made in the speech of
D. <hi>Antonia D' Almoda,</hi> concerning a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> His Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
That he should be very glad if an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
might be found out to renew the antient
Leagues of friendship between the two Crowns,
without the breaking with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some few days after, the Ambassadors were
conducted to give a Visit to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of
<hi>England,</hi> who sat in a Chair of Estate ready to
entertain them: when they came into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
She rose out of the Chair, and came as
far as the Carpetting, making low reverence as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56653:73"/>
the Ambassadors bowed; when they came near,
Her Majesty made them be covered, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they spoke with their Hats off. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
the Queen told them, that she much
desired to hold Correspondence with Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> 1641. a Peace
was absolutely concluded with the <hi>Portugal,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the earnest endeavors of Don <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo
Cardenas,</hi> Leiger Ambassador for <hi>Spain,</hi>
who by gifts and promises, even as far as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> endeavored to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it.</p>
               <p>The Embassadors that were sent to the King
of <hi>Denmark</hi> (notwithstanding the great Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and Commerce that had formerly bin held
between that Kingdom and <hi>Portugal)</hi> were not
(by reason of the great interest the House of
<hi>Austria</hi> had with those Kings) received; yet
the King gave all possible respect otherwise to
them. From thence they passed into <hi>Sweden,</hi>
and were magnificently entertained at the yong
Queens Court at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> where a League
was soon concluded, and the Ambassadors dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed,
according to the custom of that Nation,
with Gold Chains, and the Queens Portraicture
in a Meddal of Gold.</p>
               <p>The Ambassador D. <hi>Tristano De Mendoza
Hurtada,</hi> that was sent to the States of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces,</hi> was received with the like magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
and seeming affection, and a Truce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> for ten
years; for a Peace the States would not assent
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56653:74"/>
to, because they having conquered many places
in <hi>Brasile, Angola,</hi> &amp;c. which belonged to the
Crown and Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> could not
make restitution of them; by reason they now
belonged to the <hi>West-India</hi> Company; nor could
the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> allow the Conquest, as
things of right belonging to his Crown, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on it.</p>
               <p>But now we come to treat of a more solemn
Embassie, to wit, that to the Pope: Long was
it debated in the Assembly of Estates, whether
an Ambassador should be sent to <hi>Rome</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
or a more opportune conjuncture of
time be expected. Some were of the opinion
that the sending an Ambassador without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay, would be a testification of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and incline the Popes Holiness to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Don <hi>Iohn</hi> the lawful Heir, and rightful
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which would extreamly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and advance the Affairs of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>But others there were who conceived those
things rather desirable than feasable, and were
of the opinion they should rather stay till a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunity, alledging, that the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s present power at <hi>Rome,</hi> might probably
oppose the Reception of their Ambassador: that
although the Pope never was in his heart a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
yet he would never yield to show himself
an enemy to the Catholick King: That the
Spaniards cunningly fomenting the opinion
which all the world had entertained, that his
Holiness did in all things favor the <hi>French</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
would from such a Reception, draw as much
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56653:74"/>
as ever they could ask or desire. That for this
cause the Pope (that he might not seem their
enemy) had always granted them whatever they
desired; That therefore they thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
first to sound his Holiness, before they
run the hazard of the disgrace and affront which
might fall upon His Majesty, and the whole
kingdom; That in case the Pope should decline
the reception of the Ambassador, to whom could
they repair or appeal to vindicate the injury
done to the Crown? That many Popes had
been s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fascinated to the interest of their own
family, that the world had very great occasion
to believe, that their designs tended rather to
what was best for themselves, then to what was
best indeed: That the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, had as
much reason to distrust the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> as any,
whilst they had to their cost had examples how
they onely pursued their own ends. As particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, who at first seemed
so affectionate to the kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that
he imployed the utmost of his power for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of his own family, approved of all that
King had done; That there was none who had
more to give, or at least who had more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
then the Catholique King, so that in any
business of competition he must necessarily gain
the better.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all these Arguments to
the contrary, upon the promises of the King of
<hi>France,</hi> to be a Mediator at the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi>
for the reception of their Ambassadors, by the
suffrage of some few voices, to make the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56653:75"/>
part, it was concluded, That Ambassadors
should immediately be sent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in pursuance of this Vote, the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
made choice of two reverend and
able persons, to wit, <hi>Michael De Portogallo,</hi> Son
to the Count <hi>Vimioso</hi> of the blood <hi>Royal,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Lamego,</hi> and <hi>D. Patableone Rodriguiz,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Elvas:</hi> No sooner was the news arrived
at <hi>Rome</hi> of their being landed in <hi>Italy,</hi> but the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> mustred themselves together,
with resolution either to oppose their entrance,
or at least hinder their reception; whilst on the
other side the <hi>French, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Catalonians,</hi>
assembled themselves together, resolving to
hazard their dearest blood in their cause.</p>
               <p>His Holiness seeing these preparations on
both sides, feared lest his country should be
made the seat of a petty war, and considering
that in any case the dishonor would accrue to
him, if whilst under his command and protection,
the person of an Ambassador should be violated,
strictly commanded all his Guards to take speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
care to prevent the violencies in tended.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> by this order hindred from
what they purposed, their Ambassadors openly
protested, that if his Holiness did receive the
<hi>Portugal</hi> Ambassador, they would immediately
leave <hi>Rome.</hi> But notwithstanding these protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and all other opposition they could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
make, in <hi>November</hi> 1641. the two <hi>Portugal</hi>
Ambassadors being met by divers Cardinals,
Princes, and Cavaliers, well armed, entred
into <hi>Rome,</hi> and were conducted to the Palace of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56653:75"/>
the <hi>French</hi> ambassador, who received them with al
respect possible, still giving them the precedence.</p>
               <p>Hereupon several Manifesto's are scattered
abroad by the two <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors, the
Marquess <hi>De los Veles,</hi> and D. <hi>Iohn Chiumarrero,</hi>
labouring to prove that his Holiness ought not
to receive the Ambassadors of the Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi>
as they stiled him. First because he was a
tyrant, and usurper of that Kingdom, which had
been in the quiet possession of the Catholick
King these sixty years. Secondly, because he was
a Rebel, and a perjured person having sworn
Allegiance to the Catholique King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirdly,
that the reception of these Ambassadors would
animate other Subjects of the Catholique King
to Rebellion.</p>
               <p>But whilst the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
shooting such Paper-Bullets, the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi>
used all their endeavors, both by them
selves, and the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, (who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
order from the most Christian King his
Master to that purpose,) to prevail with the
Pope, to give them audience, and admit their
Embassy: but his Holiness was so fearful to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> lest he should afterwards
take occasion to revenge himself upon his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew's,
that he utterly declined their reception,
yet not out of any of the Spaniards Allegations,
but upon pretence that certain of the Church
Rites had been violated in <hi>Portugal;</hi> the Arch-bishop
of <hi>Braga,</hi> and other Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
being kept in durance, though it was for
very good reasons, as hereafter shall appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:56653:76"/>
Yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not content with this
resolution of his Holiness, but (whilst the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi>
were endeavoring to prove their cause, by
both Political and Legal Declarations, Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and Arguments,) fearing lest the Pope
might chance to alter his mind, resolved to
to make a quick dispatch of the business, and to
that purpose two hundred <hi>Banditi,</hi> were hired to
seize upon the Bishop of <hi>Lamego,</hi> and carry him
to <hi>Naples,</hi> as the Prince of <hi>Sans</hi> had been before
served by them, and there put to death.</p>
               <p>But this design, themselves at length could
not agree upon, for the Marquess <hi>De Los Velos,</hi>
thought it would be better and less dangerous
to give the <hi>Portugals</hi> a publique affront in the
City, which was concluded to be put in effect,
and to that purpose it was communicated to the
rest of the Nation, (whereof upon several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
there are always many in <hi>Rome)</hi> who assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together well armed at the Ambassadors
Palace: and so great is the power of Revenge:
that to the end they might the better effect
their design, and yet not appear as souldiers,
though there were many Gentlemen of
quality amongst them, they condescended to go
under the name of Foot-men to the Marquess.</p>
               <p>The Popes Holiness hearing of the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> sent to them to let
them know, that he could not but be very much
distasted, to see such disorders attempted in a
peaceable City, and therefore desiring them
for his honors sake to desist, and withal sent
a Messenger to the Bishop of <hi>Lamego,</hi> to assure
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56653:76"/>
him that he need not fear any thing, for upon
the word of his Holiness, he should walk the
streets undisturbed.</p>
               <p>But do the Pope what he could, either by
threats, desires, or perswasions, the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were resolved to prosecute their de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ign, which
they put in execution to their own cost, on the
twenty of <hi>August</hi> 1642. On which day the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Lamego</hi> going to visit the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
one of his retinue observed, that he was
dog'd by a <hi>Spanish</hi> spie; whereupon a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spy
was sent to the Marquesses to bring intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
what they were doing there, who brought
word to the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, that there was
great preparations of Coaches and Men: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>French, Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Catalonians,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
and armed themselves with Pistols and
Fire-locks, to convoy home the Bishop.</p>
               <p>By the way they were met by the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Ambassador, accompanied with about eight
Coaches full of Captains and Officers come from
<hi>Naples,</hi> and guarded with about sixty Foot-men,
besides divers others of that Nation. No sooner
came they in sight of the Bishops Coach, but they
cryed aloud, <hi>Che si fermassero all' Ambasciatore
di Spagna;</hi> that they should stop for the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
of <hi>Spain:</hi> but the <hi>Portugals</hi> driving on, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>Che si fermassero Loro,</hi> that they should
stop.</p>
               <p>Hereupon both sides with their Swords drawn
leapt out of the Coaches, and making a stand,
one Gun was first fired by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> side,
and immediately seconded with a brave volley
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56653:77"/>
on both sides; when they fell into Swords point
the Bishops side soon getting the better of it, yet
there was slain a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> and
a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> page, but on the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Marquesses side, there were eight killed upon
the place, and above twenty wounded, the
Marquess leaving his Coach-horses dead, esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of the back of the Coach, which stood
upon the place till next day, and got into the
next shop without his hat, and trembling for fear,
from whence he was carried to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Albornoz</hi> palace. The <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
returned first to the <hi>French</hi> Palace, and
from thence went safely home.</p>
               <p>His Holiness the Pope was extreamly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
at these disturbances, and therefore to
prevent the like for the future, Commanded a
guard of Souldiers to be put upon the houses,
both of the Bishop and the Marquess. But
shortly after, when the Bishop of <hi>Lamego</hi> had
again pressed the Pope, by a large memorial of
the reasons why he should be received, and was
absolutely refused, he was by his Master the
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> called home:</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were acting abroad, the
<hi>Castilians</hi> begun to make continual in-roads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the borders of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which made King
<hi>Iohn</hi> look more narrowly into the defence of
his kingdom, fortifie all the Frontiers, and train
up his Subjects to military excerises.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in one in-road which they
made into <hi>Portugal,</hi> laid waste all before them,
sparing neither sex nor age wheresoever they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56653:77"/>
came, which made the <hi>Portugals</hi> in revenge,
commit the like out rages in, an inroad they made
into <hi>Gallicia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these were publick enmities, and therefore
more easice to be opposed; but there was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
serpent that lay lurking at home, which was
so much the likelyer to do mischief, by how
much it was more secretly hidden. Some few
there were who thought themselves so highly
obliged to the Catholick King, as to endeavour
the reuniting of the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> to his
vast dommions, and again inslave their country
to forreigners.</p>
               <p>The principal of these was the Archbishop of
<hi>Braga,</hi> always a great creature and favourite of
the Count <hi>Olivares,</hi> who had at the beginning of
the revolt, show'd himself so opposite to the
freedom of his country, that many Gentlemen
were once resolved to make him suffer the same
fate with <hi>Vasconsello's</hi> the Secretary; Nor had
he ceased ever since to show visible signs of his
discontentment at the Government.</p>
               <p>In this Archbishops head was the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
first hatch't, and by him communicated
to <hi>D. Lewis de Meneses</hi> Marquess of <hi>Villa Reale,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Comigna</hi> his son, two persons
sufficiently ambitious, and both discontented, as
not thinking themselves sufficiently rewarded
according to their merit: These the Archbishop
tampered with, perswading them, That it was
a low and unworthy thing, much beneath their
birth and greatness, to suffer themselves to be
subject to a fellow Subject: That it would be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56653:78"/>
much more Noble and Generous in them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
their Allegiance to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> their
ancient Soveraign, who was able to bestow more
upon a person deserving in one day, then the
Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> could in a hundred years.
These &amp; few other arguments were sufficient to
draw those, who before out of their envy to the
house of <hi>Braganza,</hi> were inclinable to a change.</p>
               <p>These made sure, the Arch-Bishop next
draws into this Plot a Gentleman of a Noble
blood, named, <hi>D. Augustine Emanuel,</hi> a man
of excellent parts, but somewhat necessitated,
nor had ever been looked upon, or put into any
employment, which without any other incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
were motives sufficient to move a man to
any desperate design. Next him was added to
this conspiracy, <hi>Pietro Baeza,</hi> a lately convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Jew, whom the <hi>Portugueses</hi> call Upstart Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
he was famous for nothing, but his vast
riches; being a great <hi>Criado</hi> of the Count <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares,</hi>
whose favor, he used often to say, would
one day advance him to high honor, or to a
high pair of gallows, which last proved very
true.</p>
               <p>Many private meetings had these, and some
few other Conspirators, where they debated to
bring their designs to effect; some were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that before they could bring it to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
more should be acquainted with it, for it
was impossible that so few should ever be able
to compass it: But in this course there arose
many fears and doubts, lest too many being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, some should discover it, as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56653:78"/>
had often happened in designs of that high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
yet at length it was found necessary to
draw more into the Plot, for whilest they were
so few, the business onely rested in imagination,
but could never be put in execution.</p>
               <p>Having therefore added some more to the
number, their next debates were of the maner
how to bring it to effect; some advised that a
power of the Catholique Kings was to be got in
a readiness, but they then thought that the King
of <hi>Portugal</hi> would raise as great a force, and so
prevent a sudden invasion: Yet in answer to
that objection, it was by some aledged, That the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> by way of intelligence might be let in,
which again seemed as difficult, the <hi>Militia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the hands of persons most loyal and trusty
to the King: Others proposed, that the onely
way to effect it was by a sudden and violent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of the King; but this advice was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by most, who inclined to a mediocrity,
and would rather have found out a way to make
his Majesty renounce his own Right and Title to
the Crown, and retire himself from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which should be presented unto him.</p>
               <p>But whilest they thus wavered in opinions,
and inclined to that moderation, which is the
ruine of all designs of this nature, they gave
the King time and occasion to search out their
Plots; for his Majesty having always had a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitious
eye upon the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Braga,</hi>
and the Marquis of <hi>Villa Real,</hi> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
now private notice, that they had had
sundry meetings, and were observed daily to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56653:79"/>
converse with persons as discontented as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
endeavored by all means possible to
know the depth of their Counsel, and at length
intercepts some of their Letters to <hi>Madrid,</hi>
which discovered not onely the whole Plot, but
even the names of all the Conspirators.</p>
               <p>The Act of holding correspondence with the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> was Treason in it self, sufficient to
take away their lives, being contrary to his
Majesties express command, it's being to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
made it but so much the more hainous:
His Majesty therefore not knowing how far it
might have proceeded, made no delays, but
presently by the sound of Drum and Trumpet
(as the custom is) caused to be proclaimed,
That he intended to go forth of the City; upon
which all the Nobles and Gentry, according
to the usual maner, assembled at the Palace,
to accompany his Majesty, who when he saw
them all ready, commanded first that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Estate should be called, which was done,
many of the Conspirators being assistant in it,
who being sate, his Majesty without any noise
caused them to be arrested one by one, which
without the taking of this course, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have effected; for if the Conspiracy had
been detected before their persons had been sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
they had either been torn in pieces by the
fury of the people, or else had some of them
escaped.</p>
               <p>It was very strange that of all the Plotters in
this conspiracy, not one should, either by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or otherwise, escape, for the persons of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56653:79"/>
these now taken, were no sooner imprisoned,
but his Majesty published a Proclamation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
a Free-Pardon to all the Complices in
this conspiracy, that should within four days
come and acknowledge their fault, and beg it;
but the Kings diligence had been such before,
that there was not one left to accept of this
grace.</p>
               <p>Shortly after those who had been taken, were
arraigned according to Law, found guilty of
High Treason, and in maner following executed.</p>
               <p>On the last day of <hi>August,</hi> 1641. the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Villa Reale,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Camigna,</hi> his
son, the <hi>Count de Armamac,</hi> and <hi>D. Augustine
Manuele,</hi> were led along a Gallery to a Scaffold
erected for the purpose, with two stories, on the
uppermost of which stood two Chaires, on the
next one, and on the Scaffold it self the fourth.</p>
               <p>The first that was conducted forth to Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was the Marquis of <hi>Villa Reale,</hi> who was
clothed in a long black Bayes Cloak, and his
servants attending him in mourning; being
mounted to the uppermost part of the Scaffold,
he prayed for a good space upon his knees, and
then rising up, asked, if there were no hopes of
Pardon? which made the people with one voice
cry out, <hi>No, let him dye, let him dye for a
Traytor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next funebrious Ceremony of his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was the Proclamation, which according to
the usual maner was made by the Executioner,
in these words;</hi> This is the Iustice that the King
our Soveraign Lord, commands to be executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56653:80"/>
the person of <hi>Don Lewis de Meneses,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Marquis of <hi>Villa Real,</hi> that his throat be
cut as a Traytor to his Majesty, Nobility and
People of this kingdom, that for his Crime his
goods be confiscated, and his memory banished
out of the World. <hi>Whereat all the people cryed
out,</hi> Iustice, Iustice.</p>
               <p>The Marquis thereupon seeing no hopes of
any reprieve, with a sober and becoming gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
demanded Pardon of all the Spectators,
desiring them to assist him with their prayers to
God for the Pardon of this, and all his other
sins; then turning to a Father Jesuite his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
he prayed him in his behalf to present
himself at his Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esties feet, and beseech him
out of his wonted goodness, to forgive him that
hainous offence committed against him and the
whole kingdom.</p>
               <p>Having ended this Speech, he very patiently
sat down in the Chair, and the Executioner ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tied his arms and legs, to the arms and
legs of the chair, he leaned his neck over the
back of the chair, and the Executioner with his
knife cut his throat, covering him afterwards
with a black Scarf.</p>
               <p>In the same maner his son the Duke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migna</hi>
came to the Scaffold, his servants all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
him in mourning; as he came to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Corps he kneeled down, and several times
kissed his feet, begging of the people the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of one <hi>Pater nostre</hi> for his fathers soul; then
after some prayers, and Proclamation made by
the Executioner, he received the same punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56653:80"/>
Next that suffered was the Count of <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac,</hi>
in the Chair seated upon the lower story;
and after him <hi>Don Augustin Manuel</hi> upon the
Scaffold it self; the Judges would have had all
their necks cut behinde, but his Majesty would
not consent thereto, as a punishment too igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
for persons of their quality.</p>
               <p>The same day <hi>Pietro de Baeza,</hi> and <hi>Melchior
Correa de Franca,</hi> were drawn at a horse tayl
to an extraordinary high gallows, and there han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
whilest <hi>Diego de Brito Nabo,</hi> and <hi>Antonio
Valente,</hi> were executed upon a lower; the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of these four were set up at the gates of the
City, and their heads placed upon several
Frontier Towns.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>September</hi> following, for the
same offence <hi>Antonia Cogamigne,</hi> and <hi>Antonio
Correa,</hi> were likewise executed; the first of
which during the whole time of his imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was an example of penitence, feeding
onely upon bread and water, and whipping
himself very often, with continual prayers to
God for Pardon of that, and all his other sins.</p>
               <p>As for the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Braga,</hi> and the
Bishops of <hi>Martiria</hi> and <hi>Malacca,</hi> and Fryer
<hi>Emanuel de Macedo,</hi> though they were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that had the greatest hand in the conspiracy;
yet in regard they were Ecclesiastical persons,
they suffered no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> death, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
but were kept in prison, till the Popes
pleasure were known concerning them.</p>
               <p>Here must not be forgot a great example of
humility and repentance in the Arch-Bishop of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56653:81"/>
                  <hi>Braga,</hi> not onely in his life time (when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
writ to the King, that he might suffer, and
others be spared, who were rather drawn in, in
complyance and obedience to him, then out of
any ill will to the King and kingdom) but also
at his death (which happened about three years
after his imprisonment) when he gave order
that as soon as he was dead, his last Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
should be carried to the King, wherein
he humbly intreated his Majesty to Pardon the
Treason committed against him, and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, and that he would permit his
body to be buried without the Church of any
Parish of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and that without any Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
or Tomb-stone, that there might remain
no memory of a man who had been a Traytor to
his King and Country.</p>
               <p>This exemplary punishment and rigorous exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Justice upon the forementioned tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Delinquents, established the King in his
kingdom, struck a terror into his enemies, and
increased his Subjects love and care of him more
diligently to watch his Royal Families, and the
kingdoms safety.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time daily incursions were
made upon the Frontiers between the <hi>Castilians</hi>
and <hi>Portugueses,</hi> with the same violence, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and animosity, as formerly.</p>
               <p>But now come we to relate the most shameful
piece of treachery ever yet heard of, acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that most Noble and Gallant Prince the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante
<hi>Don Duarte,</hi> or <hi>Edward,</hi> brother to the
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who had served the Emperor
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56653:81"/>
in his Wars, with much gallantry, and no less
success, long before his brother <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had
any thoughts of a Crown; nor did he shew any
endeavors to desert the Emperors service, after
the news arrived of the Revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but
seemed resolved to continue there, till he was
betrayed by <hi>Francisco de Mello a Portugal,</hi> at
that time Ambassador to the Catholique King
in the Emperial Court.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Mello</hi> notwithstanding he was bound by
many strong Obligations to the House of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi>
yet like an ungrateful villain, having
opportunity offered, now resolves to build his
fortunes upon their ruine, or at least displeasure,
he therefore earnestly sollicites the Emperor to
seize upon the person of <hi>Don Duarte,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him up to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> alledging of
what great concernment the securing of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would be to the Catholique King; that it
much behoved his Imperial Majesty to shew his
affection to his brother the Catholique King
in this particular, which would not onely prove
of Interest to <hi>Spain,</hi> but the whole house of
<hi>Austria:</hi> That this Prince was the onely Prop
of the House of <hi>Braganza;</hi> that this was the
onely means which God had left in the hands
of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> to recover the kingdom
of <hi>Portugal;</hi> that it would be a great error both
in prudence and policy to let ship so fair an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
for that if he should scape out of their
hands, and get to the assistance of his brother,
both his personal valor and experience in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
affairs would very much infest the Catholick
King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:56653:82"/>
The Emperor was not onely not perswaded
by this Discourse of <hi>Mello</hi>'s, but extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at it; returning him in answer, that he
did abhor and detest so great a breach of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
faith, and violation of all Laws of hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;
that it would be both against the liberty
of the Empire, and against his own honor, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison
a Prince who had committed no fault to
the Empire, but rather had laid innumerable
Obligations both upon it, and himself.</p>
               <p>Nor was the detestation of the Arch Duke
<hi>Leopold</hi> to an act so foul and shameful, less then
that of his brothers the Emperor; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all which, <hi>Mello</hi> was not at all discouraged,
but still prosecutes his villanous design, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
with great sums of money the Count of
<hi>Tratsmandorf,</hi> and several other Pensioners of
the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> but they were soon weary
of so base and shameful and employment; which
made <hi>Mello</hi> think of a more cunning Artifice,
which was to perswade the Emperor to hearken
to the allurements of one <hi>Diego di Quiroga,</hi>
who of a soldier was turned Monk, and was
now Confessor to the Empress: This Father
who had often been called to give his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Affairs of State, endeavored by all
means possible to perswade the Emperor that he
might not onely with a good conscience secure
the Infante, but that according to the best rules
of Interest of State, he ought to do it.</p>
               <p>His Imperial Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esty notwithstanding all
these perswasions, was very much unsatisfied in
the action, and once fully resolved not to do
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56653:82"/>
it; but at length overcome by <hi>Mello's</hi> importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and the Ghostly perswasions of <hi>Quiroga,</hi>
he was as it were constrained to alter his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to give order to <hi>Don Lewis Gonzaga,</hi>
to go to the Princes quarters at <hi>Leipen,</hi> and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
him to <hi>Ratisbone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time to endeavorto prevent all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll
impressions, which an action so hainously wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
might strike into all bosoms that had either
honor or honesty; it was given out abroad, that
the Infante <hi>Don Duarte</hi> was secretly fled for
some misdemeanor from <hi>Leipen,</hi> (when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of his own innocency, was in his journey
to <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> according to the summons) and
thereupon proposal made of sixteen thousand
Crowns, as a reward to any man could bring him
either dead or alive; so that the Prince being
ignorant of any such thing, very hardly escaped
their hands, who out of hopes of the money,
had gone in search of him; but missing them,
he came to <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> where he was no sooner
arrived, but without any reason given, he was
cast into a common goal, and all his servants
imprisoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Francisco de Mello</hi> having thus far
brought his desires to effect, stops not here, but
afresh sollicites the Emperor, that the Prince
might be delivered into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands,
and sent prisoner to <hi>Millain:</hi> but instead of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to this, he sends a messenger to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante,
assuring him upon his word, that he would
not deliver him into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
but would speedily procure his liberty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchisement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:56653:83"/>
Yet notwithstanding these fair promises of
the Emperors, <hi>Don Duarte</hi>'s ill usage in prison
daily and hourly increased, not could he by any
means possible get audience of the Emperor,
not without any reason, for, <hi>no face is more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to the offender then the face offended;</hi> which
made the Prince make his protestation, calling
God and man to witness of the injury done him
by the Emperor, to whom he was neither sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
by Obligation, nor Birth; that when his
brother was made King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he was in
the Emperors service, and wholly ignorant of
any design of his brothers; that if the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> were offended, he should revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the person offending; that that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
no way concerned the Emperor, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All these Allegations the Emperor confessed
to be true, by a messenger sent to the Infante in
prison, again assuring him that he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him up to his enemies, but that he could
not release him for some reason of State: which
made <hi>Don Francisco de Sosa Contigno,</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
extraordinary from <hi>Portugal</hi> to the King of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> in the name of the King his Master,
represent at large to the Diet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> the
whole proceedings, requiring Justice and liberty
for the Infante: But it is in vain to plead against
Interest, all the Manifesto's, Protestations, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
and Intercessions made, produced no
other effect then the removal of the Infante
from place to place, that still as he was the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off, he might have the harder usage.</p>
               <p>But hitherto the Emperor seemed immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56653:83"/>
able in his resolution of not delivering up the
Infante into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> till
tempted with what made <hi>Iudas</hi> betray his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and our blessed Savior to death, <hi>Money;</hi> he
consented to the breach of his resolve, for upon
the promise of forty thousand Crowns (contrary
to the immunities of the Empire, to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of free Princes, to the Law of Nations,
and to his word and promise so often reirerated)
he consented that that Noble and innocent
Prince should be sent whither the Catholique
King should think fit; so away he was hurried
towards the Castle of <hi>Millain,</hi> there to remain a
prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the way as he entred into the Spanish
Territories, he was received by the</hi> Count de
Sirnela <hi>Governor of that Dukedome, where the
Emperors Commissary took leave to return, to
whom D.</hi> Duarte <hi>openly said,</hi> Tell thy Master
that I am more sorry I have served so unworthy a
Prince, then to see my self sold a Prisoner into the
hands of my enemies; but the just judge of the
world will one day suffer the like dealing towards
his children, who are no more priviledged for being
of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> then my self that am of the
blood Royal of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and posterity will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udge
of him and me.</p>
               <p>The Emperor had given instruction to those
that convoyed the Infanta, that in case their
prisoner made an attempt to escape, they should
kill him upon the place: being arrived in <hi>Millain</hi>
he was clapt in the Common gate with all the
Rogues and <hi>Banditty,</hi> having a guard lodged
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56653:84"/>
with him in his Chamber, so rude that they would
scarce admit him to take his rest.</p>
               <p>Thus was this generous, but unfortunate
Prince rewarded, for having left his Country,
kindred, friends, interest; for having at his own
proper cost and charges, served the Empire eight
years, for having always, and upon all occasions
ventured his life with the most daring, and yet
expecting no other pay but thanks, nor other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
but honor.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iohn</hi> was extreamly perplexed at this
inhumane barbarism used to his Brother, which
he vowed fully to revenge with Arms; but he
could for the present do it no otherwise, then
defensively, by reason of the continual inroades
the <hi>Castilians</hi> made into <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1642. (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Truce that had been concluded
between <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and that a great
Fleet of <hi>Hollanders</hi> had been sent to assist the
<hi>Portugal</hi> against the <hi>Spaniard)</hi> there passed
very high Acts of Hostility between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> beyond the Line;
for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> seeing the disunion of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
from <hi>Castile,</hi> made all speed possible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Conquest of those parts before a perfect
Peace should be concluded with <hi>Portugal,</hi> that
so in the Treaty they might pretend reason, that
all things should continue in the state they were
then found.</p>
               <p>To this purpose, that is, the expediting their
Conquest, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> treacherously (whilest
there was all quiet and peaceable Commerce
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56653:84"/>
held between the two Nations in the kingdom
of <hi>Angola)</hi> surprized the <hi>Portugals</hi> that were
Governors of the place, killed divers, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
all of the great wealth they there found; of
which perfidiousness, as also of the barbarous
usage of the prisoners there taken, complaints
were made to the <hi>States General</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
but no redress granted; nor was the King of
<hi>Portugal</hi> of ability to force it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the affairs in <hi>Portugal</hi> were
a little discomposed by the general discontent
and distast taken at the Secretary of State <hi>Don
Francisco de Lucena:</hi> This man had lived a long
time in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> till he was by <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi>
made under-Secretary to <hi>Vasconsellos,</hi> his
readiness to Proclaim King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the place, made the King continue him in
it, reposing in him so great a confidence, that
though some had advertized his Majesty that
he kept correspondence with the Court at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
yet the King would not suspect him, nor
permit him to be brought to a Trial.</p>
               <p>But about the middle of the year 1643. the
urgent affairs of the kingdom requiring a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the three Estates, they openly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all Acts that should pass the hands of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>Lucena,</hi> positively telling his Majesty, that
until he were brought to Tryal, no Acts should
pass in the Assembly of Estates, nor any farther
proceedings be made.</p>
               <p>His Majesty was very much grieved hereat,
yet prudently resolved to give his Subjects satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
by delivering up his Secretary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56653:85"/>
yet resolving he should have a fair Tryal,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o that purpose sitting himself to hear the
Witnesses examined. Whilest Process was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against the Secretary, some secret advice
came to his Majesty, which caused the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the brother, and three servants of the
Secretary, together with an <hi>English</hi> Monck,
and a Cavalier of the habit: not long after the
Secretary was arraigned and condemned for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
his truth, in holding correspondence
with the enemy, and in neglecting timely to
advertise the Infanta <hi>Edward</hi> to retire out of
<hi>Germany, &amp;c.</hi> and according to his sentence exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in a publique place in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where at his
death he protested his innocency touching any
treachery towards His Majesty.</p>
               <p>The death of the Secretray both pleased the
people, and satisfied the Assembly of Estates,
who now according to His Majesties command
met on <hi>September</hi> 18. 1643 and being all sate,
and His Majesty sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in his Throne, D. <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel
D' Acugna</hi> Dean of His Majesties Chappel,
rose up and after reverence made to the King,
spake to the effect following.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>THat in the space of sixty years that that
Kingdom was under the power of the
Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> there had bin but two Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of States, the first to inslave, the next to
abuse them. But that since they were under the
present King, within the space of two years,
they had two Assemblies, the former to settle
their liberties, the present to beget a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56653:85"/>
between the King and his people,
wherein they had all freedom to demand what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was necessary, that the world might see
they are now no longer slaves but children, no
longer strangers but natives, and that they are
under rather a loving father, then a severe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>
                  <p>In the former Assembly, said he, his Majesty
took all the Customs, and left the defence of
the Kingdom to your hands, you ordered what
seemed good unto your selves, you made
choice of a General Assistance by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
but in the leaving thereof, the first
payment was found ineffectual, the second un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
the third insufficient; whence arose some
complaints, some imagining that the fault pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the unequal division of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
others from the change of value in
mony and comodities, and others from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
gathering and disbursing the whole:
I may easily say, that if there were any errour
committed, yet it might be excusable for that.
<hi>Never had any weighty affair it's conception and
perfection at once: Then shall errours cease to be in
Government when men shall cease to be in the
world.</hi> These things are to be indured with the
same patience that droughts, dearths, inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and such other disorders in nature, for
the wit of man cannot hold forth a remedy
for all diseases. But certainly they will be no
ground of reprehension, (though much of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
to him that shall consider how His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
entred upon a Kingdom, exhausted by the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56653:86"/>
                     <hi>Castilians</hi> of mony and other necessaries, for
offence or defence, and yet how in less then a
year and a half, we should want neither Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
nor Artillery, nor Horse, nor Arms, nor
Fortification, nor Armies upon the Frontiers,
three powerful Fleets put to Sea, divers hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and extraordinary Ambassages, besides
many secret (yet necessary expences) all which
will astonish any understanding man. Now to
the end that the people may have full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
His Majesty hath commanded, that (before
further proceeding) it be made appear particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
how all the mony received hath been laid
out, and then it is expected, and the present
state of affairs requireth that we all contribute
liberally, considering that these charges are
but for a time, but our liberties are for ever:
That we shall never have a better opportunity
to destroy our enemy. That nature teacheth
to hazard an arm, to save the whole body:
The Merchants at Sea cast away some part of
their goods sometimes, to save the rest; we are
now on shipboard in a storm, our Goods, our
Lives, our Liberties, our Honor, our Country,
are all in danger.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the barbarous usage of the King
of <hi>Castile</hi> towards the Infanta <hi>Don Duarte,</hi> calls
upon this Assembly for revenge, that we spend
not onely our mony, but our blood in affection
to him, and that we make our enemies spend
theirs in satisfaction for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>This speech of the Deans was spoken with so
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56653:86"/>
much affection, that it stirred up and encouraged
the States readily to give all assistance imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
both for redressing of greivances, and for
the levying Arms, so that within a small time
after, the King was in the head of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and three thousand Horse, marching
towards the Frontiers of <hi>Castile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst these great preparations for Hostility
were made, the Queen brought forth into the
world a second Son to His Majesty, but first
childe after he came to the Crown, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> added to
the magnificence of his christning, he was named
<hi>Alfonso,</hi> and his brother <hi>Theodosio</hi> dying before
his Father, succeeded in the Kingdom, and is at
present King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many Skirmishes had passed between the
<hi>Castilians</hi> and <hi>Portugueses,</hi> many town had been
surprized, many lands wasted, but never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a set-battel between them till in the year
1644. when both Armies met upon the border
of <hi>Portugal</hi> in a field called <hi>Campo Major.</hi> The
<hi>Spanish</hi> Army which for the most part consisted
of strangers, was under the Command of the
Marquess of <hi>Forrecusa,</hi> and the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army
consisting of natives, and some few <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
were commanded by <hi>Macchias de Albuquerque.</hi>
This fight was maintained with all possible
courage and resolution on both sides; but the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> being more numerous, especially in
horse, at length put the whole <hi>Portuguese</hi> Army
in disorder, seized on their whole Artillery, and
baggage, and slew <hi>Albuquerques</hi> horse under
him, took many prisoners, and assured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56653:87"/>
of an absolute victory. But fortune which
had thus favourably smiled upon them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the day, frowned as harshly upon
them in the conclusion; for <hi>Albuquerque</hi> being
remounted, rallied again his scattered forces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the pursuing <hi>Spaniards,</hi> put them to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
rout, and pursued the chase for above 3 miles.</p>
               <p>In this battel the <hi>Castilians</hi> lost 1600 men upon
the place, amongst which were the Lieutenant
General, the General of the horse, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

about four thousand Arms, and a thousand horse.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Portuguese</hi> side there were not above
three hundred slain, among which were two

by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their flight.</p>
               <p>It was not long after this Battel, that the

Lord Treasurer, President of the Council of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and Councellor of Estate, with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were imprisoned upon suspition of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
against the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Examination found that the suspition
was by the Spaniards cunningly raised, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
King <hi>Iohn</hi> of his most able Ministers, and
to make the world believe the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56653:87"/>
were discontented with their King; they
were set at liberty, and their Honors fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
by a Proclamation of the Kings.</p>
               <p>For the Spaniards ceased not by all means
and devices, which the will and policy of the
most wicked States-men could invent, not onely
to weaken the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Nation within it self,
by breeding discontents (if possible) between
the King and the three Estates, but likewise to
undervalue them, and make their credit be sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and disregarded by other Kingdomes and
States, their Confederates and Allies.</p>
               <p>Yet besides these subtile Ambages, the King
of <hi>Castile</hi> did not desist the endeavoring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
this kingdom by force of Arms; but not

which had proved so tedious and so chargeable
a war to <hi>Spain;</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in this Kingdom, and
in <hi>Germany,</hi> there happened several Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and popular Tumults in some of the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> Dominions, which not onely robbed
that King of a present supply of Treasure, but
were otherwise retardments to the prosecution
of his Wars in other places.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:56653:88"/>
The first of these Commotions began in the
Island of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the people gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a tumultuous maner, forced the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
to take off all new Imposts and Taxes which
the Kings present necessities had enforced him
to lay upon them. This encouraged their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
on the adjacent Continent, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the famous City of <hi>Naples,</hi> in hopes to
rid themselves of their oppressions, to rise in like
maner in Arms; which they did encouraged and
commanded by one <hi>Thomas Aniello,</hi> or vulgarly
<hi>Masaniello,</hi> who though of so mean and obscure
a birth as a poor Fisher-boy, yet to the wonder
of the world for ten dayes commanded this
mighty City, and freed it from all Gabels, so
that ever since these two kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi>
and <hi>Sicily</hi> have rather been a great charge, than
any benefit to the Spanish Monarchy.</p>
               <p>These Troubles, and the <hi>Austrian</hi> Families
being every where encompassed and embroiled
in Wars, together with the earnest desire of the
King of <hi>Castile</hi> to prosecute a vigorous War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> were I suppose
the motives which perswaded the Catholique
King to end those Wars, which had lasted in
the low Countries for above ninety years, by
owning now at last (what he had so long refused)
the united Provinces free States, so an absolute
peace was concluded on, and proclaimed at all
the chief towns in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> on the 5. of
<hi>Iune</hi> 1648. a Peace no less advantagious to the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> then disadvantagious to the <hi>Portugals,</hi>

and other places in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> King
<hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> about the beginning of the year
1649. thought his Son the Prince <hi>Theodosio</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at an age fitting to keep a Court of himself,
Lodgings were therefore appointed for him, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Royal Palace, and Officers of his
houshold nominated and appointed by the King,
amongst whom the Earls of <hi>Villa nova,</hi> of <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
of <hi>Valdereis</hi> &amp; <hi>Fernando, Tellez de Menezez,</hi>
(who had formerly been governour of the City
of <hi>Port,)</hi> were entrusted as the principal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of his Chamber.</p>
               <p>The King likewise thought fit to adde a third
to the two former Superintendents of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
whom he nominated to be <hi>D. Rey de
Moure Tellez,</hi> whose former Office of Steward
to the Queen, was at the same time conferred
on <hi>D. Antonio de Silva</hi> Lord of <hi>Billas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the Truce, the Hollanders
still continued their outrages on the other side
the Line, but principally in <hi>Brazile,</hi> where they
seized upon many of the <hi>Portugal</hi> forts, impeded
the Traffick, abused and murthered the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which made His Majesty resolve to call the
Earl of <hi>Castle Melhor</hi> from his charge of being
General of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Forces upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> and committing that to the
young <hi>Viscount de Villanova de Servera,</hi> that the
Earl might be imployed as Viceroy to <hi>Brazile,</hi>
to curb the <hi>Flemings</hi> insolencies, and to secure
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Merchants Ships from their py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
the King appointed a Fleet of forty Ships

His Holiness the Popes anger as yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>But in the middest of this setling of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical

               <p>The commotions of the Parisians against the

valiant act before he departed from his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
made the Marquess of <hi>Leganez</hi> governour
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> forces at <hi>Estramadura,</hi> give an
Alarum to the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Frontiers, and enter
into the Country with two thousand horse, and

assaulting him, forced him to retire with shame,
and excuse himself that he marched out onely
to meet the Marquess of <hi>Mortare,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to succeed him in the Government.</p>
               <p>Yet this small and worthless Alarum, made
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who knew that too much
care could not be had of the safety of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to send Orders to the Governors to look

their charges then formerly, and strictly to give

party which assaulted it, being slain by a valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

for which service the King bestowed upon the
French-man a pension of six hundred Crowns
<hi>per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whilst His Majesty was distributing his

into <hi>France,</hi> to renew the Alliance, and
conclude a firm League between the King of

of his services, bestowed a valuable pension on
his aforesaid widdow.</p>
               <p>There was almost dayly inroads made upon

His Majesty notwithstanding his great engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> that on his
behalf, and in his name, having first most friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saluted you, (as I now do with the greatest
affection of my heart that I am able) I may
joyntly tender and make known to you, the
Royal desire which my Master feels within
himself, to conserve and more and more to
knit the knot of that Amity which uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hath ever been between the <hi>Serenissimo</hi>
Kings of <hi>Portugals</hi> their Ancestors, and this
renowned <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>It being my part to endeavor what lies in
me, to remove all obstacles that may hinder the
most vigorous effect of this hearty union, and
conjunction of minds, so to preserve inviolably
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56653:92"/>
the ancient peace between us.</p>
                  <p>This I come to continue, hoping and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all happy success therein; this I come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
and offer unto the Parliament of the
Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> with that sincere
and pristine affection, which hitherto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of many ages hath made manifest.</p>
                  <p>Nor shall you need to scruple the sincerity
of my intention and purpose, by reason of the
divers past attempts (not to say fights) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your power and ours, since they have not
been such as have broken or dissolved our ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor have had their rise or approbation
from the King my Master, nor as we believe
from the Parliament of the Commonwealth
of <hi>England,</hi> but more probably carried on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the impulse of their own private affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
or by the defect of that circumspection
which in such cases is ever necessary.</p>
                  <p>But as I hope particularly and fully to prove
(indeed to demonstrate) this truth unto the
Parliament of the Republique of <hi>England,</hi> so I
am assured they will not onely rest satisfied
therein, but shall also have accruing to them
a newer force, and sence of mutual friendship
between us, since the jarrs that happen amongst
friends, are oftentimes justly accounted as
certain redintigrations of love.</p>
                  <p>And I do admire our enemies have not
made this reflection, whilst fed with vain hope,
they have thought it in their power to sow and
foment discords between us, upon presumption
of this trivial innovation.</p>

The King my Master sends me to continue
and preserve our common and ancient peace,
whereof I am to make a render unto the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> in
His Majesties behalf, as proceeding from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
sincerity in his Royal breast, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he is chiefly drawn by the motive of his
singular esteem and love, he bears unto this
English Nation.</p>
                  <p>And this, as the main point I shall recommend
unto you, both in regard of your greater good
and ours, and as a thing of highest concernment,
that we reflect how little it can be pleasing to
Almighty God, and how derogatory it must
needs be to our reputation on both sides, to
give the least beginning of discord between two
Christian Nations, so well affected to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as we are.</p>
                  <p>It is manifest unto the Parliament of the
Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and to all <hi>Europe</hi>
besides, in how wonderful a manner (such as
was onely possible to God, the King my Master
was restored to his Kingdoms, and how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majesty (whose handy-work this was)
doth by his especial care and grace defend and
continue this restoration.</p>
                  <p>Which as it doth dayly more appear by the
victories we have over our enemies at home, so
again it is seen in our remotest and most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
dominions in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at a huge distance (His Majesty possessing
the hearts of his people, enjoyes that greatest
peace in the world, and is secure in <hi>Affrica,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56653:93"/>
relying thereupon his prosperous and happy
powers.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, the King my Master, lest any
thing should be wanting to render him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
happy, hath (according to the wish of
an ancient <hi>Christian</hi> Author, for securing the
prosperity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, a faithful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
puissant Armies, and a most obedient
people, Fortifications in the judgement of
wisest politicians, conducing and necessary both
to defend and increase Empires and Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Now in this good condition of not onely
gaining and conserving friends, but also of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing
our enemies, the King my Master
loves and embraces peace, as the chiefest good
amongst humane things, holding it forth to all
Kingdomes and Commonwealths, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to this of <hi>England,</hi> with that exceeding
good will which he hath hither to born, &amp; shall
ever bear unto the same, standing thereunto
obliged by such bonds of love and good offices,
as shall never be forgotten by His Majesty.</p>
                  <p>For the people of this Nation are the most
worthy successors of those their Heriock An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
who by their just power and Arms
came freely to vindicate our Crowns from the

with a fervor and zeal of defending
the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> justly did disdain to see
it in the unjust possession of a forreign Prince.</p>

snatch away this undue possession from the said
Usurper, maugre the concurrence of some ill
affected <hi>Portugals</hi> with our enemies; and that
they might archieve this end glorious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to us emolumental, they are those
who covered these as with their Squadrons and
Fleets of Ships, ever formidable to their most
potent enemies by a new example of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard

then given us leave to be happy) come up to
the very walls of <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this having formerly been between us
and them most powerful English-men, and
our most loving brethren, now that the Crown
of <hi>Portugal</hi> (for which you have fought so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly,
when it was unlawfully detained, is
happily restored to the possession of the natural,
and lawful King to whom of right it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains)
who would not admire to see you bend
your equal power, (upon no occasion given)
against the true and rightful King of <hi>Portugal</hi>
by joyning with, and favoring the same Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
(beaten by us, from whom your selves did
heretofore by force of your own Arms in our
behalfs endeavor to snatch and wrest away that
Crown he had unjustly seized upon, and whom
indeed you have hitherto both in desire and
effect opposed.</p>
                  <p>It would to all the world seem a thing much
removed from the innate generosity and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of this your Nation, and very ill suiting
with your Christian justice and equality, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it would be a very unworthy requital of us

(who have deserved better at your hands, and

the same happiness that we our selves desire to
enjoy.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore these imaginary Clouds of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
vanish, and be quite blown over from our
thoughts, as serving onely to Ecclipse with
darkness, the clear light of our antient amity,
which (with what intention God Almighty
knows,) the importune sagacity of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy would fain deprive us of.</p>
                  <p>Let all obstactles be removed, and thrown
quite away, wherewith the true serving politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
by their inbred ambition of an universal
Monarchy do conspire the ruine of us both;
aiming at nothing more then to set us together
by the ears, that overthrowing each other
with our own Wars, we may have brests open,
(when our powers are exhausted) to their swords
and wounds, with greater advantage against our
selves, and less hazard unto them.</p>
                  <p>This new Republique is built upon strong and
sure foundations, as also our antient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
Kingdoms, let us therefore cast our
eyes unto the common interest of our cause,

such effect, as may render both parties secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the greater forbearing, and bewaring
above all things, all provocations, or irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of War, whereby (besides the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and losses which they ever draw after
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56653:94"/>
them,) all our own affairs and safety may be
hazarded extreamly, while their councels and
endeavours will be promoted, who by hidden
and wicked arts, strive to extend their own
power, by the common waste they would
make in ours.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> my Master, hath sent
me hither furnished with a firm ample plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary
power, that discussing, and screwing
all the just and convenient meanes, I may
confer about the conservation of Peace, and
(removing all emergent obstacles and scruples)
resolve, and establish with the Parliament of
the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> whatsoever
shall be necessary for composing of our present
affairs, and maturely to provide with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
security that may be possible, for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
well being.</p>
                  <p>I therefore beseech the Parliament of the
Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> that weighing and
considering these things which I have exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they would please to decree whatsoever
shall seem to them most convenient and just.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this large Speech of forced and known
flattery, if we respect it in relation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
it was spoke to, (though most true in those
particulars relating to the <hi>English</hi> Nation whilst
monarchical) was answered by the Rebels, with
a large Harange of the injuries they supposed
done them by the protection of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi>
Fleet, and seizure of the English Merchants
Ships and Goods, concluding that they must have
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56653:95"/>
reparation made for the publique damage of the
Commonwealth, which they would be willing
to accept of in any honorable manner, and were
willing to that purpose, if the Ambassador had
sufficient power to treat with him to that
effect.</p>
               <p>In summe, after sometime the Count <hi>Del Sa</hi>
Lord Chamberlain of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi>
arrived in <hi>England,</hi> in the quality of an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
extraordinary, who after many Conferences
Addresses and large Offers made, obtained a
Peace, upon condition to repay great Sums of
monyes towards the satisfaction of the losses of
the English Merchants.</p>
               <p>During the stay of this Ambassador, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>D. Pantaleon Sa,</hi> Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> led by I
know not what frantick madness, made a great
uproar upon the New Exchange in <hi>London,</hi>
where some <hi>English</hi> were by him and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
murdered; for which several of his retinve
were hanged, and himself, notwithstanding the
earnest solicitations of his brother, afterwards
beheaded upon Tower-hill, when the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> was changed from a strange
kinde of Commonwealth, to a stranger kinde of
Monarchy, under a Protector.</p>
               <p>But to return back again to the affairs of the
Kingdom of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Castle Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi>
who had been sent Vice-Roy into <hi>Brazile,</hi>
had so good success, that with the assistance of
those <hi>Portugueses</hi> before in the Kingdom, he
expulsed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> out of all their Garrisons
there, except the strong Fortress of <hi>Recif,</hi> which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56653:95"/>
was built upon a Rock wholly invironed by the
Sea. This animated the United States of the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> to endeavour a revenge and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of that country, and to that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
a Potent Fleet was set out, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the very earnest endeavours, and large
offers of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ambassador at the <hi>Hagne,</hi>
set sail to reconquer that Kingdom, but not with
that success which was expected, for the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
proved wholly fruitless, and after so great
an expence, the States were so highly disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the Admiral <hi>Wittison</hi> was arrested at
the <hi>Hague,</hi> to answer such things as should be
objected against him concerning that voyage.</p>
               <p>It much concerns that King who hath to deal
with enemies too potent for him, to strengthen
himself with such Alliance, as may most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
him, and endammage his foe; This consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
made King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> about
the year 1652. send an Ambassador to the
young Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> (who by reason of the
scituation of his Country, had good and frequent
opportunites to annoy the Catholique King,)
and divert him from turning his whole Force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Kingdom) offering reciprocal Marriage
between that Duke and his Daughter, and the
young Prince <hi>Theodosio</hi> and <hi>Savoy's</hi> Sister. But
this his intention, was I suppose diverted, if not
wholly hindred by the great power of Cardinal
<hi>Mazarine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who designed one of his
Nieces as a fit match for <hi>Eugenius</hi> young Duke
of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not at all safe nor fit for a Subject to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56653:96"/>
grow too rich, at least not to exceed his Soveraign
in Treasure, for he thereby layes himself open
to the envy and suspicion of his Prince, nor is it
possible that any who hath managed a publique
employment, can be so without faults, as that
somewhat cannot be laid to his charge to render
him at a Kings mercy.</p>
               <p>Sufficient example of this we have in D. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
de Mascarendas</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Goa,</hi> in the
<hi>East-Indies,</hi> who having for many years officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that high imployment, had gathered up an
infinite Mass of Riches, and now being called
home, thought in peace and quiet to enjoy what
with a penurious and industrious hand he had
been many years storing up: but the King being
informed that he had indeed such a vaste treasure
in Gold, Diamonds, Pearls and other Jewels, as
he could not with his own honor or safety per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a Subject to enjoy, easily found out them
who were ready to form complaints against him,
which were as readily listned to by the Kings
Councel, who presently drawing up a charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, for having used an arbitrary power,
oppressed, and abused the Subjects, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
trading thither, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> caused the Ship
wherein he came, with all the riches laden on it,
to be seized on for the Kings use, and himself
for sometime imprisoned, nor had it been a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if he had made a forfeiture of his life, as well
as of the greatest part of his Estate.</p>
               <p>The strength of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at Sea, had
been the greatest obstacle to the <hi>Portuguese,</hi> not
wholly regaining there ancient possession in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zile,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:56653:96"/>
but the Wars wherein the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had
involved themselves with <hi>England,</hi> proving so
powerful a diversion, the <hi>Portuguese</hi> took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to reduce <hi>Recif,</hi> which with several
Forts that encompassed it, and some few other,
were the onely places that held out against
them.</p>
               <p>Against this therefore with a sufficient Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,
came <hi>Don Francisco Barreto</hi> governor of
<hi>Pernambuco,</hi> (whilst the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Navy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of 65 Sayl blocked it up by Sea,) and
first by storm took the Fort of <hi>Salines,</hi> and thence
coming before that of <hi>Burracco,</hi> found it already
abandoned, and blown up be the defendants:
he next proceeded to the new Fortress, the next
and strongest Fort to that of <hi>Recif,</hi> and well
manned and munitioned. Thus having made a
sturdy resistance, was at length forced by the
<hi>Portugal,</hi> which so amazed the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that
though they had fifteen hundred men, and six
months provisions in <hi>Recif,</hi> yet they agreed to
yield it upon honorable tearms on the 26 of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary
1654.</hi> being twenty four years after they
had taken it from the <hi>Portugals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe conditions upon which this stronge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess
was surrendred up, were to this effect.</hi>
1. That D. <hi>Francisco Bareto</hi> should forget all
Acts of Hostility made by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> against
the <hi>Portugals</hi> by Sea and Land. 2. That all
persons whatsoever, even the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Recif,</hi> and
<hi>Maurice</hi> town, though Rebells against the King of
<hi>Portugals,</hi> should be pardoned. 3. That all <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56653:97"/>
should be free to carry away those goods
they actually possessed. 4. That they should have
sufficient numbers of Ships, able to pass the Equine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial
Line, with Iron-guns for their transportation.
5. That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> married with <hi>Portugal</hi>
Woman or Natives there, should be dealt so withal,
as if they had married Dutch Women, and should
with the consent of the women, have power to carry
them away with them. 6. That those who would
stay there under the obedience of the <hi>Portugals,</hi>
should be used as well as if they were native <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
and as to their Religion, should live as other
strangers do in <hi>Portugal.</hi> 7. That all forts about
<hi>Recif</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi>-town, <hi>viz.</hi> the port of
<hi>St. Bastions, Boa, Vista, St. Austines, Convent,</hi>
the Castle of <hi>Maurice</hi>-town, that of the three Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
the <hi>Brum,</hi> with it's Redoubt, the Castle of St.
<hi>George,</hi> and all others should be surrended to the
aforesaid D. <hi>Francisco Barreto</hi> governor of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambucco,</hi>
with all the Ordnance and Ammunition
presently after the signing of these Articles.
8. That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> should be free to remain in
<hi>Recif</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi>-town for three months, they
surrendring their Arms, which should be restored
to them when they took shipping, and in the mean
while they should have power to buy them necessary
provisions of the <hi>Portugals</hi> for the voyage. 9. All
Negotiations and Alienations should be made
during the said three months, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Articles. 10. That the Governor should quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Forces where he pleased, and that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
should be protected during those three
months, and having liberty to end their private
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56653:97"/>
differences before their own Iudges. 11. That they
should carry away all their Papers whatsoever.</p>
               <p>12. That if they could not sell their goods in the
said three months time, they should leave them with
whom they pleased under the obedience of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi>
to be disposed of according to their own order.
13. That they should have all the victuals in the store
houses of <hi>Recif,</hi> and the other Forts for their voyage.
14. That as to their pretensions against the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
they might sue them at the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi>
Court. 15. That all their Vessels should be
restored unto them, which they might fit for their
voyage. 16. That they might have liberty to advise
all their Ships upon the Coast, to come and laid their
goods at <hi>Recif:</hi> And in the last article it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
that upon the demand of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that
this might not prejudice any former treaty between
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the States General, D.
<hi>Francisco Barreto</hi> would not assent thereunto.</p>
               <p>There were other articles likewise granted
to the military Forces, the sum of which were,
that all offences and hostages might be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that all souldiers should go out of <hi>Recif</hi>
with their Arms, Match lighted, Bullet in
mouth, Flying-colours; but coming near the
<hi>Portugal</hi> Army, should put out the Match, and
lay their Arms in those Magazines appointed
by the governour of <hi>Pernambucco,</hi> to be restored
to them at their departure, provided they
went to <hi>Nants, Rochel,</hi> or to some place in
in the United Provinces and not to any belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> for security
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56653:98"/>
whereof they should give three hostages, and
all Officers and Souldiers should be shipt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with General <hi>Sigismond Schop,</hi> after the
delivery of the Forts of <hi>Riogrando, Paraiba,</hi> and
<hi>Tamarica.</hi> That the General should have twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pieces of brass ordinance; from four Pound-Ballet
to eighteen, withal their furnitures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all necessary Iron-guns, for the defence
of the Ships that should be afforded them for
their transportation, with convenient supplyes
of ammunition and provision, according to the
thirteenth Article before recited: That General
<hi>Sigismond,</hi> and all his Officers of War, should
have liberty to carry away or sell all his or their
goods or slaves. That sick or wounded persons
should have liberty to stay till they recovered,
but the Governour would not condescend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
those <hi>Hollanders</hi> which were prisoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this surrendry: A general pardon was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all rebells, chiefly to <hi>Amboyna, Mendaz,</hi>
and all other Indians and Negroes, but they
were not to have the honor to march out with
their Arms. In sum, the supream Councel at
<hi>Recif,</hi> did oblige themselves for the surrendring
of these places, upon the signing of these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and for the delivering up the Island of
<hi>Farnam, Viaca, Noroga, Riogrand, Paraiba,</hi> and
<hi>Tamarica,</hi> upon the same conditions for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
as had been granted to those of <hi>Recif.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Articles were signed and delivered on
both sides, at the Camp at <hi>Taborda,</hi> on the 18 of
<hi>Ianuary</hi> 1653. and Conditions on both sides
punctually observed. Thus did the Hollanders
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56653:98"/>
loose all their Acquists in <hi>Brazile,</hi> which so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
those high and mighty States, that at
the coming into <hi>Holland</hi> of myn Heer <hi>Sigismon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
Schop,</hi> who had there been General of their
<hi>Militia,</hi> they caused him to be imprisoned, and
tried for his life by a Councel of War, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
endeavors of his enemies, he was
acquitted.</p>
               <p>Nor were the <hi>Portugals</hi> at home less for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
against their neighbor enemy the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
for to omit many petty skirmishes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roades
made by them withal success desirable in
the summer 1654. <hi>D. Antonio D' Albuquerque</hi>
General of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> horse, taking an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon a party of <hi>Castilians,</hi> which lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Borders neer <hi>Aronches,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Count D' Amaranthe,</hi> set upon them,
slew their General <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> and took six
hundred horse; and farther animated with this
success, and the knowledge he had that a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
prosecution is the onely mother of a true
victory, pursued them with a Army of 3000
Foot and 1500 Horse, eight leagues into their
own Country, as far as the old and strong Castle
of <hi>D' Oluce,</hi> while encouraging his Souldiers,
(made valorous by their former good fortune)
he resolved to attacque, and with continued
batteries, and storms so wearied out the enemy,
that after four days siege they yeilded upon
composition, and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> looking upon it
as a place considerable, both for the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of incursions into the enemies country,
and keeping in awe the town of <hi>Xeres,</hi> which is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56653:99"/>
hard by, having repaired it and placed in it a
strong Garison, returned.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1655. D.
<hi>Franciso De Ferrara Rabella</hi> arrived in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with Commission from the king of <hi>Portugal</hi>
as Agent, to <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who then swayed
here under the title of Protector, to make a

                  </gap>e firm confirmation of the Peace with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to advise, I suppose, about carrying on
the War with <hi>Spain;</hi> which when <hi>Cromwel</hi> had
given some reasons to make the world believe
he would commence against that Catholick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and how much such a War was for the
interest of <hi>Portugal,</hi> none will doubt who have
read the foregoing story, which made King <hi>Iohn</hi>
court that English Usurper, with more submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and complacency, by both harbouring his
Fleets, and sending presents to his Generals,
then otherwise his Genius would have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to have done, any way in prejudice of
<hi>Englands</hi> lawful KING. In the mean time
the death of Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the Tenth,
made D. <hi>Francisco de Souza<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to <hi>Alexander</hi> the seventh his Successor,
for confirmation of the Church Officers in that
Kingdom, for he had never had any full grant
from <hi>Innocent;</hi> but now the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors
opposed themselves more then ever, and by
meanes of the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who wholly
imployed her in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nations endeavoured to frustrate even the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi>
hopes, nay so desperate was the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56653:99"/>
malice, that they laid several designs to
murther the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambassador, but all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ineffectual. In sum, after D. <hi>Francisco de
Souza,</hi> had spent some years in the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> to very little purpose, he was upon the
death of King <hi>Iohn</hi> the fourth, called home to
be Governor of the yong King <hi>Alfonso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proffered interchangeable Match with
<hi>Savoy,</hi> not taking effect, father <hi>Du
Rozaire,</hi> a Domincan and Archbishop of <hi>Goa,</hi>
was sent Agent to <hi>France,</hi> to treat about a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
between that King, and the Infanta
<hi>Donna Catharina,</hi> with Proposals of three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Gold for Her Portion, and that the
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> would for seven Years main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
eighteen Men of War at Sea, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and service of the <hi>French</hi> Crown.</p>
               <p>Long was this business in negotiation, and by
many thought would have taken effect, the
Agent being very highly carressed both by the
King and Queen mother of <hi>France,</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by reason of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s dislike of
it, or other reasons of State, it was prolonged by
continual demurs, till after the King of <hi>Portugals</hi>
death, and then wholly broken off.</p>
               <p>For King <hi>Iohn</hi> being now arrived to about
fifty years of Age, in the sixteenth year of his
Reign, and in the year of our Lord 1656. on
the 6. of <hi>November, S. N.</hi> paid his last debt to
nature, having a long time been troubled with
an obstruction in the kidneys, occasioned by the
stone and gravel, which was so sharp all the time
of his sickness, that he seldom urined, and when
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56653:100"/>
he did it, was in so little quantity that it did
scarce at all ease him, this violent pain put him
into a Burning-feaver, which in ten days over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
his vitals.</p>
               <p>Before his death, he appointed <hi>Donna Lucia</hi>

Marquess of <hi>Nisa,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Canvandake,</hi> and
some others whose abilities, love and fidelity, he
had experience of.</p>
               <p>He had by his Queen <hi>Donna Lucia</hi> Daughter
to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> four Children;
onely two of which survived him, to wit, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso</hi>
who succeeded him in the Kingdom, and is
at present King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and the <hi>Infanta Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharina,</hi>
who was born the year before her Father
came to the Crown, a Princess in whom all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
seem to flow, that can make her the worthy
Daughter of such renowned Parents: her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
body being amply repleate with her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Mothers spirit, whose magnanimity and
prudence, all the world have admired: his other
two children were the Prince <hi>Theodosio,</hi> who
was so unfortunate as to die some time before
his Father, and a Daughter who died young.</p>
               <p>He was a person of a very comely presence,
his countenance pleasant, but inclinning to
swarthiness, his body about a middle stature, yet
comely and well proportioned, nor were the
lineaments of his mind less becoming then those
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56653:100"/>
of his body, though if ye believe common fame,
he was none of the wisest Kings that ever <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
could boast of: the reason that he left so
much of the reins of the Government to his
wife, a woman of a masculine and politick spirit,
from whence perhaps that jesting <hi>Spaniard</hi>
might take occasion to say; <hi>That it was not the</hi>
Portugal <hi>force, but the</hi> Spanish <hi>policy, that kept
that kingdom from the Catholique King,</hi> alluding
to the Queens being a <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was buried in the great Church of St.
<hi>Vincenza del Foro,</hi> with all accustomed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
ceremonies, lamented by those Kings
who had been his Allies, especially be the King
of <hi>France,</hi> who honored his memory with a most
magnificent Funeral solemnity, himself (atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<hi>France,)</hi> gracing it with his presence at the

eight days after the death of his Father.</p>
               <p>The whole Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> was in a
kind of amaze at the so sudden death of King
<hi>Iohn,</hi> especially considering the youth of their

                  </gap>,
soon banished all those fancied fears.</p>
               <p>The Queen being sensible, that upon this
occasion of the Kings death, she should have
most occasion to use the Souldiery, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of her Council, ordered all the Infantry of
the Kingdom should have half a years pay, the
better to incourage them, who were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ready enough to fight against their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and inveterate enemy, the Castilians.</p>
               <p>And because she knew that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:56653:101"/>
would loose no opportunity to oppress the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> she thought it imprudence to
let any slip where any advantage might be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon him, and therefore all the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Forces being drawn out of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> to oppose
the English, in case they should attempt to land
at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> (for they then blocked up that Port
with a Potent Fleet, she commanded four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

who plundered, and layed waste all before them,
bringing away between forty and fifty thousand

               <p>This so exasperated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

raised a potent Army, and with ten thousand

                  </gap>ke of
<hi>Braganza,</hi> which made the <hi>Portugals</hi> renounce
any farther treating.</p>
               <p>But at length the <hi>Spaniards</hi> condescending to
treat, the Town was delivered upon Articles:
but so much did the Queen Regent and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Portugal</hi> resent it, that they immediately
gave order to arrest the person of Don <hi>Mandiol
de Saldagna</hi> the Governour, who (with several
of his chief Officers,) was by the Count <hi>de St.
Lorenze,</hi> General of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Forces in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56653:102"/>
those parts, sent prisoner to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> there to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
their ill defending of that town, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that at the surrendring of it, there marched
our two thousand two hundred well Armed
Foot, and one hundred Horse; nor were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to that necessity that was pretended, there
remaining in the stores of Ammunition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
sufficient to have defended the town a
great while longer.</p>
               <p>The loss of this place was a great blow to the
<hi>Portugueses,</hi> it being a strong Frontier town, and
giving the <hi>Spaniard</hi> absolute command a great
way into the Country: but this the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
resolved should be but a beginning of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
(if possible) of this Kingdom, for he still
made all preparations he could to assault it with
a greater force, and not onely endeavoured this
with might and main to oppress it himself, but
by his Ambassadors solicited the States General
of the United Provinces to send their Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<hi>Opdam</hi> with the Fleet he then had before
<hi>Dantzick,</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> to demand satisfaction
for the dammage the <hi>Portugals</hi> had done to
their <hi>West-India</hi> company in <hi>Brazile,</hi> and in case
the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> should deny to comply
with their desires, to force them to a composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The High and Mighty States easily listned to
this councel, and Vice-Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> with a
potent Fleet was sent to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> carrying with
him some Commissioners from the States to
make their demands, which the Queen Regent
and Council thought so unreasonable, that they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56653:102"/>
could not return any satisfactory answer to
them, whereupon the Commissioners departed.
But <hi>Opdam</hi> still stayed with his Fleet to wait
an opportunity of catching the <hi>Brazile</hi> Fleet in
their return home, many of which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the care and endeavours of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi>
to prevent it, he made prize of, and sent
into <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this means was the War which for many
years, had been maintained between the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
and <hi>Portugals</hi> on the other side the line,
transferred to this side, which the King of
<hi>France</hi> endeavoured by all meanes possible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it's eruption to prevent, and afterwards to
compose by his Ambassadors <hi>Monsieur de Thou</hi> in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Comings</hi> in Portugal,
but to no effect.</p>
               <p>Thus assaulted by two potent Nations, both
by Sea and by Land were the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> which
yet made them not at all falter in their courage
and resolution, the generous Queen Regent
causing all possible Leavyes to be made to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>Castilian,</hi> sending into <hi>Barbary</hi> to buy
horses, and by Leagues abroad endeavoring to
strengthen the interest of the Kingdom, an
Ambassador was sent to that purpose into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to renew and confirm the Amity before
concluded on, and many conferences there
were between the Archbishop of <hi>Goa,</hi> who had
before been Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> and the
<hi>Sieur de Comings,</hi> so that many were in hopes
that the Match between the King of <hi>France</hi> and

                     </gap>,</hi> took the field,
and in revenge for the loss of <hi>Olivenza,</hi> laid siege
to <hi>Mouron,</hi> which in three or four days they took
by storm, putting 1500 <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Sword,
and resolved to proceed to the regaining of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayox,</hi>
and <hi>Olivenza;</hi> and to that purpose mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
without opposition by <hi>Caya,</hi> (which they
left fortified) they came to the Fort of St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher,</hi>
the strongest hold of the City of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayox,</hi>
which they several days battered, and
thrice stormed, but were beaten off, yet at the
length they took it, and so securely entrenched
themselves about the whole City.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Ossima</hi> General of the <hi>Castilian</hi>
horse, having notice of this streight siege of the
City, endeavoured with sixteen hundred Horse
to cut off their convoys and provisions; but the
<hi>Count del Prado</hi> governour of <hi>Elvas,</hi> receiving
advice of his design, sallied out of the City with
three companies of Horse, and all the Foot he
had to prevent him, by which means <hi>Ossima</hi> was
encompassed on both sides, for at the same time
that he was on the other part charged by Don
<hi>Andrea D' Albuquerque</hi> General of the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
horse, and that with so much gallantry that they
presently discomfited their enemies, slew four
hundred upon the place, took three hundred
prisoners, and forced the Duke of <hi>Ossima</hi> to save
himself by swinning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:56653:103"/>
This happy success encouraged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
with more alacrity to the siege, which
they prosecuted with all vigor possible, and on
the three and twentieth of <hi>Iune,</hi> stormed and
took a Redoubt which was palisadosed, but at
length when they had spent much time, blood,
and treasure, they were enforced by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Army of <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> to raise their
Siege.</p>
               <p>For the King of <hi>Spain</hi> exsperated with the
loss of <hi>Mouron,</hi> and fearing likewise to loose
<hi>Badayox,</hi> had rallyed a great Army, which he
committed to the care of his favorite Don <hi>Lewis
de Haro,</hi> who not onely with it raised the siege
from before <hi>Badayox,</hi> but likewise so straightly
besieged <hi>Elvas,</hi> one of the <hi>Portugueses</hi> strongest
Frontier-towns, the taking of which might have
endangered the whole Kingdom, and reduced
it to such necessity, that it was even upon the
point of yielding.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Portugals</hi> who knew of how much
importance it was to them, had ever been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
for its relief, and therefore having at
length bravely recruited their Army, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
with full resolution to drive the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
out of their Trenches, nor did they effect
it less bravely then they had resolved it, for
they totally routed their General, Don <hi>Lewis de
Haro</hi> very hardly escaping; but in this battel the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> lost the worthy <hi>Albuquerque</hi> General
of the horse.</p>
               <p>And to counterpoise this victory, the strong
Fortress of <hi>Mounson</hi> upon the borders of <hi>Gallicia,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:56653:104"/>
was surrendred to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and a Party
of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> not having advice that it was
already possessed by the <hi>Castilians,</hi> going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, were surprized and forced shamefully
to retreat, with the loss of some hundreds, and
this Success encouraged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under the
command of the Marquis of <hi>Viana,</hi> to besiege
the onely City the <hi>Portugals</hi> were possest of on
the River <hi>Minho,</hi> but it was relieved by the
<hi>Portugals.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewise gained a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

of what it was like to feel by the Peace which
was treating of between those two mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which the Queen

a Mediation for them with the King of

Submission, which by the magnanimous Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses
was rejected with indignation.</p>
               <p>Nor were they at all daunted with the great
power of the Spaniard which he intended to
imploy against them, but manfully resolved to
endure all hazards, yet would they willingly
have concluded a Peace with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and
to that purpose Don <hi>Fernando Tellez de Faro,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Alvero,</hi> was sent Ambassador to the
States General, but he like a treacherous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
revolted from them to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>

who had served the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in the

this occasion commanded to retire to one of his

               <p>After him was sent Don <hi>Henry de Susa</hi> Count
of <hi>Miranda,</hi> to negotiate an Accommodation

little, for the pertinacious <hi>Hollanders</hi> were still

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56653:105"/>
their losses in <hi>Brazile</hi> (where they had
no right to be) to amount to no less then thirty
millions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the mean time were forced
to give the <hi>Portugals</hi> some respite in the summer
1659. but preparations were made to assault
them, with the whole power of that Monarchy
in the Spring 1660. Don <hi>Iohn D' Austria</hi> being
called out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to be <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of the
Spanish Forces, and having Orders given him
in <hi>April</hi> 1660. to march directly to <hi>Merida,</hi> on
the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal,</hi> though he went not
that Summer.</p>
               <p>But the Portugueses resolved not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand
with their Enemies, and therefore
made several in-roads into the Spanish Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
depopulating all before them, which
made the Spaniards to be revenged, resolve to
do the like to them; Order was therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to fall into the Kingdom on all sides, the
Marquess of <hi>Viana</hi> Governor of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that way with eight thousand Foot, and
eight hundred Horse, and the Governor of
<hi>Camara</hi> invading that part which was adjacent

               <p>In this condition was the Kingdom of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>

of <hi>England</hi> was restored to his Crowns and
Kingdoms, welcomed by his Subjects with all

and for three days and nights kept solemn
and magnificent Rejoycings; the <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Nation as well as by this their joy at the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

affection for the English Nation.</p>
               <p>But because their joy should be somewhat
for their own, as well as our sakes, there at
the same time arrived News at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that Don
<hi>Alfonso Turtudo</hi> General of the Horse, on the
Frontiers of <hi>Alentejo,</hi> meeting with a Brigade
of the Enemies Horse nigh to <hi>Badajox,</hi> had
fought and defeated them, killed and took four
hundred of them, amongst whom were four
Captains of Horse prisoners.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards still continued their Leavies
against <hi>Portugal,</hi> being resolved to employ an
Army of four thousand Horse and twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot constantly recruited, about the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Estramadura,</hi> and another of three
thousand Horse, and ten thousand Foot about
<hi>Gallicia,</hi> and a third of twelve thousand men,
to serve as a Reserve to the two former. In
this manner were they resolved to assault them
by Land, while the Prince of <hi>Montesarchio</hi> with
ten Men of VVar, was appointed to coast up
and down before their Ports, and do them what
mischief he could by Sea.</p>
               <p>Thus have we deduced a Compendious Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> from its first

which great Monarch, by the prudent Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Affairs by that Sage and Illustrious
Queen Regent, she hath hitherto been able
to resist, and will without doubt still be able
to defend her self against him, especially if
the Match with <hi>England</hi> take effect, as without

two <hi>Castiles</hi> and <hi>Estramadura,</hi> from which it is

it extendeth on the Sea-coast from
North to South, four hundred miles; the breadth
of it in the broadest place is one hundred miles,
in the narrowest, eighty; the whole circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is about eight hundred seventy nine miles;
in which compass it containeth fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and sixty Parishes.</p>
            <p>It was first called <hi>Lusitania,</hi> from the <hi>Lusitans</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:56653:107"/>
its chief Inhabitants, and had the name of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
either from the Port of <hi>Cale,</hi> now called
<hi>Caia,</hi> sometimes a rich Empory or Mart-town,
or more likely from the Haven of <hi>Porto,</hi> a town
standing on the mouth of the River <hi>Dueries,</hi>
where the <hi>Golls</hi> (or <hi>French)</hi> used to land their
merchandize, and so was called <hi>Portus Gallio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and by contraction <hi>Portugal.</hi> This Town
was given in Dower to <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi>
with <hi>Teresa</hi> base Daughter to <hi>Alphonso</hi> the sixth,
King of <hi>Castile,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Earl of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
whose Successors coming to be Kings,
called all those Countries they gained from the
<hi>Moors,</hi> by the same name.</p>
            <p>The Air of the Countrey is healthy, the
Countrey hilly and bare of Corn, with which it
is supplyed from <hi>France,</hi> and other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
parts; yet that which they have is as good,
if not better, than any <hi>Europe</hi> affords. The soyl
and people are in all parts not rich alike, for
where the soyl is richest, the people are poorest,
not benefited by the Trade of the too-far distant
<hi>Lisbon;</hi> and where the soyl is poorest, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are richest, helped by Traffick and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
the chief of which are making Salt
and Silk, which they export in great abundance;
and where there's want of Corn, that defect is
supplyed with abundance of Honey, Wine, Oyl,
Alume, Fruits, Fish, Salt, white Marble, and
some Mines of Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people are of a more plain, simple beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
than the rest of <hi>Spain,</hi> and (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Spanish Proverb) neither numerous,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56653:107"/>
nor wise, but they have found them both. They
have a kinde of natural Animosity, if not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
against the <hi>Castilians,</hi> for depriving them
of their native Government and Liberties, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have now recovered both. They
were always accounted good Sea-faring men,
and fortunate in discovery of forein Countreys.</p>
            <p>It aboundeth with Rivers of all sorts, having
neer two hundred great and small. The chief
are, 1. <hi>Minius,</hi> full of red Lead, and thence
called <hi>Minium</hi> by the Latines, navigable with
small Vessels neer a hundred miles. 2. <hi>Lethes,</hi>
now <hi>Lavada. 3. Muliadas,</hi> now <hi>Mundego.
4. Tagus. 5. Duerus.</hi> and 6. <hi>Anas.</hi> These
three last, common to all the rest of <hi>Spain; Anas</hi>
or <hi>Guadiana</hi> passing by <hi>Portugal</hi> onely for seven
leagues, <hi>Tagus</hi> for eighteen, and <hi>Duero</hi> for
eighty: None of these navigable for any long
space, by Ships of any great burthen; all the
Rivers of <hi>Spain</hi> being generally swift of course,
restrained within narrow Channels between
sharp Rocks, and therefore incommodious for
navigation: but that want is supplyed by three
excellent Havens, 1. That of <hi>Lisbon</hi> upon <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.
2. Porto</hi> upon <hi>Duero</hi> to the north of <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi>
3. That of <hi>Setaval</hi> south of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> scituate
on a <hi>Goll,</hi> twenty miles in length, and three in
breadth, a place of great importance.</p>
            <p>The principal Cities of this Countrey are,
1. <hi>Lisbon,</hi> seated upon <hi>Tagus,</hi> a City famous for
Commerce, called by the Latines <hi>Olisippo,</hi> or
<hi>Ulisippo,</hi> and as some have fabulously imagined,
built by <hi>Ulysses</hi> in his ten years travel. It is in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56653:108"/>
compass seven miles, and contains upwards of
thirty Parishes, in which are at least 20000 hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
neat and comely Fabricks: There are on the
Walls seventy six Turrets and Towers &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>two
Gates to the Sea-side. Towards the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
it is scituate upon five small Hills, betwixt
which is a valley which runs down to the River.
On the highest Hill stands an ancient Castle, not
strong, but by reason of its vicinity to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
serving now onely for a Prison for great
men. The Entrance of the River is defended
by the Castle of <hi>Cascais,</hi> and neerer the City by
the Fort of St. <hi>Iulians,</hi> and the <hi>Rock of Belem,</hi>
