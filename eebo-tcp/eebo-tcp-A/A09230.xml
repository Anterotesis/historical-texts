            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

might quickly doe: This was soone accomplished, and <hi>George</hi> was fnrnished with his blacke Sattin suit, and a paire of bootes, which were as familiar to his legges, as the pillory to a Bakers or Colliers necke, and hee suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently possest his friends with the whole scope of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as, gentle Reader, the sequell will shew. Instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they tooke a paire of Oares, whose armes were to make a false gallop no further then Brainford, where their faire was paid them so liberally, that each of them the next tide to London, purchased two new wastcoates, yet should these good benefactors come to their vsuall places of trade, and if they spie a better fare then their owne, that happily the Gentleman hath more minde to goe withall, they will not onely fall out with him that is of their owne sweet transporters, as they are, but abuse the fare they carrie with foule speeches, as a Pox or the Deuill go with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as their Godfather <hi>Caron</hi> the Ferry man of Hell hath taught them. I speake not this of all, but of some that are brought vp in the East, some in the West, some in the North, but most part in the South: but for the rest, they are honest compleat men, leaning them to come to my honest <hi>George</hi>; who is now merry at the three Pigeons in Braineford with Sache and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, not any wine wanting, the Musicians playing, my host drinking, my hostis dauncing with the worshipfull Iustice, for so then he was tearmed, and his mansion house in Kent, who came thither of purpose to be merry with his men: because he could not so conueniently neere home, by reason of a shrewish wife he had: my gentle ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis gaue him all the entertainment her house could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for M. <hi>Peele</hi> had paid royally; for all his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>George,</hi> how fals the Tyde out for London, not till the euening, quoth mine Hoste, haue you any businesse Sir? Yes marry, quoth <hi>George,</hi> I intend not to goe home this two dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore my Hoste saddle my man a horse for London, if you be so well furnished, for I must send him for one bag more, quoth <hi>George,</hi> ten pounds hath seene no Sunne this six moneths. I am ill furnished if I cannot furnish you with that, quoth my Hoste, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sadled him a good Nag, and away rides one of <hi>Georges</hi> men to London, attending the good houre of his Master <hi>Peele</hi> in London, in the meane time, <hi>George</hi> bespeakes great cheare to Supper, saying, He expected some of his friends from London: Now you must ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there was not a peny owing in the house, for he had paid as liberall as <hi>Caesar,</hi> as far as <hi>Caesars</hi> wealth went. For indéed most of the money was one <hi>Caesars</hi> an honest man yet liuing in London; but to the Catastrophe. All the day before, had one of the other men of <hi>George Peele</hi> beene a great soliciter to my Hostis, she would beg leaue of his Master he might goe sée a maid, a sweet heart of his so farre as Kingstone, and before his Master went to bed, he would returne againe: saying, he was sure shee might command it at his Masters hands. My kinde Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis willing to pleasure the yong fellow, knowing in her time what belonged to such matters, went to Master <hi>Peel,</hi> and moued him in it: which he angerly refused: but she was so earnest in it, that shee swore hee should not deny her, protesting he went but to see an vncle of his some fiue miles off Marry I thanke you, quoth <hi>George,</hi> my good Hostis, would you so discredit me, or hath the knaue no more wit, then at this time to goe, knowing I haue no horse here, and would he base cullian go afoot? Nay, good Sir, quoth mine Hostis, be not angry, it is not his intent to goe afoot: for hee shall haue my Mare, and I will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10875:4"/>
assure you Sir, vpon my word, he shall be here againe, to haue you to bed; wel, quoth <hi>George,</hi> Hostis, Ile take you at your word, let him goe, his negligence shall light vpon you. So be it, quoth mine Hostis: so down goeth she<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sends away ciuill <hi>Thomas,</hi> for so she cald him, to his swéet heart backt vpon her Mare: which <hi>Thomas</hi> instead of riding to Kingstone, tooke London in his way, where meeting with my other horseman, attended the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall of <hi>George Peele,</hi> which was not long after: they are at London, <hi>George</hi> in his Chamber at Brainford, accompanied with none but one <hi>Anthony Nit</hi> a Barber, who Din'd and Supt with him continually, of whom hee had borrowed a Lute to passe away the melancholy afternoone, of which he could play as well as <hi>Bankes</hi> his horse. The Barber very modestly takes his leaue; <hi>George</hi> obsequiously bids him to supper, who (God willing) would not faile. <hi>George</hi> being left alone with his two supposed men, gaue them the meane how to escape, and walking in the Court, <hi>George</hi> found fault with the weather, saying, it was rawish and cold: which word mine Hostis hearing, my kinde Hostis fetched her Husbands holiday Gowne; which <hi>George</hi> thankfully put about him, and withall called for a cup of Sacke, after which he would walke into the Meddowes, and practise vpon his Lute. 'Tis good for your worship to do so, quoth mine Hostis: which walke <hi>George</hi> tooke directly to Sion, where hauing the aduantage of a paire of Oares at hand, made this Iourney for London, his two Associates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind had the plot in their heads by <hi>Georges</hi> instruction for their escape: for they anew he was gone, my Hostis she was in the Market buying of prouision for Supper: mine Hoste he was at Tables, and my two masterlesse men desired the maids to excuse them if their Master came for, quoth they, we will goe drinke two pots with my Smug Smithes wife at old Brainford.

So away went my men to the Smiths at old Brainford, from thence to London, where they all met, and sold the Horse and the Mare, the Gowne and the Lute, which money was as badly spent, as it was lewdly got. How my Hoste and my Hostis lookt when they saw the euent of this; goe but to the thrée Pigeons at Brainford, you shall know.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GEorge</hi> on a time being happily furnished both of horse and money, though the horse he hired, and the money he borrowed: but no matter how he was possest of them: and towards Oxford he rides to make merry with his friends and fellow students: and in his way he tooke vp Wickham, where he soiourned that night: Being at supper accompanied with his Hostis: among other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-talke,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10875:6"/>
they fell into discourse of Chirurgerie, of which my Hostis was a simple professor. <hi>Ceorge Peele</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the humour of my she Chirurgion, vpheld her in all, the strange cures she talked of, and prassed her womanly endeuour; telling her, he loued her so much the better, because it was a thing that he professed, both Physicke &amp; Chyrurgerie: and <hi>George</hi> had a Dictionary of Physicall words, that it might set a better glosse vpon that which he seemingly profest: and told his good Hostis, at his returne he would teach her something that should doe her no hurt: for (quoth he) at this instant I am going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a great Cure as farre as <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of great liuing, and one that hath beene in a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption this halfe yeere, and I hope to doe him good. O God, (quoth the Hostis) there is a Gentleman not a quarter of a Mile off, that hath beene a long time sicke of the same disease: Beleeue me, Sir, quoth the Hostis, would it please your Worship e're your departure in the morning, but to visit the Gentleman, and but spend your opinion of him, and I make no question but the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman will bee very thankfull to you. I faith (quoth <hi>George,</hi> happely at my returne I may; but at this time my haste is such that I cannot: and so good night, mine Hostis. So away went <hi>George</hi> to bed; and my giddy Hostis, right of the nature of most women, thought that night as long as tenne, till shee was deliuered of that burthen of newes which she had receiued from my new Doctor: (for so hee termed himselfe.) Morning being come, at breake of the day mine Hostis trudges to this Gentlemans house, acquainteth his wife what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man she had at her house: protesting he was the best seene in Physicke, and had done the most strangest cures that euer she heard of: saying, that if shee would but send for him, no question he would doe him good. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10875:7"/>
glad to heare of any thing that might procure the health of her Husband, presently sent one of her men, to desire the Doctor to come and visit her Husband: Which message when <hi>George</hi> heard, hee wondred: for hee had no more skill in Physicke then in Musicke, and they were as distant both from him, as heauen from hell. But, to conclude, <hi>George</hi> set a bold face on it, and away went he to the sicke Gentleman; where when hee came, after some complement to the Gentlewoman, hee was brought to the Chamber where the ancient Gentleman say wonderfull sicke: for all Physicke had giuen him ouer: <hi>George</hi> beginnes to feele his Pulses and his temples, saying, hee was very farre spent: yet, quoth hee, vnder GOD I will doe him some good, if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bee not quite extinct. Whereupon hee demanded whether they had euer a Garden? That I haue, quoth the Gentlewoman. I pray you direct me thither, quoth <hi>George.</hi> Where when hee came, hee cut a handfull of euery Flowre, Herbe and Blossome, or whatsoeuer else in the Garden; and brought them in in the lapis of his Cloake, boyled them in Ale; strained them, boyled them againe; and when he had all the iuyce out of them, of which he made some pottle of drinke, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the sicke Gentleman to drinke off a maudlin Cup full, and willed his wife to giue him of that same at morning, noone, and night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> protesting, if any thing in this world did him good, it must bee that: giuing great charge to the Gentlewoman to keepe him wonderfull warme: and at my returne, quoth <hi>George,</hi> some tenne dayes hence, I will returne and see how he fares: For, quoth he, by that time something will be done; and so I will take my leaue. Not so, quoth the Gentlewoman, your Worshippe must needes stay and take a simple dinner with mee to day. Indeede, quoth <hi>George,</hi> I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10875:7"/>
cannot now stay; my haste is such, I must presently to Horse. You may suppose <hi>George</hi> was in haste vntill he was out of the Gentlemans house: for hee knew not whether hee had poysoned the Gentleman or not, which made him so eager to bee gone out of the Gentlemans house. The Gentlewomon séeing she could by no meanes stay him, gaue him two brace of Angels, which neuer shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long in his purse, and desired him at his returne to know her house: which <hi>George</hi> promised, and with seeming nicenesse tooke the gold, and towards Oxford went he, fortie, shillings heauier then he was, where hee brauely dominéered while his Physicall money lasted. But to see the strangenesse of this: Whether it was the vertue of some herbe which hee gathered, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit the Gentleman had of <hi>George Peele,</hi> but it so pleased GOD the Gentleman recouered, and in eight dayes walked abroad; and that fortunate potion which <hi>George</hi> made at randome, did him more good then many pounds that he had spent in halfe a yeere before in Physicke. <hi>George</hi> his money being spent, he made his returne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London; and when he came within a mile of the Gentlemans house, hee enquired of a Countrey fellow how such a Gentleman did. The fellow told him. God be praised, his good Landlord was well recouered by a vertuous Gentleman that came this way by chance. Art thou sure of it, quoth <hi>George?</hi> Yes, beleeue me, quoth the fellow, I saw him in the Fields but this morning. This was no simple newes to <hi>George.</hi> He presently set spurres to his Horse, and whereas hee thought to shunne the Towne, hee went directly to his Inne: at whose arriuall, the Hostis clapt her hands, the Oastler laught, the Tapster leapt, the Chamberlaine ran to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans house, and told him the Doctor was come. How ioyfull the Gentleman was, let them imagine that haue

any after-healths. <hi>George Peele</hi> was sent for, and after a Million of thankes from the Gentleman and his friends, <hi>George Peele</hi> had 20. pounds deliuered him: which money, how long it was a spending, let the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes in London witnesse.</p>

                  <hi>GEorge</hi> was inuited one night by certaine of his friends to supper, at the White Horse in Friday stréet; and in the euening as he was going, hee met with an old friend of his, who was so ill at the stomacke, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>George</hi> tell him of the good cheere he went to, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being vnprouided both of meate and money, that he swore he had rather haue gone a mile about, then haue met him at that instant.

Any way, quoth hee to <hi>George,</hi> doe thou but deuise the meanes, and Ile execute it. <hi>George</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tolde him what hee should doe; so they parted. <hi>George</hi> well entertained, with extraordinary welcome, and seated at the vpper end of the Table, Supper being brought vp, H.

                  </gap>me longer then hee intended, by reason of a Booke that <hi>George</hi> had to translate out of Greeke into English: and when he wanted money, <hi>George</hi> had it of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but the more he supplyed him of Coine, the further off he was from his Booke, and could get no end of it, neither by faire meanes, entreatie, or double payment: for <hi>George</hi> was of the Poeticall disposition, neuer to write so long as his money lasted; some quarter of the Booke being done, and lying in his hands at randome. The Gentleman had plotted a meanes to take such an order with <hi>George</hi> next time he came, that he would haue his Booke finished. It was not long before he had his company; his arriuall was for more money: the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bids him welcome; causeth him to stay dinner, where falling into discourse about his Booke, found that it was as néere ended as he left it two moneths ago. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10875:9"/>
meaning to be gui'd no longer, caused two of his men to binde <hi>George</hi> hand and foot in a Chayre: a folly it was for him to aske what they meant by it: the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman sent for a Barber, and <hi>George</hi> had a beard of an indifferent size, and well growne: he made the Barber shaue him beard and head, left him as bare of haire, as he was of money: the Barber he was well contented for his paines, who left <hi>George</hi> like an old woman in mans apparell; and his voyce became it well, for it was more woman then man. <hi>George,</hi> quoth the Gentleman, I haue alwayes vsed you like a friend, my purse hath beene open to you: that you haue of mine to translate, you know it is a thing I highly estéeme; therefore I haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you in this fashion, that I might haue an end of my Booke, which shall be as much for your profit as my pleasure.

                  <hi>GEorge</hi> was at Bristow, and there staying somewhat longer then his coyne would last him, his Palfrey that should bee his Carrier to London, his head was growne so big, that he could not get him out of the stable: it so fortuned at that instant, certaine Players came to the Towne, and lay at that Inne where <hi>George Peele</hi> was: to whom <hi>George</hi> was well knowne, being in that time an excellent Poet, and had acquaintance of most of the best Players in England: from the triuiall sort hee was but so so; of which these were, only knew <hi>George</hi> by name, no otherwise. There was not past three of the companie come with the Carriage, the rest were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, by reason of a long Iourney they had; so that night they could not enact; which <hi>George</hi> hearing, had presently a Stratageme in his head to get his Horse free out of the stable, and Money in his purse to beare his charges vp to London: And thus it was: Hee goes directly to the Maior, tels him he was a Scholler and a Gentleman, and that he had a certaine Historie of the Knight of the Rodes; and withall, how Bristow was first founded, and by whom, and a briefe of all those that before him had succeeded in Office in that worshipfull Citie: desiring the Maior, that he, with his presence, and the rest of his Brethren, would grace his labors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Maior agreed to it, gaue him leaue, and withall appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him a place: but for himselfe, hee could not be there, being in the euening: but bade him make the best benefit he could of the Citie; and very liberally gaue him an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, which <hi>George</hi> thankfully receiues, and about his businesse he goes, got his Stage made, his History cryed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10875:10"/>
and hyred the Players Apparell, to flourish out his Shew, promising to pay them liberally; and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them they would fauour him so much, as to gather him his money at the doore: (for hee thought it his best course to imploy them, lest they should spie out his kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie; for they haue perillous heads.) They willingly yéeld to doe him any kindnes that lyes in them; in briefe, carry their apparell to the Hall, place themselues at the doore, where <hi>George</hi> in the meane time, with the tenne shillings he had of the Maior, deliuered his Horse out of Purgatorie, and carries him to the Townes end, and there placeth him, to be ready at his comming. By this time the Audience were come, and some forty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings gathered, which money <hi>George</hi> put in his purse, and putting on one of the Players Silke Robes, after the Trumpet had sounded thrice, out he comes, makes low obeysance, goes forward with his Prologue, which was thus:
<q>

               <p>Which being said, after some fire-workes that hee had made of purpose, threw out among them, and downe stayres goes he, gets to his Horse, and so with fortie shillings to London; leaues the Players to answer it; who when the Iest was knowne, their innocence excused them, beeing as well gulled as the Maior and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

               <p>COmming to London, hee fell in company with a Cockatrice; which pleased his eye so well, that <hi>George</hi> fell aboording of her, and proffered her the wine: which my Croshabell willingly accepted: to the Tauerne they goe, where after a little idle talke, <hi>George</hi> fell to the question about the thing you wot of. My she-Hobby was very dainty, which made <hi>George</hi> arre more eager; and my letcherous animall proffered largely to obtaine his purpose. To conclude, nothing she would grant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, except ready coyne, which was forty shillings, not a farthing lesse: if so he would, next night she would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him where he should meete her. <hi>George</hi> saw how the game went, that she was more for lucre than for loue, thus cunningly answered her: Gentlewoman, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you speake, I doe not thinke your heart agrees with your tongue; the money you demand is but to try mee: and indeed but a trifle to me: but because it shall not bee said I bought that Iemme of you I prize so highly, Ile giue you a token to morrow, that shall bee more worth then your demand, if so you please to accept it. Sir, quoth she, it contenteth me well: and so, if please you, at this time wéele part, and to morrow in the euening meete you where you shall appoint. The place was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and they kist and parted, shee home, <hi>George</hi> into Saint Thomas Apostles, to a friend of his, of whom he knew he could take vp a Petticoat of trust: (the first letter of his name begins with G.) A Petticoat hee had of him, at the price of fiue shillings; which money is owing till this day. The next night beeing come, they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10875:11"/>
met at the place appointed, which was a Tauerne; there they were to suppe: that ended, <hi>George</hi> was to goe home with her, to end his Yeomans plee in her common case. But Master <hi>Peele</hi> had another drift in his mazzard: for he did so ply her with wine, that in a small time shee spunne such a thread, that shee reeled homewards, and <hi>George</hi> he was faine to be her supporter: when to her house she came, with nothing so much painting in the inside, as her face had on the outside; with much adoe her Maide had her to bed, who was no sooner laid, but shee fell fast asleepe: which when <hi>George</hi> perceiued, hee sent the Maide for Milke, and a quart of Sacke to make a Posset; where before her returne, <hi>George</hi> made so bold as to take vp his owne new Petticoate, a faire Gowne of hers, two gold Kings that lay in the window, and away he went: the Gowne and the gold Kings hee made a chaffer of; the Petticoate hee gaue to his honest Wife, one of the best deedes he euer did to her.

and making such pittifull moane with shrikes and teares, and beating of her brest, that made the people in a maze: some stood wondring at the Childe; others plucked her, to know the occasion; but none could stay her by any meanes, but on shee kept her iourney, crying, O, her Father, her good Father, her deare Father, ouer the Bridge, thorow Cheap-side, and so to the Old Bailey, where the Gentleman soiourned, there sitting her selfe downe, a hundred people gaping vpon her, there she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to cry out, Woe to that place, that her Father euer saw it: she was a cast-away, her Mother was vndone: till with the noise, one of the Gentlemans men comming downe, looked on her, and knew her to be <hi>George Peeles</hi> Daughter: hee presently runnes vp, and tels his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who commanded his man to bring her vp. The Gentleman was in a cold sweat, fearing that <hi>George</hi> had for the wrong that he did him the day before, some way vndone himselfe. When the Girle came vp, hee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cause why she so lamented, and called vpon her Father? <hi>George</hi> his flesh and blood, after a million of sighs, cryed out vpon him, he had made her Father, her good Father, drowne himselfe. Which words once vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, shee fell into a counterfeit swoone, whom the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman soone recouered. This newes went to his heart, and he being a man of a very milde condition, cheered vp the Girle, made his men to go buy her new cloathes from top to toe, said he would be a Father to her, gaue her fiue pounds, bid her go home and carry it to her mother, and in the eueneng he would visit her. At this, by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle she began to be quiet; desiring him to come and sée her Mother. He tels her, he will not faile, bids her goe home quietly. So downe stayres goes she pearily, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring people that staid at doore, to heare the manner of her griefe, had of her nought but knauish answers, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10875:12"/>
home went she directly. The Gentleman was so crossed in mind, and disturbed in thought at this vnhappy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that his soule could not be in quiet, till he had béene with this wofull widdow, as hee thought, and presently went to Blacke Fryers, tooke a payre of Oares, and went directly to <hi>George Peeles</hi> house, where hee found his Wife plucking of Larkes, my crying Crocadile tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the spit, and <hi>George</hi> pinn'd vp in a blanket, at his translation. The Gentleman, more glad at the vnlookt for life of <hi>George,</hi> then the losse of his money, tooke part of the good cheere <hi>George</hi> had to dinner, wondred at the cunning of the Wench, and within some few daies after had an end of his Booke.</p>

               <head>How <hi>George</hi> read a Play-booke to a Gentleman.</head>
               <p>THere was a Gentleman, whom GOD had indued with good liuing to maintaine his small wit: hee was not a Foole absolute, although in this world he had good fortune: and hee was in a manner an Ingle to <hi>George,</hi> one that tooke great delight to haue the first hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of any worke that <hi>George</hi> had done, himselfe being a writer, and had a Poeticall inuention of his owne, which when he had with great labour finished, their fatall end was for priuie purposes.

He willingly condiscended, and <hi>George</hi> beginnes to reade, and betweene euery Sceane hee would make pauses, and demand his opinion, how hee liked the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of it. Quoth he, wondrous well, the conueyance. O, but (quoth <hi>George</hi>) the end is farre better: (for hee meant another conueyance e're they two departed.) <hi>George</hi> was very tedious in reading, and the night grew old: I protest, quoth the Gentleman, I haue staide ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, I feare me I shall hardly get into mine Inne.

               <head>A Iest of <hi>George,</hi> riding to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere was some halfe doozen of Citizens, that had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes beene solliciters to <hi>George,</hi> he being a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Art at the Uniuersitie of Oxford, that hee would ride with them to the Commencement, it being at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer. <hi>George,</hi> willing to pleasure the Gentlemen his friends, rode along with them. When they had rode the better part of the way, they baited at a Uillage called Stoken, fiue miles from Wickham good cheere was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken for dinner; and frolicke was the company, all but <hi>George,</hi> who could not be in that pleasant vaine that did ordinarily possesse him, by reason he was without mony: but he had not fetcht fortie turnes about the Chamber, before his noddle had entertained a conceit how to money himselfe with credit, and yet gleane it from some one of the company. There was among them one excellent Asse, a fellow that did nothing but friske vp and downe the Chamber, that his money might bee heard chide in his pocket: this fellow had <hi>George</hi> obserued, and secretly conuay'd his gilt Rapier &amp; Dagger into another Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and there closely hid it: that done, he called vp the Tapster, and vpon his cloake borrowes 5 shillings for an houre or so, till his man came, (as he could fashion it well enough:) so much money he had, and then who more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then <hi>George?</hi> Meate was brought vp, they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to dinner, all full of mirth, especially my little foole, who dranke not of the conclusion of their feast: dinner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, much prattle past, euery man begins to buckle to his furniture: among whom this Hichcock missed his Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: at which all the company were in a maze; he besides his wits; for he had borrow'd it of a specaill friend of his,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10875:14"/>
and swore he had rather spend twenty Nobles. This is strange, quoth <hi>George,</hi> it should be gone in this fashion, none being heere but our selues and the fellowes of the house: who were examined, but no Rapier could be heard of: all the company much grieued; but <hi>George</hi> in a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull chafe, swore it should cost him fortie shillings, but hee would know what was become of it, if Art could doe it: and with that he caused the Oastler to saddle his Nag, for <hi>George</hi> would ride to a Scholler, a friend of his, that had skill in such matters. O, good M. <hi>Peele,</hi> quoth the fellow, want no money, heere is forty shillings, see what you can doe, and, if you please, Ile ride along with you. Not so, quoth <hi>George,</hi> taking his fortie shillings, Ile ride alone, and be you as merry as you can till my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. So <hi>George</hi> left them, and rode directly to Oxford, there he acquaints a friend of his with all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, who presently tooke Horse, and rode along with him to laugh at the Iest. When they came backe, <hi>George</hi> tels them he had brought one of the rarest men in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: whom they with much complement bid welcome. He, after a distracted countenance, and strange words, takes this Bulfinch by the wrist, and carried him into the priuy, and there willed him to put in his head, but while he had written his name and told forty: which hee willingly did: that done, the Scholler asked him what he saw? By my faith Sir, I smelt a villanous sent, but I saw nothing. Then I haue, quoth hee; and with that directed him where his Rapeir was: saying, It is iust North-East, inclozed in wood, neere the earth: for which they all made diligent search, till <hi>George,</hi> who hid it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a settle, found it, to the comfort of the fellow, the ioy of the company, and the eternall credit of his friend, who was entertained with Wine and Sugar; and <hi>George</hi> redeemed his Cloake, rode merrily to Oxford, hauing

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>let shall testifie: in the meane time, good Hostis, quoth he, send for such a friend of mine. Shee did: so his friend came: to whom <hi>George</hi> imparted his mind: the effect whereof was this, to pawne his Cloake, Hose and Doublet, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to his Hostis: for, quoth <hi>George,</hi> this seuen nights doe I intend to keepe my bed. (Truly hee spake: for his intent was, the bed should not keepe him any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.) Away goes he to pawne his apparell; <hi>George</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakes good cheere to supper, which was no shamble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butcher stuffe, but according to the place: for, his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being remote from the house, at the end of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, his apparell being gone, it appeared to him as the Counter, therefore to comfort himselfe, he dealt in Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. His friend brought the money, supped with him: his Hostis hee very liberally payed, but cauelled with her at her vnkindnesse: vowing that while he lay there, none should attend him but his friend. The Hostis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, A Gods name, she was well contented with it: so was <hi>George</hi> too: for none knew better then himselfe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10875:15"/>
what he intended, but in briefe, thus he vsed his kinde Hostis. After his Apparell and Money was gone, hee made bolde with the Featherbed hee lay on, which his friend slily conuey'd away, hauing as villanons a Wolfe in his belly as <hi>George,</hi> though not altogether so wise; for that featherbed they deuoured in two daies, feathers and all: which was no sooner digested, but away went the Couerlet, Sheetes, and the Blancket; and at the last dinner, when <hi>Georges</hi> good friend perceiuing nothing left but the bed cords, as the Deuill would haue it, straight came in his mind the fashion of a halter; the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish kind knaue would needs fetch a quart of sacke for his Friend <hi>George</hi>; which Sacke to this day neuer saw Uintuers Cellar: and so he left <hi>George</hi> in a cold Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a thin shirt, a rauished bed, no comfort left him, but the bare bones of deceased Capons. In this distresse, <hi>George</hi> be thought him what he might doe; nothing was left him; and as his eye wandred vp and downe the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chamber, by chance he spied out an old Armour; at which sight <hi>George</hi> was the ioyfullest man in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for the Armour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that <hi>Vlysses</hi> and <hi>Aiax</hi> stroue for, was not more precious to them, then this to him: for hee presently claps it vpon his backe, the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert in his hand, the Moryon on his head, and so gets out the backe way, marches from Shorditch to Clarkenwell, to the no smal wonder of those spectators that beheld him. Being arriued to the wished hauen he would be, an old acquaintance of his furnished him with an old Sute and an old Cloake for his old Armour.

               <p>
                  <hi>GEorge</hi> was making merry with three or foure of his friends in Pye-corner; where the Tapster of the house was much giuen to Poetrie: for he had ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed The Knight of the Sunne, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pamphlets which the Stripling had collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and knowing <hi>George</hi> to be a Poet, he tooke great delight in his company, and out of his bounty would bestow a brace of Cannes of him. <hi>George</hi> obseruing the humour of the Tapster, meant presently to worke vpon him. What will you say, quoth <hi>George</hi> to his friends, if out of this spirit of the Cellar, I fetch a good Angell, that shall hid vs all to supper. We would gladly see that, quoth his friends. Content your selfe, quoth <hi>George.</hi> The Tapster ascends with his two Cannes, deliuers one to Master <hi>Peele,</hi> and the other to his friends: giues them kind welcome: but <hi>George,</hi> in stead of giuing him thankes, bids him not to trouble him: and beginnes in these termes: I protest, Gentlemen, I wonder you will vrge me so much; I sweare I haue it not about me. What is the matter, quoth the Tapster? Hath any one angered you? No faith, quoth <hi>George,</hi> Ile tell thee, it is this: There is a friend of ours in Newgate, for nothing but onely the command of the Iustices, and he being now to be released, sends to me to bring him an Angell: now the man I loue dearely well; and if hee want tenne Angels, he shall haue them: for I know him sure: but heere's the misery; either I must goe home, or I must bee forced to pawne this: and pluckes an old Harry groat out of his pocket. The Tapster lookes vpon it: Why, and it please you, Sir, quoth he, this is but a groat. No, Sir, quoth <hi>George,</hi> I know it is but a groat: but this groat
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10875:16"/>
will I not lose for forty pound: for this groat had I of my mother, as a testimony of a Lease of a House I am to possesse after her decease: and it I should lose this groat, I were in a faire case: and either I must pawne this groat, or there the fellow must lye still. Quoth the Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, If it please you, I will tend you an Angell on it, and I will assure you it shall bee safe. Wilt thou, quoth <hi>George?</hi> as thou art an honest man, locke it vp in thy Chest, and let me haue it whensoeuer I call for it. As I am an honest man, you shall, quoth the Tapster <hi>George</hi> deliuered him his groat: the Tapster gaue him ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: to the Tauerne goe they with the money, and there merrily spend it. It fell out in a small time after, the Tapster, hauing many of these lurches, fell to decay, and indeede was turned out of seruice, hauing no more coine in the world then this groat; and in this misery, hee met <hi>George,</hi> as poore as himselfe. O Sir, quoth the Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, you are happily met; I haue your groat safe, though since I saw you last, I haue bid great extremitie: and I protest, saue that groat, I haue not any one penny in the world; therefore I pray you Sir, helpe me to my money, and take your pawne. Not for the world, quoth <hi>George</hi>: thou saist thou hast but that groat in the world: my bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine was, that thou shouldst keepe that groat vntill I did demand it of thee: I aske thee none: I will doe thee farre more good: because thou art an honest fellow, kéepe thou that groat still, till I call for it : and so doing, the proudest Iacke in England cannot iustifie that thou art not worth a groat, otherwise they might: and so, honest Michael, farewell. So <hi>George</hi> leaues the poore Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster picking of his fingers, his head full of proclamations what he might doe: at last sighing, hee ends with this Prouerbe:

But to come to <hi>George,</hi> who arriued at the Ordnary among other Gallants, throwes his Cloake vpon the Table, salutes the Gentlemen, and presently calls for a cup of Canarie. <hi>George</hi> had a paire of Hose on, that for some offence durst not bee seene in that hue they were first dyed in, but from his first colour, being a youthfull gréene, his long age turned him into a mournfull blacke, and for his antiquitie was in print: which this busie-body perceiuing, thought now to giue it him to the quicke: and drawing neere Master <hi>Peele,</hi> looking vpon his Bréeches: By my troth, Sir, quoth she, these are exceedingly well printed. At which word <hi>George</hi> being a little moued in his mind, that his old hose were called in question, answered, And by my faith, Mistris, quoth <hi>George,</hi> your face is most danmably ill painted.

Peace, quoth <hi>George,</hi> and iogs her on the elbow, I will say it was I.
