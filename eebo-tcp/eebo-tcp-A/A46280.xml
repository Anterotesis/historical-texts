            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A disswasion to a very virtuous Lady, who resolved to be a Nun.</head>
            <l>REcall this Resolution, or you'l prove</l>
            <l>Sinful to God, to Nature, and to Love:</l>
            <l>He that did form all creatures for increasing,</l>
            <l>Made fruitful Amity the first great blessing.</l>
            <l>Why were you made a woman? Why were we</l>
            <l>(By different Sex) put in capacity</l>
            <l>Of getting Children? you cross Gods decree,</l>
            <l>You will live single, God bids multiply:</l>
            <l>You wrong the Law of Nature, every thing</l>
            <l>Contributes to the store-house of the Spring:</l>
            <l>Beasts, Fish, Fowle, Grain, one ear of corn will yeeld</l>
            <l>(With husbandry) enough to fill a field:</l>
            <l>Were every thing fruitless (as you would be)</l>
            <l>You'd eat the walls down of your <hi>Nunnery.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But your transgression unto Love is such,</l>
            <l>As no man's pen can aggravate too much;</l>
            <l>Were those blue veins, red lips, white hands black eys</l>
            <l>Made only for a vestal sacrifice?</l>
            <l>But you reply, tis to prevent those crimes,</l>
            <l>And hot allurements which pollute the times:</l>
            <l>Madam, are you so weak, or sin so stout,</l>
            <l>That nothing but stone walls can keep it out?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>"Vlisses</hi> when he fear'd to be imbrae'd</l>
            <l>"By <hi>Syreus,</hi> bound himself to the ship mast;</l>
            <l>Because he found his soul so much inclin'd</l>
            <l>Unto temptation, did his body bind;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:63225:14"/>
And is it so vvith you? must you needs run</l>
            <l>This tempting race, unless y'have fetters on?</l>
            <l>Are Maids so frail, can Virgins find no trick</l>
            <l>For chastity, but to be buried quick?</l>
            <l>And yet vvhen all this streight prevention's vvrought,</l>
            <l>Not all your vvalls, nor bars, can keep out thought:</l>
            <l>In my conceipt those hearts have firmest stations,</l>
            <l>That can be chast in spite of all temptations:</l>
            <l>Chast vvedlock vvas at first design'd, that vve</l>
            <l>Might not abuse, but keep our chastity.</l>
            <l>You may do so, and yet not live alone,</l>
            <l>That vvoman's chast enough that knovvs but one;</l>
            <l>Stop your resolve then e're it further runs,</l>

            <l>MY Muse, which fornerly was wont to prize</l>
            <l>Ladies fair hands, white necks, red lips, black eyes;</l>
            <l>Flyes with <hi>reformed</hi> wings and (as its meet)</l>
            <l>Layes by the <hi>head</hi> to magnifie the <hi>Feet:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The subject of this half hours thought shall be</l>
            <l>On <hi>dancing's</hi> regular Activity:</l>
            <l>And it is fit this Quality shouid be</l>
            <l>Exalted with the feet of <hi>Poetry:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For Schollars when their flameing souls advance</l>
            <l>To write a <hi>Poem,</hi> all their spirits <hi>dance:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>First I will tell you what the essential part</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Danceing</hi> is, and then, Have at the <hi>Art:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>It is an <hi>Act,</hi> if rightly understood,</l>
            <l>Consisting of three parts, <hi>Time, Tune,</hi> and <hi>Mood;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Time</hi> limits, <hi>Tune</hi> doth regulate, the vigor</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Mood,</hi> doth aptly form <hi>posture,</hi> and <hi>figure:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus are the parts distinguish'd, I shall next</l>
            <l>Give you a Comment on this tempting <hi>Text</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In orderly <hi>Gradations,</hi> not by leaps,</l>
            <l>But soberly ascend to it by steps.</l>
            <l>What can be more allicient then to see</l>
            <l>Men move with <hi>mathematique</hi> majesty?</l>
            <l>Whose glyding feet so press the buxom earth</l>
            <l>As if their <hi>Motion</hi> gave the <hi>Musique</hi> birth.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:63225:18"/>
Where not alone the foot, but head, arm, thigh</l>
            <l>Contribute to compleat the harmony;</l>
            <l>It is a fit of <hi>order</hi> where our eyes,</l>
            <l>Have glimpses of the Spheres Rotundities:</l>
            <l>'Tis Musick to the sight, a swift and sweet</l>
            <l>Concord of spirits; Language of the feet,</l>
            <l>It moves the soul with such secret devotion,</l>
            <l>That it compels the standers by to motion:</l>
            <l>All creatures since the world (at first did start</l>
            <l>From <hi>Chaos)</hi> are presented by this Art:</l>
            <l>In <hi>motion</hi> or in <hi>station,</hi> look upon,</l>
            <l>The active glory of the rising Sun;</l>
            <l>Where <hi>time</hi> and <hi>tune</hi> do both (at once) confine</l>
            <l>His flameing feet along th' Ecliptique line;</l>
            <l>Exactly to a minute, some will say,</l>
            <l>He <hi>danceth</hi> to, upon an <hi>Easter day.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Moon doth more then he, for (like our Apes,</l>
            <l>In Antiques) she appears in several shapes;</l>
            <l>Whilst round about her, (by divine command)</l>
            <l>In <hi>figure</hi> all the <hi>Constellations</hi> stand:</l>
            <l>And he that will on <hi>Plinies</hi> volum call,</l>
            <l>Shall finde much order in each Animal.</l>
            <l>The whole Creation is a Dance, where men</l>
            <l>Rise, walk, turn, side so to their seats agen.</l>
            <l>An <hi>Army</hi> is a <hi>Dance,</hi> where (though an Ocean,</l>
            <l>Of mingled men) they measure all their motion;</l>
            <l>Who (as the trumpets sound, or drums do beat)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lead up,</hi> that is, <hi>March on, Fall back, Retreat:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But if it chance they by the Foe are foyld,</l>
            <l>They'r all <hi>disfigured,</hi> and the <hi>dance</hi> is spoyld.</l>

            </l>
            <l>I could enlarge upon it, but I must</l>
            <l>In <hi>Dancing's</hi> use and the abuse be just;</l>
            <l>In modest men, and virtuous women this</l>
            <l>Cannot conduce to any thing amiss:</l>
            <l>Besides, some <hi>Dances</hi> and some <hi>Dancers</hi> be</l>
            <l>So grave, they move like a <hi>solemnity;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Rather then such as titilate the bloud,</l>
            <l>With any Appetite that is not good:</l>
            <l>The true intent of <hi>dancing</hi> to me seems,</l>
            <l>Only an Artful perfecting the Limbes</l>
            <l>In gracious postures, such as <hi>Nature</hi> would,</l>
            <l>Her self have brought to pass if that she could</l>
            <l>This Art is necessary, if it were,</l>
            <l>Only to make the Feet familiar</l>
            <l>To walk the streets with hansomness, or come,</l>
            <l>With civil motion to a strangers Room:</l>
            <l>But (in a word) these active Recreations</l>
            <l>Are antient, good, and practiz'd by all Nations:</l>
            <l>Th' abuses are, where persons void of fame</l>
            <l>And full of lnst, use this to feed the flame:</l>
            <l>What's this to th' Art? the Spider and the Bee</l>
            <l>Extract, by one rule of <hi>Phylosophy:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:63225:19"/>
And that which is an ornament in one,</l>
            <l>May in another breed destruction:</l>
            <l>I fear that <hi>Scripture phrase,</hi> where mischief's hid,</l>
            <l>Hath done more hurt then ever dancing did:</l>
            <l>All things may be corrupted, meat, drink, health;</l>
            <l>The <hi>Seat of Justice,</hi> an whole <hi>Commonwealth:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>If it be so, then I may boldly say,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Danceing</hi> is as innocent as they.</l>
