            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore let all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians pray, that God in his mercy may blesse vs &amp; all others, from the like practises: and to weede from the face of the earth all such like offenders as he did these, and with the like shame and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reward them O God I beseeche thee.</p>
               <p>These aforesayd confessions being taken before the Gouernour, and other Burgesses of the Cittie of <hi>Manchen,</hi> they were arraigned, conuicted, and condemned: and vpon the nine and twentie of Iuly were executed in this maner and forme following.</p>
               <p>First, they were all sixe brought before the towne house of <hi>Manchen,</hi> where the Woman (being placst betwixt her two Sonnes) had both her Brestes cut off: with the which Brestes, the Executioner stroke her three times about the face: and in like maner her two Sonnes, who sate on each side of her, were likewise beaten about the face with their mothers Brestes three times apeece. This beeing done in the presence of many people, the Woman had sixe stripes giuen her with a Whip of twisted Wier: and after, had both her Armes broken with a Wheele, and then set in a settle made of purpose:
<pb facs="tcp:16279:6"/>
her body was immediatly burnt.</p>
               <p>After this, the other fiue men-Witches, had also sixe stripes apeece, and both their Armes likewise broken with a Wheele, and foure of them tyed vnto a stake in the same place, and burnt: But <hi>Paule Gamperle,</hi> the father and maister Witch of them all, was spitted aliue, and so roasted to death, and after had his body likewise burnt into sinders.</p>
               <p>Thus gentle Reader, hast thou heard the life and death of these sixe most notorious and wicked Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For the truth wherof, let no man make doubt: for it is not onely reported of by many men of good sufficiencie, but translated out of the Dutch Coppy as it was there first imprinted. Therefore let vs all in general, fall downe vpon our knees, and with contrite hartes, desire of his Maiestie, by whose sufferance all theyr wicked practises were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that he will abate the pride and mallice of Sathan, now raigning amongst mankind, and to put in our hartes such strong fayth, that the like assaultes neuer assayle vs, but that we may serue him in perfect loue and godlines, who is the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Ring of all Kinges: to whom be all prayse, glory, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for euer.</p>
               <closer>Amen.</closer>
