            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ame doth not ever delude us. She proclaimes you not onely for a Scholler, but celebrates you as a profound Divine and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. It ſeemes yet to me, by her ſparing Relation, that ſhe was loth to offend your Modeſty. For, after our acquaintaince, you appear'd to me far greater then your Fame. Verily, you have ſo temper'd Excellent Learning, with ſweet Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that your Demerits exceed the praiſes even of an eloquent Lover.</p>
            <p>This rare Elogy is the more illuſtrious in you, as tis moſt ſeldome to be found in Others of your Rank and Roman profeſſion: (to deale freely with you, as your Curteſie invites me.)</p>
            <p>Being both of us caſt into the ſame Priſon, but for different Cauſes, you for defending the Pope, I for impugning him; I confeſſe, that (at firſt) I purpoſly ſhun'd your Acquaintaince; not in hate to your Perſon, but out of feare of your Party, which after ſome private Colloquies had wrong'd me and the Truth, dearer to me then my ſelfe: reporting, that the Defenders of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were unlearned and diſhoneſt: and abſurdly caluminating our Doctrin, as falſe and Hereticall. It happened likewiſe, that after we had caſually met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in company, (but had then no leiſure to enter into any Diſpute) it was bruited abroad, (I know not by whom) that being challeng'd by you to a Scholaſticall Combat, I had cowardly declin'd it. As my credit is not ſo weak, to be wounded with ſuch ſilly Rumors, ſo I hold it not fit to let them paſſe without Comptroll. Your Conference (indeed) I refus'd, for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I conceiv'd, there was ſmall hope to win you to our fide, by any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54238:2"/>
of Truth, being ſuch an old Souldier of the Popes, and now growne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and gray hair'd in Popery. But when (after) I had learnd by experience, that you were a Gent. of ſingular Ingenuity and Candor, and perceiv'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how affectionately you lov'd me, and how zealous you were of my Soules-health: I began to be much inflamed with deſire of your Society. For, <q>Civility and Curteſie is of ſo winning a nature, that it is a ſtronger Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the ſtrongeſt Enchantment.</q> You were often heard to ſay, that you would give any thing to procure my Converſion, yea, goe to <hi>Rome</hi> bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, if ſuch a painfull journey might reclaime me to the Roman-Church. How much am I obliged for ſo eminent a Favour? I confeſſe, I was (now) as zealouſly deſirous of your wel-fare. For how could I retaliate ſo ſolicitous a Love, but by a reciprocall Solicitude of your Salvation?</p>
            <p>Nor did your Curteſie and good will, reſt onely in good wiſhes; but you promis'd alſo very kindly to lend me your helping hand to rayſe me from my Fall, and gently to ſhew me the way after my wandering. I began therefore to perſwade my ſelfe, that if haply (like a ſtraid Sheep) I had gon out of the way into the Mazes and by-pathes of Error, I could not poſſibly find out a better guide to conduct me to the Temple of Truth. Your Sufficiency, for Learning, was well known to me: and your Humanity ſo apparent, that it was ſtill ready to ſeize on me, even againſt my will. I ſaw, we had (Both) leiſure more then enough, and that we could not better beſtow our Time, nor find a more pleaſant Recreation during our Impriſonment. I was deſirous therefore to heare your Inſtructions, and to be better informed by you; not by any interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quntory Conference (which is ſubject to inconveniencies, and not ſo ſafe for either of Us) but by this ſilent and temperate way of Writing, which is more conſiderate, and not unbecomming our preſent condition.</p>
            <p>I remember, at our laſt Parley, you moſt confidently affirmed, the Roman Party to be the onely true Church, renowned for Antiquity, Succeſſion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſneſſe, Amplitude, and Unity. That in her Faith our Anceſtors liv'd and dyed; of whoſe ſalvation, ſhould their Poſteity doubt, it were groſſe impiety. That ſhe is reputed a true Church by her profeſt and Capitall Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and that eternall Woe will be the Reward of them that erre or deviate from her.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, you wiſht, out of your hearty deſire of the common ſalvation of all that all differences being accorded, and all Factions abandon'd, all men would returne to the Roman Church, caſheering the dull and droway Religion of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>: concluding (withall) that you could eaſily coine (if you were diſpoſed) one far better and more tolerable.</p>
            <p>I, as confidently urged, that our Church wanted neither Divine-Truth, nor ſaving-Faith. Thus, all our talke, at that time, ended in your Yea, and my No.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54238:3"/>
But becauſe the matter in controverſie, was of ſuch important conſequence, I conceiv'd that it ought to be aſſerted, not by bare words, but forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet, not with pride or pertinacy, but with Chriſtian Humility, and a mind prepared to imbrace the Truth.</p>
            <p>The principall and moſt impregnable Reaſon, inducing me to beleeve, that ours is the true Church, is becauſe I cleerely ſee, it hath all thoſe Requiſits that conſtitute the eſſence of a Church. For, when our Saviour Chriſt ſent forth his Apoſtles to inſtruct the whole World, he gave them onely this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to preach the Goſpell, and adminiſter the Sacraments, promiſing his Peace (which includes all happineſſe to all Nations, Cities, and people that reſiſted not their Evangelicall Legation. Wherefore, ſince the ſincere preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and beliefe of that Word preached, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt adminiſtration of the Sacraments, containe the ſumme and ſubſtance of our Religion, and are the very eſſentials of the Church, why ſhould we not not both hope and judge moſt worthily of ours, that hath neither corrupted the Doctrine of the Goſpell, nor adulterated the Sacraments?</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe, your Church, having polluted the Fountaine of the Goſpels with the mire and dirt of humane Inventions, and having corrupted the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sacraments with a number of trifling Ceremonies, it ſeemes to me, to have declin'd far from Truth, and to have no right to challenge to it ſelfe the Title of Catholik,<note place="margin">

            <p>And now you may ſee how weakely done it is of our wilfull Adverſaries, to cry out and calumnate us, for Heretiks: For, if men would be pleaſed to try our Doctrine and yours by the Rule and Canon of the Goſpell, 'twere no hard matter to judge whether Church were the preſerver of Integrity, and the Vaſſall of Hereticall impiety.</p>
            <p>Thinke not (moſt curteous Sir) that I ſay thus, to object to you the Faults of others, which out of over-zealous Piety (as they conceit) regard not to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate Charity; truely, when I reflect on ſuch kind of men, the Image of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan Church comes into my mind: For that alſo was ancient, ſplendid, rich in Rites, and ſhining with Ceremonies; yea, it honour'd <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly expected the <hi>Meſſias</hi>: notwithſtanding all this, the Author of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſentenced Her (from his owne mouth) not to be in the ſtate of Salvation. This I am the more confident to ſay to you, whom I know to be a perſon of excellent moderation, and not to be taken with ſpecious Toies and empty Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. For, what a brainſick piece of Braggardiſme is that; The Roman Church is ancient? Admit it be ſo: yet is it (withall impious and Superſtitious. But, ſhe is brave and Magnificent. Who denyes it? yet is ſhe falne into Idolatry.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54238:3"/>
Tis the moſt pernicious policy of Satan, to gild moſt execrable Errors with the falſe (but glittering) ſhew of Titles. By theſe artifices, how fouly hath he defil'd your Church? The very Rites of Pagans, condemned and exploded by the Apoſtles, he hath revived and obtruded, having painted and varniſht them with new names. But, Chriſt himſelfe he hath baniſht from the Church and Soules of men, retaining onely his Name, for a ſhew. This was Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, that he might place Antichriſt in the Throne of Chriſt. By theſe tricks, that Man of Sin mounted to the height of his Ambition. For, openly to have attempted to dethrone the Majeſty of Chriſt, had beene Folly and Madneſſe: as appeared (long before) in thoſe frantick Hereticks, <hi>Arius, Samoſatenus, Valentinus,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> ſcornd, contemnd, and plagu'd for their Blaſphemies. For, who is ſo deſperately hopeleſſe of Salvation, that could endure to heare an open Blaſphemer of Chriſt? They which deny the Godhead, or the Trinity, or which rage. and rayle at Chriſt, are by the common conſent of Chriſtians, adjudged to Death. But the myſtery of Iniquity was (by ſecret engines) to be contrived more cleanly. The Name of Chriſt was to be kept, and Adoration to be given at the naming of Jeſus, but the vertue and efficacy of his Merits, to be aboliſht. By this Stratagem, was Chriſt to be exterminated, that roome might be made [at <hi>Rome</hi>] for the ſeat of Antichriſt in the Temple of God. Horrible impiety! to deny that underhand, which openly dare not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. Excellently was it ſaid of <hi>Seneca</hi>: What difference is there betwixt denying and defaming God? So, what matters it, whether you deny Chriſt, as a Renegado, or whether you ſtrip him of his Offices? For if Chriſt be not veſted and dignified with his Office, he is no Chriſt to us. Since then, under the Name Chriſt, his Regall, Sacerdotall, and Propheticall Offices, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Word Jeſus, all the ſaving Benefits flowing from that triple Office are comprehended: there is no doubt, but, that is a corrupt Church, which hath corrupted thoſe Offices. Not to aggravate the atrocity of the Fact, with words: I ſay impaſſionately: The Roman Church erres grievouſly about Chriſts Offices; which ſhe hath corrupted, deſtroyed, and violated. Of this hainous and hideous Crime our Church was never guilty, but ever maintained and defended them.</p>
            <p>Intending to make a Parallel of the Doctrines of both Churches, I firſt ſay, by way of Preface, that in all your Doctrinall Additions and Corollaries, which (as ſo many unſound Fringes) you have ſewed to our Aſſertions, theres nothing which is not ſuperfluous, and which without any hazard of our Soules, may be canceld, exploded, and rejected. But, let us now beginne this parallel-collation of Doctrines, from Chriſts Regall Office.</p>
            <p>This is the Faith of the Reformed Chrurches. That Chriſt Jeſus is the onely Monarch, Moderator, Defender, and Governor, both of the whole World,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54238:4"/>
and of his Church in the World,<note place="margin">

            <p>But, your Papall Church teacheth otherwiſe: <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt is a King, but a worldly one: and not King alone neither, but the Pope his Vicar, ſhares with him in Raigne and Regiment. That in this Vicariat, there is a long <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and ſucceſſion of Popes, which are the Heads and Foundations of the Church. That the Church muſt be regulated &amp; governd not by Chriſts Lawes onely, but by the Canons alſo, and Conſtitutions of Councells and Fathers: and that the Violaters of ſuch Decrees are more ſeverely to be puniſht, then the Tranſgreſſors of Gods Law. That ſhe is to be ruled by Traditions, not by Scripture onely. That thoſe Traditions <hi>(of ſtraw</hi>) are equall to that Sacred Scepter.

For tell me if any man utterly ignorant of Pope, Fathers, and Councells ſhall ſubmit only to Chriſts Scepter, and obey his Lawes, in beleeving in him alone, as his only comforter, and protector in Adverſity, and his ſole patron in proſperity: ſhall this man (thinke you) on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, need to feare any Doome for his <hi>premention'd ignorance?</hi> I know, you are not ſo harſhly opinionate. Againe, if any man that knowes there is a Pope, ſhall confidently beleeve that Chriſt hath no Vicar on earth, that the Pope is very like Antichriſt: that <hi>Rome</hi> is Heriticall, that we muſt rather obey Chriſts Lawes, then Decrees of Fathers, and Councells, that no mortall man is inerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Multitude, Antiquity, Vnity, and worldly Felicity, have bin oft found In a falſe &amp; Malignant Church, will you take from this man ſo beleeving, and dying in this beleif, all hope of Heaven? Far be ſuch Immanity from your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. For, wherein hath he offended? what crime is he guilty of, that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd? This I would faine know, what Law (by that <hi>Faith</hi>) he hath broken. For, without tranſgreſſion of a Law, no man is a Delinquent. I ſuppoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (moſt learned Sir) you will grant me, that the Pope and his Gew-gawes may either be unknowne, or unacknowledg'd, without loſſe of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The Reformed Church beleeves, that Chriſt only is the ſole Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and men, that he only hath made ſatisfaction to God, fulfil'd the Law, paid our Ranſom, offer'd himſelfe in Sacrifice, that he alone is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor to God the Father, opens the paſſage for our prayers to the throne of grace, and emboldens us with confidence to addreſſe our ſupplications to God, and (therefore) that he alone is Mediator both of Redemption and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion: whence it followes that we ought not to pray to the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (nor to the Angels) as being ignorant of our preſent State of calamity or infirmity, and not able to penetrate the ſecrets af our hearts, as alſo, that this Mediator-ſhip is impiouſly aſſign'd to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who though ſhe were indeed of all Women the moſt bleſſed, yet had ſhe need (her ſelfe) of this Mediator. That this our Prieſt offer'd himſelfe a Victime for his choſen flock and people, not promiſcuouſly for all men whatſoever. That he is the Sacrificing Prieſt of the New Teſtament, and that there are on Earth no other Prieſts to offer daily a propitiatory ſacrifice for the ſinnes of quick and dead. That this Prieſts Sacrifice being of infinite vertue and value, is applied to the Faithfull, by the operation of the Holy Spirit, the preaching of the Goſpell, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments: which Sacrifice having bin once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate on the Croſſe by himſelfe, is not to be reiterated by any man on Earth. That wee are clad with the Righteouſneſſe of this Prieſt, and by vertue thereof, abſolvd from guilt and puniſhment. That beſide his blood, there it no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54238:5"/>
Purgatory that can cleanſe the ſpots and blots of our ſoules. That there are no torments or tortures, by the ſuffering whereof, any man can ſatisfie divine Juſtice, much leſſe can there be any workes of ſuper-erogation, which being laid up in the Granary or Treaſury of the Church, may by the ſale of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, be diſpenſ'd to others of leſſe deſert or merit. That our workes being far from perfection, cannot purchaſe eternall life. That remiſſion of ſinnes, is concredited and conſign'd to Miniſters, as Preachers, or Proclaimers of it, not as Iudges.</p>
            <p>But your Churches Creed runs thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt is indeed Mediator of Redemption: yet Saints and Angels act likewiſe their parts in mediating: but moſt of all, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Gate of Paradiſe, and Queene of Heaven, and that (therefore) Wee ought to addreſſe our Vowes, Prayers, &amp; Petitions, to them that ſo well, knowe our Wants. That there muſt be on Earth other Prieſts after the order of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> to offer Chriſt daily as a Sacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory for dead and living. That the Righteouſneſſe of this Sacrificing Prieſt is not imputed to us. That by his Merits, we are indeed delivered from the guilt of Sin, not from the puniſhment, to which we are ſtill liable. That the ſoules departed are purg'd and cleanſ'd by the Fire of Purgatory. That by our owne ſufferings, wee may make ſatisfaction to God. That there are works of ſupererogation in the Churches Magazine, which the Pope may ſel to lewd and looſe perſons. That life eternall is due to our workes, as wages are to a labourer. That to the goodneſſe of a worke, tis ſufficient, if the mind and intendment of the worker be good: Laſtly, that Eccleſiaſticall miniſters have Iudiciall power and authority, to forgive Sinns.</p>
            <p>Is not this (moſt worthy Sir) a groſſe Colluſion, to acknowledge Chriſt to be a Prieſt, in word, but to deny him indeed? To leave a ſhew only, and evacuate the vertue and ſubſtance of his Prieſt-hood. This mighty maſſe of Blaſphemous contumelies againſt Chriſt, may it not be unknowne without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to our faith. Can it hurt or prejudice a Chriſtian to diſbeleeve ſuch fainged devices? Admit, there be a good man, and carefull of his Salvation, which repoſes his confidence in Chriſts only Mediation, offers his prayers in his only Name to God, ſeekes for righteouſneſſe by his bloody Sacrifice alone, being utterly ignorant of other ſacrificing Prieſts, of any other Mediator, Sacrifice, Merit, or Purgatory: thinke you, that this his ignorance, ſhall be any impeachment or prejudice to him at Gods Tribunall? I trow you are not ſo unwiſe, to thinke ſo. Imagine now, there is one that is rooted and ſtrongly grounded in this belief. That beſide Chriſt, there is no Mediator or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, that the Dignity of Mediation is not to be communicated to Angels, Saints, or the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> That our affaires are to them unknowne and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granted. That to them we are neither to make Vowes, nor Prayers. That ſoule tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting

Purgatory is no where to be found, but in the crackt braines of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, or the jugling knavery of cozening Prieſts. That the Saints of God, are freed both from guilt and penalty. That Chriſts Righteouſneſſe is imputed to the Faithfull. That our ſufferings can effect nothing towards ſatisfaction, nor our doings conduce ought to ſalvation, by way of merit. That ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is a Bravado and Braggardiſme, and a device of Avarice to draw on filthy lucre. That good intents are not ſufficient for good works. That the miniſter hath no judiciall Authority to remit Sinns. What? doe wee thinke this man in danger, for this his confident perſuaſion? this belief breakes no Law nor Commandement. What danger then can there be where is no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency?</p>
            <p>The Reformed Church beleeves: That Chriſt is conſtituted by God, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Paſtor, Doctor, and Preacher of Peace: that he promulgated Gods ſecret and cabinet-counſell of the redemption of mankind, that he publikly preached this good tydings and goſpell,<note place="margin">Deut. <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1+ letters">

That from this Prophet, Gods perfect will was manifeſted to the World, and the ſame (by his Order) written in the Old and new Teſtament, not in darke or doubtfull termes, but plainely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly, as far as was neceſſary for our Salvation. That theſe ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being the Iudges of all controverſies, need not the addition of humane Traditions. That we are to ſerve and obey God, not according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men, but his owne celeſtiall ſanctions: and that (therefore) the worſhip of Images, is to be aboliſht out of our Churches and minds, not commanded by God. That Holidaies, not appointed and ſanctified by the Lord, need not be obſerved. That the uſe of all kind of Meates, is at any time lawfull, being frugally and moderately taken. That divine ſervice is miſ-cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in a language unknowne to the people. That ther's no inherent ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſome place, more then other, nor in any Church: and that our prayers are no ſooner heard in ſome one place, then another.</p>
            <p>Thus beleeves the Reformed Church. But ſhe gives no credit to thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious paradoxes, <hi>viz.</hi> That iuſtifiing faith, may be without charity and good workes. That faith may be without knowledge of what is to be beleeved. That men drown'd in their owne corruptions, are indued with certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives to grace, or furniſht with merits of congruity. That our converſion to God is not wholly to be aſcrib'd to grace, but in part to Natures endeavour. That election depends of faith fore-ſcene &amp; the motion of our free will. That the faithfull may: Apoſtatize, and fall from grace. That concupiscence is void of ſinne. That Kings have not their preheminence by divine Right. That the

That the gift of continence is given to all that refuſe it not. That the Pope may lawfully take tribute of ſtewes. That Sacraments confer grace by the worke wrought. That infants baptiſed are not tainted at all with ſinne. That Chriſts body is in divers places at once, yet neither viſible nor tangible.

            <p>Now (Worthy Sir) ſuppoſe ſome wel-affected Chriſtian, to be of this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: that he will wholly give eare to, and be inſtructed by Chriſt, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: that he will obey onely the Scripture and Gods will therein revealed: ſuppoſe this man to beleeve that the Scripture is perfect, perſpicuous, the Judge of all controverſies and determiner of all doubts: that Laicks ought to read it, and regulate their lives and manners by it. Doe yee thinke, the high honour which this man gives to Chriſt as to our Chiefe-Prophet, ſhall or can prejudice him? Far be ſo wide and wilde a conceit from your ingenuous Candor. For, what crime hath he committed, which being ignorant of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Holidayes, Images, Faſting-dayes, and a number of the like Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious obſervances, doth ſoly imbrace thoſe Doctrines which Chriſt hath taught for the Churches comfort and edification? Adde now hereto, that the ſame man is fully confidenced, that Scripture cannot (without extreme impiety) be charged with imperfection or obſcurity: that tis a great crime to debar the people from reading Scripture: and no leſſe ſin, to traine them to the beliefe of Traditions: that tis impious, to worſhip God in the ſhape or likeneſſe of Man, or to expoſe Images to the peoples Adoration: that tis Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranicall to obtrude the obſervance of Holidaies (under the terror of Penalties) which are inſtituted by men; as alſo to forbid Meats, to ſober men at certaine Seaſons. That tis unlawfull to mumble &amp; mutter prayers in a ſtrange Tongue. That tis abſurd to thinke one place holier then another. That tis impoſſible, at once to beleeve, and yet to be ignorant: or that juſtifying Faith ſhould ſubſiſt, without charity: or, that man wallowing in his corruption, ſhould be able to prepare himſelfe for Grace: or, that concupiſcence ſhould be put out of the catalogue of ſins. That they are moſt execrable Miſcreants, that deprive the Kings Crowne of its divine Right, or exempt the Miter from obedience to the Scepter: or breake their Faith with Hereticks; or draw monaſtick perſons to a blind obedience: or calumniate the Marriage of the Clergy, as worſe then Adultery. That they are abſurd and ſenſeleſſe, that teach, the Gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to be promiſcuous and obvious to all: which approve of tribute taken from mercenary Proſtitutes: which think that children may vow or diſ-avow againſt their parents wils: which hold that Matrimony is not violated by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. That they erre grievouſly, that pretend, the Sacraments collate

Grace by the bare worke done: that all baptized perſons are without all Sin, and all unbapatized liable to eternall Damnation. That they are the maddeſt Bedlams that (like Corybanticall Prieſts) teach, Chriſts Body to be in many places at once, unſeene, and inſenſible: which dreame of a Metamorphoſis, and change of Bread and Wine into his Body and Blood: which dote that our Lords Fleſh may be ſwallowed and devoured by impious Wretches: which preclude the Cup from the people, though Chriſt himſelfe reach it to them in the Scripture: which adore a Wafer in ſtead of Chriſt: which vainly imagine his corporall preſence on earth, being conſign'd to Heaven till the end of the World. Can ſuch a mans ignorance of theſe Romiſh Trumperies, or his beliefe of Chriſts ſincere Doctrine, hurt him when he is alive, or damne him for ever being Dead? What cruell Rhadamanth (or Judge of Hell) can paſſe ſuch a Sentence? For; what crime is there here? What Law hath he tranſgreſt? ſhall any man be blam'd, for being afraid to Idolatrize, or to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God after his owne voluntary invention? ſhall he be condemn'd for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning the impious and abſurd Traditions of Men, and obeying the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Prophet that is given us from Heaven?</p>
            <p>Thus, if we collate and parallel the adverſe Opinions of the Romiſh and Reformed Churches, it will ſoone appear which Party is moſt Zealous of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Piety, which is its proper Fruit and product.</p>
