            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE READER, OR, A gaining of ſatisfaction to all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Practiſers, and confuting the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſelf-conceited.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not diſpute the ſeveral opinions of men in this Kingdom, touching the keeping of the <hi>Running Horſe;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know many are idle and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſome uncertain, and a few in the right way: Only in this I would clear one <hi>Paradox,</hi> which is ſtrongly maintained, and infinitely purſued by many of our beſt Profeſſours; And that is the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and length of time, for the preparing or making rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an Horſe for a Match or great Wager.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32605:13"/>There be divers, nay ſome which I know carry the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis</hi> on their backs, that affirm an Horſe, which is exceeding fat, foul, newly taken from graſs ſoile, or lofty, liberal, and unbounded feeding, cannot be brought to performance of his beſt labour under ſix Moneths, five is too little, and four an act of impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; by which they rob their noble Maſters of half a years pleaſure, thruſt upon them a tiring charge to make the ſport lothſome, and get nothing but a Cloak for ignorance, and a few falſe got Crowns, which melt as they are poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>Yet as <hi>Heretiques</hi> cite <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſo theſe find reaſons to defend want of knowledge.</p>
            <p>As the danger of ſo early exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The offence of greaſe too ſuddenly broken.</p>
            <p>The moving of evil humours too haſtily, which leads to mortal ſickneſs.</p>
            <p>And the moderation or helping of all theſe by a ſlow proceeding, and bringing of the Horſe into order by degrees and times, or, as I may say, by an ignorant ſufferance.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons, I know, have the ſhew of a good ground; for the early exerciſe is dangerous, but not if free from violence.</p>
            <p>To break greaſe too ſuddenly is an offence unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for it puts both the Limbs and the life in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, but not if purged away by Scowrings.</p>
            <p>The haſty ſtirring up of humours in Body, where they ſuperabound, and are generally diſperſed, and not ſettled, cannot but breed ſickneſs.</p>
            <p>But not where diſcretion and judgment evacnateth them in wholſome ſweats and moderate ſtirrings.</p>
            <p>And for the moderation of all theſe by the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, as two Moneths for the firſt, two Moneths for the ſecond, and as many for the laſt. It is like
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32605:13"/>
the covering of a Gangrene in an old man, better to dye than be diſmembred, better loſe the prize, than bear the charge: for I dare appeal to any noble judgment (whoſe purſe hath Experience in theſe actions,) if ſix Moneths preparation, and the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances belonging to it, and his perſon, do not devour up an hundred pound wager.</p>
            <p>But you will demand of me, What limitation of time I will allow for this purpoſe of preparation? And I anſwer, that two Moneths time is ſufficient at any time of the year whatſoever; and he that cannot do it in two Moneths, ſhall never do it in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</p>
            <p>But reply they, No Scowring is to be allowed; for they are Phyſical, then unnatural; they force na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo hurt nature; they make ſickneſs, and ſo impair health: Becauſe nature worketh every thing her ſelf, and though ſhe be longer, yet ſhe hath leſs danger.</p>
            <p>I confeſſ that ſlibberſauce ſcowrings, which are ſtuft up with poyſonous Ingredients, cannot chooſe but bring forth Infirmity; but wholſome ſcowrings that are compoſed of beneficial and nouriſhing Simples, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion ſickneſs, nor any manner of infirmity, but bring away greaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all manner of foulneſs in that kind, that one week ſhall effect and cleanſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more than two Moneths of delat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry and doubtful forbearance.</p>
            <p>Becauſe no man in this lingring courſe can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tell which way the greaſe and other foulneſs will avoid: as whether into his Ordure, which is the ſafeſt; into ſweat, which is hazardous; into his limbs, which is miſchievous; or remain and putrifie in his body, which is mortally dangerous; ſince the iſſue of all theſe falleth out according to the ſtrength and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32605:14"/>
eſtate of the Horſes body, and the diligence of the keeper; and if either the one fall in power or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in care, farwell Horſe for that year; all this nevy cannot chooſe but confeſs, only they have but one broken Crutch to ſupport them, which is, they know no ſcowring, therefore they will allow of no ſcowring. Againſt Barbariſm I will not diſpute, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I appeal to art and diſcretion, whether purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſufferance (when nature is offended) be the better doers.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Two Moneths I allow for preparation, and according to that time, I have laid directions. My humble ſuit is, out of a ſincere opinion to truth and juſtice, ſo to allow or diſallow, to refrain or imitate.</p>

               <head>The firſt ordering of the Running Horſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeveral eſtates of their Bodies.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen a Horſe is matched (or to be matched) for a runing Courſe, you are principally to regard the eſtate of the Body, in which the Horſe is at the time of his matching, and this eſtate of body I divide into three ſeveral kinds.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The firſt is, if he be very fat, foul, and either newly taken from graſs or ſoil.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:32605:15"/>2, The ſecond, if he be extreme lean and poor, either through over-riding, diſorder, or other in firmity.</item>
                  <item>3. The third, if he be in a good and well liking eſtate, having had good uſage and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If your Horſe be in the firſt eſtate of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, you ſhall take longer time for matching, keeping, and bringing into order, as two Moneths at the leaſt, or more, as you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your wager.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe be in the ſecond eſtate of Body, that is, very poor, then you ſhall alſo take as long time as you may, yet you need not ſo much as in the former, both becauſe greaſe cannot much offend, and exerciſe may go hand in hand with feeding.</p>
               <p>If your Horſe be in the third eſtate of Body, (which is a mean betwixt the other extremes) thena Moneth or ſix weeks may be time ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diet him for his Match.</p>
               <p>Now as you regard theſe general eſtates of bodies; ſo you muſt have an eye to certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſtates of bodies: as if a Horſe be fat and foul, yet of free and ſpending nature, apt quickly to conſume and loſe his fleſh; this Horſe muſt not haue ſo ſtrict an hand, neither can he endure ſo violent excerciſe, as he that is of a hard diſpoſition, and will feed and be far upon all meats and all exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Again, if your Horſe be in extreme poverty, through diſorder or miſuſage, yet is by nature very hard and apt, both ſoon to recover his fleſh, and long to hold it; then over this Horſe you ſhall by no means hold ſo liberal and tender
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32605:15"/>
an hand, nor forbear that excerciſe, which otherwiſe you would do to the Horſe, which is of a tender nature, a weak ſtomack, and a free ſpirit. Provided always, you haue regard to his limbs, the imperfection of his lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how to look into the Eſtates of Horſes Bodies, and what time to take for your matchings.</p>
               <p>I will now deſcend to their ſeveral order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and dietings, and becauſe in the fat Horſe, is contained both the lean Horſe, and the Horſe in reaſonable eſtate of Body, I will in him ſhew all the ſecrets and obſervations, which are to be imployed in the dieting and ordering of all three, without any omiſſion or reſervation whatſoever. For truth, Sir, I have Vowed unto you, and truth I will preſent you.</p>

               <p>IF you match an Horſe that is fat and foul ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by runing at Graſs, or ſtanding at Soil, or any other means of reſt, or too high keeping, you ſhall for the firſt fortnight at leaſt riſe early in the morning before day, or at the ſpring of day, according to the time of the year, and having put on his Bridle waſht in Beer, and tyed to the Rack, take away the dung and other foulneſs of the Stable, then you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32605:16"/>
ſhall dreſs the Horſe exceeding well, that is to ſay,</p>
               <p>You ſhall firſt curry him all over from the head to the tail, from the top of the ſhoulder to the knee, and from the top of the buttock to the hinder cambril; then duſt him all over, either with a clean duſting cloth, or with an horſes tayl, or ſuch like thing, made faſt to an handle, then curry or rub him all over with the French bruſh, beginning with his forehead, temples and cheeks, ſo down his neek, ſhoulders, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs, even to the ſetting on of his hoofs, ſo along his ſides, and under his belly; and laſtly, all about his buttocks, and hinder legs, even to the ground. Then you ſhall go over all thoſe parts which the bruſh hath touched with your wet hand, and not leave, as near as you can, one looſe hair about him, nor one wet hair; for what your hands did wet, your hands muſt rub dry again: you ſhall alſo with your wet hands cleanſe his ſheath, his yard, his ſtones or cods, and his Tuel; and in dead not leave any ſecret place uncleanſed, as ears, noſtrils, fore-bowels, and between his hinder thighs. Then you ſhall take an haircl-oth, and with it rub the Horſe all over in every part, but eſpecially his face, eyes, cheeks, between the chops, on the top of his forehead, in the nape of the neck, and down his legs, fetlocks, and about his paſterns.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You ſhall take a clean woollen cloth, and with it you ſhall rub the Horſe oll over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with his head and face, and ſo paſſing through every part of the Horſes body or limbs, which hath been before mentioned; then take a wet Mane-comb, and come down mane and tail.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32605:16"/>
When this work is finiſhed, take a fair large body-cloth, of thick warm houſewives Kerſey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if it be in the winter ſeaſon, or of fine corten, or other light ſtuff, if it be in the Summer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) and fold it round about the Horſes body; then clap on his Saddle, and girt the foremoſt girth pretty ſtrait, and the other girth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſlack, and wiſp it on each ſide the Horſes heart, that both the girths may be of equal ſtraitneſs, then put before his breaſt a warm breaſt-cloth, and let it cover both his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>When the Horſe is thus accoutred and made ready, you ſhall take a little beer into your mouth and ſpirt it into the Horſes mouth, and ſo draw him out of the Stable, and take his back, leaving ſome ordinary Groom behind you, to trim up your ſtable, to carry forth dung, and ſhake and toſs up your litter. For you are to underſtand, and it is a general principle, that your Horſe muſt ſtand upon good ſtore of freſh dry Litter continually, both night and day, and it muſt ever be of Wheat-ſtraw, if poſſible, or Oat-ſtraw, if forced by neceſſity. As for Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-ſtraw, and Rye-ſtraw, they are both un wholeſome and dangerous, the one doth heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, the other cauſeth ſcowring.</p>
               <p>When you are thus mounted, you ſhall walk forth your Horſe foot pace, (which we call racking) for you muſt neither amble, nor trot, at leaſt a mile or two, or more, upon ſmooth and ſound ground, and as near as you can to the ſteepeſt hils you can find: there gallop your Horſe very gently up thoſe ſteep hils, and rack or walk him ſoftly down, that he may cool as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32605:17"/>
much one way, as he warmeth another. And when you have thus exerciſed him a pretty ſpace then ſeeing the Sun beginning to riſe, or pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily riſen, you ſhall walk your Horſe down ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſome freſh River, or ſome clear Pond that is fed with a ſweet Spring, and there let your Horſe drink at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>After he hath drunk, you ſhall gallop and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe him moderately as you did before; then walk him a pretty ſpace, and after offer him more water: If he drink, then gallop him again; if he refuſe, then gallop him to occaſion thirſt; and thus always give him exerciſe both before and after water.</p>
               <p>When he hath drunk (as you think ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) then bring him home gently, without a wet hair about him: when you are come to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble door (before which your Groom ſhall throw all his foul litter continually from time to time) you ſhall there alight from his back, and by whiſtling ſtretching the Horſe upon the ſtraw, and ariſing the ſtraw up under the Horſe, ſee if you can make him Piſs, which if at firſt he do not, yet with a little cuſtome he wil ſoon be brought unto it, and it is an wholſom action, both for the Horſes health, and for the cleanly keeping of the ſtable.</p>
               <p>When theſe things are performed, you ſhall then bring the Horſe into his ſtall; and firſt tye his head up to the rack in his bridle, then with hard wiſps rub all his four legs down with as great ſtrength as you can, then unlooſe his breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth; rub his head, neck, and breaſt, exceeding much with a dry cloth: then take of his Saddle, and hang it by; and after take of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32605:17"/>
Body-cloth; then rub over all the Horſes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and limbs, eſpecially his back where the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſtood; and then clothe him up firſt with alin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen ſheet, then over it a good ſtrong houſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and a bove it his woollen body-cloth, which in the winter is not amiſs to have lined with ſome thin cotten, or other woollen ſtuff, but in the heat of Summer the Kerſey it ſelf is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>When you have girt theſe Clothes about him, ſtop his ſurſingle round with reaſonable big, ſoft, and thick wiſps; for with them he will lye at beſt eaſe, becauſe the ſmall hard wiſps are ever hurtful.</p>
               <p>After your Horſe is thus clothed up, you ſhall then pick his feet, and ſtop them up with cow-dung, and then throw in to his racka little bundle of hay, ſo much as a half-penny bottle in a dear Inn, well duſted, and hard bound up together, and this he ſhall tear out as he ſtandeth on his bridle.</p>
               <p>After the Horſe hath ſtood on his bridle more than an hour, or an hour and half, you ſhall then come to him, and firſt rub his head, face, and the nape of his neck with a clean rubber, made of new rough hempen cloth, for this is excellent for the head, and dſſolveth all groſs and filthy humours, and then you ſhall draw his bridle, and with a very clean cloth make the manger ſo clean as may be; and if he hath ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered any hay therein, you ſhall gather it up and throw it back into his rack; then you ſhall take the quantity of a quart, or better, of ſweet, dry, old, and clean dreſſed Oats, of which the heavieſt and the whiteſt are the beſt, as thoſe which we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32605:18"/>
call the <hi>Poland</hi> Oats, or the cut Oats, for thoſe only are wholeſome, the other which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweet breed infirmity, thoſe which are moiſt cauſe ſwelling in the body, thoſe which are new breed worms, and pain in the belly, and they which are half dreſſed deceive the ſtomack, and bring the Horſe to ruine. As for theblack Oats, though they are tolerable in the time of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yet they make full dung, and hinder a mans knowledg, in the ſtate of the Horſes body.</p>
               <p>This quart of Oats you ſhall put into a Sieve that is ſomewhat leſs than a Riddle, and a thought bigger then a Reeing Sieve, ſuch a one as will let a light Oat go through, but will keep a ful Oat from ſcattering. In this Sieve you ſhall ree, dreſs, and toſs your Oats very much, that there may be neither duſt, nor any other foul thing in them: And ſo give them to the Horſe to eat, and if he eat them with a good ſtomack, you may then ſift, and give him as much more; and ſo let him reſt, till it be near eleven of the clock. Then come to the ſtable again, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rubbed the Horſes head, neck, and face, you ſhall then take another quart or better of Oats, and as before, toſs and ree them through your Sieves, and ſo give them the Horſe. Then cloſing up your windows and light, that the Horſe may remain ſo dark as is poſſible, leave him til one of the clock. And here you are to underſtand that the darker you keep your Horſe in your abſence, the better it is, and it will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion him to feed, lye down and take his reſt, where otherwiſe he would not. And therefore we commonly uſe to arm the ſtals, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:32605:18"/>
thoſe Horſes ſtand, round about, and aloft, and over the rack, with ſtrong Canvas, both for darkneſs, warmth, and that no filth may come near the Horſe.</p>
               <p>At one a clock or thereabouts, come to the Horſe again, and ſift and dreſs him another quart of Oats, as before ſhewed, and give them him: after you have rubbed well his face, head, and nape of the neck, then putting away his dung and making the ſtable clean and ſweet, give him a little knob of hay, and ſo leave him till four of the clock in the evening, if it be in the Summer; after three, if it be in the Winter and ſhort ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>At four a clock in the evening come again to the Stable, and having made all things clean, then bridle up the Horſe, having wet the ſnaffle with beer, and tyed him up to the rack, then take off his clothes and dreſs him in all points, and every way as was ſhewed you in the morning. After he is dreſſed, then clothe and ſaddle him, as was alſo ſhewed for the morning: then bring him forth, and do your beſt to make him piſs and dung upon the foul Litter at the ſtable door: then mount his back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ride him forth, as you did in the morning, but not to the hils, if poſſible you can find any other plain and level ground, as Meadow, Paſture, or any other earth, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it lye along by the River. But in this caſe you can be no chooſer, but muſt take the moſt convenient ground you can find, to make a vertue of neceſſity. There air your Horſe in all points in the Evening, as you did in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, galloping him both before and after his water, then racking him gently up and down,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32605:19"/>
in your raking you muſt obſerve even from the Stable door in all your paſſages, eſpecially when you would have your Horſe to empty himſelf, to let him ſmell upon every old and new dung you meet with all, for this will make him empty his body, and repair his ſtomack.</p>
               <p>After you have watered your Horſe, and ſpent the Evening in airing till within night, (for nothing is more wholſome or ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth foulneſs than early and late airings) you ſhall then air him home to the Stable door, there alight, and whatſoever you did in the morning either within doors or without, do the ſame alſo now at night, and ſo leave the Horſe on his bridle an hour or an hour and an half. Then come to him again, and as you did in the fore-noon, ſodo now, rub well, draw his bridle, cleanſe the manger, put up his ſcattered hay, ſift him a quart and better of oats, and give them him and ſo let him reſt till nine of the clock at night.</p>
               <p>At nine of the clock at night, which is bedtime both for your Horſe and your ſelf, come unto him, and firſt rub down his legs hard with hard wiſps, then with a clean cloth rub his face, head, chaps, nape of the neck and fore-parts. Then turn up his clothes, and rub over his fillets, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, and hinder parts: then put down his clothes, and ſift him a quart of Oats, and give them him. Then put into his Rack a little bundle of hay (as hath been before ſhewed) toſs up his Litter and make his bed ſoft, and ſo betake both him and your ſelf to your reſts till the next morning.</p>
               <p>The next morning (as the morning before) come to the Horſe before day, or at the break,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32605:19"/>
according to the ſeaſon of the year, and do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, without the omiſſion of any one particular, as hath been formerly declared.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſhall keep your Horſe conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the firſt fortnight; in which by this double daily exerciſe you ſhall ſo harden his fleſh, and conſume his foulneſs, that the next fortnight (if you be a temperate man) you may adventure to give him gentle heats.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Now touching his heats, you are to take to your ſelf theſe four Conſiderations.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, That two heats in the week is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proportion for any Horſe of what condition or ſtate of body ſoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That one heat ſhould ever be given upon that day in the week on which he is to be run his match. As thus, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>If your match is to be run upon the Munday, then your fitteſt heating days are Mundayes and Fridayes, and the Munday to be ever the ſharper heat; both becauſe it is the day of his match, and there is three days reſpite betwixt it and the other heat.</p>
               <p>If the match-day be on the Tueſday, then the heating days are Tueſdays and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</p>
               <p>If it be on Wedneſday, then the heating dayes are Wedneſdayes and Saturdayes by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>If on the Thurſday, then the heating dayes are Thurſdayes and Mundayes, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32605:20"/>Thirdly, you ſhall give no heat (except in caſe of extremity) in very rainy and foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but rather to differ hours, and change times, for it is unwholeſome and dangerous. And therefore in caſe of ſhowers and uncertain weather, you ſhall be ſure to provide for your Horſe a warm lined hood with linnen ears, and the nape of the neck lined to keep out rain, for nothing is more dangerous than cold wet falling into the ears, upon the nape of the neck and the fillets.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Obſerve to give your heats (the weather being ſeaſonable) as early in the morning as you can, that is, by the ſpring of the day: but by no means in the dark, for it is to the Horſe unwholeſome and unpleaſant, to the man a great teſtimony of folly, and to both an act of danger and precipitation.</p>

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The ſecond Fortnight's keeping.</head>
               <p>NOw to deſcend to your ſecond Fortnight's keeping; touching your firſt approach to the Stable and all other by-reſpects, as cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhaking up of Litter, and the like, you ſhall do all things as in the firſt fortnight. Only before you put on his Bridle, you ſhall give him a quart or better, of clean ſifted Oats, which as ſoon as he hath eaten, you ſhall then bridle him up, and dreſs him in all points, as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the firſt fortnight, you ſhall clothe him, ſaddle him, air, water, and bring him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32605:20"/>
home in all points, as in the firſt fortnight; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſhall not put any Hay in his Rack to tear out, but only draw with your hand as much fine ſweet Hay (which you ſhall toſs and duſt well) as you can well gripe, and let him as he ſtandeth on the bridle tear it out of your hand, which if he do greedily and earneſtly, then you may give him another and another, and ſo let him ſtand on the bridle an hour or more after. Then come to him, and after rubbing and other ceremonies, before declared, performed; ſift and duſt up the quantity of a quart of Oats, and ſet them by: Then take a loaf of bread, that is at leaſt three dayes old, made after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The firſt Bread.</head>
               <p>TAke three pecks of clean Beans, and one peck of fine Wheat, and mix them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and grind it to pure meal.</p>
               <p>Then ſearce and bolt through a reaſonable fine range, and knead it up with great ſtore of barm and lightning, but with as little water as may be; labour it in the Trough with all pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, tread it, break it, and after cover it warm, and let it ly a pretty ſpace in the Trough to ſwell: then after knead it over again, and mold it up into big Loaves, and ſo bake them well, and let them ſoak ſoundly; after they are drawn from the Oven, turn the bottoms upward and let them cool.</p>
               <p>At three daies old you may adventure to give this bread, but hardly ſooner, for nothing doth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32605:21"/>
occaſion ſurfeit, or is more dangerous than new bread; yet if neceſſity compel you that you muſt ſooner give this bread, or that the bread be danck and clammy, ſo as the Horſe taketh diſtaſte thereat, then cut the loaf into thin ſhives, and lay it abroad in a Sieve to dry, and then crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it ſmall amongſt his Oats, you may give it without danger.</p>
               <p>But to return to my purpoſe where I left: when you have taken a loaf of this bread of three dayes old, you ſhall chip it very well, then cut it into thin ſhives, and break three or four ſhives thereof (which may countervail the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Oats) very ſmall, and mix it with the Oats you had before ſifted, and ſo give them to the Horſe.</p>
               <p>About Eleven of the Clock you ſhall come to the Horſe, and having performed your by-Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, before ſpoken of, you ſhall give him the ſame quantity of bread and Oats as you did in the morning, and ſo let him reſt till the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</p>
               <p>At one of the Clock in the afternoon (or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if you intend not to give him an heat the next day) you ſhall feed him with bread and Oats as you did in the forenoon, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently every meal following for that day, obſerving every action and motion, as hath been before declared.</p>
               <p>But if you intend the next day to give him an heat (to which I now bend mine aim) you ſhall then only give him a quart of ſweet Oats, and as ſoon as they are eaten, put on his bridle, and tye up his head, not forgetting all by-Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, before declared. Then dreſs him, clothe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32605:21"/>
him, ſaddle him, air and water him, as before ſhewed: alſo bring him home, and order him, as before ſhewed, only give him no hay at all</p>
               <p>After he hath ſtood an hour on the bridle, give him, as before a quart of clean ſifted Oats; when he hath eaten them, you ſhall then put on his head a ſweet clean waſht muzzle, and ſo let him reſt till nine of the Clock at Night.</p>
               <p>Now touching the uſe of the Muzzle; and which is the beſt, you ſhall underſtand, that as they are moſt uſeful, being good and rightly made; ſo they are dangerous and hurtful, being abuſed or falſly made.</p>
               <p>The true uſe of them, is to keep the Horſe from eating up his Litter, from gnawing upon Boards and mud-Walls, and indeed to keep him from eating any thing, but what he reciveth from your hand.</p>
               <p>Theſe muzzles are ſometimes made of leather, and ſtampt full of holes, or elſe cloſe, but they are unſavoury and unwholeſome; for if it be allom'd Leather, the allom is offenſive; if it be liquor'd, the greaſe and ouze are full as unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: beſides, they are too cloſe, and too hot, and both make a Horſe ſick, cauſe him to forbear reſt, and retain his dung longer in his body, then otherwiſe he would do.</p>
               <p>The beſt Summer-muzzle, is the Net-muzzle, made of ſtrong packthred, and knit exceeding thick, and with ſmall maſhes in the bottom, and ſo enlarged wider and wider up to the middle of the Horſes head, and then bound about the top with ſtrong tape, upon the near ſide a loop, and on the far ſide a long ſtring of tape to be faſtned unto the Horſes head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:32605:22"/>The beſt winter muzzle, is that which is made of ſtrong double Canvas, with a round bottom, and a ſquare Lattis window of ſmall tape, before both his noſtrils, down to the very bottom of the Muzzle; this muſt alſo have a loop and a ſtring to faſten it about the Horſes head.</p>
               <p>At nine of the Clock at night coming to the Horſe again, after your by-Ceremonies, before taught, are performed, give him a quart of clean ſifted Oats; and as ſoon as he hath eaten them, put on his muzzle, toſs up his Litter, and leave him to his reſt.</p>
               <p>The next day early in the morning before day, come to the horſe (if he be ſtanding on his feet) but if he be laid, by no no means diſturb him.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt he is lying, or if he be ſtanding, take a quart of clean Oats well ſifted, and rub between your hands, and waſh them in a little ſtrong Ale or beer, and let them not be too moiſt for fear of offence, and ſo give them to the Horſe.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he hath eaten them, bridle him up, and hang by his muzzle in ſome ſweet place, then unclothe him, and dreſs him, as hath been before ſhewed; after put on his body-cloth, and breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and Saddle him: then being ready to go forth with him, take his Bridle-rein and draw it over the top of the rack, ſo as you may draw his head aloft. Then take a new laid Egg, waſht clean, and breaking it in his mouth make him to ſwallow it down, then waſh his tongue and mouth with a little beer, and ſo lead him forth of the ſtable.</p>
               <p>At the door ſee if he will piſs or dung, then take his back and rack him gently to the Courſe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32605:22"/>
ever and anon making him ſmell upon other Horſes dung, whereby he may empty himſelf the better.</p>
               <p>When you are come within a mile or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, of the ſtarting Poſt, you ſhall alight from the Horſes back, and take of his Body-cloth, and Breaſt-cloth; and then girt on the Saddle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, then ſending away your Groom both with thoſe clothes, and the clean dry rubbing clothes, let him ſtay at the laſt end of the race till you come. Then your ſelf rack your Horſe gently up to the ſtarting Poſt, and beyond: make your Horſe ſmell to that Poſt, as you ſhall alſo do at the firſt Poſt, which we call the weighing Poſt, that he may thereby take notice of the beginning and ending of his Courſe. And there ſtart your Horſe roundly and ſharply at near a three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpeed, and according to his ſtrength of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ability of wind, and chearfulneſs of ſpirit, run him the whole Courſe through. But by no means do any thing in extremity, and above his wind and ſtrength; but when you find him a little yield, then give him a little eaſe, ſo that all he doth, may be done with pleaſure, and not with anguiſh; for this manner of training will make him take delight in his labour, and ſo increaſe it, the contrary will breed diſcomfort, and make exerciſe irkſome.</p>
               <p>Alſo during the time that you thus courſe your Horſe, you ſhall with all carefulneſs note upon what grounds he runneth beſt; as whether upon the hill, whether on the ſmooth earth, or on the rough, whether on the wet, or on the dry, or whether on the level, or the earth that is ſomewhat riſing, and according as you find
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32605:23"/>

               <p>When you have thus courſed the courſe over ſtrongly and ſwiftly, and after a little ſleightly gallop him up and down the field, to rake his wind and chear his ſpirits, you ſhall then (your Groom being ready with your clothes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries) ride to ſome warm place, as under the covert of ſome hedge, buſhes or trees, into ſome hollow dry ditch, pit, or other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from the air, and there alight from his back, and firſt with a graſing knife, or ſcraping knife, as ſome call it, made either of ſome broken Sword blade, ſome old broken Sythe, or for want of them, a thin piece of old hard Oaken wood, faſhioned like a broad long knife with a ſharp edg: And uſing this with both your hands, ſcrape off all the ſweat from your horſe in every part of him, whereſoever you find any wet: And thus do till you find there will no more ſweat ariſe, and ever and a non move and ſtir the Horſe up and down, and then with dry clothes rub the Horſe all over exceedingly. Then take off the Saddle, and having glaſſed, ſcraped and rubbed his back, put on his body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and his breſt-cloth, and then ſet on the Saddle again and girt it; then gallop the Horſe gently forth, and again a little ſpace ever and a non rubbing his head, neck, and body, as you ſit on his back; then walk him about the Fields and Downs to cool him, and when you find that he drieth a pace, then rack him gently home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſometimes racking and ſometimes gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But by no means bring him to the Stable, till you find he have not one wet hair about him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32605:23"/>
when you have brought him to the Stable-door dry, there diſmount, and having enticed him to piſs and empty himſelf, then lead him into his ſtall, and there tye his head gently up to the Rack with his Bridle; which done, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as having prepared it before, give the Horſe this Scowring following, and made in this manner.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as you have given the Horſe this Scowring, preſently let your Groom fall to rubbing of his Legs, and do your ſelfe take off his Saddle and clothes, and finding his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dry, run ſlightly over it with your Curry-Comb, after with the bruſh. Then duſt well, and laſtly, rub all his body over exceedingly well with dry clothes, eſpecially his head, nape of the neck, and about his heart; then clothe him up warm, as at his other ordinary times, and wiſp him round with great warm wiſps, and if you throw over him a little looſe blanket, it will not be amiſs in theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary times, eſpecially if the ſeaſon be cold.</p>
               <p>Your Horſe muſt faſt full two hours after the receipt of his Scowring, but yet depart not your ſelf, or your Groom out of the Stable, but ſtay and keep the Horſe ſtirring and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, partly by extraordinary noiſe and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and partly by action about him, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him move up and down, as he ſtandeth. There is nothing more hurtful to the Horſe, or working of the Medicine, than ſleep, ſtilneſs, and reſt, and nothing better or more available to the working of the Medicine, than action and motion, for they make the ſpirits lively, and ſtir up thoſe humours which ſhould be removed, when reſt keeps the ſpirits dull, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ſo incloſed and reſerved, that nature hath nothing to work upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:32605:24"/>After your horſe hath faſted upon his bridle two hours, or more, then you ſhall take an handful of Wheat-ears, being your pollard, that is, without rough beards, and coming to the Horſe, firſt handle the roots of his ears, then put your hands under his clothes againſt his heart, upon his Fillets, Flanks, and on the neather part of his Thighs, and if you find any new ſweat to ariſe, or any coldneſs of ſweat, or if you ſee his body beat, or his breath move faſt, then forbear to give him any thing, for it is a pregnant ſign, that there is much foulneſs ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, on which the Medicine working with a conquering quality, the Horſe is brought to a little heart-ſickneſs. Therefore in this caſe you ſhall only take off his bridle, and put on his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, then toſs up his litter that he may lye down, and then abſent your ſelf (having made the Stable dark and ſtill) for two hours more at the leaſt, which is the utmoſt end of that ſickneſs:</p>
               <p>But if you find no ſuch offence, then you ſhall proffer him the ears of wheat by three or four together, and if he eat this handful, then give him another.</p>
               <p>After he hath eaten the Wheat-ears, you ſhall then give him a little bundle of Hay, ſuch as hath been before declared, and draw his Bridle, rubbing his head well.</p>
               <p>An hour or better after he hath had his Hay, you ſhall ſift him a quart of the beſt Oats, and to them you ſhall put two or three handfuls of ſpelted Beans, which you ſhall cauſe to be reed and dreſſed, ſo clean as poſſible, from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of huls, duſt, and filth whatſoever, ſo as there may be nothing but the clean ſpelted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32605:25"/>
Beans themſelves. To theſe Oats and beans you ſhall break two or three good thick ſhives of bread, clean chipt, and give all unto the Horſe, and ſo leave him to his reſt for near three hours or there abouts.</p>
               <p>At evening, before you dreſs your horſe, give him the like quantity of Oats, ſpelted beans and bread, and when he hath eaten them, then bridle him up and dreſs him, as before ſhewed; after he is dreſt, clothe him up, for you ſhall neither ſaddle him, nor ride him forth; for you ſhall underſtand that this evening after his heat, the Horſe being inwardly foul, and the Scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring yet working in his body, he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any water at all.</p>
               <p>After the Horſe is dreſt, and hath ſtood an hour and half upon his bridle, you ſhall then take three pints of clean ſifted Oats, and waſh them in ſtrong Ale or beer, and ſo give them to the Horſe; for this will inwardly cool and refreſh him, as if he had drunk water.</p>
               <p>After he hath eaten all his waſht meat, and reſted upon it a little ſpace, you ſhall then at his feeding times, which have been ſpoken of before, with Oats and ſpelt beans, or Oats and bread, or all together, or each ſeveral and ſimple of it ſelf (as you ſhall find the ſtomack of the Horſe beſt addicted to receive it) feed him that night in plentiful manner, and leave a Know of hay in the Rack when you go to your bed.</p>
               <p>The next day, very early as may be; firſt feed, then dreſs, after clothe, ſaddle, then air him abroad, and water him, as hathe been before ſhewed: after bring him home and feed him

               <p>This day you ſhall cool the horſe, ſhoe the horſe, and do all extraordinary things of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament about him: Provided there be nothing to give him offence, or to hinder him in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any other material or beneficial action: for I have heard ſome horſemen ſay, that when they had ſhoed their horſe with light ſhoes, and done other actions of Ornament about them, the night before the courſe, that their horſe hath taken ſuch eſpecial notice thereof, that they have refuſed both to eat and lye down. But you muſt underſtand that thoſe horſes muſt be old, and long experienced in this exerciſe, or they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach at theſe ſubtile apprehenſions: for my part, touching the nice and ſtrait platting up of horſes tails in the manner of Sakers or Docks (which is now in general uſe) howſoever the ornament may appear great to the Eye, yet I do not much affect it, becauſe I know, if an ignorant hand have the workmanſhip thereof, he may many wayes give offence to the horſe, and in avoiding cumberſomneſs breed a great deale of more cumber; therefore I wiſh every one rather to avoid curioſity, which they call neceſſary Ornament, than by thoſe falſe graces to do injury to the horſe.</p>

Then lay a very white ſheet over the Saddle next his skin, and over it his ordinary clothes, then his body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and breaſt-cloth, and wiſp them round about with ſoft wiſps: then if you have a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpane or cloth of State for braverie's ſake, let it be faſtened above all: when this is done,

               <p>Alſo in your leading, if any white or thick foam or froth ariſe about the Horſes mouth, you ſhall with a clean handkerchief wipe it away, carrying a small bottle of clear water about you, waſh your Horſes mouth now and then therewith.</p>

               <p>To begin therefore with the firſt Principles of Election, you ſhall underſtand, that they are divided into two ſpecial heads: the one general, the other particular.</p>
               <p>The general Rule of Election, is firſt the end for which you buy, then his breed or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, his colour, his face and his ſtature: and theſe are ſaid to be general; becauſe the firſt, which is the end for which you buy, is a thing ſhut up onely in your own breaſt.</p>
               <p>The other which is his breed, you muſt either take it from faithful report, your own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, or from ſome known and certain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, by which one ſtrain or one Country is diſtinguiſhed from another: As the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> is known by his hook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Noſe, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by his ſmall Limbs, the <hi>Barbary</hi> by his fine Head, the <hi>Dutch</hi> by his rough Legs. the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by his general ſtrong knitting together, and ſo forth of divers others.</p>
               <p>As for his colour, although there is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour exempt utterly from goodneſs, for I have ſeen good of all, yet there are ſome better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted than others, as the Daple gray for beauty th Brown Bay for ſervice, the black ſilver-hair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:32605:30"/>
for courage, and the Lyard or true mixt Roan for countenance: as for the Sorrel, the black without white, and the unchangeable Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray, they are reputed cholerick; the bright bay, the flea-bitten, and the black with white marks, are Sanguiniſts; the blanke-white, the yellow dun, the kite glew'd, and the Pide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald, are Flegmatick; and the cheſnut, the mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun, the red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bay, and the blew-gray, are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
               <p>Now for his Pace, which is either Trot, Amble, Rack, or Gallop, you muſt re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er it to the end alſo for which you buy; as if it be for the Wars, Hunting, Running, or your own private diſpoſition, then the trot is moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. And this motion you ſhall know by a croſs moving of the Horſes Limbs, as when the far fore-Leg and the near hinder-Leg, or the near fore-Leg and the far hinder-Leg, move and go forward in one inſtant. And in this motion, the neater the Horſe taketh his Limbs from the ground, the opener, the evener, and the ſhorter he treadeth, the better his pace; for to take up his feet ſturnly ſhews ſtumbling and lameneſs, to tread narrow or croſs ſhews enterfering or falling: to ſtep uneven ſhews toil and wearineſs, to tread long ſhews over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Now if you elect for eaſe, great Perſons Seats or long Travel, then Amble is required, and this motion is contrary to trotting, for now both the feet on one ſide muſt move equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, that is, his far fore-Leg, and the far hinder-Leg, and this motion muſt go juſt, large, ſmooth and nimble; for to tread falſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32605:30"/>
takes away all eaſe, to tread ſhort rids no ground, to tread rough ſhews rolling, and to tread nimbly ſhews a falſe pace that never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth, as alſo lameneſs.</p>
               <p>If you elect for Buckhunting, for galloping on the High-way, for Poſt, Hackney, or the like then a Racking pace is required, and this motion is the ſame that Ambling is, only it is in a ſwifter time and ſhorter tread, and though it rid not ſo much ground, yet it is a little more eaſie.</p>
               <p>Now to all theſe parts muſt be joyned a gallop (which naturally every Trotting and Rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Horſe hath) the Ambler is a little unapt thereunto, becauſe the motions are both one, ſo that being put to a greater ſwiftneſs of pace, than naturally he hath been acquainted withal, he handles his legs confuſedly and out of order, but being tamed gently, and made to know and underſtand the motion, he will as well undertake it, as any Trotting Horſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Now in a good gallop, you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe vertues.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Horſe which taketh his feet nimbly from the ground, but doth not raiſe them high, that neither rolleth, nor beats him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that ſtretcheth out his fore-legs, follows nimbly with his hinder, and neither cutteth under the knee, (which we call the swift cut) nor croſſeth, nor claps one foot upon another, and ever leadeth with his far fore-foot, and not with the near.</p>
               <p>This Horſe is ſaid ever to gallop moſt comely, and moſt true, and is the fitteſt for ſpeed, or any other like imployment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:32605:31"/>If he gallop round, and raiſe his fore-feet, he is then ſaid to gallop ſtrongly, but not ſwiftly, and is fitteſt for the great Saddle, the Wars, and ſtrong encounters.</p>
               <p>If he gallop ſlow, yet ſure, he will ſerve for the high-way; but if he labour his feet confuſedly, and gallop painfully, then he is good for no gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping ſervice, beſides it ſhews ſome obſcure lameneſs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, touching his ſtature, it muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to your own judgment, and the end for which you buy him; ever obſerving, that the biggeſt and ſtrongeſt are fitteſt for ſtrong oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as great burthens, ſtrong draughts, and double carriage, the middle ſize for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and general employments, and the leaſt for eaſe, ſtreet-walks, and Summer-Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>Now touching the particular Rule of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is contained in the Diſcovery of natural deformities, accidental, outward or inward hidden miſchiefs, which are ſo many, are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, that it is a world of work to explain him; yet for ſatiſfaction ſake, I will, in as methodical manner as I can, briefly and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the beſt conceited opinions, ſhown or can be obſerved in this occaſion.</p>
               <p>firſt therefore, When an Horſe is brought unto you to buy, being ſatisfied for his breed his pace and colour, then ſee him ſtand naked before you, and placing your ſelf before his face, take a ſtrict view of his countenance, and the chearfulneſs thereof, for it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Glaſs wherein to ſee his goodneſs; <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> If his Ears be ſmall, thin, ſharp, pricked,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32605:31"/>
and moving, and if they be long, yet well ſet on, and well carried, it is a mark of beauty, goodneſs and metal; but if they be thick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laved, or lolling, wide ſet on, and unmoving, then are they ſigns of dulneſs, doggedneſs and ill nature.</p>
               <p>If his face be clean, his forehead ſwelling outward, the mark or feather in his face ſet high; as above his eyes, or at the top of his eyes, if he have a white ſtar, or a white rach of an indifferent ſize, and even placed, or a white ſnip on his Noſe, all are marks of beauty and goodneſs: but if his face be fat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cloudy or ſcouling, his fore-head flat as a trencher, which we call mare-ſaced, the mark in his forehe ad ſtand low, as under his eyes; if his ſtar or Rach ſtand awry or in an evil poſture, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſnip, his Noſe be raw and unhairy, or his face generally bald, all are ſigns of deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if his Eyes be round, bright, black, ſhining, ſtaring, or ſtarting from his head; if the black of the Eye fill the pit, or outward circumference, ſo that in the moving none (or very little) of the white appeareth, all are ſigns of beauty, goodneſs and meral; but if his eyes be uneven and of a wrinkled proportion; if they be little (which we call Pig-eyed) both are uncomely ſigns of weakneſs: if they be red and fiery, take heed of Moon-eyes, which is the next door to blindneſs; if white and walled, it ſhews a weak ſight, and unneceſſary ſtarting or finding of boggards; if with white ſpecks, take heed of the pearl, pin and web; if they water or ſhew bloudy, it ſhews bruiſes; and if they matter, they ſhew old over-riding and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32605:32"/>
feſtred Rheums, or violent ſtrains, If they look dead or dull, or all hollow and much ſunk, take heed of blindneſs, at the beſt the Beaſt is of an old decrepit Generation; if the black fill not the pit, but the white is alwayes appearing, or if in moving the white, the black be ſeen in equal quantity, it is a ſign of weakneſs and dogged diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>If handling of his Cheeks or Chaps, you find the bones lean and thin, the ſpace wide between them, the thropple or wind-pipe big as you can gripe, and the void place without knots or kernels; and generally, the jaws ſo open, that the neck ſeemeth to couch within them, they are all excellent ſigns of great wind, courage, and ſoundneſs of head and body; But if the chaps be fat and thick, the ſpace between them cloſed up with groſs ſubſtance, and the thropple little, all are ſigns of ſhort wind, and much inward foulneſs; if the void place be full of knots and kernels, take heed of the ſtrangle or glanders, at leaſt the Horſe is not without a foul cold.</p>
               <p>If his jaws be ſo ſtrait, that his neck ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth about them; if it be no more but natural, it is only an uncomely ſign of ſtrait wind, and purſineſs, or groſsneſs; but if the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be long and cloſe to his chaps like a whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, then take heed of the Uvies, or ſome other unnatural impoſthume.</p>
               <p>If his noſtrils be open, dry, wide and large, ſo as upon any ſtraining the very inward redneſs is diſcovered; and if his Muzzle be ſmall, his mouth deep; and his lips equally meeting, they are all good ſigns of wind, heat
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32605:32"/>
and courage; but if his noſtrils be ſtrait, his wind is little; if his Muzzle be groſs, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is dul; if his mouth be ſhallow, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carry a bit well; and if his upper lip will not reach his neather, old age or infirmity hath marked him for carrion; and if his noſe be moiſt and dropping, if it be clear water it is a cold, if foul matter then be ware the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, if both noſtrils run it is hurtful, but if one then moſt dangerous.</p>
               <p>Touching his teeth, and their vertues, they are at large ſet down in another Chapter touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Horſes age; only remember you never buy an Horſe that wanteth any, for as good loſe all as one.</p>
               <p>From his Head look down to his Breaſt, and look that it be broad, out-ſwelling, and adorned with many feathers, for that ſhews ſtrength and endurance: the little braeſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely, and ſhews weakneſs; the narrow breaſt is apt to ſtumble, fall and enterfere before; and the breaſt that is hidden inward, and wanteth the beauty and diviſion of many feathers, ſhews a weak-armed heart, and a breaſt that is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and unfit for any toyl or ſtrong la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Next look down from his Elbow to his Knee, and ſee that thoſe fore-things be ruſh-grown, well horned within, ſinewy fleſh, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſwelling, for they are good ſigns of ſtrength; the contrary ſhews weakneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>Then look on his knees, that they carry an equal and even proportion, be clean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſinewy, and cloſe knit, for they are good and comely;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32605:33"/>
if one be bigger and rounder than another, the Horſe hath received miſchief; if they be groſs, the Horſe is gouty; and if they have ſcars or hair broken, it is a true mark of a ſtumbling Jade, and a perpetual faller.</p>
               <p>From his knees look down his Legs to his Paſterns, and if you find his Legs clean, fat, and ſinewy, and the inward bougth of his knee without a ſeam, or hair broken, then he ſhews good ſhape and ſoundneſs; but if on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, there are excreſſions, if under his knee be Scabs on the inſide, it is the ſwift cut, and he will ill endure galloping; if above his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns on the inſide you find Scabs, it ſhews en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering. But if the Scabs be generally over his Legs, it is either extreme foul keeping, or a ſpice of the mangy; if his Legs be fat, round and fleſhy, he will never endure labour; if on the inward bougth of his knee you find ſeams, ſcabs, or hair broken, it ſhews a mallander, which is a cankerous ulcer.</p>
               <p>Look then on his Paſtern, the firſt muſt be clean and well knit together, the other muſt be ſhort, ſtrong, and upright ſtanding, for if the firſt be big or ſweld, take keed of the ſinew-ſtrains and gurding; if the other be long, weak, or bending, the limbs will hardly carry the Body without tiring.</p>
               <p>For the hoofs in general, they would be black, ſmooth, rough, rather a little long than round and hollow, and full ſounding, for a white hoof is tender, and carries a ſhoe ill; a rough, groſs, ſeamed hoof ſhews old age or over-beating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brittle hoofs will carry no ſhoe, an extraordinary round hoof is ill for foul
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32605:33"/>
wayes or deep hunting; a flat hoof that is pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed ſhews foundering, and an hoof that is empty and hollow-ſounding ſhews a decayed inward part, by reaſon of ſome wound or dry founder. As for the Crownet of the hoof, if the hair be ſmooth and cloſe, and the fleſh fat and even, all is perfect; but if the hair be ſtaring the ſkin ſcabbed, the fleſh riſing, then look for a ring-bone, a Crown-ſcab, or like miſchief.</p>
               <p>After this, ſtand by his ſide, and firſt look to the ſetting on of his head, and ſee that it ſtand neither too high nor too low, but in a direct line; and that his neck be ſmall at the ſeting on, and long growing deeper and deeper, till it come to the ſhoulders, with an high, ſtrong, and thin Creſt; and his Mane thin, long, ſoft, and ſomewhat curling, for theſe are beautiful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; where as to have the head ill ſet on, is the greateſt deformity, to have any bigneſs or ſwelling in the nape of the neck, ſhews the pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evil, or begining of a Fiſtula: to have a ſhort thick neck like a Bull, to have it falling at the withers, to have a low, a weak, a thick or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling creſt, ſhews want both of ſtrength and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and to have much hair on the Mane ſhews intolerable dulneſs, to have it too thin ſhews fury, and to have none, or too ſhed, ſhews the worm in the mane, the itch, or elſe mangies</p>
               <p>Look then to the chine of his back, that it be broad, even and ſtraight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his ribs well compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and bending outward, his fillets upright, ſtrong and ſhort, and not above four fingers between his laſt rib and his huckle-bone, let
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32605:34"/>
his body be well let down, yet hidden without his ribs, and let his ſtones be cloſe truſt up to his body, for all theſe are marks of good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Whereas to have his chine narrow, he will never carry a Saddle without wounding; and to have it bending or Saddle-backt, ſhews weakneſs; to have his ribs fat, there is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for wind; to have his fillets hanging long or weak he will never climb an hill well, nor carry burthen; and to have his belly clung up and gant, or his ſtones hanging down cloſe or ſide, they are both ſigns of ſickneſs, tenderneſs, or foundering in the body, and unaptneſs for labour. Then look upon his buttock, and ſee that it be round, full, plump and in an even level with his body; or if long, that it be well raiſed behind, and ſpread forth at the ſetting on of the tail, for theſe are come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and beautiful: the narrow pin-buttock, the Hog or Swine-rump, and the falling or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-buttock are full of deformity, and ſhew both an injury in nature, and that they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit nor becoming for Pad, Foot-cloth, or Pillow.</p>
               <p>Then look to his hinder thighs, or gaſcoyns, that they be well let down, even to the middle joynt, thick, brawny, full and ſwelling, for that is a great argument of ſtrength and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; where as the clean, lank, ſlender thigh, ſhews diſability and weakneſs. Then look upon the middle joynt behind, and ſee if it be nothing but skin and bone, veins and ſinews, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little bending then too ſtraight, then it is perfect as it ſhould be; but if it hath chaps or ſores in the inward bougth or bending, then it is a S<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>landar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:32605:34"/>If the joynt be ſwell'd generally all over, then he hath gotten a blow or bruiſe, if the ſwelling be particular, as in the plot or hollow part, or on the inſide, and the vein full and proud; if the ſwelling be ſhort, it is a blood-ſpaven, if hard, it is a bone-ſpaven, but if the ſwelling be juſt behind, below the knuckle, then it is a curb.</p>
               <p>Then look to his hinder legs, and if they be clean fat, and ſinewy, then all is well, but if they be fat, they will not endure labour; if they be ſwel'd, the greaſe is molten into them; if they be ſcabbed above the Paſterns, he hath the Scratches; if he have chaps under his Paſterns, he hath the Pains, and none of theſe but are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and noiſome.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the ſetting on of his tail, where there is a good buttock, there the tail can never ſtand ill, and where there is an ill buttock, there the tail can never ſtand well, for it ought to ſtand broad, high, flat, and a little touched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <head>Obſervations from the ſtate of the Horſes Body.</head>
                  <p>IT is good for our Keeper to obſerve, that the ſtrongeſt eſtate of body (which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the higheſt and fulleſt of fleſh, ſo it be good, hard, and without inward foulneſs) to be the beſt and ableſt for the performance of Wagers; yet he muſt herein take to himſelf two conſiderations; the one, the ſhape of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes body, the other, his inclination and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of feeding.</p>
                  <p>For the ſhape of Horſes bodies, there be ſome Horſes that be round, plump, and cloſe knit together; ſo that they will appear fat and well ſhaped, when they are lean and in poverty;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32605:38"/>
others are raw-boned, ſlender and looſe knit together, and will appear lean, deformed, and in poverty, when they are fat, foul, and full of groſs humors.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe their inclinations, ſome Horſes (as the firſt before named) will feed outwardly, and will carry a thick rib, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as clean as may be, and without all manner of foulneſs.</p>
                  <p>There be others (as the latter) that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear clean to the eyes, and ſhew nothing but skin and bone, when they are full of inward fatneſs, and have guts as full as may be. In this caſe the Keeper hath two helps to advantage his knowledg, the one outward, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>The outward help is the outward handling and feeling of the Horſes body, generally over all his ribs, but particularly upon his ſhort and hindmoſt ribs; if his fleſh generally handle ſoft and looſe, and your fingers ſink into it as into down; then is the Horſe foul without queſtion: But if generally it be hard and firm, only upon the hindmoſt rib it handleth ſoft and downy; then it is a pregnant ſign, there is greaſe and foul matter within the Horſe, which muſt be avoided, how lean or poor ſoever he appear in outward ſpeculation.</p>
                  <p>The inward help is only ſharp exerciſe and ſtrong ſcowrings, the firſt will diſſolve and melt the foulneſs, the latter will bring it away in abundance.</p>
                  <p>If your Horſe be fat and thick, and as it were cloſed up between the chaps, or if his jaws handle fleſhy and full, it is a ſign of much
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32605:39"/>
foulneſs both in the head and body; but if he handle thin, clean, and only with ſome lumps or ſmall kernels within his chaps, then it is only a ſign of ſome cold or poze newly taken.</p>

            <p>I Would have your Keeper of theſe ordinary Horſes, to riſe early in the morning, by the ſpring of day, or before. according to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, and to ſift the Horſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of near three pints of good old dry Oats, and to put to them an handfull or two of ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beans, Hulls and all, and ſo give them to the Horſe.</p>
            <p>After he hath eaten them, let him dreſs him according to the order of good Horſemanſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:32605:57"/>Firſt, curry with the Comb, then duſt, then curry with the Bruſh, then duſt, then rub with wet Hands, after with a clean Woollen cloth, after with a clean Linnen cloth, then pick all obſcure places; Laſtly, comb down the Main, and Tail. Then ſaddle him, and ride him forth to water. then warm him both before and after very moderately. ſo bring him home dry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſweat.</p>
            <p>Then cloth him up after you have rubbed his head, body, and legs, and let him ſtand on his Bridle more then an hour, then give him the former quantity of Provender, and the ſame in kind.</p>
            <p>After he hath eaten his Provender, give him into his Rack a pretty bundle of Hay, and ſo let him reſt till after dinner.</p>
            <p>When you have din'd, give him the former quantity of Provender, and the ſame in kind, and ſo let him reſt till the evening; only renew his Hay, if there be occaſion.</p>
            <p>At evening dreſs him well, as in the morning, then ride him forth to water, and do as you did in the morning.</p>
            <p>When you come home, and have clothed him up, let him ſtand on his Bridle as before; then give him the former quantity of Provender, and ſo let him reſt till nine of the Clock at night; at which time give him the former quantity of Provender, and a pretty bundle of Hay, and ſo let him reſt till the morning.</p>
            <p>This you ſhall do concerning his Ordinary keeping at home, where the Horſe hath reſt, and that you may dispoſe of hours as you pleaſe;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32605:57"/>
but if you be either in Travel, or Sport, or other occaſion, ſo that you cannot obſerve theſe particular times, then you muſt divide the main and whole quantity of Meat, into fewer parts and greater quantities, and give them at the beſt conveniency; ever obſerving to give the leaſt quantity before Travel, as a 3 part before Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the two other after you come to reſt.</p>
            <p>Nor would I have you to diſtract your mind with any doubt or amazement, becauſe I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe you five ſeveral times of Feeding in one day, as if it ſhould either over-charge you, or over-feed your Horſe: Queſtionleſs there is no ſuch matter, when you look into the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; for it cannot be denied, but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is worthy of a good Horſe, or good Means to keep a good Horſe, cannot allow him leſs than one Peck a day; nay the <hi>Carrier, Caerter, Poulter</hi> and <hi>Packhorſe</hi> will allow half a peck at a Watering, and this allowance which I ſet down comes to no more; for 15 pints of Oats, and one pinte of Spelt-Beans up-heaped, make two gallons, and that is one peck of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> meaſure. Now to give it at twice, fills the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack more, makes the digeſtion worſe, and the appetite weak; whereas to give leſs, but more often, the ſtomack is ever craving, the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion always ready, and the appetite never wanting: ſo that health (without diſorder) can never be a ſtranger.</p>
            <p>Therefore once again, thus much for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry keeping.</p>
            <p>But if you intend to give an Heat, as to Hunt, Gallop, Travel, or the like, which I would wiſh you do once, twice, or thrice a week; Then
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32605:58"/>
obſerve all your former obſervations; only the night before give him little or no Hay at all.</p>
            <p>In the morning early before his Heat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his dreſſing, give him three or four hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of clean ſifted Oats, waſht either in ſtrong Ale or Beer; Then dreſs him, Saddle him, and give him his Heat.</p>
            <p>But if it be ſudden and violent, then let it be when the Horſe hath emptied himſelf very well.</p>
            <p>After his heat Rub him very well, and bring him dry into the Stable.</p>
            <p>Then after he is Clothed up warm, let him ſtand on his Bridle at leaſt two hours, then give him a little bundle of Hay to tear out upon his bridle, and an hour after feed him as hath been before ſhewed: Only with the firſt Oats give him an handful or better of Hempſeed, well duſted and mixed.</p>
            <p>At night warm him a little water, and give him it luke-warm, then an hour after give him his Provender, and a pretty bundle of Hay, and ſo let him reſt till the next Morning.</p>
            <p>The next Norning do all things as in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary keeping.</p>
            <p>Let him ſtand on Litter both night and day; yet change it often, and keep the Planches clean.</p>
            <p>If you intend to Travel or Journy in the Morning, then give no Hay, or but little the Night before, If you Journy in the Afternoon, then give no Hay, or but little in the Morning.</p>
            <p>In Journeying ride moderately the firſt hour or two, but after according to your occaſions. Water before you come to your Inn, if poſſible; but if you cannot, then give warm water in the Inn after the Horſe is fully cooled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:32605:58"/>Trotters Oyl is an excellent Oyntment being applied very warm, and well chafed in, to keep your Horſes limbs and ſinews nimble, and to help ſtiffneſs and lameneſs.</p>
            <p>Neither waſh your Horſe nor walk him; for the firſt endangereth foundering in the body or feet, and breedeth all ſurfeits; the latter is the ground of all ſtrong colds. which turn to Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Rottenneſs: but if neceſſity compel you to either, as foul wayes and long ſtays, then rather waſh your Horſes legs with pails of Water at your Stable-door, than to endanger him in any Pond or River.</p>
            <p>And for Walking, rather ſit on your Horſes back to keep his ſpirits ſtirring, than to lead him in hand, and with dull ſpirits to receive all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of miſchief.</p>
            <p>This I think ſufficient for clean and Ordinary keeping.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:32605:99"/>
you ſhall ſee the Vein yet plainer than you could when his Leg was tied up: If you cannot ſee the Vein plain enough when his Leg ſtands upon the ground, then heat but a little Water, and clap it on with your hand upon the Vein, and then you ſhall certainly ſee the Vein appear a great deal bigger, that you may let it blood, then when you ſee the blood is come into the Plait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vein, and that the Vein is plain enough to ſee and feel, tie up his lame Leg again, and let him blood in the Plait-vein, on that ſide the bottom of his Cheſt his lame Leg is on: Let him bleed a quart or two, or more, the greater the lameneſs is, the more let him bleed: after he hath bled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quart upon the ground, preſently put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bowl a good handful of Salt, and let him bleed a quart or more into that Salt: you muſt ſtir the Salt and blood altogether, all the vvhile he bleeds into the bovvl, becauſe it may not clot, then ſet the Blood and Salt by, and ſtop the Plait-veine vvith a piece of Lead, that may nip the mouth of the Vein together again that it may not bleed: You muſt have in a readineſs an ounce, or an ounce and a half of the Oyl of Turpentine, and as much ſtrong Beer, put them both into a Glaſs Vial, and ſhake them vvell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: When you have thus ſhaked the Oyl and Beer together, bathe it vvell in vvith your hand about his Breaſt, and all his Shoulder over, and the bottom of his Breaſt, betvveen his Legs, and half vvay dovvn to his knees; bathe it and clap it vvell in vvith your hand, preſently after take the Blood and Salt, and bathe and clap that upon the former; then ſet him up into the Stable to meat, and vvith a Liſt or Garter, tye both his Fore-legs

The next day untie his Fore-legs, take him out and walk him, and if you ſee he go any thing well, take his back and ride him gently a Mile, and ſet him up again, and tie his Fore-feet again, as cloſe as you did before; If he go not well the firſt day, do but walk him the ſecond day, and not ride him; and the third day after his firſt dreſſing, do not only tie his Legs, but flat a ſtick on both ſides in the faſhion of a wedge, about the breadth of a ſixpence, take it and drive it in between the Toes of his Shooes, and the Toe of his Foot faſt, ſo that it may not come out, and alwaies whilſt he ſtands ſtill in the Stable, tie his Legs cloſe, and peg him with a Wedge, and when you walk or ride him abroad, untie his Legs and take out the Wedge: do this every night and day till he grow ſound, which will be vvithin two or three daies, if it be a Strain nevvly taken: To let blood once, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it once vvith the Oyl of Turpentine and Beer, and once vvith the blood and ſalt, is enough vvith the help of tying his Legs together, and driving in a vvooden Wedge as you vvere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed: For a vvrench in the Shoulder, or vvhen a Horſe hath pulled his Shoulder out of his place, and the Shoulder is faln the breadth of a mans hand or more, or if he be ſplayed on the Shoulder, do nothing contrary to vvhat you vvere directed before in this Receipt, either for matter or manner; for if it be but lately done, it is as ſpeedy a Cure for the one as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
