            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let all laid together pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with you to make you as the more carefull to affect and embrace all good meanes of helpe and furtherance therein; so the more forward and diligent from time to time instantly and incessantly to craue further grace at his hands, by whose strength we all stand; who as he hath begun this his gratious worke in you, so is alone able to finish it (and I doubt not but he will so doe) to his owne glory in you, and your eternall glory with him. And to this purpose may this loose discourse afford you any the least helpe, I shall esteeme it a sufficient recompence of my labour in the publishing of it, what euer the issue be otherwise: If any other beside shall reape benefit thereby, I desire but that God may haue the praise of it, and my selfe onely their prayers. Howsoeuer it proue, it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a testimonie of the sincere loue and respect that he beareth and oweth to you and the house you come of, who both is and shall by Gods grace alwayes continue</p>

               <hi>One whose words went in those dayes for Oracles.</hi> But yet had <hi>Dauid</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor beyond and aboue all these, to wit, the voice of God himselfe in his word: This had a negatiue voice in all <hi>Dauids</hi> consultations; so that though the matter propounded seemed good in his owne

eyes, yea and had the approbation of his learned Councell withall, yet if this his head Counsellor went not with it, it was not for <hi>Dauid</hi> to deale with. And this Counsellor so long as <hi>Dauid</hi> hearkned vnto (for sometime to his owne woe he ouer-shot himselfe by neglecting it; but for the most part he did so) so long he did well, and thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and found comfort, and had prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in whatsoeuer he went about. And the like must we doe, if we desire to fare as he did; make Gods word our Counsellour, if we would haue it our comforter: doe as worldly-wise and warie men are wont to doe; they will doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counsell; If they dwell neere to a Lawyer, whom they may freely repaire and haue accesse to vpon euery occasion, and of whom they may haue counsell, and cost them nothing, as oft as they will, they will be sure to doe nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the least matter of doubt or suspition of danger may be, without his aduice.

them. There is none but would haue comfort from it: and there is none almost willing to take counsell of it. We like all well to haue a Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it; but we haue no lust to make a Counsellor of it. But as <hi>Dauid,</hi> and Gods Spirit by <hi>Dauid</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth these two together: so <note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 19. 6.</note> we must not disioyne or seuer them the one from the other; or if we doe, we shall but delude our selues with vaine hopes.

            <p>It is that that would fit vs for the publike mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, and make it the more effectuall with vs: As on the other side <note n="y" place="margin">Logatur Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Lazaro &amp; Diuite, homil. 3.</note> it is well obserued, that the want of such priuate imployments maketh the publike ministerie altogether vnprofitable with many; <note n="z" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 7.</note> who heare much, and are at many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but gaine little by any, because they are not carefull heereby, either to prepare their hearts before-hand, to receiue the seede of the word as into ground fitted for it, or to water and cherish what they haue taken in on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, by a constant course of religious offices in the weeke following.</p>
            <p>§. 76. Nor let any man alledge heere in way of excuse for himselfe, that for the workes of his calling, they are so many, so manifold, hee cannot possibly finde any spare time to spend thus in religious imployments.

Yea (that which is a foule shame to consider) those that will pretend such straites of time to shift off such imployments, can finde many of them time enough (if not more then enough) to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their vaine and idle disports.

            <p>To conclude, if wee will watch aright and as wee ought; as the workes of our speciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings must not be neglected, so our spirituall good, and those meanes either publike or priuate that tend directly to the nourishing and improuing of it, are to bee principally regarded: And therefore so are we to ply and follow the one, that yet euen amids them we take time for, and <note n="*" place="margin">Sicut laboranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus manibus nec ocu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
