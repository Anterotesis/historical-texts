            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Compulſion of Conſcience Condemned, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere are a ſort of Fierce and ill Natur'd <hi>Paſquillers,</hi> that keep a Bawling at all works of this Nature, though the Deſign be never ſo Innocent; The Dread of thoſe, ſhan't Terrifie me from preſenting theſe few Sheets to the Publick, Premiſing the true State of the Caſe by me aſſerted, <hi>viz. That the Mind and Conſcience of Man, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Divine Truths, ought not to be Compell'd by outward Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and therefore that it is unreaſonable and unſeaſonable to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute ſo many of his Majeſties</hi> Proteſtant-Subjects, <hi>meerly for their</hi> Nonconformity, <hi>to Jayls, Fines, Baniſhment, and to the Spoiling and taking away their Goods,</hi> &amp;c. the Demonſtration of which ſhall be clearly and briefly offered with all Humillity. It is no ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Grief of the Afflicted, that when they propoſe their Humble Complaints, and produce their modeſt reaſons againſt theſe kind of Severities, they are preſently aſſaulted with a new kind of Perſecution, by a parcel of cruel and unmerciful Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leters, who make it no leſs then an Arraignment of the State, and a Murmuring againſt the Government: In Return to which uncharitable Calumny I offer a few conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis an eaſy thing for thoſe Maſters of the Faculty to Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the Government with aggravated <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> and overſtretch'd <hi>Paraphraſes;</hi> 'Tis the very Nature of miſery to complain, and I never knew that the Perſon complained to (if of a Noble and Heroick mind,) Interpreted the Petitioners Requeſt at this Rate. The Poor Beggars crying for Relief, is no Arraignment of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Charity. The Subjects Complaint of Grievance is no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his Princes Juſtice. Our moſt Importunate Prayers to Almighty God, are no Arraignment of Infinite Meroy; no more are the Diſſenters applications to a Prince of ſuch Clemency as his Majeſty is, juſtly to be ſo repreſented, neither does he in his Royal Judgment ſo eſteem it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99083:3"/>
               <hi>2. It is Univerſally known that our Gracious King (whom God long Preſerve) is a Prince of ſuch Natural Clemency, and of ſo merciful a diſpoſition, that he is much more apt to Pardon the Delinquent, then oppreſs the Innocent, and therefore his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects are very well ſatisfied in his Royal Expreſſions in a Proclamation Dated</hi> April <hi>8. 1681,</hi> viz. We will both in and out of Parliament uſe our utmoſt endeavour to extirpate <hi>Popery,</hi> and to redreſs all the Grievances of our Good Subjects, and in all things Govern according to the Laws of the Kingdom. <hi>The Pious Temper of our moſt Illuſtrious Soveraign is Remarkable, in a Speech to both Houſes,</hi> Monday Feb. <hi>10. 1667. where he ſays,</hi> One thing more I hold my ſelf obliged to recommend unto you at this preſent; which is, that you would ſeriouſly think of ſome Courſe to beget a better <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Compoſure in the minds of my <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi> in matters of Religion, whereby they may be Induced, not only to ſubmit quietly to the Government, but alſo chearfully give their Aſſiſtance to the ſupport of it.</p>
            <p>This evidently demonſtrates that his Majeſty conſiders that Chriſtianity is full of Mercy, and that Chriſt the Glorious Author of it, is a Reconciler and Mediator, and therefore would have his Subjects diſputed, or Preach'd into Church, not Worry'd, Jayl'd, Plunder'd, and Church curs'd into Conformity.</p>
            <p>I cannot leave this Royal-Text, till I have noted, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his Majeſty expreſſes the ends of this Compoſure and Union, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A quiet Submiſſion to the Government, and 2. a chearful aſſiſtance to ſupport it; No Subjects of equal Quality have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the Diſſenters in either of theſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to matter of Fact, no Treaſons, Rebellions, or Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (no not a Shaddow of any ſuch things) can be juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon them, ſince his Majeſties Happy Reſtauration. All the Spys and Eagle-Ey'd Obſervators that have been Imploy'd to watch them, can't produce ſo much as a probable Circumſtance of any Conſpiracy amongſt them againſt the Government, and to be ſure, had there been any ſuch thing, the Nation e're this would have Ring'd of it. Some few half-penny Scriblers rant at 'um, and in Spight of the Act of <hi>Oblivion,</hi> Revive what the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority commands to be forgotten; But of that and the Single Freak of <hi>Venner,</hi> more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99083:3"/>
2. As to the Probability of the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That any ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy ſhould be Contrived by <hi>Diſſenting-Proteſtants,</hi> the Perſons that ſo think, muſt ſuppoſe them meer. Fools and Mad-men: For as things ſtand, they muſt firſt forfeit their Reaſon, before they can abandon their Allegiance. They are not ſo ſilly, whatſoever others think of them, but that they very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand they hold their Lives, as well as their Religion by no other Tenure then his Majeſties Life. And therefore it is their great concern, as they tender all that's dear and near to them, to preſerve his Perſon and Government, and Defend both with their Lives and Fortunes. And I am confident that the whole Party of the Diſſenters, (though in ſome little things differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from each other) would Univerſally and Uniformly agree, to Sacrafice their All in his Majeſties Service, againſt any power whatſoever that ſhould oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>The Univerſal experience of unbyaſs'd Mankind can Witneſs the Truth of what is here ſaid. Yet I know very well, what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections have been and will be made from that diſmal Topick of the Nations late Unhappy Convulſions. But that muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Diſtinct head.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, It is certain that (theſe <hi>Proteſtant-Subjects</hi> his Majeſty intends, namely) the Diſſenters have chearfully given their Aſſiſtance to the ſupport of the Government. It is well known that they are an Induſtrious Trading People, that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly pay whatſoever Taxes the Law requires. And it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that no People ever expreſt a greater Zeal to oppoſe the various attaques of a Forreign (Anti-Spiritual Power) then theſe Diſſenters: And could I know any one of them that would ſhrink from his Princes Service, when his Royal Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are menaced, I would eſteem him not only a Fool, but a Traytor to boot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Evidence (further) the Lenity of his Majeſty, I ſhall quote a Memorable paſſage in his Declaration from</hi> Breda, <hi>Dated</hi> April <hi>14. 1660.</hi> We do declare a Liberty to Tender Conſciences; and that no man ſhall be diſquieted or called in queſtion for differences of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in matters of Religion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom; And that we ſhall be ready to Conſent to ſuch an Act of Parliament, as upon mature Deliberation ſhall be offered to us for the full Granting that Indulgence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99083:4"/>
What can be more Pious and Conſonant to the Rules of the Goſpel, then what this Great Monarch here declares? No Perſon is excepted from his Royal-Indulgence, but ſuch as diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom. Now if there be any ſuch among the Diſſenters, let them be ſeverely Puniſhed: But if there be none, I cannot but wonder at the Cruelty and undutifulneſs of ſuch as Proſecute their Peaceable and Innocent <hi>Fellow-Subjects</hi> againſt the mind of their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty has not only declared this (ſo Favourable) Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but alſo by his own experience declares the unfruitfulneſs of Compulſion,</hi> March <hi>15</hi>th. <hi>1671. In theſe words,</hi> Our Care and endeavours for the Preſervation of the Rights and Intereſts of the Church, have been ſufficiently Manifeſted to the World, by the whole Courſe of our Government, ſince our Happy Reſtauration, and by the many frequent ways of <hi>Coercion</hi> that we have uſed for the reducing all erring or Diſſenting Perſons, and for Compoſing the unhappy Differences in matters of Religion which we found among our Subjects upon our Return: But it being Evident by the ſad Experience of Twelve years, that there is very little Fruit of all thoſe Forceable Courſes, we think our Self obliged to make uſe of that Supream Power in Eccleſiaſtical matters, which is not only Inherent in us, but hath been declared and Recognized to be ſo by ſeveral Statutes and Acts of Parliament, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Auguſt <hi>part of the Legiſlative power, the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Reſolved</hi> Janu. <hi>10. 1680,</hi> That it is the opinion of this Houſe, that the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the Penal-Laws, is at this time Grievous to the Subject, a Weakening the Proteſtant Intereſt, an Incouragement to <hi>Popery,</hi> and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, there was a Bill paſt both Houſes at the laſt Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for the Repeal of the 35 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but through ſome unhappy neglect it was not preſented to his Majeſty, who doubtleſs would have paſt it. Nevertheleſs by that and what's mentioned before, we may clearly infer that the King and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, judge that Compulſion of Conſcience (of Peaceable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters) is both unſeaſonable and unprofitable. And if I have the whole Legiſlative Authority on my ſide, <hi>viz. King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> (that is all <hi>England)</hi> I may modeſtly preſume, that no Proteſtant will be angry at this Eſſay, nor cenſure it of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99083:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Arrogance; it being ſo conformable to the Sentiments of the moſt Illuſtrious in the Nation: I muſt confeſs that there are Laws in force againſt the Diſſenters which we ſhall a little Diſcourſe of hereafter, and evidence plainly that the intention of the <hi>Legiſlators</hi> was to puniſh ſuch as they ſuppoſed would be Seditious or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Government, and they that ſtretch theſe Laws to deſtroy ſo many Innocent Peaceable Members of the Common-Wealth, do but Fight againſt God, and pervert the meaning of the Lawgivers; and can (at long run) expect no other Fruit of their officiouſneſs, then what is reap'd by ſuch as are unmerciful (to ſay no more) at the great and general Tribunal. Here you ſee thoſe very Laws repealed, in <hi>voto,</hi> by them that made it, and though that dots not diſanull them, yet let me tell you, that for ſome particular Juſtices of the Peace, meerly upon the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſort of Creatures called Informers, (whoſe Character in a few words I'le give you e're long) to Execute the utmoſt, yea, more then the utmoſt Severity of the Laws, againſt Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in defiance of the ſenſe of the Law-makers, who did undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly know what was beſt for us, is no leſs then to oppoſe a private Opinion to a publick Deliberation, and a private Spirit againſt a publick. But I'le proceed to my main buſineſs; and refer the Opinion (with a reſpect to this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of as Great. Stateſmen as <hi>England</hi> ever knew to another place.</p>

            <p>Thoſe Maximes that interfere with the Sacred Rules of the Goſpel, and threaten deſolation to Men for what they cannot help, are undoubtedly to be laid aſide in a Chriſtian Common-Wealth. And I queſtion not but that our Gracious King, when he thinks fit to meet his People in <hi>Parliament,</hi> will order a Regulation of theſe proceedings, ſuitable to his Beneign and merciful temper before expreſſed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I humby crave leave to offer a few gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſons againſt the preſent Proſecutions, which my Zeal for Truth and the management of Church-Wars (like Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) extort from me.</p>
            <p>It is notorious by Univerſal Experience that it is the perverſe Nature of Man, <hi>Niti in vetitum,</hi> to long (like <hi>Eve)</hi> for what is forbidden; A Malady derived by an uninterpreted ſucceſſion from our firſt Parents. Hence grew a neceſſity of Eſtabliſhing Laws and Civil Sanctions, the end of which are, to reſtrain and Puniſh Tranſgreſſors, who by the Intemperate Sallys of private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lich Ambition, Revenge, Luſt or other Vice, attempt or actually perpetrate any thing Injurious to their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
            <p>Theſe Laws are Calculated for the reſpective <hi>Meridians</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations and Governments, and Levell'd againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing vice of the place, <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae leges natae ſunt:</hi> The pravity of Mans Nature, cauſed a neceſſity of Laws, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers do of Phyſick. And as the Office of the <hi>later,</hi> is to preſerve the Health, and Cure the Diſeaſes of the Body; ſo the Office of the <hi>former</hi> is to preſerve the Body Politick. Neither of theſe are ſo limited, but that the private or publick Phyſick may be altered according as the Symptoms of the Diſeaſe direct the Application. And ſo we ſee that <hi>Parliaments</hi> (without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement to their Wiſdoms) <hi>Repeal</hi> Laws <hi>proper</hi> to the times they were Enacted in, and make New, as the Viciſſitudes of the Publick <hi>Pulſe</hi> ſtands in need of. The wiſeſt Men have changed Counſels and Reſolves upon Second thoughts: The very <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves, and <hi>General Councels</hi> have done it, though the <hi>former</hi> Arrogate to themſelves an Infallibility.</p>

No meer Man is ſo ſharp ſighted as certainly to foreſee what the Events and Revolutions of things to come may be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Divine Inſpiration. Therefore it is rather to be Eſteemed a prudential Skill, then an Arraignment of the Acts of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, when what was ſuitable to them, and improper for us, are repealed, and a more ſeaſonable remedy Applied, when the inconveniences of the <hi>former</hi> are diſcovered. I am certain that the beſt way to convince Proteſtant diſſenters, (and moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Dictates of Chriſtianity,) is to Win them by fair and Charitable Methods; and that thoſe Penalties the Law inflicts, ſhould at leaſt be relaxt, for Reaſons hereafter to be produced. Every conſidering Man muſt needs know that the Biaſs of Intereſt and Education are ſtrong Shackles to the Judgment, which Fetter it from yeilding to Demonſtrated Truth. That of Education is very hard to be over-maſter'd. We have had Deplorable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that Opinion meerly got by Education, is ſometimes as hard to be removed, (yea harder) then the Body from the Soul. It ſo Wheels and Intoxicates the Brain, that even amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> we Read of ſome Wiſe and Moderate Perſons, who would Die to maintain their ridiculous <hi>Alcaron.</hi>

Religion in many is really their humour, and a Darling Fancy paſſes with ſuch for Reaſon; and Faſhion is more prevailing then the beſt Arguments. O the Deplorable Eſtate of Chriſtianity: Men will now reject the moſt Sacred of Truths, if they can but find a <hi>Pique</hi> at the Meſſenger, as if the Raving Patient would ſpill the beſt of Cordials, becauſe not preſented in a Golden Spoon!</p>

            <p>NO Humane Authority, no not the very <hi>Popes</hi> (thoſe Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tooles) can deny but that <hi>the Word of God is the Rule of Faith,</hi> to which all that profeſs the Name of Chriſt ought to Conform. And as all the Children of God have an Equal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Teſtament of their Father, ſo no one amongſt them, has any Prerogative to Impoſe a force upon the Judgment of his Brother. One holds <hi>this,</hi> the other <hi>that,</hi> a third denys <hi>both,</hi> they Examine Scripture, Conſult the Originals, Examine the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of Antiquity; they ſincerely Pray for Illumination: What then? Why pray what Courſe will you take with your Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brother? All that you can ſay, can't remove him from his former perſwaſion: The beſt way is to pray for him, if any <hi>Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> courſe be taken in ſuch a Caſe, and if the fire brings no light with it to Demonſtrate the Truth of it, I profeſs I cannot but ſuſpect that the Coals are fetcht from below.</p>
            <p>He that reflects upon the difficulties that Encounter us in the way to Truth, <hi>for Strait is the Gate, and Narrow is the Way,</hi> and with all conſiders how ſhort ſighted the beſt of Men be, for <hi>here we ſee but in Part, and understand but in Part,</hi> will ſoon find that there is infinitely more Reaſon for Chriſtians mutually to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the ſupport and aſſiſtance, rather then ſtudy the Ruine and Deſtruction of each other.</p>
            <p>Since all have neither an equal Depth of <hi>Natural</hi> Judgment, nor the ſame Meaſure of <hi>Supernatural</hi> Illumination, but <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Bloweth how, and where it pleaſeth,</hi> we ought not to deſpiſe or Perſecute our <hi>Brother,</hi> for his Innocent and blameleſs miſtakes, leaſt we be found <hi>to fight againſt God,</hi> who is the free diſpoſer of his Gifts; we know <hi>the way of Man is not in himſelf,</hi> Jer. 10. 23. <hi>But his goings</hi> (or ſteps) <hi>are of the Lord,</hi> Pro. 20. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, did we bear a due Reſpect to God, we would be Content

to wait his leaſure, who has Ingaged himſelf by his Apoſtle, Phil. 3. 15. <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall Reveal even this unto you.</hi> Let us therefore entertain ſuch a one, (who proceeds in the ſimplicity of his heart,) with <hi>Milk,</hi> till he grow ſtronger to Digeſt <hi>Strong-Meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am much miſtaken, if <hi>Compulſion of Conſcience</hi> borders not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very Skirts of the Implicite Faith of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man is conſtrained to Swear, or profeſs, more then he is convinced of, proceeds from as Blind an aſſent, as can be match'd in the groſſeſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and of ſuch a convert no profeſſion has any great cauſe to boaſt. For common Reaſon tells us, that ſuch as are Proſelyted by violence, will continue ſuch no longer then the force laſts.</p>
            <p>Force is meer Puniſhment, and conſequently not Juſt, unleſs the offence be voluntary: But he that believes according to the evidence of his own Reaſon, is neceſſitated to that belief, and to compel him from it, is to drive him to Renounce the Eſſential part of Man, his Reaſon.</p>
            <p>I can't Imagine why we ſhould be commanded <hi>to try the Spirits,</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. <hi>And to prove all things.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>If there be not a Faculty in the Soul to judge for it ſelf.</hi> 'Tis a ſtrange Injunction when we are commanded to <hi>hold faſt that which we find to be beſt;</hi> if after our moſt ſerious and deliberate Election, we ſhall be whipt out of our Conſcience by Penaltys. To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe do we Preach poor Souls into juſt ſo much Liberty of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as may beget their torture, and not permit them to reſt where they find ſatisfaction? Either prohibit to ſearch at all, or leave us ſenſible of ſome benefit by teaching. To believe what ſeems untrue, ſeems to me Impoſſible; To profeſs what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve untrue, I am ſure is damnable.</p>
            <p>As 'tis certain, that whoſoever ſwerves from the Dictates of his own Conſcience, commits a grievous Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. So without Queſtion they that endeavour by Force or Artifice to draw any Man to profeſs or Act contrary to what his Soul believes, are as deeply guilty of the ſame Crime, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>When ye wound the weak Conſciences of your Brethren, ye Sin againſt Chriſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 8. 12. How dangerouſly then do they expoſe themſelves to the Juſt Indignation of God who drive others, (and fall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) into this Evil? &amp;c. How wilfully do they attempt to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

the Light of Nature, which Indiſpenſably obliges all Men to <hi>Deal with others, as they would be dealt with themſelves?</hi> This Light is placed by God in clear and candid Souls to Shine and guide them, but in black ones to condemn and burn them. I could heartily wiſh that all Men would take the Advice of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Let us not therefore Judge one another any more: But Judge this rather, that no man put a Stumbling-Block, or an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to fall, in his Brothers way.</hi> If this Bleſſed Counſel were but followed, what a happy Nation might ours be?</p>
            <p>Nothing hath cauſed more miſchief in the Church then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing new (and many) Articles of Faith, and the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Gods Worſhip by Ceremonys, which all acknowledge to be more for Ornament, then any Eſſential neceſſity. And had theſe Stumbling-Blocks been removed, 'tis certain that our too too deplorable diviſions would in a great meaſure vaniſh, but ſince there are, and muſt be Diviſions, let us pray to the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Souls to heal them. <hi>To Love one another</hi> is a command of the Almighty, which never was, nor never will be repealed. And O! how diſagreeable to that Sacred precept is it, to vex and trouble each other! How rare is it to ſee the very <hi>Brutes</hi> prey upon their kind! Yet we ſee mankind deſtroy mankind, not only deveſting themſelves of humanity, but with a more then Brutiſh cruelty, rage againſt their very Brethren. To break ſo evident a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to eſtabliſh that which is (more then) doubtful, is certainly contrary to Goſpel-Laws.</p>
            <p>A thing may be clear to one man that would fain impoſe it, but it may be doubtful to him on whom it is impoſed, which no Body can help. Muſt the doubtful Perſon be knockt o'the head therefore, or muſt we pick out the Eyes of all that cannot See as well as our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the point be clear in Scripture; why then ſay I, there is no neceſſity to make a new Law to Impoſe it; much leſs a new Article of Faith. If it be but deduc'd or infer'd; 'tis certain that what one thinks clearly deduced, another as Learned and able as he, may think not to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Mens underſtandings are as various as their Speech or Faces: And is it Juſt for one man to Quarrel with another, becauſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from him in either of theſe? or put him upon a Rack to ſtretch him to his own dimenſion, if not ſo tall as he? He that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99083:7"/>
thinks all Diſſenters either malieiouſly or wilfully Blind is (in my Judgment) defective in Charity. If theſe People Diſſent out of humour or Hypocriſie, every thinking Man will pronounce them abſolute Fools. For they that play the Hypocrites; do it either for Worldly ends, or vain glory. Now theſe Men, who are under the laſh of every Informer, and ſuffer ſo unmercifully; cannot be charg'd with Diſſenting for worldly ends, becauſe they may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves by Conformity, and by neceſſary conſequence their Nonconformity is out of pure Conſcience. Elſe (as was ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) they are ſtark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deots, and if ſo, the State has no need to fear them, and it would be a great diſparagement to ſo wiſe and Illuſtrious a Government to ſeem to fear ſuch a Company of ſuppoſed ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletons. But then on the other hand, if their Diſſent be really from the ſtrong and convinced perſwaſions of their minds, I would in all humility beſeech all, that have power to Execute the Laws againſt them, to conſider, that they are Chriſtians, their Bretheren and Countrymen, and that they would treat them as ſuch, in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to what our merciful Prince declared, as before, <hi>viz. To Puniſh only ſuch as are diſturbers of the Government.</hi> For my Pen ſhall never be an Advocate for any Perſon of that Character. If any ſhould think that theſe Men Diſſent out of <hi>vain Glory,</hi> he muſt ſtill ſuppoſe them worſe Fools then before; For who but a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would purchaſe the applauſe of a few Perſons (an Idle airey thing that will neither Feed nor Cloath him) at the dear rate of 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Month, 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Sermon, &amp;c. or a Priſon with all its tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting apurtenances? Is this a comfortable Bargain?</p>
            <p>Well then, ſuppoſing them weak Brethren, what ſhall we do with them? why the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> readily anſwers this queſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith receive ye, but not to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputations.</hi> Here is not one word of ſending him to Priſon; or Fining of him; No, No, they us'd to perſwade and convince; not compel men to Conformity. Neither did the ſtrong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Perſecute, but Cheriſh and Inſtruct his weak Brother. For,</p>
            <p>They very well knew that no man can be forced to believe, he may ('tis true) be compelled to ſay this or that, but not to believe it; the Dominion over the External part has no Rule over the Soul. And though a Man may be compell'd to diſſemble his thoughts, it is impoſſible that any outward force can change the opinion. The Soul of man is a thing ſo generous, that it is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99083:8"/>
rather perſwaded by mildneſs, then won upon by figorous and Coercive Methods. And the Nature of Chriſtianity, is really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted for ſuch procedures. If <hi>Compulſion of Conſcience</hi> had been thought by the Almighty, to be the beſt way of reducing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, our Lord Jeſus would have uſed it. He that had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the whole Heavenly Militia, (one of which in a Night Slew 185000 of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Hoſt) could with as much eaſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Great <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> as command a Fiſh to bring him the Tribute Money.</p>
            <p>He that has good Eyes, and has been taught to Read, will Read you a clear Printed Book, but if he be Blind, or having Eyes wants Light, or never learnt to Read, or if the Print be Blind, you may ſooner daſh out his Brains with a Club, then make him perform an Action he cannot.</p>
            <p>Faith is not to be driven like a Nail into the Head, or Heart, with a Hammer: For a Man cannot believe if he would, till the Gift be beſtowed upon him. And the Scripture is plain, when it tells us, <hi>that Faith is the Gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arguments are good Inducements, but force has no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Goſpel, much leſs a command. Pray peruſe theſe Texts, <hi>John</hi> 20. 31. 5. 39. 42 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. 'Tis an eaſy thing to pick out ones Eyes, but all the Art of Man cannot reſtore thoſe Eyes again, or make Eyes for one Born without them. Even ſo <hi>Compulſion</hi> can make a Man a Hypocrite, but all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity in the World cannot make him a true Convert.</p>
            <p>If Reaſon underſtands not what is declared, how can we by way of Deduction, or the beſt framed Syllogiſms yield to what we apprehend not to be Demonſtrative? All diſcourſe and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination ought to be of things Intelligible; The object of Faith is purely and eſſentially Divine, and the Soul cannot arrive at that (Beſt of) Learning, till the Spirit of God becomes the Tutor.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this (by way of digreſſion) I cannot but borrow a few excellent Notions of an Eminent Prelate now Living. <q>There is no giving way to Rational deduction and human Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations againſt Scripture, for then a cunning <hi>Sophiſter</hi> may lead men into many Errors. To go about to prove by Reaſon ſuch things as are above Reaſon, is wonderful: And to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of what we underſtand not, is a ſpice of madneſs. The Concluſions drawn from ſuch Diſcourſes are dangerous, yea,

The Divine Subſtance is not expreſſible by human Rhetorick, nor the moſt delicate Flouriſhes of an Artificial Pencil.</p>
            <p>That which Men call School-Divinity, has been perverted at ſuch a Rate, that it has prov'd a meer Plague to Chriſtianity. There you have new Queſtions, nice Diſtinctions, and intemperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions toſt up and down like Tennis Balls. And from thence proceed cruel Bickerings, and Theological Wars.</p>
            <p>The firſt Divinity-School was ſet up at <hi>Alexandria</hi> by <hi>Pantaenus,</hi> and from thence Sprung the Arrian-Hereſie, which like an ill weed ſoon over ran all Chriſtendom. In the Subtilty of theſe Schools Hereſie grew Refined, and with their School tricks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions and Evaſions, almoſt baſſled the plain and ſimple Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Primitive Doctors, converted from Heatheniſm, and well skil'd in <hi>Philoſophy, Antiquity, Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> Tranſlated theſe Sciences (falſly ſo called) into Chriſtianity, to Illuſtrate by their Indiſcreet Zeal, and Imbelliſh Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by Artificial Forms and Figures, but rather indeed defaced it. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>He that ſeriouſly and without prepoſſeſſion conſiders the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtian Doctrine, will conclude, that it muſt be taught by the Demonſtration of the Spirit and Power, and not by the School harangues of <hi>Sophiſtical Syllogiſms</hi> and <hi>Enthymoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſidering Men are wary, (and ſo they had need) of the Subtilties of ſuch as would pervert or deceive them, in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a matter as Religion is: Becauſe Hereſies appear not firſt in their own Natural Shape, but they complement you in Diſguiſe, <hi>Maſqueraded</hi> with ſpecious pretences; the Author of theſe Hereſies will preſs into their Service, this and that obſcure place of Scripture capable of various Interpretations. But (mark I pray) when they have once got Footing, by degrees they lay a ſide their Vizards, and march on Brazen Fac'd, (I mean bare-Fac'd.)</p>
            <p>Well, but as to <hi>Compulſion of Conſcience,</hi> ſince the affront is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Divine Majeſty, ſuppoſing the Diſſenter errs, methinks we ſhould leave God to vindicate his own cauſe: For what can
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99083:9"/>
be a greater diſparagement or more derogatory to the honour of the Godhead, then to think he wants the help of Man to defend him. Mark how <hi>Peter</hi> was rebuked by our Saviour for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off <hi>Malchus</hi> his Ear. Beſides, do but conſider the Methods uſed by the Redeemer of the World, in Conquering his Enemies, and you will find it was by Preaching and Suffering, and if his Diſciples wont follow ſo Illuſtrious an Example, they deſerve not to be called by his Name, nor be Dignified with the Title of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>In all well order'd Governments the Magiſtrate may and ought to puniſh Evil doers, but not Evil Believers, for God Reſerves that to himſelf, it is his Divine Perogative, for he only is the Heart ſearcher; and Man cannot poſſibly have a right Cognizance of the concealed or Evil thoughts of another; becauſe, for any thing he knows, <hi>The greateſt Profeſſor may be the greateſt Atheiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not Remember that Chriſtians ever took up Arms againſt their Governours in the Primitive times for propagating their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or to preſerve themſelves from Perſecution; And he that will do ſo, meerly upon that account, is either a Fool or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt: A Fool, becauſe he rejects the opportunity of gaining the Reward promiſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when Men Revile you and Perſecute you,</hi> &amp;c. Or an Atheiſt, becauſe he wont believe that God will be as good as his word. But to Return where I left, I may reckon that common ſaying among ſhallow Fancys, <hi>viz. That a Pigmy on a Gyants ſhoulders ſees more then the Gyant.</hi> The Queſtion is not of ſeeing more, but clear diſcerning. If both theſe ſee a Beaſt at a Miles diſtance, and contend whether it be a <hi>Horſe</hi> or an <hi>Oxe,</hi> the <hi>Pigmy</hi> on the <hi>Gyants</hi> Shoulder, is never the nearer diſcerning what it is, becauſe it depends more upon the ſharpneſs of Sight, then the height of his ſhoulders: ſo we have no poſſible aſſurance that the Doctrine delivered to us by man (if not revealed in Scripture) is abſolutely true, becauſe we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſured that 'tis poſſible for him, or any man to erre, yea in this very Doctrine. The Great <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (the wonder of his time for ſharpneſs of underſtanding, and great modeſty withal,) believed it abſolutely neceſſary that Infants ſhould Receive the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> and termed it a down-right <hi>Hereſie</hi> to affirm that there were any <hi>Antipodes.</hi> So <hi>Lanctantius</hi> a notable Wit, and a great Scholar.</p>

The moſt Eminent of the Evangelical Doctors grant that even general Councels have erred, and if anyman ſhould deny it, the thing may be eaſily Demonſtrated. Our Church Hiſtorys declare how often they have thwarted one another, in things (point blank) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory. At which we need not wonder, for they have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Infallibility; You'l ſay they are the Churches <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> What then? I know no promiſe in the whole Bible, that the Repreſentative ſhould be Infallible. 'Tis true <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church,</hi> but what's that to a General Councel which (by a modeſt Calculation) cannot amount to one part in 10000 of the Univerſal Church. But I need ſay no more, then that theſe (ſo called) general Councels have been <hi>ex diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro</hi> againſt each other, as before hinted.</p>
            <p>Parents are accountable to God for their commands, as well as the Children are for their Obedience, natural Parents are by meer Nature prompted to ſeek the Love of their Children: So ought Spiritual Parents who are Stiled <hi>Miniſters of God</hi> (who is Love) to demean themſelves towards their Spiritual Children. And conſequently is it not more ſuitable to this excellent <hi>Grace,</hi> and Parental Tenderneſs to lead the People into the Houſe of God, rather then to whip them in by fear? And to put on ſuch a habbit as will Invite them in, rather then fright them out? What wiſe and Loving Father would put on a winding Sheet to Fright his weak and ſimple Child?</p>
            <p>Man (ſays a Reverend Pen) is a very tickliſh Animal to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; he will not always be guided by Reaſon and Authority.

This is ſo high and ſharp a point of Religion, that you may break the Heart ſtrings of many in winding them up ſo high; and ſo you may crack all their Religion.</p>
            <p>I cannot in Conſcience when I Treat upon ſo ſerious a Theam, but Remark, that the Carriage of ſome Preachers has created a great diſlike of that Sacred Work, as 'tis managed by not a few, and ſo are themſelves the cauſers of that Diſſent, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt: too many Preach not Chriſt but themſelves; They take here and there a Sentence of Scripture, the ſhorter and more abſtruſe the better. Then to ſhew their Skill and Invention, they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99083:10"/>
Divide and Subdivide it into Generals and Particulars. Here you have the <hi>Quid,</hi> the <hi>Quale,</hi> the <hi>Quantum,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Quack-Salving</hi> Forms, which the People underſtand no more then they do <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine.</hi> Then they look into this or that quaint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and pick out a Sentence of a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> or Father, ſome nice Speculation or other, and Labour to Couch all in Elegant Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But what's the end of this? why certainly 'tis meerly to ſhew their Wit, Reading, or whatſoever elſe is excellent in them. But, Pray mark, how ſuch practiſes are Charactered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. the whole Chapter is worth Reading; and plainly demonſtrates that this kind of Preaching is not Apoſtolick, that is, that they Preach not in the Demonſtration of the Spirit, but in the Demonſtration of their Learning.</p>
            <p>Many of the Ancient Fathers (eſpecially the <hi>Greeks)</hi> have been ever Fond of Nicetys. Theſe, when Converted to Chriſtianity, Tranſplanted their Beloved Rhetorical Flowers of humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Chriſtian Gardens, which prov'd indeed Weeds. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience will be my Advocate, when I ſay that humane Nature is apter to give Nouriſhment and vigour to humane Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples then to ſuch as are Divine.</p>
            <p>Pray when did ever any Learned, Witty, Rhetorical Harangue, or cunning Syllogiſtical Diſcourſe convert the tenth part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> or St. <hi>Pauls Fooliſh Preaching,</hi> as he terms it? (tho 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Wiſdom of God to them that are Perfect.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How widely different is the manner of Preaching in the Apoſtles time from Philoſophical Arguing, and Rhetorical declaiming? the Preaching then, was either Catechiſtical Inſtructions, or Pious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, not tying themſelves to any form; but paſt from one matter to another, as the condition of the Hearers required, and not as the Preachers Fancy and Reading prompted him.</p>
            <p>'Tis Reported of the Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> that he Judged, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or acquitted Delinquents <hi>as beſt agreed with the Current of his Oration;</hi> So ſome now a days ſhape their Diſcourſe more to the Applauſe, then Edification of the Hearers. Such Sermons may be better termed Banquets for full wantons, then Inſtructions for ſuch as are almoſt Starved for want of Spiritual Food. It may nouriſh an Auditory of <hi>Camelions</hi> that Live by Air, but can never make ſound and Solid Chriſtians.</p>

The <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and ſuch as greedily Suck their unexamined Dictates, have ſet up an opinion, that none are fit to Preach but ſuch as have been Students in the Univerſity; Where if he hath Learnt a little to chop <hi>Logick,</hi> and produce ſome nice Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations from <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> &amp;c. or ſome <hi>Theological</hi> diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Aquinas, Peter Lombard,</hi> or the reſt of the diſtinction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, or a little gingling from the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> then, O! then, (but you muſt ſuppoſe him documented by the <hi>Guide to the Inferiour Clergy)</hi> he ſets up for a Spiritual Paſtor! the weightieſt Office in the world, becauſe Mens Souls, (their better part) is concern'd! 'tis very ſtrange that ſuch qualifications (common to Graceleſs as well as Gracious Schollars) ſhould render him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>rightly Dividing the word of Truth:</hi> For if you ſeriouſly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the whole New-Teſtament, you will not find one tittle of thoſe Sciences in the Goſpel; but you will ſee they are rather ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely arraigned, as Enemys to it; Becauſe they tend to <hi>vain Jangling, Strife, and Contention,</hi> not tending to that (which is the end of Preaching) the <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> of Souls, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (two Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Biſhops,) tells you the qualifications of Biſhops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <hi>viz. Gravity, Sobriety, Meekneſs, Diligence,</hi> &amp;c. Not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, Logick, Phyſick,</hi> &amp;c. Not the Study of <hi>Ariſtotle, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Cicero, Euclid, Scotus, Aquinas,</hi> &amp;c. And why? why there is very good Reaſon: For 'tis moſt evident that the greateſt part of Academical Learning is as uſeleſs to a Spiritual Paſtor, as the Art of <hi>Navigation</hi> is to a <hi>Phyſitian:</hi> The Apoſtle telling us in plain terms, that he deſired <hi>To know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified.</hi> There's the qualification with which whoſoever is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, may ſay with <hi>David, Come I will ſhew thee what the Lord hath done for my Soul.</hi> But without it all the Arts in the World can't make a Preacher, as the old verſe ſays.</p>

            <p>Chriſt may be better Preach'd by a Grave, Conſcientious Man, well verſed in the Scriptures, and the Myſterys of Faith, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bred in any Univerſity, nor skill'd in any Language but his Mother-Tongue, then by the Students of <hi>Ariſtotle, Scotus, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, &amp;c.

            <p>It is Remarkable, that no <hi>Greek, Italian,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand underſtood any Language beſides his <hi>Mother-Tongue,</hi> when the Goſpel firſt was Planted. And 'tis worth noteing, that the Apoſtles received the Gift of Tongues, becauſe they were to Preach to all Nations, but we find no infuſion of School-Learning by the Holy-Ghoſt, nor any more Gift of Tongues, when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was once ſpread over the World.</p>
            <p>This is further very Remarkable that no Man can produce an Example of any Nation that was ever Converted to Chriſtianity by <hi>Philoſophical</hi> or <hi>Rhetorical</hi> Preaching.</p>
            <p>I hope the Digreſſion will be excuſed, if I note the miſchief of Excurſions; For if ſuch be countenanced, we ſhall never have an end: becauſe the Itch Men have to ſhew their Learning, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this vain and unedifying Practice. Poſſibly the Preacher ſits in his Study all the week long, picking from this and that and 'tother quaint-Authour, a few Beautiful Flowers; well, what then? then he comes on the Preaching day (commonly called <hi>Sunday)</hi> with his Noſegay in his Hand <hi>(viz.</hi> his Notes pinn'd up in his Bible) to entertain Ladys and Courtiers. But what have you to ſay to that? I'le ſay nothing, but refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to the <hi>New-Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Before I proceed, give me leave (good <hi>Reader)</hi> to tell you, that by what I have here written, (partly from Perſons Eminent in our Church of <hi>England,</hi> and partly from my own experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation) I would not be underſtood to cry down humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a thing of no uſe; nor throw the leaſt diſparagement upon our Famous and Reverend Divines, for I honour them from my Heart, and know that amongſt the Ciergy of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (as Eſtabliſhed by Law,) there are as Eminent Men, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to all, not only for their Learning, but alſo for their Piety and Gracious Converſations, and their painful and Induſtrious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Service of our God, as any in the World: No, no, 'tis the Abuſe only I write againſt, and 'tis that alone I heartily wiſh were Reformed.</p>

The knowledge of the Original Languages in which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were Pennd is of very great neceſſity, that we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with that Sacred Book in its own <hi>Emphatical</hi> and <hi>Native I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diom,</hi> and that we may not be Impoſed upon by wrong Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But withal let me add (which no Learned Man I am ſure will blame me for, if unbyaſs'd) that we are to conſider the Bounds of <hi>Phyloſophy</hi> and Humane Literature: Theſe are to be exerciſed in the things that may be known by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon; But when they Travel beyond that Road, and muſt needs be defining things beyond their Sphear, they become extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and Saucy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was the Judgment of that Excellent and Learned Lord</hi> Picus <hi>Earl of</hi> Mirandula, <hi>in his Epiſtle to</hi> Aldus Manutius, <hi>a ſharp Schollar:</hi> Accinge te ad Philoſophiam, ſed hac Lege, ut Meminer is nullam eſſe Philoſophiam quae a Myſteriorum veritate nos abducat: Philoſophia veritatem quaerit, Theologia Invenit, Religio poſſidet. <hi>That is,</hi> Addreſs your ſelf ſo to the Study of Phyloſophy; <hi>that no</hi> Phyloſophy <hi>ſhould ſeduce you from the Truth of the Myſterys. (of Chriſtian Religion)</hi> Phyloſophy <hi>ſeeks Truth,</hi> Divinity <hi>finds it, (but)</hi> Religion <hi>poſſeſſes it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thing is good and proper in its place, as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Fire</hi> is uſeful in the Chimney, but it is miſchievous in the Houſe-Top. There, that which before would Warm you, or be Serviceable to Dreſs your Meat, will Burn you and your Meat too, unleſs you can quench it, or Run away from it. So Learning is good as an <hi>Hand-Maid, Hagar-like,</hi> But if it muſt needs be Miſtreſs, and Uſurp-Authority in the Family, if like Scoffing <hi>Iſhmael Geneſis</hi> 21. 9. <hi>Gallat.</hi> 4. 30. It will Mock at the Spirit, and the Simplicity of the Goſpel, let it be caſt out: For nothing Supream will endure to be Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val'd in his Authority. Perogative, eſpecially in Divine matters, is as tender as the Apple of ones Eye.</p>
            <p>There is no Sober and Impartial Divine, but will Grant, that it is the work of Faith, by the Aid of <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> to be Imployed in the Myſterys of Religion. From which conceſſion it is evident, that when any Man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to Teach us Divinity, by the meer Guidance of Nature, (call it Natural Phyloſophy, Univerſity Learning; or what you will,) but ſhews himſelf by ſuch an attempt as abſurd and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99083:12"/>
Nonſenſical, as if the Eye ſhould Incroach upon the Ear, and would pretend to Diſtinguiſh the various gradations of Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notes, or the quavers of a pleaſant Inſtrument, which it cannot ſo much Imitate, as the dulleſt Brute can Imitate the warblings of the Nightingale.</p>
            <p>If the Example and Practice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be worth Imitating, you will find that he made Choice of ſuch as were Deſpiſed and Unlearned. Why? Becauſe his Grace might ſo much the more be Magnyfied, and that the Honour due to His Soveraign Converting Power might not be Attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any Humane Faculty of Rhetorical Perſwaſion. He made Fiſhermen, a Tent-maker, and other Tradeſmen, Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Everlaſting Goſpel, and (as it were) Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors extraordinary of Heaven. They were not ſent to Learn the Facultys of <hi>Ariſtotle, Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Aquinas:</hi> No no; His Holy Spirit was the only Schoolmaſter. He could with as much eaſe Imploy the whole Univerſity of <hi>Athens,</hi> as thoſe Poor Men; but he did not, and why ſuch as are called by his Name ſhould deſpiſe his Grace when appearing in Perſons of that Quality he Choſe, is a meer diſconcurrence with the Sanctions of this Ever-Bleſſed <hi>Law-Giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not repreſent theſe things to Introduce a promiſcuous Liberty for all Perſons to turn Preachers that are Chriſtians, but to Reaſon People (if I could) our of extreams. For as on the one Hand I believe that meer Learning does not qualifie a Man to be a Preacher, ſo on the other ſide I am ſatisfied, that <hi>Grace</hi> without the gift of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance</hi> and <hi>a ſound Judgment</hi> accompanied with an Ability to <hi>Divide the word of Truth,</hi> ſuitable to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Hearers, does not qualifie any Man for a Publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Of both theſe I take the Church to be Judge, and am ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that without the Approbation of a Chriſtian Aſſembly, ſuch as preſume to take that Office upon them, where ſuch an Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be had, are none of Chriſts Meſſengers but their own, Becauſe we ſhall ſo have no order, but confuſion, which muſt not be Introduced into the Church of Chriſt, unleſs you will change the beſt of <hi>Governments,</hi> into the worſt of <hi>Anarchys.

It has been (and will be till reform'd) the Reproach of Chriſtianity, that <hi>Preachers</hi> have err'd on both Extreams, ſome talk Nonſenſe, ſome talk above common-Senſe. I have (ſaies one of our <hi>Prelates)</hi> ſeen ſome Learned Men call Children together, and ask them a few Queſtions; and then to begin a Profound Lecture, ſhaped according to his own large Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, at whom Boys and Men gaze at, as a prodigious Monſter of Learning: ſome ſaying as <hi>Feſtus</hi> to <hi>Paul, Much Learning hath made him Mad.</hi> Sure he knows not where he is, why, he is not in a Univerſity School of Divinity, but in an Aſſembly of weak and ſilly Youth, who underſtand his <hi>Engliſh,</hi> no more than <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He adds, If Men would mark the form and phraſe of the Goſpel, and what kind of Matter and Language the Divine Oracle uſed in Preaching, even to the Learned <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. and the beginning of the ſecond, it would Inform them what Language that is, that's Cloathed in ſuch Meretricious Attire, &amp;c. <hi>Haec Ille.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scope and Intention of this Digreſſion, is to ſhew how this Sacred Office of Preaching is abuſed, and of what Influence that Abuſe is to ſcare people away, who love to underſtand, and profit by what they hear; And ſo I ſhall conclude this <hi>Section</hi> in imitation of a late Ingenious <hi>Author</hi> (tho' not in his very words) That if there be not ſuch a parcel of things as call themſelves <hi>Preachers</hi> that Act thus; then no body is concern'd in this Character; but if there be, the Abuſe is worth looking after, in order to Reformation, if not Puniſhment, of ſo great a Spiritual Grievance.</p>

will give them Repentance, to the acknowledging of the Truth. <hi>ver. 26.</hi> And that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Captive by him at his Will.</p>
            <p>From this paſſage it is evident, that the Apoſtle forbids all rigorous Courſes, even towards <hi>Infidels;</hi> and that he expreſly ſets down the right Chriſtian Courſe of Convincing and Converting them, <hi>viz.</hi> By Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Meekneſs: And if Chriſtians will make uſe of Church Curſes, and Humane Laws, Enacted only againſt Seditious perſons, and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Government, to force Innocent Chriſtians that agree with themſelves, in the Eſſential Articles of Chriſtianity, to Diſputable Modes of Circumſtantial Ceremonies, confeſs'd by all to be of Humane Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; In my Opinion, they diſagree with this Bleſſed Man, who after he Teaches the Biſhop his Duty, adviſes him to leave the ſucceſs to God; But not a ſyllable of Jayling, Impriſoning, or Fining them.</p>

Pray mark, good Reader, what can be ſaid more Efficaciouſly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Chriſtians to Chriſtian forbearance, than ſo plain an Injunction to live peaceably with meer Heathens. You may ſee moreover, that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. He denies that even the Apoſtles themſelves have any Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over the Conſcience, but only Commiſſions to aſſiſt the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.—<hi>Not for that we have Dominion</hi> (ſaies he to the <hi>Corinthians) over your Faith, but are helpers of your Joy: For by Faith you ſtand.</hi> In this he exactly obſerves the Orders which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, <hi>Go and Teach,</hi> (not compel) <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that Houſe or City, ſhake off the Duſt of your Feet,</hi> as we find practiſed, <hi>Act,</hi> 13. 51. Mark, they are not commanded to trample upon them as Duſt under their Feet; the Planters of Chriſtian Religion had never any ſuch Commiſſion. If the people would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they did e'en let them alone, with only that harmleſs Teſtimony that they had done their Duty, and left them to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—O how wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different is this little Duſt-ſhaking, which neither Kill'd not Jayl'd any body, from the Thunder-claps of <hi>Popiſh Bulls, Interdicts, Smithfield Flames, Impriſonments, Fines?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Conſonant to this Principle of Meekneſs, our Saviour himſelf inſtructs his Diſciples. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 10. <hi>Be not call'd Rabbi,</hi> (that is, Impoſers in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Matters, or Lords over the Conſcience) <hi>For one is your Master, even Chriſt; and all ye are Brethren.</hi> From theſe Texts Reader, infer what you can rationally,—for it were but to light a Candle to the Sun, for me to go about to Illuſtrate them.</p>
            <p>I wonder what the Patient forbearing of the <hi>Tares</hi> means, and letting them grow together till the time of Harveſt, Ay, and along with the Wheat too, til the Spiritual Reaper comes,—unleſs it be a Chriſtian Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration. I cannot fix any other Senſe upon that <hi>Scripture Parable,</hi> but that we ought not to pluck up each other by the Roots, becauſe we are not alike,—for it may happen that ſome of the very Wheat may be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Corn-Weeders. Therefore 'tis certainly the ſafeſt and ſobereſt way to be quiet, and leave the management of the Spiritual Corn-Fields to the Lord of the Harveſt, till he Orders the contrary.</p>
            <p>That admirable Preſident of mildneſs towards the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> a Surly Inhoſpitable ſort of people, (that would not receive <hi>even Christ himſelf)</hi> is very Notable. The Diſciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John, would have Fire imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Commanded down from Heaven to Conſume them,</hi> as in the Days of <hi>Elias;</hi> but our Merciful God Rebuked their Zeal with this ſweet and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reply, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 55, 56. <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of: For</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99083:14"/>
               <hi>the Son of Man is not come to deſtroy Mens, Lives, but to ſave them.</hi> This one Example abundantly ſatisfies all Objections drawn from the Practice of <hi>Elias, Jehu,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>Old-Teſtament;</hi> For as they had an Expreſs Command from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God to warrant their Zeal, we have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Warrant from Chriſt to Command Meekneſs.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhall ſhuffle in a <hi>ſuſpition</hi> that this moderate temper was meant only for the Times of Perſecution, when the Chriſtians had no <hi>temporal power;</hi> let him firſt confeſs that theſe were the beſt and pureſt Times, and then ſhew a <hi>Warrant Dormant</hi> under our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s hand (that is in his <hi>Goſpel)</hi> to Commiſſionate his Diſciples, as ſoon as they ſhould get the Sword into their hands, to uſe the ſeverity of Penal Laws againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyers, and I ſubmit. But if they can cite no ſuch Authority, let them conſider whether compulſion of Conſcience is conſiſtent with the juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Priviledges of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> approves not of <hi>Donatiſm,</hi> nor that <hi>Romiſh Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance</hi> which pronounces <hi>All Diſſenters ddmn'd.</hi> No, no; 'tis evident both by publick Declarations, and the Writings and Preachings of many of the moſt Eminent <hi>Church-men,</hi> that Salvation is not tyed up here, to a meer Conformity to what the <hi>Engliſh-Church</hi> differs in, from others; Of this we have a freſh and famous Inſtance in the <hi>Charitable</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian-like</hi> entertainment given to the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> that came hither for <hi>Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> from the preſent Perſecution in their Native Country. This clearly manifeſts that our <hi>Church</hi> Quarrels not with the <hi>Diſſenting-Proteſtants;</hi> For it would be a very ſtrange <hi>Riddle,</hi> to entertain <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the very ſame perſwaſion with ſo much tenderneſs and hoſpitality, and at the very ſame Inſtant, exact the utmoſt mite, that the Penal Laws require, from their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Country-men,</hi> who diſagree in nothing from theſe forreign <hi>Brethren,</hi> but only in Language (I mean with reſpect to <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion)</hi> ſo that lie that will charge the preſent Proſecutions upon the <hi>Church of England,</hi> does charge her at one and the ſame time, with ſeverity to our own Natives, and Charity to Strangers of the ſame Profeſſion. Now, ſince it is not to be preſumed that the <hi>Church of England</hi> would act with ſuch Partiality and Condradiction, may we not rationally conclude, that this unſeaſonable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, (when <hi>Popery</hi> is watching all opportunities to Ruine <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> as well as <hi>Nonconformiſts)</hi> is to be charged only on ſome particular Self-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons, or ſuch as do not calmly conſider what the Circumſtances of things are?</p>
            <p>The Judgment of His Majeſty, and the Reſolves of our laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (all true <hi>Patriots</hi> and <hi>Church-men,</hi> that have given ſecurity to the

            <p>AT the writing of this, there came to my hands a Paper newly publiſhed, with this Title, <hi>A Second Argument for a more full and firm <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion amongſt all good Proteſtants, wherein the</hi> Nonconformiſts <hi>taking the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the manner of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>is juſtifyed, &amp;c. In a Letter to a Friend.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Scope</hi> of it is not only to magnifie the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (which I do not in the leaſt reflect upon) but alſo to fix an <hi>Odium</hi> upon <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and render them more intollerable in the Eye of the Government, than the Charity of many Pious and Learned <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> either deſire, or think ſeaſonable; I have thought it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nature of my Subject, to leave a few modeſt <hi>Remarks</hi> upon it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the <hi>Converſion</hi> of ſuch <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as are mentioned <hi>p.</hi> 1. be really the Effect of <hi>Conviction</hi> of mind, without any ſiniſter ends, I ſhall not blame them for walking according to their <hi>Light,</hi> for that were to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Deſign of theſe few Sheets, viz. <hi>The Exerciſe of a Charitable meekneſs towards our weak Brethren.</hi> But if it be meerly for fear of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Proſecution there likewiſe mentioned, it is probable that the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of ſuch a practice, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to Conform to ſuch things as they before cry'd down as not <hi>Evangelical,</hi> or at beſt think ſtill to be doubtful,) will hardly prove <hi>Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Temporizing</hi> is <hi>Diametrically</hi> oppoſite to the Nature of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> And ſuch as are for ſelfiſh worldly ends, liſt themſelves among the pureſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> of <hi>Evangelical Truths,</hi> are juſtly branded with the <hi>Ignominious Name</hi> of <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> But whether theſe Men do it out of Conſcience, or 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99083:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for any By-ends, <hi>The Lord only knows,</hi> for he is <hi>the Searcher of Hearts;</hi> and there we leave it.</p>
            <p>The Expreſſions <hi>p.</hi> 2. are ſo perplext and unintelligible, that I cannot well pick out the meaning of it. If by <hi>Sons of Leviathan</hi> (bating the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſualneſs of the Phraſe) be meant, the <hi>Romiſh Clergy;</hi> the Paper then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſuch, to be <hi>Inſtructors</hi> among the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and of great <hi>Influence</hi> overthem: But that isno leſs than a malicious and groundleſs <hi>Slander.</hi> And I Challenge this Author to juſtifie the ſurmiſe by any <hi>Demonſtrative Inſtances.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it means the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> (for one of theſe it muſt be) who are repreſented as frighting the people from <hi>Conformity,</hi> and ſcaring them out of <hi>Church</hi> by calling it, and its Miniſters, <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> let the <hi>Author</hi> produce the Words or Writings of any eminent <hi>Nonconformiſt Preacher</hi> or <hi>Preachers,</hi> that have branded the <hi>Church of England</hi> with that Odious <hi>Epithete,</hi> and I will joyn with him to abhor the <hi>Calumniators.</hi> All <hi>Sober Diſſenters</hi> univerſally agree, that the <hi>Romiſh Hierarchy</hi> is the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and it was lately well proved in a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> Intituled, <hi>Schematologia,</hi> by a <hi>Diſſenting Preacher.</hi> And for them to make the <hi>Church of England</hi> another <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is not only diſconſonant to their publick and avowed <hi>Principles,</hi> but the higheſt violation of that <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Divine Principle</hi> of Love which they owe to their <hi>Chriſtian Conforming Brethren,</hi> that agree with them in all the ſubſtantial parts of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and differ only in Circumſtances confeſſedly indifferent by the very <hi>Impoſers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſurprized to find ſuch a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> in this Paper, <hi>p.</hi> 3. as I never yet ſaw or heard from a <hi>Proteſtant Writer.</hi> All things neceſſary to Salvation are <hi>peremptorily</hi> laid down by this <hi>Author,</hi> in theſe four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; upon which take a few Notes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The Learning of a good <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> to aid and conduct their <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> A good and well Compoſed Form of Prayer to diſcharge their Devotion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> To hear Learned and Good Men Preach to revive and quicken them to Duty.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> To Square and Regulate their Lives by Moral Precepts (or the Law of Nature.)</p>
            <p>Here's the <hi>ſum total</hi> of what's neceſſary to Salvation in this <hi>Authors</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.—But he is not content <hi>Dogmatically</hi> to make ſo Diminutive a Reduction of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but will alſo enſure your Soul for you, in theſe words,—<q>The which <hi>[meaning the ſaid particulars]</hi> whoſoever ſhall humbly and carefully obſerve, conſtantly and Conſcientiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99083:15"/>
we <hi>[that we is himſelf, as if he had been the Repreſentative of the</hi> Church of England] will aſſure them Salvation, and undertake to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to God for them, and be content to ſtand chargeable with their <hi>Blood,</hi> if they do miſcarry, &amp;c.</q> 
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Firſt, 'tis confeſſed that <hi>Catechiſtical</hi> Inſtructions were uſed in the Primitive Times, and ſince; and that if rightly managed, it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary expedient to Inform the Judgments of the Ignorant. But I never yet knew that it was made to lead the <hi>Van</hi> of ſuch <hi>Articles,</hi> as are neceſſary to Salvation, before. It is a means indeed, which (as the Spirit of God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences) may be Inſtrumentally ſubſervient to Convert the unconverted. But 'tis meer <hi>Popery</hi> to Attribute any ſuch Virtue to it, as if the meer Learning of a bare Form of <hi>Catechistical Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers,</hi> were a thing neceſſary to Salvation; and this I take to be the Papers meaning.</p>
            <p>The way of <hi>Catechiſing</hi> in the Primitive Ages of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> was for ſome of the <hi>Church Elders</hi> to call the Youth and other Ignorant Perſons together, at ſome certain Times, and examine them concerning the <hi>Faith,</hi> alwaies explaining what was obſcure to their weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nottying themſelves to any Form, but adminiſtring their <hi>Queſtions,</hi> and ſhaping their <hi>Inſtructions</hi> as the Capacity of the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> required, like <hi>Divine School-Maſters</hi> teaching their <hi>Spiritual Pupils,</hi> and with ſervent Prayers recommending the ſucceſs to God, the <hi>Converter</hi> of Souls. So that <hi>Catechiſing</hi> is no more than a Chriſtian endeavour, or expedient for the begetting of <hi>Faith,—not an aid and conduct of Faith</hi> (as the Paper words it) becauſe the perſons <hi>Catechiſ'd,</hi> were ſuppoſed to be yet unconverted. Beſides, to make <hi>formal Catechiſing</hi> a poſitive means of Salvation, is to Damn all that have not the opportunity to Learn it by Heart, and yet that there are many ſuch in the World, that are nevertheleſs ſaved, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly known to this <hi>Author,</hi> who ſeems to make <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> conſiſt in <hi>External Forms,</hi> and a Moral Deportment, or Converſation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. As to the Second,</hi> viz. A good and well Compoſed Form of Prayer to diſcharge their Devotion. <hi>It ſounds ſo different from</hi> Praying with the Spirit and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, <hi>that I cannot but marvel at it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not at all blame ſuch as uſe Forms of Prayer, for they may, for ought I know, Pray with the Spirit likewiſe, conſidering the Form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. But this is as clear as the Sun, that neither in all the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> nor the Firſt Three Hundred Years, there) can be produced any Record of known Credit, that any ſtinted Forms were Impoſed; And good Reaſon, for all the Children of God, can repreſent their grievances to their Heavenly Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99083:16"/>
their Petitions are expreſſed in Liſping Notes, or by the unutterable groans of the Spirit; yet they are not for all that rejected any more than a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father would deny his hungry Child a piece of Bread, becauſe he cannot ſpeak plain, or uſes not a Formal Addreſs for it.</p>
            <p>But for this <hi>Author</hi> to make a Form of Prayer neceſſary to Salvation, is to Damn ſuch as will not, or do not, make their Applications to the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Seat,</hi> in the ſtinted and Compoſed Conceptions of others, which poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may not reach their Caſe, or (as he calls it) <hi>diſcharge their Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Third thing neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>viz. To hear Learned and Good Men Preach, to revive and quicken to Duty.</hi> I ſay, That to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Sacred Diſpenſations of the Word of <hi>Truth,</hi> in order to growth in Grace, and Spiritual Edification, is a <hi>Chriſtian Duty.</hi>—And that the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ought to be Learned in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and a <hi>Good Man,</hi> that is of ſuch Goodneſs as the utmoſt preſſing after it, can arrive at. If the <hi>Author</hi> means by Learning and Goodneſs, what may be meerly attainable by School Faculties, and that which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call <hi>Morality,</hi> abſtracted from the Influences of Converting and <hi>Evangelical Grace,</hi> I muſt <hi>Diſſent</hi> from him till he proves, that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> are one and the ſame thing; Or that, <hi>Morality</hi> is that <hi>Grace</hi> by which we are <hi>ſaved through Faith.</hi> If he proves that, it will follow that the coming of Chriſt to Plant an <hi>Evangelical Religion</hi> in the World, and by his Death to ſave Mankind was unneceſſary, becauſe Salvation might have been attain'd by the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Heathen Moraliſts.</hi> This <hi>Authors</hi> Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſeems to look this way: For his fourth thing neceſſary to Salvation, is for Men <hi>to Square and Regulate their Lives by Moral Precepts (or the Law of Nature.)</hi> To which I ſay, That <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to do not only this, but more too, ſo that <hi>Chriſtian Duty</hi> terminates not here; It is not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to practical or ſpeculative <hi>Morality,</hi> which is only a Branch or Species of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and is as much in degree below that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Grace</hi> that ſaves the Soul through the <hi>Efficacy of the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> as the Body is below the Soul. The one is exerciſed in Principles of Common Equity betwixt Man and Man,—comprehended in that ſaying, <hi>Do as ye would be done unto:</hi> The other is exerciſed in a Spiritual Commerce with the Divinity by <hi>Faith, Prayer,</hi> and other <hi>Goſpel Graces,</hi> which <hi>Natural Philoſophy</hi> (meerly conſider'd as ſuch) can no more perform, than a Man ſtark Blind can judge of Colours, or <hi>Lazarus</hi> could get out of his Grave before the All quickning power of the Mediator rais'd him. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> repreſents ſuch as were <hi>Naturally Alive,</hi> to be <hi>Spiritually Dead.</hi> And <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99083:16"/>
without <hi>Grace</hi> is Character'd by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to be a vain, ſeducing thing.</p>
            <p>Before I touch upon the Reaſons of this <hi>Authon,</hi> in juſtification of <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi> taking the Sacrament after the manner of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> give me leave to put in this Caution; <hi>That I do not in what I write directly or indirectly, diſpute againſt the Lawfulneſs of the Adminiſtration of this Ordinance, as us'd in the ſaid Church;</hi> but my Scope and Intention is, to ſhew how unreaſonable it is, for this <hi>Author</hi> to repreſent the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> as ſuch ſilly <hi>Sectaries,</hi> becauſe they hant ſo wide a Throat as he, to ſwallow what they cannot Digeſt; and conſequently, that ſuch of them as <hi>Diſſent</hi> out of pure Conſcience, though they ſuffer ſuch Penalties, as this Gentleman it ſeems does not care to be concern'd in, are to be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, whilſt they behave themſelves peaceably and dutifully towards the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government. And to give him a hint, that if he be one of thoſe <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineaning Diſſenters, that has Converſed well near</hi> 30 <hi>Years amongſt them (as he ſays)</hi> p. 1. then either he ſaw their folly and groundleſs ſcrupuloſity (as he angerly calls it) before the preſent juncture, or not: If he ſaw it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and would not make diſcovery of it in order to his <hi>full and firm <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> as he Baptizes his Pamphlet, how can he clear himſelf of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> if not <hi>Hipocriſie,</hi> in not beginning this <hi>Bleſſed Atchievement</hi> ſooner, that he might prevent the jealouſie of the <hi>Government,</hi> and the ſufferings of ſo many Poor Families as he talks of.</p>
            <p>But if he be but a new <hi>Proſelite</hi> to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and is Converted on a ſuddain, as on the one hand people will be apt to ſuſpect him, becauſe he chuſes a time of ſuffering to forſake his Old Brethren, and think him a <hi>Temporizer:</hi> ſo on the other hand, he will be lookt upon as a <hi>Novice</hi> in <hi>Reformation,</hi> and Old Experienc'd Men, will hardly be perſwaded to Learn their <hi>Religion</hi> from the little pedantick ſubtilties of ſuch variable <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> who move with the <hi>State Compaſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things I ſpeak not from any prejudice againſt the <hi>Author,</hi> (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be) but to put him in mind, in a Spirit of meakneſs, that it would better become him rather to exerciſe Charity towards his forſaken Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, (if he has been a <hi>Diſſenter)</hi> and ſince he has freed himſelf from the laſh of ſuffering, that he would not add to their burthen, at ſo Licentious a Rate as he does in this Pamphlet. If they are in an Error, let him leave them to God, as they are willing to leave him quietly to the happineſs of the ſecure Station he has choſen.</p>
            <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 4. he begins his Proofs, which the Judicious and Conſcientious <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> will look upon more ſubtil then ſolid. All that I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99083:17"/>
as to that, will be this, becauſe my Work is not to diſapprove the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but to intreat the Proſecutors to ſhew Chriſtian Compaſſion to peaceable <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants;</hi> that this <hi>Author</hi> would if he writes a <hi>Third Argument,</hi> reſolve me a few plain <hi>Quaeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether the poſitive Rules ſet down by the <hi>Soveraign Legiſlator</hi> (with reſpect to his Ordinances) are not to be obſerved by Chriſtians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, without any Addition or Subſtraction, as near as can be?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it be not an Impeachment of the <hi>Divine Wiſdom,</hi> to ſuppoſe his Laws imperfect? Or that he ſtands in need of <hi>Spiritual Privy Council,</hi> to Regulate and Eſtabliſh the Circumſtances of his Lordſhip?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether, if the ſaid <hi>Divine Laws</hi> be perfect, and unalterable, (as they certainly are) any quiet, and Conſcientious <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> ought to be puniſhed for Non obſervance of ſuch Ceremonies as are confeſs'd to be of a meer Humane Original?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it be an Argument of <hi>Piety,</hi> for ſuch as have got on the warm ſide of the Hedge, to pelt dirt at thoſe that cannot ſtride ſo largely, or jump over ſo nimbly as they do?</p>
            <p>For my part I thought, and ſtill think, that the things neceſſary to Salvation, may be comprehended under this ſhort Sentance, <hi>viz. To Love God with all our Hearts, and our Neighbours as our ſelves;</hi> which is the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and a <hi>Compendium</hi> of the firſt and ſecond Table.</p>
            <p>Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, the Saviour of the World, who is God, Co-equal and Co-eſſential with the Father, and, a Life and Converſation ſuitable to the Sacred Rules of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> which comprehends <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> purely Divine too, do conſtitute a Chriſtian: And if this Mans <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> mentioned before, be true, which as far as I can ſee, reaches no further then to what the Law of Nature teaches,—then he may throw away that ſuperfluous thing called the <hi>Bible,</hi> and ſtudy <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Hobs</hi> his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Certainly this <hi>Author</hi> has but a deſpicable Opinion of <hi>Faith,</hi> though the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, <hi>That 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God without it;</hi> when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford it a little room among his things neceſſary to Salvation,—only ſuppoſes Men to have it, by which I have ground to ſuſpect, that the <hi>Faith</hi> he means, is nothing but ſome kind of <hi>Moral perſwaſion,</hi> or other, that being ſuitable to the reſt of his Diſcourſe. His little Pedantick <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma's,</hi> to juſtifie the Communion of the <hi>Church of England, p.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. are meerly frivolous; becauſe no ſober, nor wiſe <hi>Diſſenter</hi> (as far as I can ſee) Condemns that Communion. 'Tis only ſome things reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99083:17"/>
the Circumſtances of Adminiſtration, that they diſallow, as being not ſo exactly Quodrate with the Rule. Therefore let this <hi>Author,</hi> (if he will do any thing to the purpoſe) leave beating the Air, and draw a parel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between the Communion he juſtifies, and what is written of it in <hi>Scripture,</hi>—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reſpecting the perſons Adminiſtring. 2. The perſons receiving 3. The manner how. 4<hi>ly.</hi> The Time when. And 5<hi>ly.</hi> To what end. And if he makes them agree, then he will Convert all the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in that great Point, for which they ſuffer. But if they do not agree, then let this <hi>Dilema-maker</hi> give us ſome Reaſons for the Diſparity, and by what Authority the alteration was made: Or elſe in good earneſt let him e'en appear bare-fac'd, and blunder it out in plain <hi>Engliſh, That the Laws of God are ſubſervient to the Inſtitutions that Humane Policy thinks fit to ſuperadd.</hi> I would withal, intreat the <hi>Author</hi> to bleſs the World with a like parallel about <hi>Infant-baptiſm,</hi> that he may reduce thoſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> that have no good Opinion of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now comes the Mortal Wound (as he thinks) have a care poor</hi> Phanaticks!—Here the greateſt number of them are affirm'd to hold Principles dangerouſly Heretical, and moſt abominably abuſive of the moſt Holy and Bleſſed God,—yea, they ungod him. <hi>This is moſt ſad indeed,—but wherein I pray?</hi> By making him the greateſt Author of miſchief,—folly, &amp;c. by their idle Dreams about his Peremptory and Eternal Decrees. <hi>Oh! There'sthe buſineſs; this is the excellent and ſtupendious folly [fine</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.] <hi>which he admires at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you ſee how he brands the poor <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for the moſt <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Hereticks;</hi> and how does he prove it? Why he Fathers an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them, which none but a mad-Man will own, and then pours you out a long winded <hi>Rhapſody</hi> of ſuch Deviliſh Conſequences, as are able to ſcare abody out of all Charity with the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, if I had thought it had been ſuch a Damn'd thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>That God fore-ordain'd whatſoever ſhould come to paſs,</hi>—I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done it. Well, but the <hi>Author</hi> is pelting ſoundly at his <hi>Man of Straw,</hi> and the <hi>Odium</hi> is thrown upon the greateſt part of the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> What I ſhall ſay in reply, is this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be any body guilty of this <hi>Hereſie, viz.</hi> That God is the <hi>Author</hi> of Sin, I heartily leave him at this <hi>Authors</hi> Mercy, for I look upon that Opinion to be no better then he repreſents it. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is too uncharitable to charge the greateſt number of the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> with it, who for any thing, I find Diſcourſe only of the Decrees of God,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99083:18"/>
as <hi>Predeſtination, Election,</hi> &amp;c. as the <hi>Scripture</hi> repreſents and as the greateſt part of the <hi>Church of England</hi> holds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I could wiſh that Men were temperate, and modeſt in writing and diſcourſing of theſe great Secrets of Gods Decrees, and forbear to Extort Conſequences with ſuch violence from doubtful and obſcure places. Men have got ſuch an <hi>Itch</hi> to Eſpouſe ſome Darling Opinion or other, that no reaſon can remove them from it, though <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> languiſhes in the very Vitals of it, by theſe Brawls and Animoſities. I have known too many that won't trouble their Heads with the moſt certain and moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Duties of the Goſpel, that inſtead of reading the Commandments, and the plain Practical Parts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> will needs be making Comments upon the obſcureſt <hi>Allegories</hi> of the Prophets, and the Revelation of St. <hi>John.</hi> Pray what neceſſity have we to confound poor ſimple Chriſtians with thoſe School Tricks, which much Idle and Licentious Wits, peſter the <hi>Church of Chriſt?</hi> It was enough for the Apoſtle to know nothing but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and him Crucified,</hi> (as was ſaid) and 'tis moſt aſſuredly true, that whatſoever is neceſſary to Salvation, is ſo plainly laid down in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that the meaneſt Capacity may (by the aid of Divine Grace) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore a dangerous piece of wantonneſs to be peeping into the Secret Cabinets of the Almighty, and I am ſure, ſuch Fooleries have done much miſchief in the World. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis enough for us to know that the Lord God hath choſen a people for himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as believe in him, and obey his Laws, and that he will Eternally ſave them. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſuch as reject his Grace and Mercy, and diſobey his Goſpel, will fall under his Eternal Wrath.</p>
            <p>With this Belief I content my ſelf, and firmly hold, That God is not, nor cannot be the <hi>Author</hi> of any Evil, but on the contrary that he is the <hi>Author</hi> of all Good. I believe that Mans Damnation is purely and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from his own wickedneſs, and that his Eternal Deſtruction is not from any Decree of God; which whoſoever ſaies, does at the ſame time affirm, That God does Damn him for what he cannot poſſibly avoid.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide I Beleive, that no Man can ſave himſelf, but that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the only and ſole <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Salvation, and that he alone purifies the corrupt Wills and Hearts of Men, adapting and preparing them to receive his Grace and ſaving Truths, through the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Influence of the Holy Spirit. This is my <hi>Creed,</hi> in this Point, and here I reſt, not propoſing it by way of Impoſition on others, but to ſhew
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99083:18"/>
that this moderate middle path, which in my Judgment is Sound and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> and would lead us to the deſireable <hi>Manſions</hi> of Peace, out of which our <hi>Pulpit-Wars</hi> have a long time kept us.</p>
            <p>I doubt ſome Intemperate <hi>Zealots,</hi> that would as ſoon part with their Eyes, as their Notions, will be grumbling at what I ſay, as too favourable to one ſide or other. But as I regard not unjuſt cenſure, ſo I Challenge them to mend it. Methinks if theſe general Truths, and ſome ſuch like, be enough for the people to know they do the Church no good ſervice, that inſtead of Preaching Practical Duties, will needs be frightening the <hi>Auditory</hi> with hidden Decrees, abſolute Reprobation, and ſome ſuch new made <hi>Thunder-Bolts,</hi> able to ſcare 'em into Deſpair. God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Goſpel to be Preach'd to <hi>all the World,</hi> that ſuch as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it ſhould be ſaved. But theſe Men have got you a hidden Decree, which Damns the greateſt part of Mankind, yet without the hand of any <hi>Heavenly Notary</hi> to teſtifie it. And pray tell me, what is it more or leſs, than to mock the poor people, to invite them to believe, &amp;c. when 'tis impoſſible for them ſavingly to do it, if their Names be Regiſtred in that black and irreverſible <hi>Muſter Roll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not deſign to reflect upon any, nor do I Liſt my ſelf with thoſe who follow <hi>Arminius,</hi> or <hi>Calvin;</hi> I am ſorry to find extreams on both hands. I would only beſeech <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to Preach neceſſary Truths, and let the hidden Decrees of God alone, with other unneceſſary Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which practice will undoubtedly be of great and uſeful Conſequenc, and will preventthe Bawling of ſuch <hi>Authors</hi> as this is, who I believe will not Quarrel with what I here write, nor charge his horrible Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon it; and yet I am ſure, all Sober <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are of this mind; For I never yet met any of them, but upon a ſober debate, as occaſion offered it, were obliged by fair Argument to own it. And he that believes this, believes enough, as to this Point, and more will but diſtract and confound the plain and honeſt Chriſtian. I have been the longer about this, tolet this <hi>Author</hi> know that his charge of <hi>Hereſie</hi> is ſtretcht unreaſonably wide, and I hope I have gain'd thus much by taking notice of this Pamphlet, that upon a ſerious and unbyaſs'd peruſal of this few Remarks, any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of common Capacity will ſee a neceſſity of better Arguments then he uſes. And 'tis hop'd that our Church will uſe that way of reducing <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, viz.</hi> Mild Chriſtian Debates and Conferences, Sober Brotherly Perſwaſions, with hearty Prayers for each other; which were the Church Weapons of the Primitive Chriſtians, not ſuch Whirlwind and Thunder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſome certain <hi>Renegado's</hi> yonder at <hi>Algier,</hi> or thereabouts, would Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99083:19"/>
up, againſt a little ſcatter'd Fleet of their <hi>Quondam</hi> Friends.</p>
            <p>I profeſs I cannot but wonder at the unparallel'd Confidence of this Pamphlet, that bluſhes not to charge the greateſt part of the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> (as its young zeal words it) meaning <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters)</hi> with <hi>making God the Author of wickedneſs,</hi> in ſuch terms as quoted before; which is no leſs then to charge them with the <hi>blackeſt of Blaſphemies.</hi> Now the Laws of our Land have provided Condign puniſhment for that (moſt) Monſtrous of Treaſons, againſt the King of Kings. And the <hi>Author</hi> cannot acquit himſelf of <hi>Miſpriſion,</hi> if he gives not a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of ſuch horrible <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,</hi> that the Law may puniſh them, and that all Chriſtians may ſhun them as the worſt of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Let him produce that, together with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Evidence, and then <hi>fiat Juſtitia,</hi> let new <hi>Tyburns</hi> be erected for them, if the Legiſlative Authory thinks fit.</p>
            <p>Reader, I have almoſt done with this Pamphlet, which I believe will Proſelite only ſuch as are under the Influence of ſomething I ſhall not name. Only give me leave to add a few Lines by way of obſervation, upon the <hi>ſpecimen,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> gives of the <hi>Wit and Policy of theſe giddy Sectaries,</hi> (as he calls them.)</p>
            <p>Would they have <hi>(ſaies he)</hi> p. <hi>12.)</hi> Arch-Biſhops,—Biſhops,—the beſt Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,—all the beſt Clergy of <hi>England,</hi>—Tythes,—<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,—Pariſh Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy's,—Down? <hi>This he Anſwers with a parcel of Gingling,</hi> Yes, Yes, Yeſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then to fill up the Vacuities, he inſinuates that theſe ſame</hi> Sectaries <hi>would Elect</hi> Tinkers, Taylors, Watermen, Shoomakers, Coffee-men, Hat-Dreſſers, &amp;c. <hi>concluding with a pious</hi> Irony, That the Chriſtian World muſt be acquainted with this Honourable—Reformation!</p>
            <p>In the firſt place the Slander is Venemous, and the Deportment of the Grave and Reverend <hi>Nonconformiſt Preachers</hi> ſince His Majeſties happy Reſtauration, confutes this wild Calumny. Let him name thoſe giddy Fools, and let them be expoſed for their ſillineſs; Elſe let him avoid the charge of turning a falſe <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren, if he can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> deſire, is but a Liberty to ſerve their God, according to their Light, in Cottages, or any where, quietly, without any Combination againſt the Government; nor do they begrudge the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church their Dignities or Revenues. When they do otherwiſe, let them be ſtigmatiz'd with a Witneſs for me; for then they ceaſe from being the Diſciples of Chriſt, <hi>whoſe Kingdom is not of this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he has been a benefic'd <hi>Holder-forth</hi> amongſt theſe <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:99083:19"/>
he might have nam'd his own Trade with the reſt; And ſhould have Demonſtrated which of thoſe <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> have aſpired to ſuch high Church Dignities; without that, the Tale ſignifies nothing. There were <hi>Mechanick Preachers</hi> in the Primitive Times, I am ſure; 'tis well they eſcape this Gentlemans laſh; he deſerves thanks for that Civility, however.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well but (ſays the Pamphlet,</hi> p. <hi>13.)</hi> for forty years they have made no Bank, built no Free-Schools, purchas'd no Church-Lands,—pay no Tythes,—wont conſent to have all things common,—their Preachers go a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,—&amp;c.</p>
            <p>This I muſt confeſs is a frightful charge, and able to ſcare their <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> away from them, if they only gape for a Benefice. But the <hi>Author</hi> did not conſider that this is a good Argument againſt his Inſinuations of their Ambition, for if this be true, then the Government needs not fear them, and the Proſecution of Penal Laws may be ſpar'd, when the <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> make no proviſion for their Miniſters, nor do Incorporate themſelves into a formidable Faction. Beſides, ſince the Caſe is thus (or the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet tells a Whisker) either the <hi>Diſſenting Preachers,</hi> (as formerly hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) are Fools to go a Begging, when they may be welcome to our Church, and provided for, or elſe their <hi>Diſſent</hi> is from pure Conſcience, and ſo, Chriſtian Charity would rather pitty then perſecute them.</p>
            <p>To conclude this <hi>Section,</hi> if the <hi>Author</hi> of this Paper thinks fit to go on, let him produce Arguments of weight and ſolidity, and wave the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Reproach, and he will either convince us, or be anſwered ſoberly.</p>

               </hi> with what Conſcience can thoſe Laws be put in Execution againſt the Innocent, which were meant only to ſuppreſs Sedition, and ſecure the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt ſuch as actually diſturb it? That that was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Legiſlators, <hi>viz.</hi> to puniſh only the guilty, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and for any one to ſtretch thoſe Statutes beyond the ends for which they were deſigned, is no leſs, then to ſhew himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful to his Soveraign, unnaturally cruel to his poor Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, an oppreſſor of his Brethren, and obnoxious to a ſevere Reckoning, in the great Day of Accounts.

            <p>THe Grand <hi>Topick</hi> which the little mercenary <hi>Paſquillers</hi> uſe to juſtifie their Invectives againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> is the late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Rebellion, and the horrid Murther of His Majeſties Royal Father, &amp;c. This is a Subject which I would not touch upon, but that I am forc'd by the dayly Clamours of theſe <hi>Pamphlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to ſpeak a few words to it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If I know my own Heart, I can truly ſay, That I do from my very Soul abhor and deteſt all Principles that tend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or Diſturbance of the publick or private Peace, and all ſuch wicked perſons as Imbrue their hands in the Blood of any Man, Woman, or Child, much more any ſuch Traytors as practice againſt the Sacred Life or Perſon of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Annointed,</hi> for ſuch perſons are ſo far from deſerving any favour or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Government, that they ought to be rooted from off the face of the Earth, as the moſt execrable of <hi>Miſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</hi> And therefore let the <hi>Authors</hi> of our late Calamities, and the unparallel'd Murther of that Great and moſt Excellent Prince, be branded with everlaſting Infamy for me. 'Tis not for Traytors, but for my Innocent fellow-Chriſtians, that I beg the favour and pitty of ſuch as are intruſted with the Execution of Penal Laws for Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How far the <hi>Papists</hi> did Influence thoſe fatal Convulſions, and whether the Nation ows not all its Calamity to their black and myſtical Stratagems, the judicious unbyaſs'd Reader will ſoon determine, if he peruſes Mr. <hi>Care</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the Plot,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed 1681. from <hi>p.</hi> 42. to 71. I have not Room to tranſcribe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99083:23"/>
it, and therefore would adviſe (any that doubts it) to peruſe it there Intire, 'tis worth his while.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis Diametrically oppoſite to Juſtice, to puniſh the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for the Crimes of the Guilty.—And admitting that a great many under the Vizard of Religion, had a main hand in theſe lamentable (and too too deplorable) miſchiefs before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there is no equity in the World, that their Villanies ſhall be chargeable upon (and their puniſhment extend to) ſuch as were never concern'd in them.</p>
            <p>The beſt Religion in the World cannot ſecure it ſelf from Hypocrites, that diſguiſe themſelves till they have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſerve ſome Deviliſh turn, or other. That <hi>Arch-Traytor</hi> and <hi>Informer Judus,</hi> got in among the very Apoſtles, and many falſe Brethren crept in among the Primitive Saints;—the Devil himſelf will ſometimes come Maſqueraded as an Angel of Light. Why is the Chriſtian Religion ever the worſe for this? No, no, Divine Truths are ſtill ſuch, though the Sacred Profeſſion of it is prophan'd and abus'd by ſuch Hypocritical Wretches, to their own Damnation.</p>
            <p>What I aim at, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are to examine the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſuch as profeſs Chriſtianity under any form, declared in their publick Confeſſions of Faith, and the Writings of ſuch as are own'd, and approv'd by them, and if we find them pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Government, or tending any waies to the diſturbance of the publick peace; ſuch are without Diſpute to be ſuppreſs'd and puniſht as Enemies to the State. But if their Principles be in all Articles of Religion ſuitable to the Word of God, and (in Fundamentals) to the Eſtabliſht Religion; it will unavoidably follow, That the miſcarriages, or wickedneſs of ſome that creep in amongſt them, are not to be charged upon their Chriſtian Profeſſion, (which allows no ſuch thing) but upon the <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>From hence I infer, that the Murther of His late Majeſty, thoſe Rebellions, Bloodſheds, and Overturnings of State, &amp;c. then noted, are to be chargeable only upon ſuch as were perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and actually guilty,—For I never heard, (and I dare boldly ſay that no Man ever did hear) that any of our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants</hi> in their Confeſſions of Faith, have ever had ſo much Traytorous Impudence, as to juſtifie the leaſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99083:24"/>
tittle of ſuch horrid things, but the quite contrary, as may be ſhown in time.</p>
            <p>If there be any now alive, who have had any hand in thoſe dreadful Commotious, &amp;c. If they have received His Majeſties Pardon, they are thereby reinſtated into equal Priviledges with the Innocent, unleſs by new Treaſons they forfeit that Royal Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if there be any of them excluded from the benefit of the <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> let them be puniſh'd, <hi>fiat Juſtitia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I inſiſt the longer upon this, to ſhew how unreaſonable it is, for ſuch a parcel of <hi>Hackney Scriblers</hi> to be perpetually bawling of 41, 41, and making the crimes of ſuch as are Dead, or were Executed for their Treaſons, not only ſurvive them, but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their poor Innocent Fellow Subjects with them; I could wiſh with all my Heart, that all thoſe <hi>half-penny Paſquillers</hi> on both ſides, who meerly for their Bellies, peſter City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, inventing Names of Reproach, as <hi>Whigg, Tory, Trimmer,</hi> &amp;c. and begetting Feuds and Animoſities betwixt His Majeſties <hi>Liege People,</hi> were ſeverely puniſht as <hi>Diſturbers of the publick Peace;</hi> I am ſure they deſerve it more then the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who are a peaceable trading People, and uſefull Members of the State, who pay His Majeſty all His Taxes and Revenues, to the utmoſt of what the Law requires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which is not inconſiderable.) How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable is it then, for free born Subjects, Loyal to the King, and helpful in ſupporting the charge of the Government to be day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weekly Libel'd, and abus'd by thoſe Raſcally <hi>Leeches of the Preſs,</hi> that to ſerve their own little Craving Neceſſities, care not if they <hi>ſet the People together by the Ears?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty out of His Royal Clemency was pleas'd to paſs an <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> yea, ſo impatient was he, that he preſt the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> with much earneſtneſs, to make it ready for his <hi>Royal Aſſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> What then? why here you have his goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Princely Lenity reviled, and contradicted, (almoſt dayly) by a certain <hi>Incendiary,</hi> who Conjurest up the Memory of thoſe fatal Times, and keeps the Nation Old Wounds a Bleeding, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of that Act, which was deſign'd to heal, and make them forgotten.</p>
