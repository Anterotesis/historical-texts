            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

had a hand therein; who having examined them, though he confeſſed he did not believe them to be Cavalieres, not any thing appearing upon, or againſt them, as matter of ſuſpition, yet cauſed he them to kept cloſe priſoners, at <hi>Exeter</hi> for the ſpace of about fourteen dayes, and then ſent them from Officer to Officer towards their homes.</p>
            <p>But being come two miles from <hi>Taunton</hi> on the way to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> the Officer that conducted them from thence, fell to the ground, and lying grovelling thereon in the ſight of divers people, was able to goe no further, whereupon they returned back to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice at <hi>Taunton,</hi> and acquainted him with what had befallen the Officer he ſent with them, and to know what further he would injoyn them, who after ſome conſideration, told them he would have no more to doe with them, and having ſet them at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſired the Lord to be with them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they paſſed to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> where, and in the Country thereabouts, having ſtayed ſome time they departed, being moved of the Lord towards <hi>Plymouth</hi> againe; having with them a friend of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> born at <hi>Exeter,</hi> and Certificates from the Captaine of the Fort at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and of a Juſtice, concerning them, and their good affections to the Common wealth; which before they had not, being ignorant, when they came out of the North, of any ſuch occaſion as had fallen out, whilſt they were on their way, that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>And ſo, through the hand of the <hi>Lord,</hi> they came to <hi>Plymouth</hi> the ſixteenth day of the month called <hi>May,</hi> 1655. and there had ſeverall peaceable meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the houſes of friends, to whom they miniſtred <hi>what they had heard, and ſeen, and handled of the word

of life,</hi> and were <hi>made manifeſt with mighty power</hi> to <hi>that</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of many to whom they were ſent, who being thereby <hi>turned from darkneſſe to light, and the eye being opened in them, which the God of this world hath blinded, the captives came to witneſſe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, even the acceptable time, the day of ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Standard</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> being thus ſet up, many people flock thereunto, inſomuch that the houſe of <hi>John Harris,</hi> a friend near the Town, where a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was appointed to be on the firſt day of the week following, being not able to receive them, they went into his garden, and to them both in the fore and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon did they declare the truth of the experience of what they had found of the <hi>free grace of God which brings ſalvation</hi> manifeſted in them, <hi>provoking them unto love, and to good works, according to the Scriptures of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, as the Spirit gave them utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> exhorting them in the words of <hi>ſoberneſſe</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> full of plainneſſe and ſimplicity, and tending onely to the advancement of the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> amongſt men, without uſing any inveighings againſt men, or opinions, and were approved of by thoſe that heard them, though ſeverall came onely to hear ſome new thing.</p>
            <p>Having <hi>both</hi> of them ſpoken, and finiſhed what they had to ſay, <hi>George Brookes</hi> then Prieſt of the Nightingale Friggot, a man whom they knew not, ſpake to the people a pretty ſpace of time, wholly in the <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>commendation</hi> of what they had ſaid, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it to be the <hi>eternall truth,</hi> and exhorting them to perſeverance, from that Scripture, <hi>Take heed that yee receive not the grace of God in vaine,</hi> telling them that <hi>they muſt expect to ſuffer perſecution;</hi> but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from whence he ſpake being ſeen in the light of

Jeſus Chriſt, which changeth not, with which he was comprehended, <hi>Thomas Salthouſe</hi> ſaid <hi>that he had ſpoken many good words, and faire ſpeeches, but asked him whether he lived the life of what he ſpake, for that it was he that had the witneſſe in himſelfe that ſetteth to his ſeale that God is true;</hi> and their friend who came with them from <hi>Briſtoll</hi> as aforeſaid, told him, he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a Trinity in Unity, and a Unity in Trinity, when as no ſuch language was to be found in the Scriptures; which being ended, <hi>Thomas Salthouſe</hi> ſpake a few words more to the people, exhorting them in the words of the <hi>Apoſtle, Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more;</hi> and made uſe of the words of <hi>Chriſt, He that entreth not in by the doore into the ſheep-fold, but climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a Thiefe, and a Robber;</hi> which <hi>he</hi> directed not to <hi>George Brookes,</hi> or any one in <hi>particular: Miles Halhead</hi> having not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>one word,</hi> nor <hi>Thomas Salthouſe</hi> otherwiſe then as afore rehearſed, and ſo the meeting ended.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>perſecution</hi> raiſed againſt them, then began; in which the <hi>Prieſt</hi> aforeſaid, to <hi>fulfill</hi> the words him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had ſaid, (to wit) <hi>that they muſt expect to ſuffer perſecution,</hi> was inſtrumentall; and on what was then ſaid to him, being in truth no otherwiſe then what have been ſaid, as <hi>ten</hi> honeſt men of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> then preſent, have atteſted under their hands, which is hereunto annexed, is laid the pretended ground of the long and cruell ſufferings, which they have, and doe ſtill undergoe, hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p>For on the third day of the week following, being the 21 of the month called <hi>May,</hi> the day before they intended to depart the Town, <hi>Miles</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a meeting of friends in <hi>Robert Caryes</hi> houſe in the Town; the Counſtables came thither with a

Warrant from <hi>John Page</hi> Mayor, out of which they took them, and their friend of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving apprehended, they brought before the Mayor at his houſe, who after a few words ſpoken to them, ſent them to Priſon at the Gild-hall, without ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any crime they had committed, that might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a reſtraint.</p>
            <p>The next day they were brought from Priſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mayor, Magiſtrates, and Counſell, and the Prieſt of the Town, and ſeverally examined,<note place="margin">G: Hughes.</note> the doores being ſhut and all who were their friends tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out by the Conſtables, not one being ſuffered to be preſent at their Examination, who any wayes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them, to teſtifie in their behalfe; and having examined them after this manner for the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three hours, they releaſed their friend of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and returned the other two to Priſon.</p>
            <p>In which having continued them ſome dayes, a friend applyed himſelfe to the Mayor, and deſired of him to know for what they was committed, who poſitively anſwered, that they were detained for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Trinity,</hi> and that there had been Oath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before them, for that purpoſe; to which accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion though they had fully anſwered at their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet that their innocency might more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, they wrote a Letter to the Mayor, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they held therein, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, againſt which they excepted not.</p>

            <p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168369:6"/>
the manifeſt other lyes with which the Warrant is filled, renders him as one that will know no ſhame. All which more at large appeareth in their Anſwer to this Warrant, and the Teſtimony of eleven honeſt men of that Town, who were eye and ear Witneſſes of theſe paſſages, delivered under their hands to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generall <hi>Disbrow,</hi> before the Seſſions hereafter mentioned, to the truth of their ſaid Anſwer.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>divers other high miſdemeanours,</hi> they are yet to mention, and therefore there needs nothing in Reply; for all men who underſtands the Law, know, That a generall Charge requires no particular Reply, and is as much as nothing.</p>
            <p>Only this may be obſerved, That he who had ſo contrary unto Law impriſoned them, and kept them for the ſpace of a week, and during that time had ſhifted from one thing to another as the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as hath been ſaid, and then ſent them to <hi>Exeter</hi> Priſon, with this Warrant full of other abominable falſhoods, there being not one true Aſſertion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, would no doubt have formed ſomething or other in relation thereunto, had it come within the reach of his invention, which had created and expreſſed ſo many therein, known to himſelf to be ſo contrary to truth; and alſo in his, and his brethrens filthy flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Letter to Generall <hi>Disbrow,</hi> in excuſe of their unjuſt proceedings againſt theſe <hi>innocent</hi> ſervants of the <hi>Lord,</hi> made up with other abominable untruths, by which they endeavoured to beget in him a good Opinion of them, for ſo doing, and to continue his favour to their Town, as by a copy of their Letter, and <hi>Miles</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Anſwer thereunto, added to this Relation, at large appeareth.</p>

aforeſaid, there they continued in the common Goal, lying on the ground, untill the Generall Seſſions of the Peace of the County held there the Tenth of the Month called <hi>July</hi> following, on the 12 day of which Month, they were brought before the Seſſions, to whom the Clerk read a Bill of <hi>Indictment</hi> exhibited againſt them upon the <hi>Ordinance for preventing of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,</hi> wherein was expreſſed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they the ſaid</hi> Thomas <hi>and</hi> Miles <hi>not fearing or regarding the ſame Ordinance, and the penalties therein contained, did the</hi> 20 <hi>of</hi> May, 1655. <hi>at</hi> Plymouth <hi>in the preſence and hearing of divers honest perſons then and there being, uſe diverſe diſgracefull provoking words and geſtures to</hi> George Brooks <hi>Clerk in the</hi> Nightingale <hi>Friggot, he being then opening and declaring to the ſame perſons a certain place of Scripture, wherein he ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Holy Trinity</hi> (viz.) <hi>Thou (the ſaid</hi> George Brooks <hi>meaning) lyeſt in ſaying there were three perſons in the Trinity, we deny it, there is no ſuch thing; but thou art a deluding ſpirit come to draw away the hearts of the people from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further, they did farther ſpeak to the people then preſent, that they ſhould not hearken to the ſaid</hi> George Brooks, <hi>for that he was a Thief, and was come with a lye in his mouth, and had ſtoln what he had from others, and had it in his hand, pointing to the Bible which was then in the ſaid</hi> George Brooks <hi>his hand open. And further did ſay it was a lye which the ſaid</hi> George Brooks <hi>had brought, and other harms to the ſaid</hi> George Brooks <hi>then and there did contrary to the form of the ſaid Ordinance, and againſt the publick peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How utterly untrue in every particular this <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is, both as to the matter and manner of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation charged therein, is clearly manifeſted in the

            <p>
               <hi>Miles Halhead</hi> ſpake not <hi>a word</hi> at the Diſcourſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which occaſion is taken, and the ground of this Indictment laid, and he that ſaith nothing cannot be made <hi>an offendor for a word,</hi> though <hi>there be that make a man an offendor for a word that is none indeed:</hi> Nor doth that <hi>Ordinance</hi> require, or any <hi>Law,</hi> that <hi>if one man tranſgreſſe it</hi> (were it ſo that <hi>Thomas Salthouſe</hi> had ſo done (which is denyed) <hi>two ſhould ſuffer,</hi> that were <hi>to deſtroy the righteous with the wicked,</hi> unto which <hi>the Law is a terror;</hi> and yet hath <hi>Miles Halhead</hi> been Impriſoned and Indicted, &amp; ſuffered hath he though he was altogether ſilent, and without ſo much as any thing that might be a pretence of offending in the leaſt that Ordinance, or any other Law of God, or the Nation.</p>
            <p>Nor did <hi>Thomas Salthouſe</hi> ſpeak one word to <hi>George Brooks</hi> in particular, as to what the <hi>Indictment</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth; true it is, after <hi>George Brookes</hi> had ſpoken ſo largely in the <hi>praiſe</hi> of what they had declared from the Lord, ſaying, <hi>it was the eternall truth,</hi> and Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people to take heed that they received not the grace of God in vain; <hi>Thomas Salthouſe</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Principle from whence he ſpake, in the light of Jeſus Chriſt which changeth not, ſaid unto
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168369:7"/>
him to this effect, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken many good words, and faire ſpeeches, but doeſt thou live the life of what thou ſpeakeſt? for it is he that hath the witneſſe in himſelf, that ſetteth to his ſeale that God is true:</hi> which were <hi>ſavory</hi> words, and <hi>feaſonable</hi> for the directing of his mind, and the hearers alſo, to ſee that they witneſſed indeed what they ſpake and profeſſed, and to ſpeak and profeſſe no more then they witneſſed, that ſo he and they might not be deceived with the ſubtilty of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> in thinking they had that which was <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> life, when in the day of Tryall it would appear to be no ſuch matter.

            <p>Had they come in wayes of craftineſſe to deceive, they would have cheriſhed his Teſtimony to the truth of what they had ſpoken, and not have queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it with ſuch expreſſions.

            <p>Thus in all Ages hath Error ſought to ſupport it ſelf againſt the Truth, and to enſnare the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe of her Children with Oaths, when other manner of Perſecutions have not reached, that ſo ſhe might be ſecure, and never know ſorrow: Which Oaths, as they are out of the Doctrine of Chriſt, ſo a Curſe have they proved, inſtead of a Defence, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168369:14"/>
the beginner and certaine Fore-runner of the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Finall Overthrow of that Kingdome, as theſe and former Generations have witneſſed, though before in never ſo promiſing and flouriſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeeming in its own eye to want nothing, but Oaths to eſtabliſh it.</p>
            <p>And now the Witneſſe of God is drawn forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, and all manner of Swearing, and it is Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing in ſufferings, at the hands of thoſe on whom was preſſed the Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Covenant, and who in their time Suffered by, and Teſtified and Fought againſt thoſe who impoſed and ſought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh both; and alſo againſt the Biſhops Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> which required a man to Swear againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and <hi>Whether the impoſing of an Oath upon a man to abjure what is ſuppoſed to be his conſcience wherewithall to worſhip God, upon the penalty of looſing his Eſtate, if he refuſe,</hi> be leſſe, let the Wiſe in heart, judge? And <hi>Whether upon the ſame ground, and by the ſame Rule, the like Oath may not be impoſed as to any other thing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted upon the ſame penalty?</hi> The Witneſſe of God hath its time of Raigning as well as Suffering, and will as certainly Raigne, as it doth Suffer; it was ever ſo in all Ages, theſe later, above any, have known it ſo, and ſo it will be in this, and in the Ages to come: Let thoſe whom it concerns, who have had a time of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and Reigning, and now cauſe others to Suffer, conſider before it be too late, <hi>The Judge ſtandeth at the door,</hi> and according to the Greatneſſe and Majeſty of the Truth that is witneſſed, and the Sufferings that attend its Teſtimony, and the condition of thoſe who cauſe it to Suffer, as having been Witneſſes and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers themſelves, and the Sword of the Lord upon that which hath cauſed to Suffer, and have known

               <p>And to mention only one particular, One who had been a Captain in the Kings Army, very well known in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> did freely declare to a friend, <hi>That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſcorn and contempt of the men and their way, his end in coming to hear them, was to ſee what he could catch from them, to render them odious; but having heard them, he confeſſed that he thought them to be harmleſſe, innocent, honeſt men, and he would not lift up a finger againſt them, if he might gain thereby ten thouſand pounds.</hi> And he freely declared to both the Witn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And ſo abominable was his filthineſſe, that in the ſame Frigot was he made a publick Example for his Drunkenneſſe, having a <hi>Quarter Canne hanged about his Neck,</hi> and is ſince for that and his other wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſet on ſhore, or turned out or the ſaid Ship, as appeareth by the Certificates of the Captain of that Friggot, and two other Captaines of Friggots here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto annexed.</p>

occaſion they have <hi>to come to theſe parts.</hi> They are by profeſſion Quakers, but Husbandmen by their calling; one of them is a <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> man, the other of <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> and they left their Families, Relations, and Callings about three Months ſince, as they ſay, and doe net work, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves in their Callings, to procure themſelves a livelihood: but wander up and down in all parts, to vent their wicked Opinions, &amp; diſcover their irregular practiſes in the breach of Peace, &amp; diſturbance of good People.

               <p>THis is the ſecond time this Mayor hath affirmed this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable lye under his Hand and Seal, notwithſtanding that two ſufficient men of the Town of <hi>Plymouth</hi> had entred into a Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance before him for their Appearance, which the next morning he denyed to give under his hand as he had promiſed, and voided the Recognizance, the Town Clerk ſaying it would not ſtand in Law, and ſent them to Priſon. And here as he twice chargeth

them for refuſing to doe that which they had done before him, and which he had refuſed to deliver them under his hand accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his promiſe, and made voyd as the cauſe of their impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo he committed them to Priſon for refuſing to doe that which the Town Clerk ſaid would not ſtand in Law, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he affirmed, was contrary thereunto. Canſt thou who doeſt ſuch things as theſe bluſh? Is it not hereby apparent that cauſe is ſought for, and made where there is none to deſtroy the innocent?</p>
               <p>What the meaſure wants of filling, with falſe Accuſations, that the Indictments <hi>meaning,</hi> and this Mayors <hi>conceiving</hi> ſhall make up to cauſe the righteous to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Where is that late Proclamation intituled againſt Quakers? There is one againſt diſturbing of Chriſtians in their peaceable Aſſemblies, and there is the 37 Article of the Government, which ſaith, <hi>That all that profeſſe faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall not be reſtrained from, but be protected in the profeſſion of the faith, and exerciſe of their Religion,</hi> &amp;c. Both which thou haſt broken, in ſending thy Officers, and taking them from their peaceable meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſtians waiting on the Lord, by thy Warrants.</p>
               <p>The Law forbids the reproaching of any, and all evill ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as evill doing, yet this Mayor who calls himſelf a Miniſter of the Law, reproacheth the Servants of the moſt high God, who fear before his preſence, and tremble at his word, as the holy men of God have done from the beginning on Record in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with the name of Quakers, and intitles the Generation of thoſe who ſeek the face of the Lord, with the name of Quakers (which he ſo reproacheth) by profeſſion.</p>
               <p>What difference is there between a calling and profeſſion?</p>
               <p>Is coming to <hi>Plymouth</hi> in obedience to the movings of the Lord, to viſite friends, and to ſpeak to them the words of eternall life, to Preach the everlaſting Goſpel, and to exhort them to love, and good works, according to the Scriptures of truth, no occaſion? ſhewed they not this as the occaſion of their coming thither? and is it not a lawfull one? And have they not there many ſeals of their Miniſtry, who by it are turned from darkneſſe to light, and from the Kingdome of Satan unto God?</p>
               <p>How can they employ themſelves in their callings of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168369:29"/>
when kept in Priſon? how can they return to their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Relations, and Callings, when thus detained, as they were at firſt hindred in their Journey on their lawfull occaſions, and are ſtill by Thee? Doeſt thou complain of them for not doing that which by impriſoning of them thou haſt made impoſſible? Did they want a livelihood before they were laid hands on, or do they now, though it's neer nine months ſince the time of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment by thee? Did they ask any thing of thee, or of any one elſe? waſt thou or <hi>Plymouth</hi> burdened, or made chargeable by? or had not the Town the advantage of their expence for themſelves and Horſes, and the friend that was with them? how knoweſt Thou that they want a livelihood? or haſt Thou or thy Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adminiſtred to them, or to their Families, and Relations du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring near nine months of reſtraint, and ſix of them in a cloſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment without a cauſe, in a ſtrange place 200 miles from their outward Habitations, whereby they are kept from imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to procure a livelihood for themſelves, Families, and Relations?</p>
               <p>Is riding the ſtrait Road from <hi>Briſtoll</hi> to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> lying at the beſt Inns, and paying for what they have for themſelves and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a wandring? Thinkeſt thou what the Law calls wandring, is not known, and how much thou haſt broken the Law upon them, and what penalties thou art under for ſo doing, and art thou ſure thou ſhalt never be called to an account, deceive not thy ſelf? May not a man travell where he will in times of peace, paying for what he hath, and behaving himſelf peaceable? what if they had come onely to ſee the Town of <hi>Plymouth?</hi> Make it thy own caſe, wouldſt thou not judge it hard meaſure for them to doe to thee, as thou haſt done to them?</p>
               <p>Art thou not aſhamed of lying, to ſay they wandred in all parts, when they travelled the direct Road? Or calleſt thou the going about to Preach the Goſpel, a wandring? Did not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and holy men of God doe ſo, and yet were they not as hardly thought of, and reviled by thoſe of thy Generation then, as theſe are now by thee, and thoſe of the ſame Generation, and as wickedly perſecuted, by reaſon of whoſe cruelty they wandred in Deſert, in Mountaines, in Dens and Caves of the earth, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented, of whom the world was not

               <p>What are their wicked and ſad opinions, deſtructive to the true Religion and power of godlineſſe, that (as thou ſayeſt indeed Sir) they hold and have vented in all parts? What are their irregular practiſes in the breach of peace and diſturbance of good people, that they have diſcovered? they are yet to name that are indeed ſo. But thou haſt in this Letter, and thy Warrant, and thy whole carriage towards theſe innocent ſervants of the Lord vented, and manifeſted thy ſad opinions, conceivings, and actings, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy irregular practiſes (though thou art in Commiſſion to doe Juſtice, and wouldſt be eſteemed as a Magiſtrate) in the breach of the peace, and diſturbance of good people, to give an account hereof to Generall <hi>Disbrow,</hi> thou doeſt not bluſh to ſay to him, it is thy duty, on whoſe patience and Juſtice, as bearing the ſword of God againſt evill doing, thou mayeſt well fear thou haſt treſpaſſed, and beg excuſe for thy trouble, and for thy ſelf and Brethren deſire by thankfully acknowledging his former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to retain ſuch an opinion of you, as thoſe that deſire to doe nothing unbecoming Chriſtians, and perſons that deſire the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and peace of this Common-wealth, and Government, when under thy hand, and as aforeſaid, againſt the innocent thou haſt ſo plainly manifeſted the contrary, and yet for thy ſelf and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren art not aſhamed of him to deſire it, who is in Juſtice, you have obliged to viſit the more your tranſgreſſions upon your heads by reaſon of the ill uſe you have made of his former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in acting contrary to the welfares and peace of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and Government, and ſo unbecoming Chriſtians, in diſturbing good people, and oppreſſing the innocent, and in bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſlandering them when you have ſo done; and in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of his favours; and nevertheleſſe to his face, when you have ſo offended, to wipe your mouth, as if you had none iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; in confidence to entreat him to underſtand you as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Now to that of God in thy conſcience, and in the conſciences of thy Brethren, and of all who ſhall read this Relation, whoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was not becoming men, much leſſe Chriſtians, theirs, or thine, and thy Brethren, and who contemn Authority, and deſpiſe Dominion, and diſcover their irregular practiſes in the breach of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168369:30"/>
the peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou, and thy Brethren, who being intruſted as Miniſters of the Law, thus break the Law, or thoſe who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent have the Law thus broken upon them by thy ſelf and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. The Magiſtrate of God is a praiſe to him that doth well, &amp; a terror to the evil doer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.

And who hold many ſad and wicked opinions deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the true Religion and power of godlineſſe; they are thee, who doeſt thus act and write, and art not come ſo much as to the bridling of thy tongue, and ſo all thy Religion is vain.</p>
               <p>And if thou wilt not yet take ſhame, behold theſe lyes and falſe Accuſations in this one Letter of thine, to murder the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſet in Order before thee. On their refuſall to give Bayle for their appearance the next Generall Seſſions to be held for the County of <hi>Devon.</hi> One— And they ſtill refuſing to give Bayle for their appearance as aforeſaid, Two— Indeed Sir, their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age here was not becoming men, much leſſe Chriſtians, Three— And beſides their contempt of Authority, Foure— All the while they were in Priſon, they never ſought God by prayer at any time, Five— Nor deſired a bleſſing on any Creature they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Six— Nor gave thanks for them, Seaven— And they ſhew no occaſion to come to theſe parts, Eight— But wander up and down in all parts, Nine— To vent their wicked Opinions, Ten— And diſcover their irregular practices in the breach of the Peace, and diſturbance of good people, Eleven— Indeed Sir they hold and vent many ſad Opinions deſtructive to the true Religion, and power of Godlineſſe, Twelve—</p>
               <p>And let theſe convince thee, and give judgement againſt thee, that thy tongue is bent like a Bow for lyes, and art not valiant for the truth upon earth, but proceedeſt from evill to evill, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not the Lord: And all lyars ſhall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. And the Devil is the Accuſer of the Brethren, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10. And falſe Accuſers are they who make the dayes perillous, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. And the Lord ſhall cut off all flattering lips, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.3. And he that reſpecteth perſons committeth ſin, and is convinced
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168369:30"/>
of the Law as a Tranſgreſſour, <hi>James</hi> 2.9. And the wages of ſin is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.53.

And <hi>we</hi> deſired, that if either <hi>man or woman had any thing to lay to our charge, they might then ſpeak.</hi> But we never
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168369:33"/>
had our Accuſars brought before us, that we might ſee them, or hear them ſpeak. And for that <hi>George Brooks</hi> ſpake concerning the three perſons of the Trinity, theſe words was ſpoken by one of us, <hi>I know no ſuch Scripture that ſpeaks of the three perſons in the Trinity; but the three that the Scripture ſpeaks of, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one. And the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm by one Spirit, into one body, and the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> declares to be <hi>one;</hi> and <hi>he that hath the Son, hath the father alſo. And this we doe own, he that can receive it, let him.</hi> And no ſuch word was ſpoken by <hi>us,</hi> as <hi>calling him a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſpirit,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Accuſation</hi> is <hi>falſe:</hi> Neither did <hi>we</hi> ſay that <hi>he came to draw away the hearts of the people from God,</hi> as you ſay; for he ſtood up, and vindicated what we had declared, to be truth, and that of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>conſcience</hi> will witneſſe againſt you in this thing. And in that you ſay, <hi>We ſpake to the people not to hearken to him, and that he was a THIEF, and pointed to the Bible which was then in his hand, and other harms to the ſaid</hi> George Brooks, <hi>againſt the peace publick.</hi> Here under a <hi>cloak</hi> of <hi>maliciouſneſſe</hi> have you made <hi>Lyes your refuge,</hi> but with the <hi>light</hi> you are comprehended, and your <hi>works</hi> of <hi>darkneſſe brought to it, and reproved,</hi> for we did neither <hi>call him Thief,</hi> nor <hi>ſay he had ſtollen the Bible that was in his hand,</hi> which you ſay, <hi>we pointed at.</hi> And you ſpeak of <hi>other harms againſt George Brooks,</hi> and ſay, <hi>We meaned that he lyed.</hi> And here you make uſe of <hi>meanings,</hi> as if here were not <hi>falſe</hi> Accuſations ſufficient to drive on your deſign of <hi>Perſecution;</hi> you might have mentioned thoſe <hi>other harms</hi> you ſpeak of, if you knew of any; but it's like you have mentioned the worſt you heard of, which we declare to be <hi>falſe,</hi> as many can witneſſe that heard the diſcourſe, that are inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and friends to the peace of <hi>Englands</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

may hear this thing, under which we ſuffer as if we were <hi>Thieves,</hi> or <hi>Murtherers; we</hi> ſhall lay open to the view of all people, the ground of the Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <q>We being met together at a friends houſe neer <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to wait upon the Lord, there being more people then the houſe would contein, we went into a Garden, and after <hi>we</hi> had ſpoken ſome words of Exhortation to the people and had declared the truth of the experience we had found manifeſted in us, of the free grace of God that brings ſalvation, provoking them to love, and to good works, according to the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as the Spirit gave us utterance at that time. Then <hi>George Brooks</hi> unknown unto us, ſtood up and ſpake to the people, with the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Take heed that yee receive not the grace of God in vain,</hi> with many words in Vindication of what we had ſpoken, witneſſing that it was the eternall truth which we had ſpoken. So after all was ended, ſome began to enter into ſome diſcourſe with him, and one of us asked him whether he could witneſſe what he had ſpoken to be from the life and power of it ſaying, Thou haſt uttered many Scriptures and good words, but it's he that hath the witneſſe in himſelf, that ſets to his ſeal; that God is true. Then directing my ſpeech to all that were there, by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. I ſpake the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians, Let him that ſtole ſteal no more,</hi> with many other words of truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe, which was not to any one in particular.</q>

               <p>SEing the Lord God of power, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth, hath entruſted thee with the power of a Magiſtrate, to bear the Sword of Juſtice, which is for the puniſhment of evil doers and the encouragement of thoſe that doe well, and to rule for him who brings peace on earth, and hath good will towards men, even Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the New Covenant; who is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; who was ſuppoſed to be the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but was the Son of God; and he that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life; and we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding, to know him who is true; and he that hath the Son, hath the Father alſo; and he that hath the witneſſe in himſelf, hath ſet to his ſeale that God is true; he that hath underſtanding, let him read; he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love; and if any man ſay, I love God, and hate his Brother, he is a lyar, for his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is love; and he that rules in love, rules with Authority, and not as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> The Law of God is perfect, and endureth for ever; he is our Judge, and Law-giver, before whom all muſt appear, to give an accompt for all the deeds done in the body, when every man ſhall receive according to his works.</p>
               <p>Now Friend, to thee for Juſtice doe we call, that the truth may be freed from ſcandalls, and falſe reports, and the oppreſſed ſet free, which is pure Religion; that we may have that favour at thy hands, which the Law doth afford, to bring our Accuſers to us, that have any thing to lay to our charge worthy of Bonds, that things may be tryed by the light, and actions weighed in the ballance of equity; that truth may ſpring up out of the Earth, and righteouſneſſe may run down as a mighty ſtream, and peace and Juſtice may kiſſe each other; for know aſſuredly, although
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168369:35"/>
we are counted deceivers, yet are we true; and nothing doe we deſire from thee, as thou art a Magiſtrate, but to have the truth cleared by the light, and truth ſet at liberty; and if there be any that knoweth the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, and hath eternall life abiding in him; we deſire to be tryed by him, even him that is guided by the Spirit of God, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God. And whereas ſome ignorant men ſay, that we deny the Trinity, and the God-head, which is falſe; for God is a Spirit, and as many as are led by the Spirit, are the Sons of God, and the Father Son and Spirit are one; and this we witneſſe according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and this God is but one, in whom all things live, move, and have their being, who is above all, and in all, and through all, God bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>And for the word Trinity, there is no ſuch Scripture as ſpeaks of a Trinity; ſo in tenderneſſe of conſcience, and love to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, which gave forth the Scriptures, we dare not wreſt them nor ſpeak any other language, nor add nor diminiſh from them. So Friend, to the light of Jeſus Chriſt in thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the meaſure of the Spirit of Truth, doe we exhort thee to take heed that the ſpirituall man judge all things in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and truth. So we remain Priſoners of the Lord, not as evill doers, our conſcience bearing us witneſſe in the preſence of the Lord in whom is everlaſting ſtrength, who are friends of the Truth, and of the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>FOraſmuch as it hath pleaſed thee to caſt us into Priſon, and haſt Examined us, and haſt found no breach of any Law, by which thou can'ſt lawfully puniſh us; but under a pretence hath tendred us an Oath to ſwear againſt the Supremacy and Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. We doe in the preſence of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, deny the Pope, and all things therein mentioned, with as much deteſtation as thou thy ſelf, or any in the world can, or doth; our conſciences alſo bearing us witneſſe, in the preſence of our God, who is able to deliver us, although we are caſt into a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; nay, if we be caſt into a Den of Lyons, and a fiery Furnace, with the three Children, as you may read in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that would not fall down to worſhip the Image, neither will we diſobey the Command of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Above all things, my brethren, ſwear not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by any other Oath, but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, leſt you fall into condemnation.</hi> And all that doth the will of God, ſhall know of the doctrine of Chriſt; and whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath both the Father, and the Son. If any come unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, nor bid him God ſpeed; and this we doe affirm, that ſwearing is out of the doctrine of Chriſt, although you may alledge many Scriptures for Swearing, as in the firſt Covenant; and that an Oath among men for confirmation, is to them an end of all ſtrife; but he that is made the Surety of a better Covenant, who hath put an end to all ſtrife, where it is witneſſed, ſaith, <hi>Swear not at
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168369:36"/>
all;</hi> although that you may alledge that the Angels ſwore, yet know this, that when he bringeth his firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, <hi>Let the Angels of God worſhip him:</hi> So we lay it upon thee to witneſſe for us, or againſt us, whether Yea or nay is not to be preferred before ſwearing, by all thoſe who profeſſe Religion, ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt hath commanded not to ſwear at all; and he ſaith, <hi>If yee love me, keep my Commandements;</hi> and if we ſuffer impriſonment for keeping the Commandements of Chriſt, it is not grievous to us; for we refuſe not to ſwear, for any guiltineſſe that is in us, or that can be charged upon us, for we are againſt all falſe wayes, falſe worſhips, falſe Lawes, but we deny ſwearing, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath commanded us, not to ſwear at all. So if we be kept in Priſon, let it never be ſaid by you, That it is for any thing, but becauſe we dare not ſwear, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that to diſobey the Commandements of Chriſt, is the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> who was driven out from the preſence of God, and became a Fugitive, and a Vagabond; and this ſome of you would charge upon us, to be Vagabonds, who in tenderneſſe of conſcience, and in the obedience to the light of Jeſus Chriſt, and in love to him, our lives are not dear to us, to lay down, if it be required, for the confeſſion of him before men, and the keeping of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; for to this end are we called; <hi>and our rejoycing is in this, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, our converſations hath been, and is honeſt,</hi> as many can witneſſe for us againſt thoſe, who in their wiſedome goe about to entrap and enſnare the innocent: And this we write, not to juſtifie our ſelves but for the ſake of the ſimple ones, who have heard many lyes and falſe reports of us; of this doe we put thee in mind, not that thou art ignorant that all the glory and honour belongeth to the Lord God, who hath ſaid, <hi>He will not give his glory unto another;</hi> and <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, ſaith the Lord,</hi> who will eaſe himſelf of all his Adverſaries, and recompence tribulation to them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, afflict, or offend one of the leaſt that believe in his Name.
