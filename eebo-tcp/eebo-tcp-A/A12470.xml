         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

&amp;c. You ſhall vnderſtand
that after many croſſes in the downes
by tempeſts wee arriued ſafely vppon
the Southweſt part of the great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries:
within foure or fiue daies after
we ſet ſaile for <hi>Dominica,</hi> the 26. of
Aprill: the firſt land we made, wee fell
with Cape <hi>Henry,</hi> the verie mouth of
the Bay of <hi>Chiſſiapiacke,</hi> which at that preſent we little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
hauing by a cruell ſtorme bene put to the Northward:
anchoring in this Bay twentie or thirtie went a ſhore with
the Captain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in comming aboard, they were aſſalted with
certaine Indians, which charged them within Piſtoll ſhot: in
which conflict, Captaine <hi>Archer</hi> and <hi>Mathew Morton</hi> were
ſhot: wherupon, Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> ſeconding them, made a
ſhot at them, which the Indians little reſpected, but hauing
ſpent their arrowes retyred without harme and in that place
was the Bar opened, wherin the Counſell for <hi>Virginia</hi> was
nonnnated: and arriuing at the place where we are now ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Counſell was ſworne, the Preſident elected, which for
that yeare was Maiſter <hi>Edm. Maria Wingfield,</hi> where was
<pb facs="tcp:26291:7"/>
made choice for our ſcituation, a verie fit place for the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all out prouiſion was brought a ſhore, and with as

            <p>The two and twenty day of Aprill, Captain <hi>Newport</hi> and
my ſelfe with diuers others, to the number of twenty two

the Countrie (for the moſte part) on each ſide plaine high

kindely intreating vs, daunſing and feaſting vs with ſtraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,

deſcribed vnto vs the courſe of the Riuer, and after in our

we returned to the fals, leauing a mariner in pawn with
the Indians for a guide of theirs, hee that they honoured for
King followed vs by the riuer. That afternoone we trifled in
looking vpon the Rockes and riuer (further he would not goe)
ſo there we erected acroſſe, and that night taking our man at
<hi>Powhatans,</hi> Cap. <hi>Newport</hi> congratulated his kindenes with
a Gown and a Hatchet: returning to <hi>Arſetecke,</hi> and ſtayed
there the next day to obſerue the height therof, &amp; ſo with many

            <p>That night paſſing by <hi>Weanock</hi> ſome twentie miles from

ſeemed little to affect vs, but as wee departed and lodged at

kindely to content vs, yet we might perceiue many ſignes of
a more Iealouſie in them then before, and alſo the Hinde that
the King of <hi>Arſeteck</hi> had giuen vs, altered his reſolution in

September there was about 46. of our men dead, at which

            <p>Our prouiſion being now within twentie dayes ſpent, the

As yet we had no houſes to couer vs, our Tents were

for the company, who notwithſtanding our miſery, little
ceaſed their mallice, grudging and mattering. As at this time
were moſt of our chiefeſt men either ſicke or diſcontented, the
reſt being in ſuch diſpaire, as they would rather ſtarue and
rot with idlenes, then be perſwaded to do any thing for their

I was ſent to the mouth of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> riuer, to <hi>Kegquouhtan</hi> an

but our fiſhing we could not effect by reaſon of the ſtormy

altered their conceits, for now they were no leſſe deſirous of

foure ſhot I viſited them, with fiſh, oyſters, bread and déere,
they kindly trades with me and my men, beeing no leſſe in

twentie men haue fraighted a Shippe with Corne: The
Towne conteineth eighteene houſes, pleaſantly ſeated vpon

With ſixteene buſhells of Corne I returned towards our
