            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THe Title-page of the Book preſented here to thy view, does ſufficiently inform thee, what in the general thou art to expect therein. The book is ſo little, and may be read over in ſo ſhort a time, that it is altogether needleſs to give a furthor account of its Contents. A large Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face me thinks would be uncomely, as being unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Building: And indeed thou hadſt not at all been troubled with any Proem how ſhort ſoever; If I had not a few words to ſpeak touching my work in this Engliſh Narrative. Although I was much perſwaded and well aſſured in my ſelf, that a Work of this kind might be of great advantage to thoſe of my Countrey men, who have ears for no other but their Mother tongue, eſpecially to them who have been abuſed by the Tongues or Pens of any, that have expoſed to obliq<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y and reproach the venerable names of theſe two reverend men, which alas! many have done, eſpecially as to <hi>Arminius:</hi> for the other, I mean <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> has not been ſo generally taken notice of, and his name was not here ſo publickly known, till the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which both of them contended and ſuffered for, was more commonly known and received amongſt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet was
<pb facs="tcp:55680:3"/>
it far from me to undertake of meer choice this endeavour, being not ſo well conceited of mine own abilities, as to thruſt my ſelf into this Imployment, nor ſo deſtitute of work as to need this for ſecuring and keeping my ſelf out of idleneſs; but by the importunate ſolicitation of ſome good men, I was prevailed with, and drawn unto it. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of Dr. <hi>Arminius</hi> is nothing elſe but that Elegant Latin Oration, here turned into plain Engliſh, which learned <hi>Bertius</hi> delivered in ſuch an Aſſembly, where he could not deliver untruths and remain undetected. I have indeed ſcarce pleaſed my ſelf in tranſlating ſo Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and verbatim the Teſtimonies there produced: Yet have ſo done, that ſome might not be diſpleaſed, who deem ſuch a tranſlation in ſuch caſes to be at leaſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. That which thou haſt here touching <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> is taken chiefly out of that excellent and large Preface, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to one of the Volumes of his Works, and written by <hi>Stephen Curcellaeus</hi> of bleſſed memory. In what I have done in the whole I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither am I unwilling to conſtitute mine Enemies judges of the performance, in caſe they be fit to examine, and not reſolved to be unrighteous in judgment. Reader, I ſhall no longer detain thee from the profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of reading the following Narrative, which God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty bleſs to thy uſe.

            <p>AS heretofore I have oft experienc'd, how hard and how difficult a thing it is, to ſpeak of Excellent perſons in an aſſembly of Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men: So now eſpecially I have thereof a ſenſible knowledge, it being my task at preſent to ſpeak in this place concerning that Reverend man Mr. <hi>James Arminius,</hi> Dr. of ſacred Theologie, and this after the ſad ſolemnity of his Funeral. For ſith that a good man is the rule and meaſure of things, he therefore; that would deſcribe to others ſuch a perſon, muſt be carefull to chooſe out and offer ſuch things to their view, by which humane life may receive advantage in the ſtudy of vertue. Good things that lie in ſecret, muſt be brought on the ſtage and made publick, and thoſe things which either Modeſty hath concealed, or Envy diminiſhed, or Calumny defamed, or which others through want of skill have not obſerved, thoſe things I ſay, when the curtain's drawn back and a light brought
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55680:4"/>
in, muſt be ſhown openly, and declared by words, that all may behold what in every one is moſt praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and what is fit for their imitation. Whence it comes to paſs, that the greater every ones vertue is, the more difficult it is to act the Orotors part in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him: for the greateſt Envy keeps company with the greateſt Vertue. And ſith that a wiſe man doth nothing without Reaſon; and it being difficult to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and unfold at every turn the principles and cauſes of particular actions, on which the judgment to be made of every thing does depend; it muſt needs be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to judge of excellent perſons, all whoſe life is full of diverſe examples, for the well inſtructing of others, how to judge, how alſo to live. And this alſo may be added, that he who takes upon him this imployment muſt very frequently have recourſe from the law to a mans life, and from his life to the law: for theſe need each the other, and as the law gives notice what muſt be done: ſo what may be done the life ſheweth. Now a wiſe man hath both theſe in himſelf; juſt after the example of Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, who firſt ſaid, <hi>Learn of me</hi>: and of his Apoſtle who thus admoniſheth, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt</hi> And as heretofore <hi>Polycletus,</hi> not contenting himſelf that he had written a book, wherein he had noted all things to be obſerv'd by him that would artificially make the image or ſtatue of a man, did himſelf afterwrrds make the ſtatue of a man, leſt he ſhould ſeem to preſcribe that to others which himſelf hap not obſerved, and this ſtatue made publick he call'd the Canon or Rule, commanding that the lineaments of art ſhould be fetch'd thence as from a law of direction: So a good man, when he hath admoniſh'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55680:4"/>
others what they muſt doe, does firſt himſelf perform, what he preſcribes to others. Now it is hard, either to bring all a wiſe mans actions to their proper rule and law, or in one to find the Examples of all laws. But as for me, who am at this day to ſpeak in this honourable aſſembly of learned men, concerning the life and death of that Reverend and Incomparable man, Doctor <hi>James Arminius,</hi> not only thoſe difficulties, which I have now mentioned ſtand in my way, but many others alſo. My Grief, yet freſh, for the loſs of a friend preſſeth me; the conſideration of a ſad family, an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted wife, nine fatherleſs children diſturbs me; the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Univerſity moves me; but I am aſtoniſhed to think of the Church and Common wealth deprived of a man ſo greatly uſefull. All which things, in a wound ſo freſh, not yet skinn'd over, may eaſily put to a loſs the moſt eloquent and the wiſeſt man whoſoever he be. To what hath been ſpoken may be added, That he himſelf, whilſt he liv'd, greatly diſlik'd all pompous funeral ſolemnities: for he knew, that the firſt ſtep to the veneration and worſhiping of Saints was hence, and he deem'd, that it unbecomes us to deſire and uſe ſuch Solemnities, that had ſuch hazards attending on them. But ſeeing our preſent condition ſeems to be ſuch, that we need not in the leaſt to be afraid of this (for alas! hitherto are we come, that henceforth it may ſeem need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to uſe diligent care, rather to bring in devotion, than drive ſuperſtition out) And ſith that it concerns all men, that examples of vertue being drawn forth ſhould be propoſed for all to look upon, I have, according to the cuſtom, through the requeſt of friends, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate willing it, undertaken that difficult task, which I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55680:5"/>
could not refuſe without the violation of Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the breach of the obligation of that friendſhip, which I have maintain'd with him from my very youth. Which things being ſo, I hope there will no reprehender of this my duty be found in this aſſembly of excellent oratours, in which there is no one but is able more grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and elegantly to perform this charge, than my ſelf. Notwithſtanding, I beſeech and moſt humbly intreat you, Magnificent, Reverend and moſt learned Auditors, to ſuffer the things I ſhall ſpeak to be of credit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with you,</p>
            <p>We have committed to the boſom of the earth the body of that Reverend man, Mr. <hi>James Arminius</hi> (or rather the temple of the holy Ghoſt) which has been ſhaken, worn, broken with labours, watchings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, diſeaſes, troubles. We have committed it, I ſay, in certain hope of a bleſſed reſurrection, which he himſelf, whileſt he liv'd, believ'd, and unto which he directed all his thoughts and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The place of his birth was <hi>Oldwater,</hi> a little Town long ſince made famous by the interflowing river <hi>Iſala,</hi> and the pleaſantneſs with the fruitfulneſs of the adjacent country, and the frugality with the induſtry of its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. He in this Town firſt ſaw the Sun in the year 1560. in which year the Conference at <hi>Poſſiack</hi> in <hi>France</hi> began; in which conference our Deputies plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of two thouſand one hundred and ninety Churches, that did humbly and earneſtly deſire of the King, peace and tranquility, and the liberty of profeſſing their faith. This year, this <hi>Oldwater,</hi> as another <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> gave <hi>Arminius,</hi> as another <hi>Lacon,</hi> to the world: which Town notwithſtanding at other times brought

            <p>There was then in that Town a certain Prieſt, a man honeſt and grave, <hi>Theodore Aemylius</hi> by name, whoſe memory, by reaſon of his ſingular learning and holineſs of life, is yet bleſſed among the living· He, when he had got a taſt of a better and more pure doctrin in Religion, determin'd with himſelf, that he would not once more celebrate the abominable ſacrifice of the Maſs: therefore he oft changed his place of abode, and lived ſometimes at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Lovane,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Colon,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi> He therefore took care, that this fatherleſs child, <hi>James Arminius,</hi> ſo ſoon as his age was capable of inſtruction, might be furniſhed with the firſt rudiments of the Latin and Greek tongue, and with the principles of true piety and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when he perceiv'd in him ſome appearances of an excellent diſpoſition to vertue, he oft times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him; that all conſiderations of earthly things being layd aſide and contemned, he would give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to follow after God and his conſcience. He told him, that the time of mans life here is but ſhort; that there follows a condition after this life, which ſhould be eſtimated not by outward adverſity or proſperity, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55680:6"/>
by the Eternity of happineſs or death. This Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, afterwards confirmed by a diligent reading of the holy Scriptures, and pious meditations, was ſetled upon his heart: And ſo he, through the hope of that life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent every labour, all hazards, with a glad and chearful mind. But after he had for ſome years thus liv'd ot <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> an unexpected calamity did oppreſs him, by means of the death of that good old Religious man, which the merciful God did ſuddenly mitigate; for preſently upon his death Mr. <hi>Snellius,</hi> who long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flying the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tyranny, went to <hi>Marpurg,</hi> came as it hapned out of <hi>Haſſia</hi> into that Countrey. He therefore carried away with him into <hi>Haſſia,</hi> in the year 1575. this his Country-man <hi>Arminius,</hi> now deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all humane help and ſuccour. He was ſcarce ſet down there, when in the Moneth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the report of his Countreys deſolation is brought thither; He hears that the Town was taken by the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; that the Garriſon were ſlain; that the Townſmen were kill'd, and the Town burnt. With this report he was ſo much ſtricken at the heart and ſo greatly troubled, that he ſpent 14 whole days, in continual weeping and tears: Therefore as one impatient he left <hi>Haſſia</hi> and went with ſpeed into <hi>Holland,</hi> being determined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee the ruines of his Country, or to looſe his life.</p>
            <p>When he was come thither, he found nothing but where the Town ſtood, and the ruines of it: and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that moſt of its Inhabitants were finally ſlain, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Mother, his Siſters, his Brothers and his Kindred: He therefore returned even on foot out of his own Country, to <hi>Marpurg</hi> in <hi>Haſſia.</hi> In the mean while this new Academy was erected and opened by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55680:6"/>
authority of the moſt Illuſtrious Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; which as ſoon as he underſtood, he prepar'd for a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney home. He came therefore to <hi>Roterdam,</hi> to which place were come from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> many faithfull Exiles, and moſt of <hi>Old-waters</hi> Inhabitants, that had eſcaped the ſword of a cruel enemy. At that time my Father <hi>Peter Bertius,</hi> was the Paſtor of that Church: but Mr. <hi>John Taffinus</hi> was the Princ's <hi>French</hi> Preacher and Counſellor; both theſe were wonderfully pleaſed with the young mans towardlineſs, readineſs and wit. Now ſeeing it was long before my Father was acquainted with learning (for he was 30. years old before he had any knowledge even of the Latin tongue) he upon requeſt of friends, took the young man very willingly into his houſe. Now it was the purpoſe of friends to ſend him to this new Univerſity; which occaſion my Father thinking not good to neglect, calls me out of <hi>England,</hi> when I was then a Student, applying my ſelf to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: both of us therefore were ſent together into this School: from that time there has been always between us a very great intimacy, familiarity and friendſhip: But I will not ſpeak of the paſſages of that time. This one thing I will ſay, that our young Scholars endeavour in learning and in the ſtudy of wiſdom, was ſo great, their reverence towards their Teachers ſo great, their zeal and earneſt affection in Religion ſo great, that greater could hardly be: But in our rank <hi>Arminius</hi> was one that excel'd the reſt; if any thing was to be written, if any thing to be ſpoken, <hi>Arminius</hi> was ſought for: If then aroſe any debate in learning that required a <hi>Palamon, Arminius</hi> was conſulted with. I remember when Dr. <hi>Lambert Danaeus,</hi> our Profeſſor,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55680:7"/>
did commend him publickly for his natural endowments, and for his proficiency, and for his vertue; and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to enter on the ſtudy of Divinity with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, after his example. Why ſhould I make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here of his ſtudy in Poetry, in which he excel'd? Why ſhould I ſpeak of his ſtudy in the Mathematicks, and in the other parts of Philoſophie? He toucht no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe, which he did not penetrate, he ſet upon nothing, which he did not happily finiſh.</p>
            <p>Thus we are come to the year 1582. in which year the honourable Senate of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſent him away to <hi>Geneva</hi>; for his more abundant proficiency in learning. Whither when he was come, he heard that reverend old man, and of bleſſed memory, Mr. <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> expounding the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> with the great admiration of all men; for there was in <hi>Beza</hi> beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortals a flexanimous and perſwaſive eloquence, a prompt and ready utterance, perſpicuity of ſpeech, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of voice, but excellent doctrine in the judgment of all learned men. Him therefore above all others <hi>Arminius</hi> made choice of to imitate and follow, But ſeeing he could not forthwith procure to himſelf the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſome Principal men in this School, and that (to ſpeak the truth) only upon the account of <hi>Ramus</hi>'s Philoſophy, which with earneſtneſs he defended pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and did alſo in private teach it to his auditors, he was provok'd to go to <hi>Baſil.</hi> Where what great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was confer'd, on the young man, what were the preſages and divinings of men of all ranks concerning his growing vertue, they are able to teſtifie, who were his fellow travellers, and companions in this his peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But he ſo heard theſe judgments and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55680:7"/>
that he never waxt proud and arrogant, but ſhewed in very deed, that he was unwilling to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by ambition, but was willing by true vertue to come unto that, whereto he was deſigned by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Baſile</hi> in the harveſt Feſtivals the more learned Students are wont out of the ordinary courſe, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe-ſake to teach ſomething in the Univerſity, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties publickly. This labour our <hi>Arminius</hi> willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, for this he was praiſ'd by that reverend man, Mr. <hi>James Grinaus,</hi> who alſo oft times honoured his lectures by his Preſence. The ſame man alſo in publick diſputations, if any thing more weighty than ordinary were propoſed, or an intricate matter worthy a defender, did occur, was not afraid for honours ſake to call our <hi>Arminius,</hi> ſitting among a great number of Students; and (that you may know the candor of <hi>Grinaeus</hi>) to ſay. <hi>Let my Hollander anſwer for me.</hi> At this time <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was in ſo great favour and renown for his learning, that when he was about to depart thence for <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Theological faculty would have conferr'd on him, even at the publick charge, the title of Doctor, which he, eſteeming it too great a dignity for one of his years, did at that time modeſtly refuſe, and gave them thanks for their grace and favour.</p>
            <p>When he was come back to <hi>Geneva,</hi> he found the minds of his friends more pacified towards <hi>Ramus's Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>; alſo he himſelf thinking it ſomething meet to abate ſomewhat of his earneſtneſs, did ſo order himſelf, that all might eaſily perceive, that gentleneſs conjoyn'd with ſo great a wit brought no ſmall ornament to his age. There were at the ſame time in the City the Sons
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55680:8"/>
of the chief of our Nobility, moſt of which now are in eminent and honourable places in our Republick. When ſome of theſe were gone into <hi>Italy,</hi> others of them called home, he ſeeing himſelf alone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all others his companions, excepting one, a man of very great dignity now in <hi>Holland</hi>; he alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to go with ſpeed into <hi>Italy,</hi> being inclin'd thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eſpecially through the fame of <hi>James Zabarella,</hi> who then at <hi>Padua</hi> profeſſed Philoſohhy, and was greatly followed. For his ſake eſpecially he ſtayed at <hi>Padua,</hi> when he inſtructed in Logick ſome noble <hi>Germans.</hi> But afterwards he took a curſory view of the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> on which journey he ſpent not above eight months, and at <hi>Rome</hi> he was never abſent from that companion of his, who was to him as another <hi>Achates</hi>: for ſo it was agreed on before they went from <hi>Geneva.</hi> They uſ'd the ſame lodging, the ſame table, the ſame bed; they went in and out together; and for the exerciſe of piety they carried with them the Greek Teſtament and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Pſalter.</p>
            <p>I remember he was wont often to tell, That <hi>Italy</hi> brought to him many commodities and diſcommodities. Among the commodities he plac'd this eſpecially, That he had ſeen at <hi>Rome</hi> the myſtery of iniquity to be far more filthy and abominable than ever he had conceiv'd it in his mind: for he ſaid, that the things which are told or read concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Court of <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> are Trifles in compariſon of the things which he had ſeen. Among the diſcommodities this; That the honourable Senate of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was then ſomewhat offended at him for that his <hi>Italian</hi> journey, ſome in the mean while augmenting their their diſpleaſure, who clearly had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55680:8"/>
done better in ſuſpending their opinions till his return. Hence then an occaſion being taken, it was noyſ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common people, That he had kiſt the <hi>Popes,</hi> pantofle; whom he had never ſeen but as other ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did, in a great throng and croud of people. (And indeed that Beaſt is not wont to give this honour to any but Kings and Princes.) Alſo, that he was accuſtom'd to hear the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> when as he never heard them; That he was acquainted with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw; That he had abjur'd the orthodox Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas he was ready to contend for it even to the loſs of his life.</p>
            <p>Now let our Youth that are pious and devoted to the Church learn this from anothers harm, That it is better never to ſet foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> than with ſo great an hazard of their repute to know the myſteries of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Not becauſe it is more dangerous for them to ſee <hi>Italy,</hi> than neighbouring <hi>Antwerp,</hi> or <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> or <hi>Brugs:</hi> for in <hi>Italy</hi> there is much more liberty, and in theſe places more ſuperſtition by far. And it is ſafer to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> than <hi>Brabant</hi> or <hi>Flanders</hi>: but becauſe it is expedient to take all occaſions of evil ſpeaking from the adverſary, and all occaſions of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmiſing from thoſe that are unadviſed and imprudent. And it is better to prevent an occaſion of offence, than to excuſe it.</p>
            <p>Being come out of <hi>Italy</hi> he ſtayed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſome months after being called home he returned to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to his <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> furniſhed, <hi>through the grace of Chriſt, with a clear teſtimony</hi> from them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>with a mind very well fitted to do office, if it might pleaſe the Lord God to uſe his miniſtry,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55680:9"/>
for his work in his Church:</hi> For theſe are the very words of Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> Epiſtle, the original of which I have in remembrance. At <hi>Amsterdam</hi> he did eaſily, with grave and prudent men, clear himſelf as to his <hi>Italian</hi> journey: but indeed the weak brethren went on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt it, and in their aſſemblings blaming it till he himſelf began to be heard in the Church, in which as ſoon as he was beheld, it cannot be ſpoken, with how much reſpect men of all ranks flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hear him: For there was in him (as ye know) a certain incredible gravity mixed with gracefull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs. His voice indeed was ſlender, but ſweet, and loud, and piercing, but he had an admirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive faculty. If any thing were to be adorn'd, he ſo did it, as not to exceed the truth. If he were to teach any thing, he did it with clearneſs and perſpicuity. If he were to diſpute any thing, he manag'd the ſame diſtinctly. Now the Melody and altering of his voice was ſo fitted to things, that it ſeemed to flow from them. And ſith he did not uſe a Rhetorical dreſs, and the Greeks boxes of pleaſant ointment: it was either becauſe his nature did abhor them, or becauſe he judged it unworthy the majeſty of Divine things; to uſe curles, and borrowed ornaments, when as the naked truth is of its ſelf ſufficient for its own defence: notwithſtanding he ſo efficaciouſly perſwaded by force and weight of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and by the pithineſs of his ſentences, and by the authority of Scripture it ſelf, that no man ever heard him, but confeſſ'd, that his diſcourſes much affected him. Some therefore at that time called him the poliſhing life of truth; others the whetſtone and ſharpner of wits; others called him the razor ſhaving off growing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55680:9"/>
errors, and nothing in Religion, and ſacred Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy was thought to favour well, that did not reliſh with <hi>Arminius.</hi> Alſo the Paſtors and Preachers themſelves of that City, men both learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, did reverence him for his learning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly acknowledge themſelves to have been dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very much advantaged by his Sermons. And thus our <hi>Arminius</hi> with ſpread out ſayles, proſperous gales, a full company of rowers, and the good wiſhes of all that knew him, was carried towards fame and glory, when it pleaſed God to exerciſe his ſervant even with adverſity, and to make a tryal of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and humbleneſs by the croſs and afflictions. Now 'tis a thing worth the knowing, to underſtand the beginnings and ſucceſs hereof.</p>
            <p>There was carried about as it chanced in the hands of ſome pious men a little Book, written by ſome of the brethren of the Church of <hi>Delf,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> with this Title. <hi>An anſwer to ſome arguments of</hi> Beza <hi>and</hi> Calvin <hi>out of a Treatiſe concerning prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination on the</hi> 9. <hi>Chap to the</hi> Romans. This little book was ſent over to our <hi>Arminius</hi> by Mr. <hi>Martin Lidy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of bleſſed memory, who had been formerly a Paſtor in the Church of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but then was Profeſſor in the <hi>Friezlanders</hi> new Academy, and by him <hi>Arminius</hi> was requeſted to undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> againſt the brethren of <hi>Delf.</hi> For <hi>Arminius</hi> was verily thought a man very fit for this buſineſs by Mr. <hi>Lidyus,</hi> who partly by report, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by experience knew the quickneſs of his wit, the ſharpneſs of his judgment, and what a wonderful
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55680:10"/>
force and power he had both in preaching and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, Neither was <hi>Arminius</hi> altogether ſtrange from this deſign, being one that newly coming out of the School of <hi>Geneva,</hi> carryed about with him in his ears the ſound of Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> lectures and arguments. He therefore betakes himſelf to the work; But whilſt he endeavours a refutation, whilſt he weighs the arguments on each ſide, whilſt he confers the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whilſt he torments and wearys himſelf, he was overcome by the truth. At firſt indeed he followed that ſame opinion which he undertook to oppoſe, but he afterwards by the guidance of the holy Ghoſt was carried over to that doctrin, which he conſtantly aſſerted even to the end of his life: Which was this; That Gods eternal Decree in predeſtination, was not to elect or chuſe preciſely and abſolutely ſome to ſalvation, whom as yet he had not purpoſed to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; (which Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> would have) neither was it, preciſely and abſolutely to elect ſome to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the decree of their creation and the foreſight of their fall, but without an antecedent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt; (which the Delfian brethren held) Bu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it was, To elect to ſalvation them of the created and fallen, who in time to come would by true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith anſwer to God calling them thereunto: Which by learned <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Nicholaus He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius,</hi> and many more divines beſides, hath been aſſerted.</p>
            <p>And although ſuch in times paſt hath been the liberty of our Churches, and even now is in very many places, that in this Argument, in which no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55680:10"/>
ancient Synod hath ever determined any thing, any one of the multitude, and a Teacher, might always without offence to any one chooſe this or that: for to omit others, Dr. <hi>Jo. Holmannus Secundus,</hi> who by the very grave advice of excellent Divines, and eſpecially of the Lords Curators was called forth, after Mr. <hi>Pezelius</hi> and <hi>Mollenius</hi> and others were ſollicited in vain, taught it out of this very place: He imbraced (as we know) the opinion of <hi>Hemingius,</hi> and ſharply defended it. Not withſtanding there were not thoſe wanting at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> that in this matter were troubleſome to <hi>Arminius,</hi> and that accuſed him for departing from the common and received opinion in our Churches, but their vehemency and fiercneſs was ſuddenly repreſſ'd and appeaſ'd by the authority of the Senate, and the equanimity and moderation of the brethren; ſo that he always lived with his Collegues at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> quietly, yea friendly and brotherly, without any cloud of diſpleaſure, or hatred, or envy. And alſo this man of God was not only naturally diſpoſ'd to candor and gentleneſs, but alſo was moreover ſo formed and faſhioned thereto by the holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Spirit of Chtiſt, that he did quietly bear with him that diſſented from him, and did not eaſily deſpair of any one, that was but willing to hear Chriſt ſpeaking in Scriptures: which by his divine moderation and equinimity we all knew, and have by ſo much the more admired it, by how much the further we, by the teſtimony of our own conſcience, perceive our ſelves yet to be from theſe good things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55680:11"/>Now when the Univerſity, deprived of her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors by the death of thoſe famous and excellent men, Dr. <hi>Junius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Luke Trelcatius</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſought for an <hi>Hercules</hi> that might ſuſtain this Orb (which in the mean while that Reverend man Dr. <hi>Francis Gomarus,</hi> being deſtitute of all his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, did as another <hi>Atlas</hi> ſupport alone) they by the general vote, and the publick conſent of their country, came to <hi>Arminius,</hi> who thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, was taking care for the church of Chriſt at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> which he had ſerved now fifteen years. But when they of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> profeſt that they could not be without his endeavours amongſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as they ſaid, they had chiefly him, by whom they might oppoſe the growing monſters of hereſies, it cannot be ſpoken how great then the conſternation of good men was. They variouſly deliberate and adviſe, no ſtone is left unturned. The Curatours of our Univerſity, <hi>viz.</hi> moſt noble <hi>Douſa</hi> and <hi>Neoſtadius,</hi> went themſelves in the publick name, together with that moſt honourable man, <hi>Nicholaus Zeyſtius</hi> the Syndick of our Common-wealth. To the ſame end Mr. <hi>Jo. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tembogardus,</hi> Paſtor of the Church at the <hi>Hague,</hi> was ſent by the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince. and alſo <hi>Nicholaus Cromhouſius</hi> out of the ſupream Court. All theſe after a diverſe manner did earneſtly move and perſwade the moſt prudent Senate of this Common wealth, and the Conſiſtorie of the Paſtors and Elders. At length by many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, intreaties, and alſo the interceſſion it ſelf of moſt illuſtrious Prince, it was hardly obtain'd, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55680:11"/>
he ſhould be diſmiſſed from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and ſerve the Univerſity. Nevertheleſs petty Rumours of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, which moſt commonly are wont to ſubvert the beſt endeavours, did withſtand him, againſt which he ſet the ſhield of his innocency and candour and learning; Truſting in this, he confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the bleſſing of God in that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. This matter therefore being heard and debated at the <hi>Hague</hi> before the Lords Curators in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſome grave Divines, it was found, <hi>That thoſe ſuſpicions were ill ſupported, and that there was no cauſe why any one ſhould have an ill opinion of that faithfull ſervant of Christ: for they found, that he uſed the allowed liberty of propheſying in the Church, had taught nothing which was contrary to the Chriſtian religion.</hi> He then firſt obtained in this Univerſity, with the good liking of God and men, the degree of a Doctor, which in the year 1603 that reverend man Dr. <hi>Francis Gomarus</hi> conferred on him here in this very place. Thus then <hi>James Arminius</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Francis Junius,</hi> the Curators ſo commanding it. And that nothing might be wanting here to his credit and authority by reaſon of thoſe things that had been given out at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> it pleaſed the Eccleſiaſtical Presbyters to commend him to all godly, honeſt and learned men, by adorning him at his departure with a very fair teſtimony which foundeth thus.</p>

Wherefore that we may briefly ſay all in a word (becauſe his very great both piety and probity, and his ſingular learning, ſeems after a ſort by their proper right to challenge it to themſelves) we ſo commend to all godly, vertuous, and learned men, this honourable Gentleman, and our moſt reverend brother in Chriſt, that with greater affection and more heartily we are not able to commend, Dated in our Conſiſtory at <hi>Amſterdam, September</hi> 8th 1603.</p>

adorned to this very day his holy calling.

               <p>Have the Brethren honourably and laudably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough teſtified of <hi>Arminius?</hi> thus then he came into the Univerſity. From this time all his Collegues have had experience of him as a moſt Faithful friend; The Schools as a Senator, Profeſſor. Rector; all the Students as a moſt gentle Father.</p>
               <p>Suddenly after his entrance into the Univerſity he found, that the Students of ſacred Theology, did entangle themſelves in the thickets of queſtions,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55680:14"/>
and did follow Thorny Theormes and Problemes, the Scriptures being neglected. This evil, after the matter had been communicated to his Collegues, he ſtudied to amend, and did in a great meaſure effect it, for he brought back the antient, and maſculine, and mighty kind of ſtudying; and drew back as much as in him lay: the wandring youth to the Fountains of Salvation (thoſe pure and ſlimeleſs Fountains) that out of them Religion might be ſought for: not that Religion which being ſatisfied with wrangling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates or bare ſpeculation is gotten to feed the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie; but that which breaths out charity, and follows the truth which is after godlineſs, by which youth learn to fly youthful luſts, and having ſubdued fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allurements, to ſhun the pollutions of the world, and to do and ſuffer thoſe things, that make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between a Chriſtian and an Heathen. That ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſes, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>: he did repeat often to fix the ſame upon their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the conſideration of Chriſtians ſo miſerably divided, and driven aſunder one from another, troubled him; he ſeldom ſpake of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears, never without deep and hearty ſighs. He declared, that he wiſhed all the ſcattered members of Chriſt might grow together in one body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lords Commandment. He rightly judged, that the Papal Court ſought not the things which are of Chriſt; but the pleaſures, the honours,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55680:14"/>
the lucre, the pomp of this preſent world, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over the ſouls as well as the bodies of men: And therefore that no man could or ought to conſult with that Harlot about matters of Salvation, and the eſtabliſhing of a common peace. He judged, that a great part of others were conſcienciouſly and piouſly affected; and were not divided not ſo much through an evil intent and purpoſe, as through doubtfull am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages or obſcurities in which many were driven from peace and concord by ignorance, many by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Anceſtours; many through pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or ſtiffneſs in thoſe opinions which either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had deviſed or long defended, many through ſhame of revoking and retracting their writings, laſtly many through prejudice and an ill opinion of their brethren. All which he thought might be remedyed, not by killing one another, but by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and by peaceable and friendly inſtruction, and by the example of an holy converſation. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both exhorted all to piety, and eſpecially took care of this, that when thornie queſtions and the huge luggage of vain and empty aſſertions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and taken away, with which the Schools make an huge confuſed noiſe; thoſe things might be fetcht only out of the Scriptures which might be uſefull to bring them to the belief of neceſſary things, and to lead a good and bleſſed Chriſtian life. Which endeaur of his, Satan going about to elude and fruſtrate endeavoured to perſwade the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that theſe things were done by him to get honour to ſhew the ſtrength of his wit to cauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55680:15"/>
innovations, to maintain contention and wrangling. Some thetefore through ſuſpicion, that ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, moved again old <hi>Camarina,</hi> or were the cauſe of miſchief to themſelves; but the Profeſſors themſelves and the Colleagues, by the prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Curators did quell and quaſh it at its firſt ſhooting up: for credit to which matter I have thought that this <hi>Inſtrument out of the Acts of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>noverſity</hi> is fit to be produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Profeſſors of the Theological faculty, when it was related to them; That the <hi>Claſſis</hi> of <hi>Dort</hi> had laid down among other this Grievance [<hi>Seeing there is a rumor that ſome controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the doctrine of the reformed Churches have riſen in the Church and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of Leyden, the Claſſis have thought it to be neceſſary that the Synod delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate concerning theſe Controverſies, and how they may moſt ſafely be compoſed, that all Schiſmes and offences which thence may ariſt, may ſeaſonably be removed, and the union of the reformed Churches to preſerved againſt the calumny of the adverſaries</hi>] did, when the Lords Curatots and the Conſuls asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any controverſies of this ſort were certainly known unto them, anſwer unanimouſly, after the matter had been firſt privately among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves examined and weighed, That they wiſhed, that the Claſſis of Dort had in this matter, acted better and more orderly; That they thought that more things were diſputed among the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, than it liked them ſhould be; but that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55680:15"/>
among themſelves, that is, among the Profeſſors of the Theological faculty there was no difference which may appear to be in the fundamenralls of doctrine; Alſo that they would endeavour that the diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this ſort which aroſe among the ſtudents might be leſſened.</q>

                  <q>The very ſame day, when the ſame thing was alſo propoſed to D. <hi>John Kuchlinus</hi> Regent of the Theological Colledge, he anſwered; That he gave his ſuffrage to thoſe things that had been ſaid by the Profeſſors.</q>

               <p>Subſcribed, <hi>John Kuchlinus</hi> Regent.</p>
               <p>And thus indeed theſe things paſſed at that time; Afterwards the Senators of the High Court, by the will of the illuſtrious States at the <hi>Hague,</hi> took cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of thoſe things that were reported. What their opinion of the whole matter was, I ſhould now relate, but that I think all here preſent have the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>But whileſt Chriſts Champion thus wraſtles, he was at the length laid on his ſick bed by a diſeaſe, which by his labours; continual ſitting, conſtant ſtudies and conflicts incurting without any diſcharge, he had at the laſt contracted. Now what wonder is it, if he were moved and troubled at that, which might expoſe to loſe his good name, his ſalvation and his labours: ſith that nothing is of more account
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55680:16"/>
to a good man than his good name; nor to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, than his ſalvation; nor to a Dr. of Sacred Theology than demonſtrations taken out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Oppreſſion, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> makes a wiſe man mad. That ſame brought him grief, his grief brought his diſeaſe, and this was the cauſe of his death. Oh horrible evil and viperous, and raiſed from the loweſt part of Hell! How oft have we heard him privately crying out even with ſighing, in the words of the Prophet? <hi>Wo is me my mother, that thou haſt born me a man of contention to the whole earth: I have neither lent on uſury, nor any hath lent to me on uſury, and yet all men curſe me.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he himſelf recalled himſelf to the incloſures of reaſon and tranquility, being always couragious, always patient and gentle towards his brethren, for whoſe ſake he was ready to ſuffer patiently, or as it were to devour, any reproaches whatſoever from the malevolent, and to forget or concoct them, not with a <hi>Cato's</hi> ſtomack, but that which was wrought in him by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But his diſeaſe lurking in his bowels brake out eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the 7th of <hi>Feb.</hi> this year: which at that time ſo diſcovered it ſelf, that the Phyſicians forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with judged, that there was need of a ſlow and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous curation. Now although at the begining of his ſickneſs he could hardly move himſelf: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he could, having now and then ſome eaſe and reſpite, he omitted not the labours of his lectures and vocation; nor was he wanting to his cauſe when need was. Therefore again and again, being called,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55680:16"/>
he with ſpeed went to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and there publiſh'd a famous profeſſion of his faith before many witneſſes, and after that laſt friendly conference he with this one thing after God and the teſtimony of his own conſcience comforted himſelf, that in a common aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of all <hi>Holland</hi> he was patiently heard by his moſt gentle Maſters, to whoſe prudence he attributed ſo much, that if he ſhould dye, he did hope, that there would not be rhoſe wanting that would defend by the patronage of their wiſdom and favour the equity of that cauſe, which they once heard debated. Being carryed home from the <hi>Hague,</hi> he had ſcarce ſet himſelf to that which his maſters commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> To write out that exactly which he had propoſed in the friendly conference, but the force of diſeaſe again aſſaulted him by ſo much the more vehemently, by how much the more it had increaſed by delay and the weakneſs of his ſtrength. Therefore being preſſed with his diſeaſe, he by letters written to the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous States modeſtly excuſed himſelf, that he could not at the day appointed obey their will: ſaying, <hi>That by ſickneſs he was forct to keep his bed; that he had written a great part, which God ſo willing it, he was now compell'd to break off from. That he had been at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time heard, and that the whole matter was then exhibited in writing; that that might be as much as neceſſity required: Notwithſtanding if they ſhould at all deſire thoſe ſame things he had written that he would take care, that they ſhould have them either full and perfect, if he by the grace of Chriſt ſhould be reſtored, or abrupt and broken, if he ſhould die. Moreover tha
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55680:17"/>
he was ſo far from doubting any whit of that confeſſion he had publiſhed, that on the contrary he did ſtedfaſtly judge, that it agreed in all things with the holy Scriptures: Therefore that he did perſiſt therein, That he was ready at that very moment to appear with that ſame belief before the tribunall of Ieſus Chriſt the Son of God, the Judge of the quick and dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the force of his diſeaſe daily increaſed, whilſt the moſt famous and moſt expert Phyſicians, Dr. <hi>Pavius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sebaſtian Egbert,</hi> Dr. <hi>Henry Sael,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reener Bont,</hi> reſiſted it as much as was poſſible by Art and Induſtry, and pleaſingly allured natures forces, but in vain; for the untamed obſtinacy of the diſeaſe ſcorned art it ſelf; For it was deeper planted than to be plucked up; it ſtirred up daily new Symptomes, Fevers, the cough, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the hypoconders, difficulty of fetching of breath, oppreſſion after meat, troubleſome ſleeps, an atrophie, the gout, and gave to him no intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of reſt: Afterwards came the Iliac paſſion, and the Colick, with an obſtruction of the left optick nerve, and an obfuſcation or dimneſs of the ſame eye; In the mean while calumny was as cruel, and abated nothing of its accuſtomed fierceneſs; of which I ſhall here mention, a cruel unworthy and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance, which is fit to be recorded for after ages. When that dimneſs of one of his eyes was known, there were ſome that durſt account this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe puniſhments, which God threatens to his enemies, and wicked contemners of his name, and did affirm even from this puniſhment, that he was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55680:17"/>
very wicked beyond others. And that there might not be wanting a pretext and colour to this ſo filthy and cruel a deed, the ſacred Books are consulted with, which a Chriſtian may not approach without reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and prayer. A place is found in the Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> concerning the conſumption of the eyes and the whole body, ſounding thus. <hi>And this ſhall be the plague wherewith the Lord will ſmite all the people, that have fought againſt Jeruſalem: their fleſh ſhall conſume away, while they stand upon their feet; and their eyes ſhall conſume away in their holes, and their tongue ſhall conſume away in their mouth,</hi> Zech. 14.12. And another place; <hi>Wo to the Idol ſhepheard that leaveth the flock: the ſword ſhall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: His arm ſhall be clean dried up, and his right eye ſhall be utterly darkened.</hi> Chap. 11.7.</p>
               <p>This place was wreſted againſt this holy ſervant of Chriſt, who indeed was afflicted in body, but in his ſoul always happy, but now even moſt happy and bleſſed. I tremble at the remembrance of ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deteſtable, and ungodly deed. Who, art thou, oh man, that condemneſt thy brother, for whom Chriſt ſhed his blood? What doſt thou revile that ſervant of God with oracles fetched as it were from heaven it ſelf, whom they that ſhall come after us, and ſhall not be ungratefull, will acknowledge to have exceeding well deſerved of the whole Church of Chriſt? Why doſt thou take unjuſtly to thy ſelf a power of condemning thy brother, whom the Lord hath commanded thee to love. Hear him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Neither this man hath ſinned, nor his parents, but theſe things

are done, that the works of God may be made manifeſt</hi> Hear him again; <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Hear the Apoſtle; <hi>It is with me a very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judgment. He that judgeth me is the Lord; Therefore judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time, untill the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart: And then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</hi> Art thou ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of what ſhall happen to thy ſelf, as to know for certain, that thou thy ſelf ſhalt not be tormented with more bitter pain and dolour? And yet 'twas not his right eye that was amiſs; neither was it blindneſs, but only a dimneſs, and his arm was not dried up, but ſwelled. His tongue truly even to the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life readily diſcharged its office. Thus things above, things below, things on the right hand, things on the left, things divine, things humane, wait together on theſe wretched Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants [Expounders of divine myſteries] to ſerve them when they will.</p>
               <p>There were ſomes who playing on his name, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ani orbis amicus: [i. e.</hi> A friend of the vain world.] as if impiety was not ſometime bold to do the ſame on the ſacred name of Chriſt. Go your wayes for beetles, the unprofitable things of the world; What will ye not attempt to do on the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who have not ſpared God himſelf and the Lord of life? But I return to that which I made digreſſion from: He although tired with all theſe evils, yet notwithſtanding kept a ſtedfaſt courage and quiet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55680:18"/>
mind; He therefore never abated any thing of the pleaſantneſs, and comely gracefulneſs, and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cheerfulneſs of his countenance, and candor of heart, his moſt ardent prayers aſcending to God for himſelf and the concord of the church. How frequent, how fervent in his ſickneſs were his ejaculations to Jeſus Chriſt? What joyes did he promiſe himſelf? With what perſeverance of faith did he expect his laſt day in the world? If the brethren did compoſe themſelves to prayers, and he himſelf was hindred by pain, he now and then deſired them to ſtay till he ſhould come to himſelf, that he might together with them perform this brotherly office.</p>

warfare, having finiſhed his courſe, fought the good fight, kept the faith, did render his ſoul now weary of cares, now glutted with the miſeries of this world, now deſiring deliverance, now having a fore-taſt of the joys of the Saints, now ſeeing Chriſt his God and redeemer, did I ſay, with his eyes lifted up to heaven, render quietly among the holy prayers of them that were preſent, his ſoul to God the Father his creator, to the Son his redeemer, to the Holy Ghoſt his ſanctifier, all crying out, <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus even this our Sun did ſet; thus that juſt man dyed of whom this world was not worthy; thus the father of ſo many prophets was taken away; thus <hi>James Arminius</hi> by the charet of Iſrael and horſemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was carryed from us into heaven and now is free and delivered from miſeryes, hath the crown ſought for by ſo many labours, by ſo great holineſs, and enjoys the heavenly Jeruſalem, in the great aſſembly of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of Angels, and the Church of the firſt-born that are written in heaven, and he ſees the Judge of all, and the Spirit of juſt men made perfect, and Jeſus the mediator of the new Teſtament, and the blood of ſprinkling ſpeaking better then that of <hi>Abel</hi>; But he expecteth that day, in which God will make his dead body, which we have laid in the earth, to be conformable to the glorious body of his Son, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf.</p>
               <p>But we ſo long as it pleaſes God ſhall be toſſed with theſe waves, till he, having at ſometime compaſſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55680:20"/>
on us alſo, ſhall call us, every one in his own order, out of this miry clay into heavenly joys; keeping in the mean while in the church of the ſaints the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed memory of Mr. <hi>James Arminius,</hi> with this Elogy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he was a Hollander, whom they that knew him, could not ſufficiently eſteem; Whom they that eſteemed him not, did never ſufficiently know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, moſt worthy Auditors, being deſirous to exhort you to the Churches amiable concord, I ſhall uſe no other than the words of the Apoſtle <hi>John. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, let us love one another, becauſe love is of God. And whoſoever loveth his brother, is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</hi>

He therefore was committed, as ſoon as poſſible, to the care and diſcipline of <hi>Peter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> a Schoolmaſter at that time famous; under whoſe manuduction he in ſo little time made ſo great a progreſs in Latin and Greek, that he was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by diverſe great men to the honourable Senate of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> which took and received him into the number of their Scholars, when his parents by the advice of Mr. <hi>John Kuchlinus</hi> and Mr. <hi>James
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55680:22"/>
Arminius,</hi> and by their perſwaſion, gave their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for at the firſt they were ſomewhat averſe thereto. When he had at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> run out his courſe there in the Grammar ſchool, the Curatours of the School did. in the year 1600, declare him by Solemn ſentence meet and worthy to be promoted to the Univerſity, that he might there apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to more high and manly ſtudies; He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent away to the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> into the Colledge of the illuſtrious States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-friezland</hi>; in which Colledge was then Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that moſt learned man, <hi>John Kuchlinus,</hi> who when he was miniſter at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a firm and intimate friendſhip with the father of our <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> This hopeful Plant had not been long in the Academical nurſery, but he loſt his moſt loving and beloved Parents; for <hi>Anno</hi> 1602 his father dyed, in the next year his Mother. He though much afflicted with this adverſity; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughtfull, and deſirous of his tranſplanting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome place of uſefulneſs to the Church of God, neglects not the preſent opportunity of furniſhing himſelf with things convenient and neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Wherefore having ſukt in as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as was needfull, of the liberal Arts, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his endeavours for getting acquaintance with the ſecrets of Philoſophy; In which having ſpent about three years, he applyed himſelf moſt ſeriouſly to the ſtudys of Divinity, and with much diligence laboured therein; yet ſo as to have now and then a recourſe to Phyloſophy· At length, the Statutes of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55680:23"/>
his Colledge, and his own private affairs requiring it, he ſought the title of a Mr. of Arts, and was, being after a ſevere examination judged worthy, adorned therewith publickly, in the year 1606, by Dr. <hi>Rodolphus Snellius,</hi> that moſt renowned Profeſſor of the Mathematicks there. After this he purpoſeth and reſolves to give himſelf wholy to the ſtudy of Divinity onely, in which he had already made a conſiderable progreſs. And ſeeing he could not accompliſh his earneſt deſire of viſiting forreign Univerſities, he continued yet two years and above at <hi>Leyden,</hi> where he was a diligent hearer of the Divinity Profeſſors, namely, <hi>Francis Gomarus, Luke Trelcatius, James Arminius</hi>; and was ſo diligent and induſtrious in diſputations, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatory Sermons, that he left far behind him moſt of his equals for age and ſtanding, and was thought worthy to be called to the Miniſtry. But ſeeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, eſpecially after the death of Dr. <hi>Trelcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that unhappy diſcenſion about Predeſtination, which afterwards gave a diſturbance to all <hi>Holland,</hi> did not onely ſecretly glow between the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Profeſſors, but alſo at length break forth openly; and ſeeing our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> ſhewed himſelf more addicted to the opinion of <hi>Arminius,</hi> he found therefore the Paſtors, who were of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, to be ſo diſaffected towards him, that they, when the honourable Conſuls of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who had knowledge of his ſingular learning and good converſation, were deſirous of promoting him to the office of a preacher, did by delays, and other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55680:23"/>
their ſubtle devices, fruſtrate and elude the good deſign of the Conſuls. <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> therefore in the year 1609, in which year <hi>Arminius</hi> dyed, left <hi>Leyden</hi> and went to <hi>Franeker,</hi> the <hi>Friezlanders</hi> Univerſity, whither he was drawn eſpecially by the fame of <hi>Jo. Druſius,</hi> Profeſſor there of the Hebrew tongue. Here <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus,</hi> the Profeſſor of this Univerſity, took great offence at our <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> who was ſomewhat too hot and fervent in Theological diſputations, as young men of prompt and ready wits are wont to be. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few moneths after departed thence, and went into <hi>France,</hi> where in a ſhort time he got ſo great acquaintance with the <hi>French</hi> tongue, that he was able not onely to underſtand it, but alſo to ſpeak <hi>French</hi> readily and purely. In the year 1610 he returned home, and found the Miniſters of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> no better affected towards him than before. But his vertue and learning, which could be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hid, and which were commended by clear and notable teſtimonies from the Churches and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities where he lived, break thorow at length all obſtacles, and ſo, that he was, with the conſent of the Claſſis, called by the honourable Senate of <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi> to the Paſtoral office at <hi>Bleyſwyck,</hi> an hamlet belonging to their juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Arminius,</hi> they of Calvins perſwaſion, whoſe notions of God, reprobating abſolutely the greateſt part of the world, to make known his power in making his creatures miſerable, had framed and diſpoſed to fierceneſs, begrn to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55680:24"/>
the ejection of them out of their places who adher'd to <hi>Arminius</hi>; hereupon theſe perceiving the deſigns that were againſt them, did exhibite to the moſt illuſtrious Stales of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-friez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a certain Remonſtrance (whence they were afterwards called Remonſtrants, as their adverſaries were called Contra Remonſtrants, from a paper they had written in oppoſition, and intituled, A Contra-Remonſtrance) in which Remonſtrance after they had declared their judgement comprehended in five heads or Articles, they humbly petition, that they in that belief and perſwaſion might be protected from the violence and force of their Adverſaries that much threatned them. Afterwards in the year 1611 was that famous Conference at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where by the appointment, and in the preſence of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> Six Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant, and as many Contra-Remonſtrant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors conferred together about the things now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. For the determining of theſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, the Remonſtrants then declared themſelves for mutual forbearance, but their adverſaries were for a Synodal Deciſion, as being no way doubtfull of out-voting them, in caſe the Remonſtrants were admitted members of the Synod, which indeed their adverſaries denyed them, when they had gotten a Synod, and the arm of fleſh on their ſide.</p>
            <p>But the illuſtrious States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> knowing well, that onely the oppreſſion of the contrary party was ſought after, and that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55680:24"/>
controverſie was obſcure and difficult, made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that both parties ſhould live together in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly communion, &amp;c. which decree had preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in peace, if might had not then overcome right, in caſting thoſe peaceable Governours out of their places, and ſubſtituting thoſe in their rooms who would be ready to doe what the Contra-remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants would have.</p>
            <p>But we muſt return to our <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> who was one of the ſix Remonſtrants that managed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at the <hi>Hague,</hi> whereas on a famous Theater he made manifeſt his great abilities, both natural and acquired, and gave all men occaſion to conclude, that his knowledge and skill in the holy Scriptures, and in Theological diſputations, was not ordinary. After this, the fame of his learning and eloquence ſpreading in the United Provinces far abroad, he was ſolicited by diverſe eminent Cities, chiefly <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> to be their Preacher; but ſeeing they of <hi>Bleyſwyck</hi> would by no means be induced to give their conſent for his departure, he therefore continued in the exerciſe of his miniſtry among them. But at length in the year 1612, when he was about 29 years old, he was called by the Curators of the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> to the Profeſſorſhip of Divinity there, in the place of <hi>Francis Gomarus,</hi> who voluntarily had deſerted it; Now although the modeſty of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> was ſo great, that he judged himſelf unmeet for a work ſo difficult in ſuch difficult times; yet ſuffered he himſelf to be prevailed with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and overcome by the judgment of others concerning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55680:25"/>
him, and eſpecially by the authority and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome very great men in the Common-wealth and Church to accept it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this honourable place, worthy a man ſo learned and venerable, he lived friendly and peaceably with Dr. <hi>Jo. Polyander,</hi> his Colleague, though of an opinion differing from his in the controverſy of predeſtination; and moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laboured in his Office, as even to us is apparent from his Commentaries on ſome parts of the holy Scriptures, then compoſed, and his diſputations there, which ſince his death have been expoſed to publick view. But his Cares were ſo many and great, that they far ſurmounted all his other labours and did much exceed them; For at this time the Controverſie about Predeſtination had ſwelled over the Academical banks, and had filled the pulpits, whence (as uſually) it ſpread as an inundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common people threatning a devaſtation of the Churches unity, and to the Common-wealth no leſs then ruine: For the governours themſelves, who were to have kept the peace, were divided among themſelves, deſigning variouſly for their ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In this evil day and contentious time, good <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> a man greatly deſirous of peace, a manſtudious, laborious and ſolicitous for the good of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs. Now to give a few inſtances of this mans ſufferings, may not onely he ſerviceable to his commendation, they being the tryal and an evident proof of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and that which brought to light his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fortitude and patience, wherein he greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55680:25"/>
they may expect, who are of the firſt in diſcovering errors, that have been long and more generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced for truths, and for ſuch, which men have much gloryed in, as a treaſure more peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than others; and alſo to let us know what are the uſual effects of blind zeal in matters of religion, which will appear to be the worſt of Guides, leading men to moſt injurious, inhumane and barbarous practices.</p>
            <p>We will begin with that which happened at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> in the ſecond year of his Profeſſorſhip; The ſtory in brief in this, <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> being at a church in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and (as they commonly ſpeak) ſtanding as a witneſs with others at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of his brother <hi>Johns</hi> Daughter, <hi>Caspar Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who then did officiate, asked him and the other witneſſes, <hi>Whether they did confeſs that to be the true</hi> and perfect <hi>doctrine of ſalvation, which was contained in the old and new Teſtament, and in the Apoſtles</hi> Creed, and <hi>which was taught in that church,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>; adding moreover theſe words: What ſay ye to theſe things? <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> the chief among them, anſwered; That he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatſoever was taught there according to the word of God, and the Apoſtles Creed, to be the true and ſaving doctrine, as the words of the uſual form, out of which the interrogation is made, do intend; Which anſwer, though mild and modeſt, ſo moved the ſpleen of Mr. <hi>Heydan,</hi> that with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he called him Young-man, and upbraided him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55680:26"/>
as one very audacious and preſumptuous in daring to ſpeak ſo in the Church of God. To which <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> again replyed, ſaying; That he would depart if the Preachers would not admit that limitation, comprehended in the form of Baptiſm, where after mention made of the old and new Teſtament, and the Apoſtles Creed, theſe words are added, and conſequently is taught in the Chriſtian Church. But when <hi>Heydan</hi> had the ſecond time upbraided him with audaciouſneſs, and <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> made no further reply, he at length chriſtened the Child. And when <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> was going out, he was reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled, and called a ſeditious man, and a diſturber of the Church, by ſome of the baſer ſort, whom <hi>Heydans</hi> words had excited to ſuch oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious ſpeeches; and when he was gone out of the Church, he hardly eſcap'd beating or ſtoning, to which ſome inſtigated the youth that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But God out of his fatherly care protecting him, and reſtraining the fury of thoſe wicked men, brought him at length to his friends in ſafety.</p>
            <p>Not long after this it happened in the ſame City, That a certain Black ſmith, ſeeing <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> paſſing by his ſhop, run out with a bar of Iron that he was forging on his anvil, and called him <hi>Arminian,</hi> and a diſturber of the Church, and ſo purſued him, as one having a mind to murther him, which danger he eſcap'd by flight and the aſſiſtance of others, that hindered and reſtrained this villanous Zealot.</p>
            <p>Now if we ſhould here inſert a ſhort but ſad ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſome Contra-remonſtrants Plunderers, we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55680:26"/>
ſhould not go far out of our way, nor much digreſs becauſe <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> (ſo called) was the occaſion, and <hi>Rembert,</hi> the brother of our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> was the perſon pillaged, and that in the time we have now under conſideration. The ſtory thus runs; There was in the year 1617, and on the 19th of <hi>February,</hi> a falſe rumour raiſed and ſpread abroad, that ſome Remonſtrants were met together to hear a Sermon in the houſe of Mr. <hi>Rembert Epiſcopius,</hi> who in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> was well known to be much addicted to the Remonſtrants opinions, and was for that cauſe much hated by the vulgar ſort, Upon this report many hundreds of vile perſons run thither, who firſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the windows with ſtones, then with a bar break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the gate, enter the houſe in an hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and as a Company of Robbers, when they had drank up or ſpilled the wine and beer in the Cellar, they ſeorch and ſack the houſe, opening forcibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 12 cheſts, carrying away what was portable, for they ſtole thence a bag of money, wearing clothes, linnen, pictures, books, houſhold-ſtuff, plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what they could not carry away tore and broke, leaving nothing there whole and untouch'd, When they had emptyed the houſe, they begin to demoliſh it and make it an heap of rubbiſh, which they had done, if the coming of the Magiſtrate had not hindered them. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his wife eſcap'd their fury; ſhe by flying to a neighbours houſe; he by hiding himſelf on the top of his own houſe, whither he got by a ladder that he drew up after him. His loſs was eſtimated
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55680:27"/>
to be above ſix thouſand florans. And if he had not had ſome ſpace (while thoſe religious Felons were breaking open his doors) for the caſting of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and ſome part of his better houſhold-ſtuff into a neighbours houſe, he had in that one day been well nigh ſpoyled of a good eſtate, and reduced to poverty, The other brother Mr. <hi>Jo. Epiſcopius,</hi> being alſo of the Remonſtrant perſwaſion, though he was not pillaged as his brother, yet was he often and much reproached by the dregs of the people, a ſort of malignant Zealots But to return now to our <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> who was a ſufferer in his Relations, and Chriſtian Aſſociates, and met with many great perſonal afflictions, eſpecially at the time of the Dort Synod, and afterwards, of which we will here take a Superficial and curſory view.</p>
            <p>In the year 1618 began the Synod of Dort, which how unjuſtly it carryed it ſelf towards the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, the Acts and Hiſtory thereof, long ſince publiſhed; do, ſaith <hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> abundantly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. We will briefly mention here a few things that more nearly touch our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi>; Although from that which happened not long before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of this Synod; namely the violent ejecting of thoſe Magiſtrates that favoured mutual forbearance, it was not hard to conjecture, that no good iſſue would attend this Synodical meeting; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being invited to it by the Letters of the Illuſtrious States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and to ſit there with the other Profeſſors of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> did with ſome other Remonſtrant Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55680:27"/>
make his appearance at <hi>Dort</hi> ſoon after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Synod; but the Synod, which was the adverſe Party, and which ſhamefully took to themſelves a power of judging in their own cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> permitted neither him, nor any other Remonſtrants to be preſent in their aſſembly, but as cited perſons, appearing at the Synods tribunal, and ſubmitting to the authority of the Synod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as having power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, when to ſpeak, when to hold their peace; and alſo at length, by majority of voices, to judge and cenſure them; Which how far from all equity it was, let all judge that have eyes to ſee, and are impartial. The Remonſtrants notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt they ſhould ſeem wanting to a good cauſe, did yield to a neceſſity, and with a great and undaunted courage entred the Synod, and there <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> with great grace and Oratorial geſture (and as our learned <hi>Hales</hi> expreſſeth it) recited that excellent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is to be found in the Acts of the Synod, and in the ſecond volume of his works. After this, when the Remonſtrants declared, that they were ready to confer with the Synod, the Eccleſiaſtical Preſident in the name of the Synod anſwered, That they by an authority granted to them from the <hi>States General,</hi> were come together, not to confer with them, but to judge them; Notwithſtanding this, yet the Remonſtrants, having proteſted, that they could not acknowledge that Synod as a lawfull Judge in the preſent controverſy, becauſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of it conſiſted of their profeſſed adverſaries, who had already condemned them, and ſeperated
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55680:28"/>
from them, did addreſs themſelves <hi>freely to propound, explain and confirm their ſentence or judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Synod, ſo far as they could and did judge neceſſary</hi>; and ſo to do, they were not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly permitted, but alſo injoyned, by the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>States-General</hi> in their Citatory Letters. But when the Synod would again circumſcribe that liberty by theſe limits, to wit, that they ſhould propound, explain and confirm their ſentence or judgment, <hi>as far as the Synod ſhould judge might be ſufficient and ought to be</hi>; then could not the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants ſatisfy their conſciences to ſubmit to ſuch uneqaal and unrighteous conditions, by which they ſhould betray their cauſe, and ſo they were at length caſt out of the Synod, as perſons unworthy for the Synod any longer to treat withall.</p>
            <p>Concerning the manner of their ejection I ſhall here adde ſomething out of the letters ſent from Dort to Sir <hi>Dudly Charleton,</hi> at that time Lord Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from <hi>K. James</hi> to the <hi>States-General,</hi> and written by Doctor <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> a member of the Synod, and one of the Engliſh Colledge there, and of a different perſwaſion to the Remonſtrants, and by our own renowned Countrey-man Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> then Chaplain to the ſaid Embaſſadour, but for a time reſident at Dort, to obſerve the Synods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there; The letters may be found in <hi>Hales</hi> his Golden Remains: When the voices ſaith <hi>(Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canqual)</hi> onely of the forreign Divines were asked (who are not above a third part of the Synod) then were the Remonſtrants called in, and diſmiſt with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55680:28"/>
ſuch a powdering ſpeech, as I doubt not but that your Lordſhip hath heard with grief enough. I proteſt (ſaith he) I am much afflicted, when I think of it; For if the Remonſtrants ſhould write, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the Preſident pronounced a ſentence, which was not the ſentence of the Synod, they ſhould not lie. The Civil Lawyers and Canon of <hi>France,</hi> who write much about the formalities omitted in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> are exceptions of leſs moment then theſe; So neither was there above a third part of the voices asked, <hi>ex quibus ſententia fieri nequit.</hi> Neither was the ſentence conceived in writ, and approved by the Synod; And the bitter words of the ſentence were not the words of ony of the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, unleſs that ſome of them were ſpoken by one man onely. So far he; There are ſaith (Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>) ſome exceptions taken by the Deputies themſelves againſt Mr. <hi>Preſident</hi> his rough handling the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants at their diſmiſſion. The next day in the morning there was a private Seſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was made of the laſt Synodical Acts, but when they came to the Act of the Remonſtrants diſmiſſion <hi>Ludovicus Croſius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> ſignfiyed, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Mr. <hi>Preſident</hi> in that buſineſs had been <hi>paulo commotior,</hi> [ſomewhat too paſſionate] and had let ſlip <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erba quaedam acerba</hi> [ſome bitter words] which might well have been ſpared; That in ſo great an act as that was, a little more adviſe and conſideration might have been uſed, That the Synod ought to have been conſulted with, and a form of diſmiſſion conceived and approved of by all,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55680:29"/>
which ſhould in the name of the Synod have been pronounced and regiſtred, whereas now the Synod ſtands indicted of all the unneceſſary roughneſs which then was practiſed. So far our <hi>Hales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſmiſſion of the Remonſtrants, the Synod prepared to judge them out of their Writings. But they in the mean time, whileſt the Synod was thus occupied, did privately, by the command of the <hi>States Deputies,</hi> compoſe for the confirmation of their doctrine, thoſe accurate Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which rogether with the Synodal Acts were publiſhed a little after, and deſervedly obtained the approbation of very many of the moſt learned men in <hi>Europe</hi>; One of chief authority when he had ſeen them, ſaid, That the <hi>Dort</hi> Synod had condemned the Remonſtrants; but they by their Writings had triumphed over the Synod.</p>
            <p>And indeed one ſubſtantial argument is better than a thouſand Synodal ſuffrages. The chiefeſt part of theſe Writings ought to be aſcribed to the indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable induſtry of our <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> That nervous Diſſertation touching Reprobation had for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that learned and reverend father Mr. <hi>Charles Niellius,</hi> a preacher at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> To his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory we are indebted not onely for that piece, but for other things alſo in that volume; and debtours we are to all the reſt of them for that ſhare of their labour we have in thoſe Excellent Writings.</p>
            <p>At length the Synodical Sentence againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants was pronounced, by which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as men of a corrupt Religion and depoſed and put out of Office.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55680:29"/>The hard uſage of the Remonſtrants is not much to be wondered at, the Synods temper being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; For although there was much candour in ſome of the forreign Divines, eſpecially our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet there was much want of it in the Provincials. Not to ſpeak any thing of the unworthy uſage which ſome of the forreign Divines, experienced in the Synod, &amp; particularly they of <hi>Breme,</hi> who were upon the point of leaving the Synod, by reaſon of offences there given them; I ſhall onely in a word diſcover their ill diſpoſition towards the Remonſtrants: Prejudice prevailed much among the <hi>Dutch</hi> Contra-remonſtrants; They are (ſaith <hi>Belcanqual</hi> in his letter of <hi>April</hi> 17) ſo eager to kill the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, that they would make their words to have that ſenſe which no Grammar could find in them; We have given a remarkable Inſtance of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents</hi> good nature and manners. And as for <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus,</hi> the then viſible head of the Fataliſts, of what a froward and turbulent Spirit he was, I am even loth to expteſs in the words of <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> who thus writes to the Embaſſador; If the Synod (ſaith he) had wanted but two men, I mean <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus</hi> [one of the principal Contra-remonſtrant leaders] and <hi>Gomarus,</hi> we had wanted a great deal of contention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I fear will not forſake the Synod as long as they are in it; They have their fits of madneſs by courſe; The laſt fit before this came to <hi>Gomarus</hi> his turn, and this day <hi>Sibrandus</hi> flew out with ſuch raving and fierceneſs of countenance, and ſuch unheard bitterneſs againſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55680:30"/>
our Colledge, as I deſire no other revenge on him, than the very ſpeaking of the words, which while they were in his mouth were checked by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Politick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In another letter, thus; The Palatine Divines are the onely Magiſtrates Doctors next to <hi>Gomarus</hi> in all the Synod, and think every thing they ſpeak ſhould be taken for Text. Let me adde one paſſage more, wherein <hi>Gomarus</hi> is mainly concerned; In the buſineſs of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants of <hi>Campes,</hi> they of <hi>Breme</hi> perſwaded to a middle courſe in dealing with them. But <hi>Gomarus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Belcanqual</hi>) fell foully upon <hi>Martinus,</hi> a man very learned and very honeſt, who hath been ſo uncivily dealt with, that the Forreigners take much offence thereat, and he and his Colleagues have been ready to leave the Synod. Becauſe he diſlikes, as others do the Contra-remonſtrants broad ſpeeches in many points, they uſe him with ſo much diſcourteſy; Though one be againſt the Remonſtrants in all the 5 Articles in ſubſtance; yet if he differ from them [the <hi>Dutch</hi> Divines] but in manner of ſpeaking, they hold him as not ſound. So far <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> I thought not indeed to meddle with this buſineſs relating to them of <hi>Breme,</hi> but fell into it unawares, and cannot but learn from it, that if the Contra remonſtrants behaved themſelves ſo, in ſuch a place, againſt perſons who in the main were of their perſwaſion, then certainly the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants to whom they were profeſſed Adverſaries, had cauſe to expect from them none of the ſofteſt uſage. But there is one paſſage more that I ſhall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55680:30"/>
recite out of <hi>Belcanqual</hi> concerning <hi>Gomarus.</hi> In Seſſion 85, <hi>Gomarus</hi> in his diſquiſition of the 3 and 4 Articles, delivered a ſpeech againſt the <hi>Bremenſes,</hi> which none I think but a mad man would have uttered, and he delivered himſelf with ſuch ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his eyes, and fierceneſs of pronunciation, as every man wondered that the Preſident did not cut him off; at laſt he cut off himſelf, I think for want of breath, and then the Preſident gave <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrimo Duo Gomaro</hi> very many thanks for that his learned, grave and accurate ſpeech. The <hi>Exteri</hi> [the forreign Divines] wondered at it, <hi>Martinus</hi> onely ſaid, that he was ſorry he ſhould be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for his long journey. In another letter; All I will ſay my Lord, is this; There are two men in the Synod, <hi>Sibrandus,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Gomarus,</hi> who are able to ſet it on fire, unleſs they be lookt to. Thus far he: I ſhall ſay nothing of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Provincial or <hi>Dutch</hi> Divines, how they were at the devotion of thoſe that were chief Actors in the Contra-remonſttatical Tragedy.</p>
            <p>We are come now to the Execution of the Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Sentence againſt the Remonſtrants; They being thus diſcharged, other Paſtors were put and ſubſtituted in their places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how unwilling ſoever the Chuches were to receive them; In ſome places theſe new Paſtors were brought in by force of arms. Now leſt the ejected Remonſtrants ſhould teach privately, therefore the <hi>States-General</hi> propoſe to them a certain ingagement, to abſtain in the future both directly and indirectly from all even private
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55680:31"/>
exerciſe of their Miniſtry. To which when ſome could not in conſcience ſubſcribe, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual baniſhment. Alas! who could expect ſuch cruelly amongſt Proteſtants, that had condemned Papiſts for the like unchriſtian practices? He that takes a view of our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> and ſome others of the Remonſtrants in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, when this diſmal Cloud appeared, will ſee cauſe to admire their faith and fortitude. For ſo dear was the truth unto them, and their zeal for it ſo great, that a promiſe of the ſame wages or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend which they formerly enjoyed, could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them (though ſome of them had but a very mean Eſtate) to oblige and bind themſelves unto ſilence, which was commanded them; Moreover theſe Generous ſpirits did with much boldneſs, after the pronouncing of the of ſentence of Baniſhment, defend openly to the <hi>States-General</hi> their own and their aſſociates Innocency, appealing to God, the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them that are unjuſtly oppreſſed, who would at the laſt day take cogniſance of their Cauſe, and judge, without reſpect of perſon, as well their Judges as them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon theſe Stout Champions for truth were ſo haſtily carryed away by the <hi>States</hi> Officers out of the limits of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> that they after their detaining eight moneths at <hi>Dort,</hi> whether they were called, as they thought, to a free Synod, had not granted to them ſo much as one day, in which to bid their families fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and to ſet in order their domeſtick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55680:31"/>
notwithſtanding they petitioned for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> therefore, and the reſt, betook themſelves to <hi>Brabant,</hi> and inhabited at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> during the peace between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>States.</hi> This place theſe Exiles made choice of for their abode, not to joyn with the enemies of their Country in a conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt it, nor to endeavour any thing detre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Reformed religion, as ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent perſons were bold enough to ſuggeſt ſlaunderouſly againſt them; but becauſe that place was near, and from which they might more commodiouſly, than from any place remote, take care of their beloved Churches, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. How faithfully thoſe imployed their talent, received of God, I ſhall here paſs over in Silence, being now to ſpeak onely of <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> whoſe diſputations with <hi>Peter Wadingus,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and his Antidote againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> do abundanly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his great care and diligence; And alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, which he, with the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant Paſtors there, did compoſe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that they might ſtop the mouths of them who calumniouſly gave forth, that the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants cheriſht in their breaſt, monſtrous and ſtrange opinions, which they durſt not expoſe to publick view.</p>
            <p>When the war was renewed between the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> our <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> ſeeing he could no longer with ſafety remain in <hi>Brabant</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55680:32"/>
departed thence into <hi>France,</hi> and inhabited ſometime at <hi>Rhoan,</hi> ſometime at <hi>Paris.</hi> If thou inquire how in theſe parts his time was ſpent, thoſe Writings of his there compiled, will give thee a worthy Account, in caſe thou art able to peruſe his Paraphraſe and Obſervations on the 8, 9, 10, and 11 <hi>Chapters</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi>; alſo his <hi>Bodecherus ineptiens</hi>; his <hi>Examen Theſium Jacobi Capelli</hi>; his anſwer to to the Defence of <hi>Jo. Cameron</hi>; his Treatiſe of Chriſtian Magiſtracy. and that of free-will, with other works of his, laboured there. He that with theſe conſiders his ſollicitous Care for the Churches of his own Countrey, which in this time of perſecution being deſtitute of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſtors, he by diverſe Writings and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles inſtructed, comforted and incouraged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the Faith; alſo the many conferences he had with learned men concerning Religion, by which he endeavoured to bring them to a more accurate ſearch and inquiry after the truth; he, I ſay, that conſiders theſe things, will be ſo far from thinking that he had many waſt hours that he will greatly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where time was found for ſo many and great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments. Here <hi>Stephen Cureelleus</hi> got with him his firſt Acquaintance and profeſſes that he heard him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſome hard points of religion, and learned ſo many things of him, that he always afterwards eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed it a ſingular happpineſs to him, that he had acquaintance with ſo worthy a man Here alſo <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> contracted ſuch a friendſhip with that moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55680:32"/>
man and eminent Mathematician, Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Mercer,</hi> which afterwards no diſtance of place, or length of time, could diſſolve or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. This was he that publiſhed this Book, by which <hi>Camerons</hi> opinion of Grace and free-will is examined, and intituled it, <hi>Epiſtola viri docti</hi>; and he that was ſo familiar a friend with <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> that <hi>Grotius,</hi> when he laſt left <hi>France,</hi> committed to him the moſt precious Treaſures he had, his Elaborate Manuſcripts, that by him they might be communicated to others.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> being deſirous to have a perfect Survay of <hi>France,</hi> who as yet knew little more than the Northern part of it, went from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lyons</hi>; After that he viſited <hi>Mar. ſeille, Niſmes, Mompelier, Tholouſe</hi>: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Burdeaux, Rochella, Poictiers, Angiers, Tours, Orleance,</hi> and other places. And when he had finiſhed his perambulation, he returned to <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rhoan</hi>; where when he had remained a while; and had heard that the fervour of the perſecution, raiſed in his own Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Remonſtrants, was ſome what alayed, he purpoſed to return thither. Leaving therefore <hi>France</hi> in the year of our Lord 1626, and in the eighth year of his baniſhment, he came to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> that he might with other brethren lay out his abilities for the gathering of that very numerous Church, which is there out of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed Remonſtrants: And that afterwards he might take care for other Churches in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55680:33"/>
Provinces.</hi> In the mean while by his Writings both in Latin and Dutch he ſtrenuouſly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth. He publiſhed in Latin An Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Remonſtrants confeſſion; An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Eſſay of the <hi>Leyden Profeſſors,</hi> with other Books. In <hi>Dutch</hi> he wrote a Treatiſe of true Antiquity againſt the Papiſts; Three Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes againſt <hi>James Triglandius,</hi> then Preacher at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſince Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Leyden</hi>; with other books,</p>
            <p>In the ſecond year after his return, he entred into a Matrimonial ſtate, (there being then hope of a more peaceable time) marrying at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> that moſt choice and vertuous Gentlewoman Mrs. <hi>Mary Peſſer,</hi> the widow of Mr. <hi>Henry Niellius</hi> a Preacher of that City, and the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother of Mr. <hi>Charles Niellius</hi> above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. They lived together, but without iſſue, moſt piouſly, peaceably and comfortably to the end of the years 1641, at which time ſhe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her courſe.</p>
            <p>But before this in the year 1634 He went to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to be Preſident in the Remonſtrants Scholaſtick Nurſery or Colledge, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected there to be as an Univerſity, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing of Youth in Divinity, that were intended for Miniſters of the Church,</p>
            <p>How faithfully and diligently he exerciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf here, we have an illuſtrious teſtimony from his copious, learned and moſt uſefull Theological Inſtitutions; and the Anſwer of 64 Queſtions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55680:33"/>
propoſed to him by his Diſciples; alſo from his learned and eloquent Sermons to the people; alſo his true Remonſtrant Divine; and his Anſwer to the 10 Dilemma's of a certain Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctor, and other works of his.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he was thus labouring, ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions forced him to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where <hi>Anno</hi> 1639 he fell dangerouſly ſick, and for ſome moneths kept his bed, and ſo far was he gone, that there was little hope of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. But at length God reſtored him to health, and ſo ſtrengthened him, that he returned to his charge at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently laboured among them as before.</p>
            <p>After his return it ſeemed good to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants to publiſh a plain Catechiſm for the inſtructing of the more ignorant ſort. Then <hi>Abraham Heydan,</hi> at that time a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at <hi>Leyden,</hi> afterwards Profeſſor of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, publiſhed an Examination of this Catechiſm, the defence of which our <hi>Epiſcopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> undertook, and finiſhed in a conſiderable large Volume, which came not forth till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. For in the beginning of the year 1643, when he was well nigh 60 years old, he fell mortally ſick. His diſeaſe is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iſchuria,</hi> a dangerous ſuppreſſion of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> which was ſo pertinacious and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that for eleven days he could not make one drop of water; although ſome skilfull Phyſicians uſed the utmoſt of their art to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55680:34"/>
or at leaſt ſomewhat to mitigate this his mercyleſs and ſtubborn enemy. This Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (of which he afterward avoided but little) mixing it ſelf with the blood of the whole body, ſo corrupted the <hi>Craſſis</hi> and temperature thereof, that he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly long ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>He lay ſick two moneths and above, and for ſome weeks before his death was deprived of ſight. Which loſs, whileſt there was any hope of his recovery, had been exceeding grievous unto him, had not his deep and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continual ſleeping leſſened the ſame; For ſometimes he complained of it to his friends that did frequently viſit him; ſaying, that he ſhould not be able any more to ſerve the Church of Chriſt,</p>
            <p>At length on the 4th of <hi>April</hi> about the 8th hour in the morning, (at which time the moon was in the Eclipſe) he peaceably fell aſleep in the Lord. And the 4th day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was carryed forth (a great multitude of all ſorts of perſons following the herſe) unto the Weſt-Church, and was there interred by his wife. His death many much lamented, and many Epicedium's, or funeral Verſes of his praiſe and commendation, were publiſhed both in <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caspar Barlaeus,</hi> the moſt renowned <hi>Poet</hi> of that time, and who lived not full two years after him, publiſhed a moſt excellent <hi>Latin Epicae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55680:34"/>
in his commendation, which is prefixed to the firſt Volume of <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> his works.</p>
            <p>Thus we have taken a ſhort view of <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> from his birth to his death. His life was unblameable, and illuſtrious for zeal to the glory of God, and mans ſalvation; His Love to the Churches peace and concord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much to his commendation. He was indeed much converſant in Controverſies, not of choyce, but through neceſſity; He was often wont to complain of his conſtraint to this kind of exerciſe. His patient bearing of jnjuries, and readineſs to forgive, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Maſter Chriſt, contributed not a little to his praiſe. In alms-deeds he was to his power ready and cheerfull; And ſuch was his modeſty and humble temper, that his rare endowments and great Atchievments he eſteemed as nothing. On his ſick-bed his Speeches were gracious, full of piety towards God, charity towards men and confidence in Chriſt. His name now and memory is bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them eſpecially, that without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice peruſe his works, that in two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Volumes are now publick in the Latin tongue, which I could wiſh that all men well underſtood, were it but to read <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> I doubt not but there are many, who have much improved themſelves by his writings. Our famous <hi>Hales</hi> is not doubtleſs without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of whom this is reported by Mr.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55680:35"/>
               <hi>Anthony Farindon,</hi> his familiar friend: that he himſelf often told him, that at the well preſſing of <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16. by <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> he bade <hi>Jo. Calvine</hi> Good-night. It would be in vain for me here to inlarge, who am ſpeaking to thoſe, that through unacquaintance with Latin, are uncapable to ſee the great knowledge and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi>: as for thoſe who converſe honeſtly with his Writings, they need not me. But I would not that any ſhould think of me, that I take all his ſayings for goſpel; No, I believe that his Writings as well as other mens muſt be read with judgment: for I nothing doubt, but that Errata's may be found in his works, not only ſuch that are juſtly imputable to the Tranſcriber and Printer, but ſuch alſo that are the Authors, who was ſubject to erre, though much more free from errors than many.</p>
