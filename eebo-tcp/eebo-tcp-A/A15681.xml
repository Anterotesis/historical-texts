            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In which respect if we will call to mind, the blessings that God hath bestowed, especially vpon this our Nation, in this last age of the world, more then euer since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, for the perfecting of the Art of Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and for the discouery of new Nations (which may in comparison be called ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all humane learning the Mathematicall sciences haue had the precedence, both for certainty, because they are grounded on demonstration, and also because they acquaint vs with all the courses, motions, &amp; proportions of the celestiall and elementarie bodies. This is the fourth honour of Nauigators, that they haue the most and best vse of all Mathematicall discipline: <hi>Arithmeticke, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Astronomie</hi>; and as it is set downe as a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Moses,</hi>

honour, especially in those artes and professions which were first found out by men famous &amp; renouned in their times. And this is the fifth honour of Nauigators: for howsoeuer prophane historians in their histories, doe ascribe both the inuention of shipping, and the art of Nauigation, to one of themselues, one <hi>Atlas,</hi> a Moore, (whom for his skill in Astronomie, the Poets faine to beare vp the heauens with his shoulders) as if he were the first inuentor, and in part a perfecter of this excellent Art; yet we Christians, (as we reade in the Scripture) do hold, that the first vse of shipping, and the Art of Nauigation, came both immediately from God himselfe; and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to <hi>Noah</hi> in forme of an Arke, which hee was not only <note n="z" place="margin">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2016:14"/>
whereby the arch-enemie of mankind, the diuell, set vpon our great grand-mother <hi>Eue,</hi> and by it brought sin into the world, to draw her from her subiection to her creator, by insinuating vnto her, that God had no good meaning toward her and her husband, in <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Genes.</hi> 3 1.</note> 
               <hi>abridging them of their free liberty to eate of all the trees of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> telling her, <note n="b" place="margin">

               <hi>that by eating she should be like to God.</hi> So doth he still suggest vnto inferiours, the hard dealing of their superiours, that by procuring them to take some course for further liberty, he may bring them to disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which breeds disorder, and is the high way to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confusion. For as the fowlers lay not meate in the shrapes for birds; nor fishers so carefully bait their hooks, to feed those fowles or fishes fatter, but to catch and make prey of them: so the diuell vnder these pretenses and faire shewes, doth aime to bring men to disobedience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>Here therefore in this example, of Christs Disciples following their Master into the ship, all inferiours are taught a lesson of obedience vnto their superiours, that as the Centurion in this Chapter before, saith of himselfe, <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>that he had souldiers vnder him; And he saith to one goe, and he goeth, and to another come, and he commeth, and to his seruant doe this, and he doth it.</hi> So all that are vnder authority, should acknowledge subiection, and bee dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by their superiours.</p>
            <p>But specially it is a fit meditation for Sea-men, (for whose sake principally I haue written this discourse) who in their ships and Fleets, are a body and a kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth seuered from other men; consisting of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers orders and degrees, of which, some are to command and gouerne, and others (according to their seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) to obey and take direction: Amongst whom there cannot come a greater plague, then mutinie and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the inferiour sort, which hath been the ouerthrow of many voyages and discoueries; and cannot bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise without carefull and speedy preuention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:2016:15"/>As it is fit therefore that the Commanders in long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages should haue large Commissions, to represse disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this kind: so it is necessary for the common sort of sailors to be conscionably instructed in their duties of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which they see practised and performed by the Apostles and Disciples of our Sauiour Christ in this place, toward their Lord and Master.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But yet secondly, the Apostles rule of obedience being this, <note n="d" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.</note>

            <p n="2">2. Secondly, that though he seeme neuer so good, yet if he command others to doe that which is wicked, hee is not to bee obeyed. In this respect let vs learne with the Apostles, in all things to follow Christ as our chiefe Lord and Commander; and so farre as any of our superiours shall command nothing contrary vnto Christ, wee are bound to obey them; but if they command any wicked or vnlawfull thing, our answere is with the Apostles, <note n="e" place="margin">

            <p>The second followeth, which is the danger of the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> appearing in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, the arising of a tempest in the Sea, so that the ship was couered with waues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, that Christ was asleepe: both which put together, gaue occasion to the Disciples both to bee in great feare, and to awake and call vpon their Master. Of both these it is the common receiued opinion of diuines, that they were extraordinarie, the tempest being either then raised by our Sauiour Christ, and by the power of his Godhead; or at the least foreknowne and foreseene of him, and his voyage purposely vndertaken at that time, to shew his power and command ouer it. And his sleepe being voluntary and of purpose, thereby bringing his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into further danger, and so not only making triall of their faith, but arming them against future perils.</p>
            <p>First, for the tempest and the danger of it.

            <p>But we consider further here, the manner of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples comming vnto Christ, by the extremitie of danger whereby they were driuen, not onely presently and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to call vpon him, but with exclamation and outcrie to crie and roare to him, thereby to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As therefore if a man shall see his house on fire, hee comes not coldly and faintly to entreat his neighbors help, &amp; to yeeld them reasons: but breakes out into exclamations, Fier, fier! water, water!
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2016:25"/>
ladders, ladders! helpe, helpe! we are all vndone, &amp;c. So in this place, in this extreme perill of water, it may wel be presumed, that the Disciples being in great feare, skree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and made a pitifull noise to awake their Master. And howsoeuer the prayers of the godly are neuer vnseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and are therefore to be vsed at all times, and vpon all occasions (as was said before), yet certainely they are neuer so earnest, so feruent, so hearty, and consequently so effectuall, as in extremity of trouble. This therefore is a principall reason why God doth suffer afflictions in this life to seaze vpon, and euen to be ready to ouerthrow his owne dearest children.

I conclude therefore that it is not onely lawfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, but necessary for a man in extreame danger of death, to call vpon God for deliuerance from the danger; so that he referre his will to Gods will, and be resolued of a better life, if it please God to take away this.

               <hi>They are blessed that die in the Lord, they rest from their labours</hi>; and being wearied with the great burthen of his sinnes, he desireth that rest. But here in these words, <hi>Saue vs,</hi> we haue before obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the <hi>faith of the Disciples,</hi> acknowledging his power to saue them, and expecting it though very faintly. It was their faith, whereby they thought hee was able to saue them; but the weaknes of their faith, that they imagined he could not saue them, except he were awake. And no maruell if their faith were yet weake, (for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherof this miracle was chiefly wrought) being yong schollers, fresh-water souldiors, newly entertained by our Sauior Christ, &amp; not fit to be sent forth yet into the world as may appeare in the tenth Chapter of this Gospell.</p>
            <p>Much more fearfull seemes to be the case of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who hauing seene this miracle, and in it the command that our Sauiour had ouer the winds and sea; and hauing receiued commission as a chiefe Apostle, not only <note n="m" place="margin">

               <hi>All these things came to them for ensamples, and were written to admonish vs, vpon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ would teach them, that they were but men, and so weake and feeble in themselues, that they ought both to acknowledge their weakenesse, and labor continually to increase their strength: but therein not to trust to themselues, but to depend vpon him, and say with the man in the Gospell, <note n="q" place="margin">

and cried out for feare, thinking him to be a spirit. He saith to them, Be of good comfort: It is I, be not afraid.</hi> So according to this interpretation, it should be a speech, to raise vp their deiected harts and spirits, and to relieue and comfort them. And if wee vnderstand the meaning in this sense, then we learne here, the difference betwixt this, and other of Christs miracles; for that in them he cured the bodily diseases, of the leprosie, paulsey, blindnesse, deafenesse, lamenes: but in this he cured the inward affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the mind, in immoderate griefe, feare, fainting, and distrust of his mercie; which are farre greater then bodily sicknesses. And herein he teacheth vs, that though their faith was very weake, <note n="o" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20.</note> 
               <hi>that he doth not breake the bruised reede, nor quench the smoaking flaxe,</hi> but comfort and nourish, and cherish the least desires of goodnesse in his Saints and children. And in that hee doth this before he worke the miracle, he not onely sheweth, that he hath more care of their soules then of their bodies: but withall teacheth them (and in them all Christians) to be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally carefull for the health of their soules, without which they are <note n="p" place="margin">

            <p>But I take it rather (as the current both of the ancient Fathers and new Writers doe agree) to be a reprehension or reproofe of the Disciples, containing, first, a question, <hi>Why are ye fearefull?</hi> Secondly, an answere, <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> The question may seeme strange; for how should they not be feareful, that saw the danger of present death before their eyes, as they verily thought? They were men subiect to passions, and imminent perils cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the passion of feare, they must be either Stoicks or stocks that are not moued with such apparent danger.

As therefore Christ himself in the next Chapter, in another miracle vpon one that was sicke of the Palsey, when he had first told him; <note n="h" place="margin">

               <hi>doth command him to arise, take vp his bed, and goe vnto his owne house.</hi> And so thorowly curing the man by his word, doth manifestly proue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be God, and to haue power as well in the one, as in the other. So in this place, though they giue him the terme of a man, yet enquiring what man, and so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him more then a man, by the worke that he hath
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2016:43"/>
wrought, in commanding the winds and seaes, they doe in a sort confesse him to be God.</p>
            <p>For conclusion therefore of the History, the meditation rising to sea-men from hence is this, that as in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of their voyages, they must (if they haue any hope to make a good and prosperous voyage) begin at Christ, and be carefull and sure to take him along with them: that is, to examine the lawfulnesse of their callings and professions, either as sea-men, or as Merchants and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to doe seruice vnto God, and to the state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue, committing themselues to that vast ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the sea, and depending vpon Gods protection and defence, and so expecting a blessing from him in all their honest labours; so must they prepare themselues before hand, (especially in long voyages, and amongst Infidels) for many disasters and counterbuffes, not onely of wind &amp; weather, (which our Sauiour Christs ship was subiect to in his short voyage) but of many other dangers, which cannot possibly be auoided; and if Christ seeme to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe, in not affoording them present helpe, by their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and hearty prayers to awake and stirre him vp, by faith beleeuing his omnipotent power, and by hope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting and waiting his leisure, submitting their willes to his will, and ready as well at sea, as at land, and as well by death as by life, to giue him praise and glory. And thus much shall suffice for this history of Christs voyage, and the meditations thence arising.</p>
            <p>But I haue yet a further taske in the second generall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> part of the text, that is, the mysterie. In the former I haue endeauoured to teach sea-men to be Christians: but now I am to shew that all true Christians bee sea-men, and haue a longer voyage in hand then to the East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for their whole life is but a voyage from earth to heauen. In which voyage they haue a sea to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and a ship to passe in; and in their passage, they must looke for great tempests, threatning to drowne both them and their ship: and they shall find Christ (in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2016:44"/>
whom they trust) to be asleepe, as if he regarded not their danger; but if they waken him by their deuout prayers, he will arise quickly, and not onely make all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to vanish, and secure the ship; but neuer leaue them nor forsake them, till he haue brought them to heauen, the hauen where they would be.

            <p>And certainely a ship may be the true resemblance of the Church of Christ in many respects.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, in the building, a ship must be made in the keele toward the water and the earth very close and tight, but is open aloft in the vpper part toward heauen: so the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2016:48"/>
Church of Christ is close, and shut vp toward the world the sea; but open vpwards towards God; for <note n="c" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, a ship that intends to make a long voyage,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> must not onely be built, but well furnisht and prouided of many necessaries; she must haue her Ballast, her Mast, her Rigging, her Sayles, her Victualing, her Ordinance, her Lading, and that neither too light, nor too heauy, and of such Merchandize as will best vent in the place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she is to trade; she must haue her Helme to bee gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by, and her Compasse whereby to steere a right course: and she must haue skilfull Commanders, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Officers, and painefull Saylers: she must haue a Wind to carry her along, and instruments to take the height of the Sunne, and the Starres, whereby she may be sure to steere a good course: And lastly, she must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided of an Anchor, both in time of danger, and being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in the Port or Hauen.

We humbly entreate thee therefore to continue thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly protection ouer vs, that we make not our selues a prey vnto them: Watch thou ouer vs (O Lord) and giue vs grace so to watch ouer our selues, that wee may not any waies so misbehaue our selues, that thy Gospell, which we professe, may by our meanes be euill spoken of amongst them.

Let vs not be ouertaken with the sins of couetousnes or pride; but both detest all filthie lucre, knowing it cannot profit vs to win all the world and lose our owne soules: and that the more blessings thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowest vpon vs, the more humble hearted wee ought to be, and so to carrie our selues. Let vs striue by all meanes to win and draw these Heathen to faith in thy name, and to that end let vs deale faithfully and truly with them, so as wee may giue no scandall vnto our profession. And teach vs so to acknowledge thy goodnesse and mercie toward vs, that wee may euer be readie to publish and declare it vnto others, and depending still vpon thee (not for any merits of ours, but for thy Sonne our Sauiour Iesus Christ his sake) may ascribe vnto thee all honour, praise, and glorie for euer and euer.
