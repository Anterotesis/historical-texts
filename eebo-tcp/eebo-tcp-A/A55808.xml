            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IN vain do we give Kings the pompous Titles of <hi>Great and Mighty:</hi> In vain has Heaven allotted them a Power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of its own, free and uncontrolable, if like <hi>Billiard-Table</hi> Kings they are onely ſet up to be ſhaken and thrown down by the ſaucy touches of their humble Vaſſals. If their Authority has ſuch confinements, as ſome Men would have us perſuaded it has, Princes are at beſt but glittering <hi>Pageants,</hi> all the profeſſions of ſteady Loyalty but ſolemn impertinencies, and Heaven it ſelf is a ſharer in the gaudy Deluſion. It is not long ſince this Iſle was reckon'd amongſt the blackeſt inſtances of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Rebellion, when the beſt of Kings and the beſt of Men fell by the rude violence of a conſecrated Axe; ever ſince we have felt the unfortunate conſequences of that diſmal Blow; a Blow which like that that was given to the Worlds great Redeemer, rent the Vail of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in two, aboliſh'd all its pious Canons, and made them give place to the New-fangled Whimſies of Religious Hypocrites; a fact ſo horrid and unexampled, that if we may believe <hi>Salmaſius, Cui ſimile nec praeterita ſecula vidêrunt, nec ventura forſitan videbunt.</hi> All this was done under the flattering diſguiſes of Religion, by Men who had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to boaſt of a more than ordinary Inſpiration, and who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have received more light from Heaven, than that Aſs whom the Antients fondly accuſed for drinking up the Moon, who
<pb facs="tcp:97289:3"/>
could throw themſelves into all the Poſtures of Religion, with as great facility as a Skilfull Tumbler can act the <hi>Italian</hi> Strades, and with a ſort of popular Piety cheated three Nations into a belief, that whatſoever they did, was highly lawful, ſo true is that which <hi>Machiavel</hi> ſays, <hi>fere omnes homines magis ſpecie, &amp; colore rerum, quàm rebus ipſis permoventur &amp; judicant.</hi> In vain do our learned Tribe go about to reclaim theſe Men by dint of Argument, all their ſober reaſonings are to them but important Trifles, and were always accounted too weak baits to catch the Carpes of <hi>Geneva</hi> Lake. And who I pray would take the pains to convince a <hi>Taylor</hi> by a Syllogiſm, who perhaps af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conſummation of a pair of Breeches, creeps into a <hi>Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-Houſe,</hi> where after he has lin'd his Pallet with that facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous juice, he looks upon his long and limber Fingers to have been contriv'd by Nature for the handling of a Scepter, and curſes the bitter fates that had dwindled it into a Needle, away he goes home, and performs the Offices of diſtributive Juſtice upon his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices ſhoulders, and fancies every piece of Parchment cut from an old Bond to make his meaſures withal, little leſs to be than clippings from of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> Such a Knave as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no other Logick than what the Pillory can afford him, to make his Ears pay for the petulancy of his Tongue. Another ſort of Man there is, whom in the Country Language we may call <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,</hi> who perhaps has got fourſcore pounds a year, and joys in having a little Dove-coat annex'd to his Farm-houſe, who is famous all over the Neighbouring Villages for his little Cheſnut Mare, who in a Race at a late Wake ſignalized her ſelf by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing a Cart-horſe; ſuch a Man as this you can never convince by dint of Argument, he tells you roundly that at the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity be'l draw his Yard and half of Rapier to defend his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ruſty Bacon from the rude inſults of Arbitrary Power: You would laugh in your Sleeve (if you have any) to hear his brisk and debonair reaſonings, about the Authority of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and you cannot imagine with what deference and regard he is entertain'd amongſt the Mobile, beeauſe he gives them to know the tranſactions of State, and fills the whole Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with News; 'tis odds but you ſhall ſee him at the next E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Knight of the Shire, brandiſhing in his Campagn Coat and Mountero, at the head of a Troop of Dapper-Day-Labourers, on whom prodigal Fortune has munificently beſtow'd two pounds a
<pb facs="tcp:97289:3"/>
Year, and who with complicated Intereſts are ſtriving to ſet up their Idol <hi>Repreſentative.</hi> Now the defections of ſuch a Man as this from the Principles of Loyalty, we cannot think to obviate by the moſt improved reaſonings; his Prejudices ſtop up all the Avenues of his Soul, hindring the leaſt beam of Truth to enter in, and enlighten his Underſtanding: his too fervent Zeal for his Principles will not give him the leiſure to be convinced, and his ignorance baffles all the attempts of Reaſon: as he does not take up any Opinion for the Affinity it bears to Truth, ſo neither does he relinguiſh any for its oppoſition to the ſame, if his intereſt invites him he eaſily accords with any thing, and his Reaſon finds no regrets in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a profitable Error: as you cannot diſengage him from his miſtakes, ſo neither can you ſettle him in a Truth, although you bring all the Credentials of a firm Demonſtration, and the reaſon is, becauſe a Diſcourſe to him is no more than it is to a School-Boy, the jingling of a Noun and Verb together. If then any thing will do, it muſt be <hi>Satyr,</hi> and we may if we obſerve, find in the dulleſt apprehenſions a quicker reſentment of a Jeſt than of an Argument, the one renders that ridiculous, which the other perhaps cannot make appear to be falſe, and <hi>Satyrs</hi> are like thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Apes, of whom I have read, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> came into thoſe parts, They ſtraight rally'd thelr deformed Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, rank'd themſelves in Battalia, camp'd and decamp'd with all the moving Solemnities of a real Army, and brought greater affronts upon that all-conquering Army with their Martial Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than all the force of <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Parus,</hi> I have made the Compariſon, let ſome courteous Reader make out the Application. For this cauſe it is that I have ridicul'd all the <hi>Commonwealths</hi> that lay in my way, from great old <hi>Rome</hi> to little modern <hi>Geneva;</hi> What I have ſaid on this Theam, if the Peruſer be not too phlegmatick, muſt needs create in him ſome faſtidious thoughts of that way of Governing. More eſpecially I have hinted at our late pretended Republican Powers, and in particular at their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous innovations about Religions; where I have let any thing ſlip from my Pen, that may ſeem extravagant, I hope it will not be look'd upon as an unruly Effort of my own, but onely as an endeavour to expoſe the Giddy <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> of thoſe times. I ſhall ſay nothing neither as to the matter or manner of the Verſe, I know the whole <hi>Poem</hi> will labour under the imputations of uneaſie roughneſs, yet I could never imagine that ſmoothneſs ſhould be ſo
<pb facs="tcp:97289:4"/>
abſolutely neceſſary in the dreſſing up of a <hi>Satyr;</hi> it always ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me as diſagreeable to ſee a <hi>Satyr</hi> Cloath'd in ſoft and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Language, as to ſee a Woman ſcold and vent her ſelf in <hi>Billings-gate</hi> Rhetorick in a gentile and advantageous Garb.
