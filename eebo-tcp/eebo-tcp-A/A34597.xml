            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>REligion is the grand employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lives, the main deſign and biaſs of our ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Natures, the important work and task that Heaven hath ſet us: and calls for our greateſt vigour and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity to attend it: and though perhaps it may ſuffer ſome diminution from the meanneſs of the Perſon, who treats of it: Yet it is not to be denied, that its own intrinſick worth and native excellency are ſufficient to render it moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all intelligent Minds, and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Underſtandings.</p>
            <p>I pretend not to any high ſtrain of Eloquence, or high flown Rhetoricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for if I were Maſter of a very flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Oratory; yet ſhould I at this time

wave it, and ſtudy plainneſs; the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am in, a Curate: the Perſons I write unto, not Courtiers but Country-men: oblige me to it.</p>
            <p>My Office is to preſent my Reader with a Portraicture of Practical Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; eſpecially as it hath an aſpect to the Duties which conſtitute our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Here it is not proper to be quaint and florid, but to make Impreſſion on Mens Hearts; and bring the Deity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Souls. This I have attempted to accompliſh in the enſuing Sheets: though I moſt frankly acknowledge how feeble and languid my Enterprize hath been.</p>
            <p>Among the plain Directions which I have given towards the Conſummating of a Religious Life, I have placed thoſe which reſpect the Lord's Day in the Front of all: and with good reaſon; ſeeing this ſacred time is the Queen and Empreſs of all the Days in the Week; and hath a juſt precedency of them by our Saviour's Inſtitution, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of his holy Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105679:4"/>Religion commenceth here: he that begins not with the right Celebration of this Day; will be extreamly defective in all the other acts of Devotion and Religion.</p>
            <p>This therefore in the firſt place I moſt paſſionately recommend to all Votaries of Chriſtianity; that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves in the due Obſervation of this Divine Time: and accordingly I here offer them ſuch Rules, as will be a certain conduct to them, and fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them how to behave themſelves, in all the Portions of that Sacred Day.</p>
            <p>If this attempt be favoured and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Religious Reader: I ſhall be animated then to aſpire to a further degree of conſulting his Spiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by committing to the Preſs thoſe other Directions which I have prepared for the guidance of pious Minds in the grand buſineſs of Religion.</p>
            <p>In the interim, I bid ſuch adieu, and inceſſantly implore the Tri-une Deity; That theſe my weak endeavours may prove Auſpicious.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Saturday's Eve Devotion.</head>
            <p>I Shall wave all the Opinions I have read, concerning the beginning of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; becauſe I would not here enter into a Controverſy with any Man.</p>
            <p>The Sentiments of Men are various, yet how different ſoever they may be otherwiſe, ſure I am, all agree in this: That a due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration the Even before, will be a great help to perform the Duties of the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>The Primitive Chriſtians uſed to ſpend the greateſt part of <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, in Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Watching, and Prayer; to fit them for the Duty of the ſubſequent Day: from whence, I ſuppoſe, our Church borrows the Cuſtom of reading the Collect for the <hi>Sunday,</hi> upon the Eve foregoing. Nay, ſo zealous were they in God's Service, that upon the ringing of the Bell to Church, the Plowman uſed to leave the Plow, and the Tradeſman his Shop, to join with the Miniſter in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, for a Bleſſing on the Sabbath.</p>

Beg, O beg of God, Dear Chriſtian! to give thee a true ſight and ſenſe of all thy Sins: which thou maiſt do in this following Prayer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Father of Light, and God of Love, grant me true Light, true Love, and true Wiſdom; that I may clearly diſcern what doth pleaſe, or diſpleaſe thy Divine Majeſty: moſt earneſtly deſiring, even from my very Soul, to deteſt the one; and embrace the other. Illuminate the Eyes of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that I may truly ſee my Sins, and Imperfections: ſtrengthen my Memory, that I may duly confeſs them: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify my Will, that I may reſolutely amend them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Return, O my Soul! to thy Self, and to thy God. Lament, Repent, Amend. The Spirit indeed is willing, but the Fleſh is weak: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turn thou me, O Lord; and I ſhall be

turned. Convert thou me, and I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Further me, I humbly beſeech thee, with thy continual help, that in all my Works, begun, continued and ended in thee, I may glorify thy holy Name, and finally, by thy Mercy, obtain Everlaſting Life, through Jeſus Chriſt Our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>Of theſe, and all my other Sins that I have committed from my youth up, unto this preſent day, I moſt heartily repent me, O Lord my God! and I am truly ſorry for every thought, word, and act, by which I have provoked thy wrath and indignation againſt me: eſpecially for my diſobedience of ſo holy a Law; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ingratitude to ſo bountiful a Lord. O God, I do acknowledge my ſelf unworthy the leaſt of thy Mercies, and obnoxious to the greateſt of thy Judgments: but thou haſt revealed thy ſelf a God of Pity and Compaſſion, for giving the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities of ſuch as truly repent, and acquitting thoſe that voluntarily acquit themſelves.

my own guiltineſs; reſolving patiently to bear whatſoever affliction thou laiſt upon me for my Sins: hoping for Pardon, through the alone Mercies of our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And now, O moſt gracious and liberal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor! with my whole ſtrength and faculties of Soul and Body, I praiſe and magnify thy name, for thy great and innumerable benefits, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purely from thy bounty, and intended wholly for my good. Particularly, for preſerving the this Week in the midſt of ſo many dangers inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to my condition; and delivering me from ſo many Calamities and Miſeries due to my Sins.</p>
               <p>Thou art my Creator, O my God! and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Protector: thou art the ultimate end of my being, and the ſupream perfection of my Nature, and under the ſhadow of thy Wings is my perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual repoſe: from the Light of thy Countenance flows Eternal Joy and Felicity. To Thee be Glory and Honour, Adoration and Praiſe from all Creatures, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince thou haſt ordained us the day to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in, and the night to take our reſt: as I praiſe thee for the bleſſings of the day paſt, ſo I beſeech thee for thy Protection this Night. Let the Eye of thy Providence watch over me, and thy holy Angels pitch their Tent about me; that being ſafely delivered from all dangers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably refreſhed with moderate ſleep; I may be the better enabled to perform the employment of my

condition, and faithfully perſevere in the duties of thy Service to my Lifes end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Beware of ſitting up late your ſelf on the <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, or of cauſing others to do ſo; Leſt when you go into the Houſe of God, to join with the multitude in Prayer, you are fitter to ſleep than pray: differing little from the dead Bodies, aſleep in their Graves. The one ſleeps above the Earth; the other underneath it.</p>
            <p>And when you are laid in your Bed, let not your mind run on Worldly thoughts: but think of the infinite Majeſty of God, that you are then to meet, think of the great weight and importance of the holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then vouchſafed you; how they concern thy Salvation or Damnation, thy Everlaſting Life or Death. Meditate on the ſhort time thou haſt to enjoy the Sabbath in: how near thy Life is to an end: how eaſily God can take down this Earthly Tabernacle: how there is no working, no labour, no ſtriving in the other World, to which thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and continue thus muſing till the fire of Meditation begin to burn. If thou thus lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thy Heart with God on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, no doubt but you will find it with him the next Morning.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Awaking with God.</head>
            <p>AS ſoon as ſleep hath unſeal'd thine Eyes, lift up thy Soul in Thankſgiving to thy Maker for preſerving thee that night, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording thee a good beginning of a new day; eſpecially a Sabbath day; to labour for his Glory, and the good of thine own Soul. And that you may be incited to perform this Act of praiſe, conſider theſe ſeveral motives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That perhaps many others not ſo ſinful as thy ſelf, have been hurried from their Beds to the Bar of Judgment; from a Bed of Down they have been caſt into a Bed of Flames: yet God in his infinite Mercy hath ſpared you until now, to Repent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your Accounts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that many others are viſited by God Almighty with Sickneſs, ſo that they cannot ſerve God in the Publick Aſſemblies: while you enjoy your health and free liberty, to go with the multitude into his Courts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider that you are now brought to the beginning of another day, which when paſt, you ſhall never ſee again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105679:9"/>Thou maiſt poſſibly ſee more Sabbath Days; but that ſpace of time when the Sun is once ſet, thou ſhalt never ſee again any more. How careful then ſhould'ſt thou be to improve this Day, ſo that it may turn to the beſt account. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends Man to School to the Ant, to learn this good Husbandry (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8.) Oh that we were as wiſe for the Bread of Life, that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as the poor Piſmire for Bread, that ſprings out of the Earth!</p>
            <p>The Sabbath is an Harveſt; and he that ſleeps away his time in Harveſt, is a Son that cauſeth ſhame.</p>
            <p>The Seaman, or Mariner, obſerves his Wind and Tide, otherwiſe he cannot get to his intended Harbour: but Seaſons of Grace are not like the Tides; of which, if you miſs one, you may get another. How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then ſhouldſt thou be to improve every Minute?</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples concerning the Loaves and Fiſhes, <hi>Gather up the Fragments that nothing be loſt.</hi> The like advice I give you concerning the Lord's Day: Gather up the Parcels thereof, Let no part of it be loſt, no not the leaſt Minutes; which are pretious: to this end, Spiritualize all the objects you meet with in the Day; as thus.</p>
            <p>When firſt awake, think that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105679:9"/>
can as eaſily awaken you out of your Graves from the ſleep of Death; as he hath in your Beds, from the ſleep of Nature: Let the riſing out of your Beds, put you in mind of the Reſurrection. And when you ſee the Sun, Let your Meditation be; That if the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of one Sun be ſo glorious, how glorious will that day be, when ſo many thouſands of Bodies, far brighter than the Sun, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to accompany Chriſt at the great Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes? Conſider that this great Star muſt run in one Day, ten or twelve Millions of Leagues: and ſhall you make no progreſs in Virtue? Conſider that unwearied Harbinger is gone to take you up a Lodging in the Grave: each Minute is ſo much deducted from your Life. Follow therefore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Son of God, Work while it is Day; for the Night cometh, when no Man can work. Let not then this Light burn in vain; but endeavour by your own good Works, to let your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your Works, and glorify your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>As thou art putting on thy Apparel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſome of them were at firſt given as coverings of ſhame, being the effect of Sin; and that they are made of the Excrements and Offals of dead Beaſts, ſo that thou haſt very little cauſe to be proud of them. Nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105679:10"/>
thou haſt great cauſe to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the ſight thereof: ſeeing the richeſt Apparel are but the fine covers of the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhame. Therefore as thou art Cloathing thy Body, endeavour to Cloth thy Soul with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as with a Garment: Leſt while thou art richly apparelled in the ſight of Men; thy Soul be found to walk na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Before thou betakeſt thy Self to thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, breath forth thy Soul to God at thy firſt awaking, in this, or the like, ſhort Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>O</hi> Lord God, as thou haſt awakened my Body from laſt Nights ſleep, ſo by thy Grace awaken my Soul from the Lethargy of Sin, that at the general Reſurrection I may ariſe to Eternal Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Cloſet-Prayer, and the Preparations to it.</head>
            <p>HAving thus fitted thy Self for thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, before thou prayeſt take the wiſe Man's Counſel (<hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 18.5.23.) Prepare
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105679:10"/>
thy Self, and be not as one that tempteth God.</p>
            <p>Now for thy better preparation obſerve theſe few Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You are to remember when you ſettle your ſelf in Prayer, you then place your ſelf in the preſence of God, whoſe Eyes indeed are upon all Men; but in a more eſpecial manner upon thoſe that call upon him in Prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The conſideration of his preſence is to put you in mind, with what humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both of Soul and Body, you ought to appear before ſo great a Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lay aſide all wrath and malice againſt your Neighbour. <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that men lift up holy hands without wrath</hi> (1 Tim. 2.8.) St. <hi>Hierom</hi> confeſſeth this of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that when he was angry he durſt not enter into the Church, but <hi>totum animo &amp; corpore contremuiſſe,</hi> He trembled very much both in Body and Mind. The Spouſe of Chriſt is compared to a Dove, which ſome ſay is <hi>ſine felle,</hi> without Gall. The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens when they offered Sacrifice threw the Gall of the Beaſt away: and wilt thou offer to God the Gall of wrath, bitterneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, with the Sacrifice of Prayer?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Baniſh all Worldly thoughts out of your Heart. Our Saviour when he taught us
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105679:11"/>
to pray, by the Preface to the Petitions telleth us where our affections in Prayer ſhould be, <hi>viz.</hi> in Heaven: <hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven.</hi> Therefore before you begin to pray, you are to reſolve within your ſelf, ſeriouſly to intend the Duty you are about, that your heart may not wander, but go along with your Prayers: Or if through weakneſs it happens to ſtray, to call it back again, and ask Pardon for it, in ſome ſuch Prayer as this:</p>
            <q>Lord ſtrengthen me, and reſtrain me, and lay not this weakneſs to my charge.</q>
            <p>Having entred thy Oratory, propoſe theſe few Queſtions to thy Soul, and engage thy ſelf to an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>O my Soul! Wherefore art thou now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into this place? What is thy deſign? What are thy Pretenſions? Where is thy God, whom thou comeſt to treat with? Is he preſent? Doth he hear thee? Is he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful? Will he help thee? What is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou art to negotiate? Is it the ſaving thy Soul, or the ſatisfaction of Earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires? What words wilt thou uſe to move God to hear thee? What humble Geſture? What profound Reverence? Doſt thou know who thou art before? Is not Gods Eye upon all, to obſerve Head and Heart, Lip and Life? Dareſt thou ſuffer thy thoughts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105679:11"/>
then to wander? Will he be pleaſed with that Sacrifice he hath accurſed, of drawing nigh to him with our Lips, when our Hearts are far from him?</p>
            <p>Anſwer thy ſelf briefly to every one of theſe Interrogatories, as thy own Conſcience dictates to thee; for by this Diſcourſe made to thy ſelf, thou ſhalt be better prepared to diſcourſe with God.</p>
            <p>Having thus prepared thy ſelf for Prayer, thou maiſt then fall down on thy Knees, and to thy ordinary Prayers (which muſt not on this Day by any means be omitted) add theſe following Heads of Prayers: ſuitable in ſome meaſure, to the ſolemnity of the Day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You are to pray for the Miniſter, that God would give him the door of utterance, that he may open his mouth boldly to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the myſteries of the Goſpel: that he may ſpeak the word truly, ſincerely, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and profitably; delivering that which is ſutable and ſeaſonable to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You are to pray for your ſelves, that he would baniſh out of your Head all wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, worldly thoughts, which may diſtract your minds in the hearing of the word, and ſo choak that Heavenly Seed, make it Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: and that he would give unto you as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to hearken; ſo Underſtanding to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105679:12"/>
conceive, Wiſdom to apply, Judgment to diſcern, Faith to believe, Memory to retain, and Grace to practiſe, what you ſhall hear: So that the word may prove unto you, not a Savour of Death unto Death, but of Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life; all which you may do in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prayer.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Lord God, from whom alone are the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of the heart, the day is now come, which being holy unto thee, I am to ſpend in thy more ſolemn Worſhip: many Sins there are by me not duly repented of, which may juſtly bring upon me a Curſe inſtead of a Bleſſing; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially my crying Sins, <hi>(Here mention thy particular Sins which thou haſt found thy Self guilty of; and alſo the Sins committed by thee, the laſt Week) that may make my Prayer an Abomination to thee.</hi> Accept, O Lord, this my Confeſſion, and (at leaſt) deſired ſorrow for them; turn my heart from them for the future; and through the blood of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſo remove the guilt of them, that they may not hinder good things from me. Let the effuſions of thy Grace, both upon me and all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of thy People, be ever plentiful: Let my heart be fixed, that no vain or worldly thoughts harbour there; while I am in thy Houſe. Quicken me with thy holy Spirit, that I may draw near unto thee with a true Heart; that I may be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105679:12"/>
in Spirit, ſerving thee; and that, receiving thy word with an honeſt and good heart, I may underſtand and keep it: and bring forth fruit with patience, and to perfection.</p>
               <p>Remember thou thy Servants which are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thy myſteries unto thy People, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally him upon whoſe teaching I wait: Pardon their Sins and Frailties, open their Mouths, guide their Minds and Tongues, that they may deliver thy truths in the demonſtration of thy Spirit: and let thy Work ſo proſper in their hands, that they may both ſave themſelves, and them that hear them, that both may be built up in our moſt holy Faith, to the perfecting thy Church, and Eternal Glory of thy name thereby, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>You may alſo add this Prayer.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>O</hi> Lord! Holineſs becometh thy Houſe, and dutifulneſs becometh me to go into thy Courts, and wait upon thee, and this is the great day of thy Service: thou that haſt given me to ſee the light of this day, make me careful to do the duty of it; timely to preſent my ſelf unto thee; and reverently to behave my ſelf before thee; that when I go hence, I may return with fruit and favour from thee, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>O</hi> Thou in whoſe Temple every man ſpeaks of thine honour, whoſe Glory no mortal man can ſufficiently expreſs, whoſe Goodneſs no tongue is able to diſplay, whoſe Holineſs tranſcends all the perfections we ſee here below! overaw my Spirit, when I go with the multitude to the Houſe of God, with the Voice of Joy and Praiſe. O let me conſider, that it is the All-ſeeing God in whoſe preſence I ſtand; and that holy Angels are ſent to obſerve my Devotion! Give me ſober Thoughts, holy Affections, devout Poſtures, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of Mind, ardent Deſires, modeſt Looks, and a grave Behaviour: eſpecially now I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive the Sacrament. Now, let all that is within me turn into holy breathings; baniſh from me all undecent thoughts; and if thou doſt not think fit to free me from temptations before they come, give me Grace vigorouſly to reſiſt them, that I may ſhow my Zeal to thy Glory, by my abhorrence of all imaginations, that exalt themſelves againſt the obedience of Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>AFter thou haſt fitted thy Self for Church, thy next care muſt be carefully and conſcientiouſly to perform Family-Duties: <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24.15. Let others do what they will, <hi>I and my Houſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will ſerve the Lord.</hi> In order to the performance of which duty, take along with you theſe following Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. See that your Servants and Children waſte not away the Morning in ſleep and idleneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cauſe them to join together in Prayer, reading, or any other Godly Exerciſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make them accompany you to Church, command their Bodies, though you cannot their Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Inform your ſelves and them, what a great and glorious Majeſty and Maſter you are to ſerve: a God ſo glorious, that the very Angels vail and cover their Faces, not being able to behold the brightneſs of his Glory. And if this lowly Reverence be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105679:14"/>
by them, who are in ſuch nearneſs to God; what poſture is low enough for us, who, in compariſon of thoſe Heavenly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are viler than the ground we tread on.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Make them ſenſible, what poor Worms and wretched Creatures they are, Duſt and Aſhes; their Hearts full of Putrefaction, and a ſink of Sin: and therefore ought to come crawling, crouching and trembling, to the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Examine what Preparation they have made for the Sabbath; whether they have not ſpent more time and care to dreſs their Body for the Eye of Man, than to deck their Soul for the Eye of God. Whether they have prayed in private for a bleſſing on God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Inform them ſeriouſly of the great work they go about, what a weighty work it is, how that their Weeks Works are but toys and trifles in compariſon of it. What are Sheep, Oxen, or Shops; to Grace, Chriſt, and Heaven? Exhort them all to be careful and ſerious in God's work, in Soul-Salvation-Work: and therefore they ought to prepare themſelves with all their might.</p>
            <p>Remember the Fourth Commandment binds you to look to all within your care, both Man-Servant and Maid-Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whoſoever rides them unneceſſary Journeys
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105679:14"/>
on that day, the groans of the tired Beaſt, will riſe up in judgment againſt them, and condemn them for breaking God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>As Motives hereunto, conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is God in a Family, not Man only that maketh it to proſper: ſo that if thou wouldeſt have it go well with thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; then oughteſt thou to ſet up the worſhip of God in it. The Lord bleſſed the Houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> for the Arks ſake: ſo God will bleſs thy Houſe, if the Ark, that is, his worſhip be there. Wouldſt thou have thy Family flouriſh, ſet up the worſhip of God in it. Let no wicked Perſon remain in thine Houſe. He that will not pray and join in the worſhip of God with thee; Let him not eat with thee. Make <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s reſolution; <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember you muſt be accountable to God for thoſe Souls he hath committed to your charge: you ought therefore to take care that they be trained up in the fear of the Lord. See that none of your Family be given to any Vice, <hi>viz.</hi> Swearing, Drinking, Lying, or the like. Make choice of ſuch Servants as fear God: chuſe for him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and not altogether for your ſelf. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the firſt place, whether they will ſubmit to his word: if not, let them not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105679:15"/>
come under thy roof. As thou wouldſt not have the Devils Company in thine Houſe; ſo do not entertain any of his Friends and Servants; but rather let it be an Harbour and Habitation of God's Children: for ſo ſhalt thou be bleſſed. You know that God bleſſed <hi>Laban</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſake: ſo may you likewiſe expect a Bleſſing, if you entertain ſuch in your Houſe.</p>

               <p>We humbly and heartily acknowledge thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, tender Love, and Fatherly Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us thy unworthy Servants , moſt vile and wretched Sinners, in that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee not only to give us a liberal allowance of time to do our own Works, and follow our own Callings and Recreations, for the health of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the neceſſities of this preſent Life: but alſo to appoint us one day in ſeven to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, do thy Work, and fit our ſelves to keep with thee an Everlaſting Sabbath in the higheſt Heavens.</p>

               <p>And now, O Lord, as thou haſt given us a day to ſerve thee; fit and prepare every Soul to worſhip thee as we ought. To this end, give us the aſſiſtance of thy holy Spirit, that we may learn to redeem time, and number all our days, our Sabbaths more eſpecially; that ſo we may apply our hearts unto Wiſdom: that we may now get wiſe, religious, believing and Repenting Hearts.

our ſelves for the better performance of the duties of the Week to come.</p>
               <p>And now, O Heavenly Father, we are going to thy Houſe to partake of thy Ordinances, we beſeech thee to go with us thither, and ſtand by us there; and bring us back again: rejoicing when we ſhall find our Faith encreaſed, our Hope quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, our Zeal kindled, our Hearts inflamed with the Love of thee and our Brethren. Let us not, we beſeech thee, make thy Houſe, which is an Houſe of Prayer and Spiritual Exerciſes, to be a Den of Thieves: but let us look to our Feet, that ſo we may be more ready to hear, than to offer up the Sacrifice of Fools.</p>
               <p>It is a fearful thing, when this word which ſhould he a Savour of Life unto Life, does prove a Savour of Death unto Death; as it does to many who regard not what they hear.</p>
               <p>Grant therefore, O Lord, that we may take diligent heed what we hear, and how we hear: keep us we humbly pray thee, that we be not like unto them that be compared unto the high way; who do not ſo much as bend their minds to regard what is taught: nor to them, who are compared to the ſtony ground; who do it but ſhallowly and ſuperficially: nor to them that be compared to the thorny ground; that do choak and ſmother it, with minding their eaſe, pleaſure, gain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit over much. But give us Grace to be like the good ground; who coming to the word with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

               <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the great obligation that lies upon every one of us to worſhip God in Publick.</head>
            <p>NEglect not publick Ordinances upon pretence of ſerving God in private: that God Almighty gives his Bleſſing both to private and Family-Duties, is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but to put God off with theſe, and neglect publick Worſhip: is to rob him of a greater ſumm, and pay him with a leſs.</p>
            <p>It is worth our Obſervation, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and publick Worſhip of God, are by him joined together; therefore let no Man put them aſunder: <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbath, and reverence my Sanctuary, I am the Lord your God.</hi> They then that deſpiſe God's San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, cannot obſerve God's Sabbath. Do but conſider <hi>David</hi>'s Tears for the want, and his Prayers for the fruition of Publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; even then, when he had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105679:17"/>
for private Performances: and ſurely then thou wilt eſteem the Miniſtry of the word no mean mercy. See his ſorrow for the want of them! <hi>I was driven</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the Sanctuary, when I did but think of it, my Soul was poured out like water; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the Houſe of God.</hi> Pſal. 42.3. <hi>My Soul was poured out</hi> (that is) was over-whelm'd with grief, and even ready to dye; when I compare my preſent condition with my former happineſs, in the fruition of religious Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>How bitterly and paſſionately doth he plead with <hi>Saul? If the Lord hath ſtirred thee up againſt me, let him accept an Offering: but if men, Curſed be they before the Lord, for they have driven me out this day, from the inheritance of the Lord.</hi> (1 Sam. 16.19.)</p>
            <p>How pathetically does he bemoan his own Soul? <hi>Woe is me, for I dwell in Meſeck, and have my habitation in the Tents of Kedar!</hi> The loſs of his Father, Mother, Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Lands, Liberty, nay life it ſelf; would not have gone ſo near his Heart, as the loſs of the publick Ordinances. As his ſorrow was great for the want; ſo was his Soul moſt earneſt for the fruition of them.</p>
            <p>How many Prayers does he put up for the liberty of the Tabernacle <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.3, 4.) and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105679:17"/>
Lord, which I will ſeek after:</hi> viz. <hi>That I might dwell in the Tabernacle of the Lord, and viſit his holy Temple.</hi> And (Verſe 8.) <hi>When thou ſaidſt, ſeek my face; my heart ſaid unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I ſeek. David</hi> at this time was baniſhed the Temple, and he among other reaſons uſeth this argument to reſtore him to his happineſs; as if he had ſaid: <hi>O God thou haſt commanded me to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee in the Temple. To appear before thee is my delight; my heart deſires to ſeek and ſee thy face there.</hi> Thus he prays to God for the performance on his ſide, that he might be enabled to obey God's Precept. Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>went up to the Temple at the hour of Prayer</hi> (Acts 3.1.) and St. <hi>Paul reaſoned in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue every Sabbath day</hi> (Acts 13.14.) thoſe that by their practices contemn publick worſhip, have neither Chriſt nor the Apoſtles for their Pattern. One of the Jewiſh Rabbies hath a ſaying, he that dwells in a City where there is a Synagogue, and cometh not to Prayers, <hi>merito dicitur vicinus malus:</hi> if thou forſakeſt the Aſſembly of God; how uſeful thou maiſt be to others Bodies, I know not: but I am ſure thou art neither to thine own Soul, or theirs; in neglecting God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Conſider the condition of Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who were forced to ſerve the Lord
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105679:18"/>
with fear, and attend his Ordinances with trembling: who built Churches under ground, rather than they would want the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſerving God in Publick.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo how <hi>David</hi> bemoan'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, counting Swallows and Sparrows in this much better than he, becauſe they could build their Neſts in the Temple, while he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from it. (Pſa. 84.1, 2, 3.) <hi>How amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are thy Tabernacles, O Lord? My Soul long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord: my heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God. Yea, the Sparrow hath found an Houſe, and the Swallow a Neſt for her ſelf, where ſhe may lay her young: even thine Altars, O Lord of Hoſts, my King and my God.</hi> Did <hi>David,</hi> being abridged thereof, thus bemoan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Surely then we ſhould count it a great Mercy, that we have Publick Churches and Oratories to go unto, without any lett or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation; that we have no Tyrants, no Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, no Rods, no Axes, no noiſe of War to affright us from God's publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: what cauſe of rejoicing is here?</p>
            <p>But yet, if this liberty of ours make us wanton, and the plenty God gives us tempts us to Licentiouſneſs: if inſtead of growing better we grow worſe: if the <hi>Manna</hi> we have, do not make us to hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs: we may have juſt reaſon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105679:18"/>
to fear God will remove our Candleſtick from us, and give it to a Nation that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth better fruit than we have done.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you ſay, you ſpend your time as religiouſly at home as you do at Church; that you Read, Pray, Catechiſe, and the like: but I muſt tell you, you do all this out of Seaſon; you miſ-time and miſplace duty, and you ſhould not uſe one Ordinance or Duty, in plain contempt and neglect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you cannot expect God's Preſence, nor look for the gift of God's Grace, in a way of Diſobedience to his Command, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of his appointed means.</p>
            <p>When God ſets up the Miniſtry of the word in any place, his Spirit then opens his School, and expects that all that ſhould be taught, ſhould come thither: Now (ſaith the Learned Mr. <hi>Gurnal</hi>) whether is it moſt fitting, that a Scholar ſhould wait of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at School; or that the Maſter ſhould run after his Truant Scholar at play in the Field, to teach him there? And again, put Caſe (ſaith the Reverend Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>) any of you were a Father of a numerous Off-Spring, and that without any expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, moſt of your Children ſhould agree by common conſent to viſit you together, to ask your Bleſſing, and pay their thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to you for your care of their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105679:19"/>
Education, and the liberal proviſion you have made for them; but one or two of them ſhould chuſe to come in private, when no body ſees them, and obſtinately refuſe to come with their Brethren; though they were cenſured by them for undutifulneſs and ingratitude. Now if Man would not accept of ſuch a private acknowledgment: ſhall we expect that God ſhould? God is a publick Benefactor, and upon that account may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge publick Worſhip at our hands; nay indeed God himſelf inſtituted it. In the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church the Sacrifices were publickly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up by the Prieſt: He likewiſe appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a publick place for Worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tabernacle at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which would have been of no uſe, if there had been no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to publick Worſhip: and this is enough I ſhould think, to ſatisfy any reaſonable Man, of their obligation hereunto.</p>

            <q>
               <l>Judge not the Preacher, for he is thy Judge:</l>
               <l>If thou miſtake him, thou conceiv'ſt him not.</l>
               <l>God calleth Preaching Folly. Do not grudge</l>
               <l>To pick out Treaſures from an Earthen Pot.</l>

            <p>Dear Chriſtian Brother! I pray reſolve me: Do the efficacy of the Ordinances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the parts of a Man, or on the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God? May not a coſtly treaſure be brought to thee in an Earthly Veſſel? Thou maiſt light a Candle as well by a Brimſtone Match, as by a great Fire. A ſmall Damſel was inſtrumental for <hi>Naaman</hi>'s recovery both of his corporal and ſpiritual Leproſy: And who art thou that none muſt inſtruct thee, but ſuch an one that like <hi>Saul,</hi> is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than others in gifts and abilities? I wiſh it proceed not from the Pride of thy Spirit:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105679:20"/>
a picking Stomach argues a Diſeaſed Body; and an itching Ear cannot argue a ſound Soul. The induſtrious Bee ſucks Honey from the Thyme, an harſh and dry Herb. The Meat is as good in a Pewter, as Silver-Diſh. If thou goeſt to the Table only for Sawce, and the Church for Stile and Elegancy: I dare be bold to tell thee, that thy heart is not right towards God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to thy prejudice againſt his Life which gives the lye to his Lips. I muſt needs confeſs, the night uſhers in more Stars than the day opens Eyes to behold a Miniſters Actions, Ears to liſten to their deportment, and Mouths to proclaim their actions through all Provinces: and they that forget their Sermons will remember their faults to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize their own. But if the Providence of God ſhould place thee under ſuch a Miniſter (which is no ſmall unhappineſs) yet is he not to be rejected.</p>
            <p>God Almighty fed <hi>Elijah</hi> by a Raven: and ſo may he feed thee with Heavenly Manna, by a ſinful Miniſter; who may convert thy Soul. The reaſon is (as before) becauſe the operation of the Word, does not depend on the Piety of the Preacher, but upon the free Grace and Power of God. A blind Man may hold a Candle and give light to others, while he himſelf remains in the dark. The Scribes

            <p>ORder thy buſineſs to come before the Prayers; for many and miſchievous are the conſequences of coming late.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You rob your ſelf of the opportunity of private Prayers, for a bleſſing upon the publick.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You loſe the benefit of publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Abſolution; which are of huge eſteem and value to all that are wiſely Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You willingly deprive your ſelves of part of God's publick Worſhip, which is both a Sin, and a loſs of ſo great account, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be expreſſed, nor ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p>As you are going to Church, you may make uſe of this Soliloquy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:105679:21"/>O my Soul! Let <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi>'s Death make thee careful, how thou enters irreverently into God's Houſe. If we be ſo careful to come with clean Apparel before an Earthly Prince, much more ſhould we with clean Hearts and Souls, approach our Heavenly King. A Prince may not regard how his Servants go in his Kitchen; but when they come into his Preſence-Chamber, he expects they ſhould look to their Carriage and Words. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, O my Soul! expects more honour in our religious acts, than in the ordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Lives: for in the firſt, we direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign his honour and ſervice; and if we do not perform them ſeriouſly, the greater is our Sin.</p>
            <p>Think then, O my Soul! how choice God was in the Law, about all things relating to his Worſhip: the Tabernacle and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be of the beſt Wood, the pureſt Gold, and the fineſt Linnen. The Perſons muſt be without blemiſh (<hi>Lev.</hi> 2.17.) the Sacrifice muſt be perfect, without ſpot; the beſt of the Flock, the beſt of the Beaſts, the fat that covereth the inwards. And what, O my Soul, doſt thou think was the ſubſtance of theſe ſhadows; but this? that God will be ſerved by holy Men, in the pureſt and holieſt manner: and that we muſt be exact, both as to our Perſons and Performances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:105679:22"/>Great Perſons are impatient of contempt and affronts; eſpecially when offered to them in their own Houſes. God will ſooner overlook thy forgetfulneſs of him in thy Trade, or Travels, than in the Tabernacle. When thou draweſt nigh to him, he will be Sanctified, either by thee, or upon thee: if thou refuſeſt to give him glory in thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; believe me, he will get himſelf Glory by thy Sufferings. His worſhip is his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, his Face; and look for his Fury, if thou dareſt him to his Face.</p>
            <p>The Waters of the Sanctuary, are like the Waters given to a ſuſpected Wife: if Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent they witneſs her Honeſty, and made her Fruitful, though Barren before. But if guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they cauſed the Belly to ſwell, and the thighs to rot. If thou makeſt Godlineſs thy buſineſs in the Ordinances of God, it will make thee fruitful, if barren of good Works: but if thou beeſt formal and perfunctory, and goeſt thy round in religious Duties, never minding the true end of them, nor thy Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in them: thy Prayer will be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; the word, a ſavour of Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death; and the Sacrament a Seal of thy Damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When thou comeſt at the Church-Door, ſay</hi>; Surely the Lord is in this place: how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this place? It is no other but the Houſe of God; the Gate of Heaven.</p>

               <hi>When you enter into the Church.</hi> O my Soul! where ever thou art, thou art under God's Eye; and therefore ſhouldeſt thou be no where prophane: but now thou art in his Church, thou art in his immediate Preſence. How holy oughteſt thou to be? How devout thy Behaviour? We read (<hi>Exod.</hi> 25.37.) <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to light up ſeven Lamps in his Tabernacle, the place of his publick worſhip: and why ſeven Lamps? What was the ſubſtance of theſe ſhadows? in ſhort this: that nothing ſhall eſcape his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He ſeeth what uprightneſs and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is in thy Prayers and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whether thou art Praying, Reading, Hearing, or Singing: and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thou doſt them, whether ſlothfully or diligently. His Eye is always upon thee; and his Eye-lids try thy actions: to reward or puniſh them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When you view the Baptiſterion or Font.</hi> Give hearty thanks unto God for your Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that by Holy-Baptiſm he hath called you to a ſtate of Grace and Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt: and humbly beſeech him, that you may continue in the ſame to your Lives end. For if you Apoſtatize, you are guilty of an horrid Sin; and muſt anſwer for it at the great and terrible day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>It was a cuſtom in the primitive times,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105679:23"/>
that ſuch as were Baptized did wear a white Stole: a Ceremony, to ſignify the purity of Life, the Baptized was to lead. <hi>Eliodophorus,</hi> after his Baptiſm, turning a Perſecutor of the Church , <hi>Marilla</hi> the Miniſter that Baptized him, in an holy indignation, brought forth in publick the white Stole, ſaying: <hi>This do I keep againſt thy coming to Judgment, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify thy Apoſtaſy from Chriſt.</hi> So be thou aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, O Chriſtian! that the Water with which, the Miniſter by whom, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom thou wert Baptized, ſhall riſe up againſt thee in Judgment; if thou doſt not walk in newneſs of Life.</p>

Therefore when the Miniſter exhorts you out of the Word of God, to confeſs and acknowledge your Sins and Wickedneſs, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your heart, but with all poſſible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, both of Body and Soul, ſay after the Miniſter in the Confeſſion of your Sins; and endeavour to let your Heart even melt and bleed in the bewailing your Offences: and to this, and every act of Divine Worſhip, neglect not to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> For that is as it were the Seal to confirm to your Soul, the benefits thereof. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> have a ſaying, that whoſoever ſays <hi>Amen</hi> with all his might, opens the Doors of Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

how affectionately you deſire the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>Be not ſilent, nor aſhamed, publickly and audibly, to make Confeſſion of your holy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, when you are thereunto called by the Miniſter; for this is a duty you owe both to God and Man. It is an act of God's Worſhip, and a Declaration that you hold the ſame Faith with all true Chriſtians: and therefore it is required of you, not only with the Heart to believe unto Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but with the mouth alſo, that Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be made unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>And when the Confeſſion of Faith is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly pronounced, do not ſit and loll, as if you were not concern'd at it; but ſtand up with the reſt of the Congregation: to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and declare, that you will ſtand to this Faith, and earneſtly contend for it, as being the ſame which was once given to, or by the Saints, the holy Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>I have read that it is a Cuſtom in <hi>Poland,</hi> that the Gentlemen draw their Swords all the while the Creed is a reading: intimating thereby that they will defend it with their Lives and Blood. Be you, Chriſtians, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſert and maintain your holy Faith; and reſolve to atteſt it with your deareſt Blood, if there be occaſion.</p>
            <p>If any Child be brought to Church to be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105679:26"/>
Baptized; ſit not ſtill, as if not concerned in that Office: but let it remind you of your own Vow; and put up this ſhort Prayer in behalf of the Infant.</p>
            <q>Grant that all thoſe that are to be admitted to the Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Religion; (and to this Infant more eſpecially) may eſchew thoſe things that are evil; and follow after that which is good.</q>
            <p>When any Woman comes to be Churched, reflect on the Mercies that thou receiveſt from God, to make thee thankful; and with a low Voice, put up this Prayer to God.</p>
            <q>O Lord, as thou haſt delivered this Woman, thy Servant, from the pains of a temporal; ſo, I beſeech thee to deliver both her and all here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, from the pangs of an Eternal Death.</q>
            <p>When you ſee any come to be Catechiſed, make not light of it, but after this, or the like manner pray.</p>
            <q>O Almighty and Everlaſting God! who ever makeſt thy Church fruitful, with a new, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Iſſue: increaſe Faith and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in our newly inſtructed, that they being born again may be joined unto the Sons of thy adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
            <p>When you hear the Banes of Matrimony publiſhed in the Church, fall not into Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as the manner of ſome is;) for it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Sacredneſs of the place, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105679:27"/>
out irreverence to God. We ſhould ſhow our ſelves better Chriſtians, by falling down on our Knees, and praying at the ſame time for a Bleſſing from God on them. O let us then reflect on our own Vow and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Marriage, how we have performed it: and let us make it alſo an occaſion of a freſh Engagement in our ſelves, to keep it moſt ſtrictly.</p>
            <p>I am not of the opinion of the Papiſts, that Marriage is a Sacrament; but I look upon it as a moſt ſolemn engagement among Men, and Sacred: being a Vow made before God, and witneſſed by many: and therefore a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject proper for ſeriouſneſs and devotion. When you ſing unto God, let your heart make melody: Take heed, that when your Voice is high, your Heart be not dead, flat, and low.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Word is read and preached; mind it: and ſay, this is the Word of God, 'tis his Command, and dare I diſobey it? O that my ways were made ſo direct, that I might keep God's Statutes!</p>
            <p n="2">2. When you hear the Curſes denounced againſt Sinners, tremble if thou beeſt guilty of any of the Sins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When you hear God's Calls and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, his rich Promiſes and Allurements, ſay: What, ſhall I refuſe them? Doth God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105679:27"/>
knock at them: and ſhall not the Everlaſting Doors of my Heart fly open, that the King of Glory may enter in?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, While the Miniſter is pronouncing the Bleſſing, poſt not away (a fault too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon every where) but hope, deſire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſhall come down upon you. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the puniſhment of <hi>Judas,</hi> he ſtayed not for the Bleſſing, but went away, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched himſelf. That you may not forfeit God's Protection, and be given over by the Almighty, as he was: I pray ſtay till the Bleſſing be pronounced; and after it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, fall down on your Knees, and offer up this ſhort Ejaculation.</p>
            <q>O Sweet Jeſu! beſtow on me this day thy Bleſſing, with this of the Miniſter: preſerve me from all Sin, and give me perſeverance in thy Service; that at the laſt and dreadful day of Judgment, I may receive that happy Benediction, among thy Elected and Predeſtinated Children: Come ye Bleſſed Children of my Father, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World.</q>

            <div type="part">
               <head>At your returning home.</head>
               <p>LET your return with your Family home be with the ſame gravity and care, as was thy paſſage to the Church. Let your talk be rather of what you have learnt or heard, than of any Worldly matters: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept neceſſary occaſions enforce the contrary. If any of your Neighbours talk Heavenly, mind them; but if their Diſcourſe ſavour of the World, either reprove or leave them. This I mention, becauſe I perceive it the cuſtom of many, as ſoon as the Word is out of the Miniſter's Mouth, to have the World in theirs. The main Queſtions, as ſoon as gone out of the Church, are uſually theſe:</p>
               <p>What News do you hear? How does Corn ſell? What a Crop have you upon the ground? Such a Perſon, has he not the beſt Corn in the Pariſh? Poor barren Souls! emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Grace ſurely; or your Diſcourſes would be more ſavoury, more ſeaſonable,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105679:28"/>
more Heavenly. Have you no better things to employ your Heads and Tongues about? Ask rather, what good Word you have heard to day? How are we to provide for Eternity? How ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow the Path that leadeth unto Life? and how few there be that find it? And alas! how miſerable ſhall I be, if I miſs thereof?</p>
               <p>The Devil is always upon his Watch, ever buſy, and labours continually to furniſh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Hearts with frothy and vain Diſcourſe; by that means to hinder the efficacy of the word, and the good of many a poor Soul. But alas! The fourth Commandment tyes up the tongue as well as the hands (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.13.) not ſpeaking thy own words. The tongue is there commanded to reſt from talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Worldly matters, as well as the hand from ſervile and Worldly Works. How blame-worthy then are they, who make the Lord's Day a Day of reckoning with Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Servants: a Day of idle talk, about their Pleaſures, Profits, or other matters?</p>
               <p>As ſoon as you are come home, before you refreſh your Body, enter into your Cloſet: offer up this, or ſuch like Prayer.</p>
               <q>I Do humbly and heartily thank thee, O Lord, Heavenly Father, for that wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and comfortable Inſtruction, which, this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105679:29"/>
Morning, I have heard out of thy holy word, by the mouth of thy faithful Servant: and I do heartily beſeech thee, that paſſing by my Sins and Infirmities of hearing, thou wouldſt ſo imprint the ſame in my memory, and bleſs it unto me; that I may believe it with my heart, and practiſe it in my Life and Converſation. Good Lord, Let not the ſweetneſs, and ſavourineſs, of any bodily food, which I am to receive of thy bounty, put the reliſh and remembrance of thy Heavenly word out of my mind: but grant, that in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Body, I may feed my Soul by holy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the things I have heard: and together with my bodily ſuſtenance, may call to mind the food that never periſheth. And as it is thy will, that I ſhould uſe thy good Creatures with Wiſdom and Sobriety every day: So give me Grace this day eſpecially to do ſo: that they may not make me the more unfit to partake of the ſpiritual food thou haſt prepared for me; to the glory of thy name, and the good of thy Saints, and my own eternal welfare and Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt, my only Redeemer and Advocate.</q>
               <p>Having finiſhed your Prayer in the Cloſet; depart to your Company, and the neceſſary refreſhment of your Body, which this Day was not appointed to abridge you off.</p>
               <p>While you are at Dinner appear chearful, eating your meal in ſingleneſs of heart: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice before God; but let not your joy be,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105679:29"/>
by any means, wanton, idle, vain, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>At Dinner obſerve theſe few Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beware of making the Lord's Day a time of Feaſting your Neighbours: For though it be lawful upon this day to make ſuch Proviſion, as ſhall be convenient for your own Family, and for the relief of the Poor: yet to make ſolemn Feaſts upon it (as is the cuſtom of too too many) whereby Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are kept from publick Ordinances, and our ſelves and Gueſts are more indiſpoſed to the Duties of God's worſhip and ſervice, muſt needs be unlawful: for though we be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden upon the Lord's Day, to kindle a fire for the dreſſing of meat; yet we muſt take heed that we make not ſuch a flame as ſhall kindle the fire of God's wrath againſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you are ſet down to Dinner, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begged God's Bleſſing on the food, eat no more than will fit and enable you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and lively to ſerve God. If tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be required in our Meals, on the Week Day, as (<hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.) much more on the Lord's Day. Many fill their Bellies ſo full, on this day, that they are fit only to lay their drowſie heads on the Devil's Pillow of ſloth: and not at all in a capacity of repairing again to a ſpiritual repaſt in the Houſe of God, and to partake of his Heavenly Viands.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105679:30"/>3. Talk of God's Word ſitting down and riſing up. Let your Hearts be heavenly, and your Diſcourſe ſavoury, ſeaſoned with Grace: a Table without ſome good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, differs but little from a Manger.</p>
               <p>One of the Fathers wrote this of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, that they were ſo holy in their Talk at the Table, that one would have thought they had been at a Sermon, rather than at a Supper. And <hi>Luther</hi> has a large Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> of the pious Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he uſed at his Table: that indeed was his Pulpit, where he read many profitable Lectures. When therefore thou art at a full Table, conſider God's Mercy in feeding thee; while there are ſo many <hi>Lazarus's,</hi> that would be glad of the Crumbs that fall from the rich Man's table. When thou eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy Bread with a good Appetite, ſay thus to thy ſelf: If the bread be thus ſavory to an hungry Body; how ſweet, how ſavory is that which comes down from Heaven to an hungry Soul! and then pray: <hi>O God, give me evermore of this bread!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Forget not God's Servants, but invite the Poor to Dinner with thee, that day. <hi>The poor ye have always with you,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) and why have we this <hi>Memento,</hi> think you? But we ſhould exert our Charity, according to their Indigence and Neceſſity? If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105679:30"/>
to Chriſt, we are to relieve the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, clothe the naked, and feed the hungry: himſelf will do it; though he works a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle for it. Fleſh and blood is not prone hereunto; and therefore ſuch munificence muſt needs argue a better and higher Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than ordinary. For as when we ſee the bank of a River, and the ground next to it, wet alone, we gather that the River hath overflown there: but when we ſee the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt and remoteſt ground wet alſo, then we know that the Rain hath done that: ſo when we ſee a Man doing good to his rich Neighbors, and Friends, we think this proceeds but from good Nature in him; but when we ſee him doing good alſo to ſtrangers and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known perſons; when feeding the poor and needy ones, then we may well believe, there is more than good Nature in that Man: it is more than probable the Gift of Grace is there.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>After you have eaten and drank.</head>
               <p>I have now allayed the importunate craving of mine Appetite, and my body is ſatisfied with material Food; but nothing can ſatisfie my Soul, but to behold the preſence of God in Righteouſneſs. Therefore, Dinner being over, either reſpect the Word heard that day, and read the Scripture, or ſome other good Book; and call your own Heart and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105679:31"/>
Family to an account for what you have read or heard; and explain the ſame to them. This is commended to us by the Practice and Example of our Lord himſelf, who when he was come home, ſaid unto his Diſciples (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.5.) <hi>Have you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all theſe things? viz.</hi> that he had preached to the Multitude. And <hi>(Mark</hi> 4.34.) <hi>When they were alone he expounded all things to his Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon one obſerveth, That Chriſt by his Example doth inſtruct every Maſter of a Family, how to carry himſelf in reference to thoſe under his charge on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>day,</hi> after their departure from the publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>A treble Benefit will follow hereupon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect to our ſelves: for the more you build up others, the more your ſelves are built up in Knowledge, Faith, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of your Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for it will make them to hearken more attentively to what is, in publick, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: when they know they ſhall be called to an Account for the ſame at home.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will help much to the underſtanding and believing of what is heard: if at home you repeat it, conferr of it, and examine the Proofs made uſe of for its Confirmation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:105679:31"/>2. Singing of Pſalms is another Duty to be performed this day in our Families, as well as in the Church. Holy <hi>David,</hi> that ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> recommends it to us, (Pſal. 92.) the Title of that Pſalm, is, <hi>A Pſalm or Song for the Sabbath:</hi> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus; <hi>It is good to give thanks unto the Lord; and to ſing praiſes unto thy name, O thou moſt high!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the manner of performing this Duty, we have the Apoſtle's Direction, in theſe words: <hi>ſinging with grace in your hearts unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be in, or with the heart, that is; our hearts muſt go with our Voices: the one muſt be lift up as well as the other: for God is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhipped in our Hearts and Spirits, as well as with our Bodies.</p>
               <p>Truly ſinging with the Voice, without concurrence of the Heart and Spirit, is no more pleaſing to God, than a ſounding Braſs, and tinkling Cymball.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we muſt ſing in the heart, ſo with Grace in the heart: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> we muſt exerciſe the Graces of God's Spirit, as well as in praying; labouring to expreſs the ſame Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in ſinging a Pſalm, as <hi>David</hi> in the penning of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:105679:32"/>If it be a Pſalm of Prayers and Petitions, then muſt our Affections be fervent: if a Pſalm of Praiſes and Thankſgiving, then muſt our Affections be chearful. Thus muſt the Affections of the Heart be ſuitable to the Quality of the Pſalm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Family-Duty is Prayer; for if this Duty ought to be performed every day, twice at leaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: then more eſpecially on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>day</hi>; a day wholly dedicated to the Worſhip and Service of God.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of reſorting to the Evening Sacrifice.</head>
            <p>WHen it is now almoſt time to repair to the Evening Service, call as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Servants as can be well ſpared, that they may accompany you to the publick Aſſembly: command their Bodies, though you cannot their Souls. And it may not be amiſs (but right edifying) if ſome one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon read a Pſalm ſuitable to the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, of going to worſhip God: ſuch as the 84. <hi>Pſal.</hi> or the 119<hi>th</hi>; one, or two parts of it being taken at a time, as occaſion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105679:32"/>
ſhall ſerve; to which reading all ought reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to attend.</p>
            <p>And this being done, let the ſame Rules and Directions which were given touching going to Church in the Morning, be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Evening: and let all (as before) reſort to the publick worſhip; where your carriage ought to be the ſame, as was before directed.</p>
            <p>Surely unleſs you and your Houſe appear thus the ſecond time before God; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid duly to ſanctify the Lord's Day: but only to do it by halves. And now to move you to this duty:</p>
            <p>Conſider you are bound in juſtice to God to do it. Becauſe God hath ſet a day, not a piece of a day apart for himſelf; and we ſhould be more afraid to ſteal away God's time, than to ſteal away Mans Goods: the one is Theft; but the other Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>God Almighty hath conſecrated to his own Service the ſeventh part of our time; but if you come only in the Morning, you give him but the 14<hi>th</hi> part of it: nay, I fear, too many ſpare him only that time which their Morning attendance takes up, in our publick Aſſembly, on the Lord's Day. Now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to thy own Conſcience, Chriſtian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! Whether it be a meet and fit thing, that rational Perſons, Created by God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105679:33"/>
by Chriſt, ſhould afford to the Worſhip and Service of Chriſt, and the great Concern of their immortal Souls, but two hours at the moſt on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>day</hi>: and that time perhaps ſpent in a formal, cuſtomary, cold, heartleſs Worſhip of the infinitely holy and juſt Deity; the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, impartial Judge, both of Angels and Men. The <hi>Jews</hi> kept a whole day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holy in a grateful Memory of the leſſer benefit of the Creation; and their Deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and ſhall we grudge to ſpend a whole day, in remembrance of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Hell, and Death eternal?</p>
            <p>We have not only greater Motives, but we have greater Means: they had only <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets; but we have Chriſt and the Goſpel: they had the Shadow; we the Subſtance. And ſhall we that have more Means and Helps, put God off with leſs Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſmaller Service, and ſhorter Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Nay, the very Heathens, guided by the Light of Nature, gave whole Days to their Dunghill Deities: and ſhall we Chriſtians refuſe it to a true God? You give your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies two Meals a-day, and will you feed your Souls but once? It was a rational Diſcourſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Miſtreſs, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 39.9.) My Maſter <hi>hath kept nothing from me but thee, becauſe thou art</hi> his <hi>Wife: how then can I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105679:33"/>
do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt</hi> my <hi>God</hi>?</p>
            <p>God hath kept no Days in the Week from us, but only the Firſt Day, becauſe it is his Sabbath: how can we do this great Wickedneſs then, and ſin againſt him? <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s Parable to <hi>David,</hi> may be applied to thee, O thou moſt prophane Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker! Hath God only one Day, which he hath kept to himſelf, and ſanctified to his Service, and laid as it were in his Boſom: and ſhall Men be ſo unworthy, when their Hearts tempt them to Vanity, even to take this day to pleaſe and gratifie their own corrupt hearts in? When they are rich in time, and have ſix days for themſelves; To entrench upon the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day</hi>: it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much. Nay, as it is unreaſonable, ſo is it plainly contradictory to our own Prayers that day: for upon every Lord's Day Morning, as we make it our open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſo likewiſe a publick Prayer, after the reading of the Fourth Commandment: <hi>Lord, have mercy upon me, and incline my heart to keep this Law.</hi> As much as to ſay; Lord, we acknowledge we have neglected thy Day; we pray thee therefore pardon all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Sabbath-breaking for the time paſt, and give us Grace to obſerve the Chriſtian Sabbath better for the future.</p>

In neglecting to worſhip God your ſelves, in your Family. 2. In hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering others from doing that Duty.

Cleanſe, quiet, clothe, comfort, content my ſick, ſinful, weak and wretched Soul.</p>
               <p>O thou Lamb of God, that takeſt away the ſins of the World, take away the world of ſins that is in me. O thou that wert my Saviour upon Earth, be thou my Advocate in Heaven, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and interceding, that none of theſe Evils my ſins have deſerved, may fall upon my head.</p>
               <p>Forget and forgive all the Crimes, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Impurities of my Life paſt, and in

particular, whatſoever through my careleſsneſs have eſcaped my memory, and whatſoever my dreadful Judge may in the rigour of his Juſtice lay to my charge, that at the end of my days I may receive the end of my hopes, the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my precious and immortal Soul.

            <p>Then fail not to add to this, this uſual Prayer for the Evening.</p>
            <p>Before thou goeſt to bed, be ſure to offer unto God thine Evening Sacrifice of Prayer and Thankſgiving. This was ſhadowed out unto us under the Law, where the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his Evening Sacrifice, as well as the Morning: therefore much more doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of us under the Goſpel. And truly if thou lieſt down in thy ſins unrepented of, thou mighteſt haply awaken with Hell-flames about thy Ears. Thou mayſt better and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ſleep with a Serpent in thy Boſom, than with a Sin upon thy Soul; the one can only puniſh thee temporally, the other torments thee aeternally. Before ever then thou ſuffer the Temples of thy head to take any reſt; beg, O Chriſtian Brother, not only Pardon of thy Sins, but his Protection from all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: which you may do in this following Prayer.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:105679:39"/>ALmighty and Everlaſting God, I yield thee moſt humble and hearty thanks, for that thou haſt vouchſafed me of thy great Mercy and Goodneſs, to preſerve me this day from all evil, and I alſo beſeech thee, for thy bitter Death and Paſſion, moſt mercifully to forgive me, a wretched Sinner, all my Offences, which I have this day committed by thought, word, or deed; and hereafter to preſerve and keep me from all danger, as well of Body as of Soul; to the end I may riſe again in Health, to praiſe thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name, and joyfully to ſerve thee with a clean Body, and chaſte Heart.</q>
            <p>Whilſt thou art going to bed, exerciſe thy Mind with theſe holy and heavenly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. As thou art pulling off thy clothes, think how it will not be long before thou be ſtripped of all, and go out of the World, as naked as thou cameſt; as <hi>Job</hi> excellently expreſſeth it, <hi>Naked came I,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And when thou art laid upon thy bed to take thy Repoſe, let it mind thee of thy Grave, thy Sheets of thy Shroud, and thy Sleep of thy Death, which indeed is the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it; and labour to fall aſleep with the ſweet Meditation of it; and to that end, while thou art awake, exerciſe thy Mind with theſe or ſuch like Meditations.</p>
