            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISCOVERY OF THE ARCH-VVHORE AND HER PARAMOVRS (OR LOVERS) OF VVHOM the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD beareth Witneſſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Eſus Chriſt, GOD and Man, having accompliſhed the work of the Redemption of Mankind, hath ſent forth his Meſſengers into all the world to gather unto himſelf a Church or Spouſe out of both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſpatched Meſſengers of God, have accordingly taught men with all care and faithfulneſſe, to renounce all earthly luſts and pleaſures, to crucifie their fleſh, to forſake all men, how wiſe ſoever, even themſelves and every thing elſe, that is not God himſelf, and in pure and ſingle hearted Love, to cleave unto their Head and Bridegroom Jeſus Chriſt, as being betrothed unto him, and to be onely and altogether corrected, ruled, led, and taught in all <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 21. 3.</note> ſubmiſſive humble obedience, by him and by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>But as the Church began already in the Apoſtles dayes, beſides their Bridegroom Chriſt, to honour alſo his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in his ſtead, to cleave unto and follow them, and to call themſelves after their names, although the holy men did highly rebuke them for, and earneſtly diſſwade them from it, leſt they ſhould be led away, like <hi>Eve,</hi> by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note> from the ſimplicitie or plainneſſe of Chriſt; for as much as they ought to be Chriſts onely and no Mans, and that God doth catch the craftie in the World, and confoundeth them with all their wiſdom. So after their Departure is this Adultery broke forth publickly, and the Miniſters themſelves have allured the Spouſe of Chriſt unto themſelves with ſweet and ſtately language and ſhew of their office, and have not addreſſed them directly onely and ſolely to Chriſt their Bridegroome (to wait on his Spirit, for life, power, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> inſtruction and government) but have offered themſelves to provide for the Souls, the Comfort of Eternall Salvation, in the name and ſtead of Chriſt, thereby to win men with ſoothing and magnificent words unto themſelves, according as the Adultery of the Churches and their daughters as well among the Papiſts, and their partie, as among the reſt, even to this very preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but too manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is a known buſineſſe as well in many other places as in Popery, how there hath been deviſed a ſpirituall marriage between the Miniſters and their Pariſh Churches, which hath its beginning in the call and ordination, is conſecrated, conſummated and perfected by his ſaying or ſinging the firſt Maſſe, and by the impoſition of hands; Whence alſo they are not aſhamed openly to give out themſelves for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Fathers, as who like conduits preſume to get ſpirituall children by their Churches, calling them their Pariſh Children, Confeſſion-children.</p>
            <p>And although ſome hundred and two hundred yeers ago God raiſed ſome Miniſters, by whom as by his Inſtruments he cauſed his Word to be ſet forth and publiſhed again, and this Adultery to be made notorious and manifeſt. Yet nevertheleſſe the Churches would not deſiſt from their wonted fornication, but being ſet free once out of that painfull Papiſticall brothel-houſe of deſpair, they run, like the Stagge, even mad in a wild and unbridled Libertiniſme, beginning anew to doat on thoſe Miniſters and their followers; ſought the comfort of ſalvation at their hands in ſtead of Chriſts, and ſetting aſide their own Lord-Head and Bridegroome (who onely and ſolely ought to inhabite, rule and make fruitfull the ſoul) did cleave unto the ſervants and Miniſters, and called themſelves after their names. And thereby they have plunged themſelves into ſuch horrible Babylonicall diviſion and confuſion, that the true knowledge of Chriſt and of his holy and precious life, is utterly extinguiſhed, and the true Chriſtianitie turned and changed into a ſectarian confuſion and moſt heatheniſh converſation, where men go on every one according to the luſts and greedy deſires of his corrupt Adamicall fleſh; for their own glory, luſt, love and goods, ſnatching at, hating, envying, devouring, ſlandering, condemning and perſecuting one another, and yet for all that ſtill conceiting they have as good a ſhare and intereſt in the Merits of Chriſt as any.</p>
            <p>This now is that painted <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> with her glorying and gliftering outſide; that great Babylon, with her ſo many names of Blaſphemies, the Mother of all Whoredom, with whom the kings of the earth do commit fornication; and being made drunk wth her cup of Abomination do ſtorme and rage ſo mightily; and ſhe is carried and ſupported by the ſpotted Beaſt, and the beaſtly world rule here.</p>
            <p>And what are her children, that ſhe brought forth by her Paramours and ſpirituall Husbands, but Lyons, Bears, ravening Fowls, Woolves, Dogs, Foxes, Swine, and the like, who every one and all do what they can to perſecute the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mbe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For having ever reſiſted the Spirit of God, Satan the old Dragon hath thereby ſo rooted and ſtrengthened his kingdom and palace in her and in her children; that he governeth and leadeth them at his own and abſolute pleaſure. Hence it is come to paſſe that the Bond of Love, according to the unity of the Spirit, is broken aſunder among men, and Chriſt notwithſtanding they boaſt and glory ſo much of him among all Sects is ſtill crucified by the <hi>Learned,</hi> in his word according to the ſpirit and power thereof, and by the Mighty ones, in his members.</p>
            <p>And hence alſo have all the modern Warres and troubles their ſourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beginning, which were hatched and broached by nothing ſo much, as by the irritating, prating, urging, ſtreporous and virulent ſqueaking before the Kings and Princes of the Earth, of thoſe three Dragon-Frogs, who ſeek ſtill every one for himſelf to be in better and higher grace and favour with the <hi>Whore</hi> then the others.</p>
            <p>But now it is manifeſt and apparent every where, how the <hi>Horns</hi> of this Beaſt, wherein this Arch-whore drunk in Saints blood ſitteth, I mean the Forces and Armies that are abroad in all parts do begin to perſecute this great confounded Whore, devouring her fleſh and laying her deſolate, as it is put into their hearts, untill the words of God ſhall be fulfilled upon her.</p>
            <p>And God hath broken and cut aſunder the <hi>Bands,</hi> and delivereth men every one into the hand of his neighbour, the one to fall by the ſword of the other, and the thrones of kingdoms to come reeling down to the ground.</p>
            <p>Happy is he that marketh this, and layeth it to heart; that goeth out of Babel, and doth not make himſelf partaker of her ſins, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable whoredoms, leſt ye receive part alſo of her plagues.</p>
            <p>But the time is at hand that the Lambe of God will grow wrath, and lay down his enemies for his footſtool; reſiſting and ſeverely aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch long practiſed Murther, in his Word and Members, and contrarily glorifie upon Mount Sion; the woman that was thruſt forth into the wilderneſſe; the true Church namely, together with her native Members diſperſed and ſcattered as yet, among all parts and ſects, and ſo diſtreſſed by the brood of the Dragon; when as Babel ſhall be made the habitation of ghaſtly fowls. Bleſſed is he that ſo watcheth and walketh as that the ſhame of his nakedneſſe be not diſcovered, but that he may appear in white Robes at the wedding of the Lambe.</p>
            <q>Glory onely to God.</q>
