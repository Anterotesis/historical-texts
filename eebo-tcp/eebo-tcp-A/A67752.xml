            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Of these <hi>Enchiridions,</hi> a <hi>Repenting Prodigal,</hi> (upon occasion of his late return) thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bound, to give ten thousand for others good; and takes it for an incomparable favour, that it came into his heart so to do. Yielding a <hi>threefold reason</hi> thereof. First, because it is probable, that that <hi>Medecine</hi> which hath <hi>cured</hi> one desperate <hi>Patient</hi>; if it be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated may work the same effect upon others: and that those thoughts, which our experience hath found comfortable, and useful to our selves: should (with neglect of all censures) be communicated to others. Secondly, because the retribution of his obedience, may in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, answer his offence; as was that of <hi>Pauls, who as he had done more evil to the Saints, then all the rest of the Apostles: so he laboured more then they all, in adding to the Church such as should be saved,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. Act. 9.16. Thirdly, for that at exemplary offendors, leave their inventions and evil practises to posterity; whereby they <hi>cease not to sin,</hi> though they <hi>cease to live,</hi> (for when dead they are still tempting, and still sin so long as they cause sin; yea how should not every <hi>Turke</hi> that perisheth by <hi>Mahomets</hi> jugling, add to the pile of his unspeakable horrors?) So if <hi>we sow good works,</hi> succession <hi>shall reap them</hi>; and we shall be happy in making others so.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Everend Sir, when (by a providence) you heard me <hi>swear and curse</hi>; you gave me a printed Paper to convince me of that <hi>fowle, audacious, provoking,</hi> and yet <hi>unprofitable sin,</hi> and withall intreated me to read three larger <hi>Tracts, viz. A short and sure way to grace and salvation. The hearts Index,</hi> with <hi>A serious and pathetical description of Heaven and Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This to me (whom you had never before seen) seemed no less <hi>absurd</hi> then <hi>strange</hi>; and having a darke heart, in stead of great love and thanks, I returned you a most churlish and uncivil answer, and accordingly when I met with my <hi>drunken consorts,</hi> I read it with <hi>no less scorn then ignorance</hi>; but before I had done, it made me tremble! nor could I rest, until I had perused <hi>the other three Books,</hi> which have so represented the very thoughts, secrets, and deceitfulness of my heart unto my conscience; that I could not but say of them, as the <hi>woman of Samaria</hi> once spake of <hi>our Saviour; They have told me all things that ever I did,</hi> John 4.29. Which made me conclude <hi>with that Vnbeliever,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.24, 25. That <hi>the hand of God</hi> was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55300:2"/>
in the contriving of them; Nor could they ever have so done, if they were not of God, as the <hi>young man in the Gospel, reasoned with the Pharisees touching Jesus, when he had opened his eyes, that had been blind from his birth,</hi> John 9.32, 33. Which is such a mercy, that no tongue is able to express! for till then, I went on <hi>in the broad way,</hi> and worlds road <hi>to destruction, without any mistrust.</hi> What change they have wrought in me, (with <hi>Gods blessing upon the means</hi>) and how greatly I have longed to see you again, I forbear to mention: Onely this, when I had read them, <hi>in reference to</hi> Levit. 19.17. and in <hi>compassion to their pretious soules,</hi> who are neither <hi>able</hi> not <hi>willing</hi> to help themselves, I have (and not without some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table success) taken up your <hi>trade,</hi> in giving the <hi>Papers</hi> and mentioning the <hi>Books</hi> to all that I hear <hi>blaspheme my Maker,</hi> or <hi>belch out their spleen against goodness</hi>: As well considering, that one soule is of more worth then the Indies.</p>
            <p>And indeed, whose heart would it not make to bleed to see what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes there are that go blindfold to destruction! and no man offer to stop or check them, before they arrive there, from whence there is no redemption, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.8. and 13 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1. to 4. <hi>John.</hi> 8.44.</p>
            <p>And certainly it more then behoves me, (as being myself <hi>snatcht out of the fire,</hi> Jude 23.) to do what I can to draw others of my brethren after me, in imitation of <hi>Andrew,</hi> John 1.41. and Philip v. 45. and <hi>the women of Samaria,</hi> John 4.28. to 41. and <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.32. Acts 2.41. &amp; 4.4. &amp;c. 3. and of <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 32.32. and <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9.3. Neither are we of the <hi>communion of Saints,</hi> if we <hi>desire not the salvation of others.</hi> Yea how could I be thankful to my <hi>Redeemer</hi>? that hath <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> so much for me! or in the least <hi>love God</hi> and <hi>my Neighbour</hi>? if I should not thus resolve; as by my sins and <hi>bad example,</hi> I have <hi>drawn others from God</hi>; so now I will all I can, <hi>draw others</hi> with my self <hi>to God</hi>; yea what a shame were it? If I should not be <hi>as faithful a servant to my Saviour? As</hi> I have formerly been <hi>to Sathan. Saul converted,</hi> will <hi>build up</hi> as fast as ever he <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down,</hi> and <hi>preach as zealously, as ever he persecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely there is <hi>a great rub in the way,</hi> which makes me fear I shall not be able to hold out, for I am so <hi>scoft and scorned</hi> where ever I come, both by <hi>Parents, Friends, and Enemies,</hi> for giving these Papers, that they <hi>make me even weary of my life, as the daughters of Heth did Rebecca,</hi> Gen. 27 46. And yet I dare not leave off, since <hi>our Saviour</hi> faith expressly, <hi>that he will be ashamed of such at the latter day, who are now ashamed for his sake, to bear a few scoffs and reproaches from the World.</hi> Marke 8.38. Nevertheless, I am in <hi>a wonderful strait</hi>! for if I seek to <hi>please God,</hi> and <hi>discharge my conscience, I displease the world,</hi> and that will <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> me; if I seek to <hi>please the world,</hi> I <hi>displease God,</hi> and he will <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> me.</p>
            <p>Now though the case he plain enough, for <hi>better</hi> it is to <hi>have all the world mine enemies, then my Maker, my Redeemer, and my Conscience,</hi> Acts 5.29. Yet it almost beats me off, from being religious, back to the world: And certainly he must be <hi>more spirit then flesh,</hi> that can contentedly make himself contemptible, to follow <hi>Christ,</hi> be pointed at for singularity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55300:2"/>
so many base and vile nicknames, have his <hi>Religion judged hypocrisie, his godly simplicity silliness, his zeal madness,</hi> and the like malicious and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous constructions made, of whatsoever he speaks or does: For my part, I could better abide a <hi>stake,</hi> (<hi>God</hi> assisting me) then the <hi>mocks, scoffs,</hi> and <hi>scornes,</hi> which every where I meet withall: Its death to me to be mockt, as it fared with <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 38.19.</p>
            <p>Now could you <hi>cure</hi> me of <hi>my cowardliness,</hi> as you have of my <hi>cursing and swearing,</hi> I should have cause indeed to bless the time that ever I saw you, and why not? Since <hi>God hath given you the Tongue of the learned, to administer a word in season to them that are weary,</hi> Esay. 50.4.</p>
            <p>Sect. 2. <hi>Minister,</hi> If you would shake off this slavish yoke of bondage and fear, in which <hi>Satan</hi> for the present holds you, and be rid of this <hi>bashful devil.</hi> Search the Scriptures, and they will both <hi>inform your judgement,</hi> and <hi>confirm, comfort,</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi> you against the <hi>worlds hatred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and calumny, though there needs no more then, Ephes. 6.11, 12. James 3.6. 2. Tim. 3.12. Matth. 5.10, 11, 12, and 10.22. and 24.9. Luke 2.34, 35. and 4.29. John 15.20, Gen. 3.15. 1 John 3.13. 1 Pet. 4.12, 13, 14. Luke 14.27. and 6.26. Philip. 1.28, 29. Revel. 2.13. Do but seriously pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those few places, and consider by whom they were spoken, and then certainly you will confess, that if there be any <hi>nectar</hi> in this life, tis in sorrows we endure for righteousness: And methinks, when I hear <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness calumniated,</hi> I bear it the easier, because <hi>the servants of vice</hi> (and none else) do it.</p>
            <p>But the better to help and further you, in this great work, take these ensuing <hi>Notions, Aphorisms, and conclusions,</hi> which perhaps alone, may both <hi>imbolden you, and stop many of their mouths that scoff you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, men scoff and scorn you; and why is it? But because you <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> no less <hi>in goodness,</hi> then <hi>they do in lewdness:</hi> Because you in great love to their <hi>souls,</hi> will be at the cost to give them <hi>Books,</hi> thereby to convince them of their <hi>swearing</hi> and <hi>cursing,</hi> and use the likeliest means, to stop them in their way to destruction, because you would <hi>draw</hi> them <hi>to heaven,</hi> as they do many <hi>to hell.</hi> A grievous fault, if a wise man may have the judging of it! As I pray consider of it you that have brains; Its no fault in them to be <hi>perjured!</hi> but for you to keep your <hi>vow and promise</hi> which you <hi>made in your baptism,</hi> is both a <hi>crime</hi> and <hi>shame.</hi> It hath ever been the worlds great quarrel, we <hi>refuse</hi> to <hi>pledge</hi> them, in their <hi>wicked customes,</hi> and will <hi>rather obey God then men. As wherefore was Cain wroth with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abel, and afterwards flew him? but because his own works were evil, and his brothers good,</hi> 1 John 3.12. <hi>Wherefore was holy David had in derision, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, slandered, contemned, and made a by-word of the people, a song of the drunkards? But because he followed the things that were good and pleasing to God, and in him put his trust,</hi> Psal. 11.2. and 22.6, 7, 8. and 37.14. and 69.10, 11, 12. <hi>Why were all the just in Solomons time, had in abomination, and mockt of the wicked? but because they were upright in their way, and holy in their conversation,</hi> Prov. 29.27. <hi>Or those numberless number of Martyrs,</hi> Rev. 6.9. <hi>even killed; but for the word of God, and for the testimony which they maintained.</hi>

That <hi>great Dragon the Devill,</hi> and <hi>his subjects make war, and are wroth with none but the woman and her seed, which keep the Commandements of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ,</hi> Revel. 12.17. Lot <hi>vexed</hi> himselfe, because he <hi>saw men bad</hi>; these <hi>because</hi> they are <hi>good</hi>: not because <hi>Gods Law is broken, but</hi> because <hi>others keep it better then themselves.</hi> It is the <hi>cursed zeale</hi> of these men, <hi>to maligne the good zeale</hi> of all men.

            <p>Sect. 4. Thirdly, why do these and the <hi>Devill hate you</hi>? but because <hi>God hath chosen you.</hi> Why are you <hi>a thorne in their eyes,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>in the Devils</hi>? but <hi>because you fare better</hi> then they. As why did <hi>Cain</hi> envy and hate <hi>Abel</hi>? but <hi>because the Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had no respect,</hi> Gen. 4.4.5. Wherefore did <hi>Saul</hi> so hate and persecute <hi>David</hi>? but <hi>because he was so praised, and preferred of the people before himselfe; And the Lord was with David, and prospered him in every thing he tooke in hand,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.7, 8.12, 13.28, 29. <hi>Davids successe</hi> was <hi>Sauls vexation:</hi> Yea, he found not so much pleasure in his <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> as vexation in the prosperity of <hi>David</hi>: And so of his brother <hi>Eliabs envy and ill will to him,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.28. And of the <hi>Elder brothers envy (in the parable)</hi> to <hi>his younger brother, when his father so kindly entertained him,</hi> Luk. 15.25, 26, 27, 28. which is meant of the <hi>Jewes envying the Gentiles conversion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Envy</hi> is <hi>sicke,</hi> if her neighbour be <hi>well:</hi> and the <hi>good mans honour,</hi> is the <hi>envious mans torment</hi>? As it fared between <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mordecai:</hi> and as hereafter <hi>the glory of Christ</hi> shall add to such Reprobates confusion, when they are driven to confesse, <hi>This is he whom we once had in derision:</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Sect. 5. Fourthly, are you scoft, &amp; scorn'd for goodness? a great matter; <hi>our Saviour Christ</hi> was far wose dealt withall. Yea, his whole life, even from his <hi>Cradle</hi> to his <hi>Grave,</hi> was nothing else but a continued act of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. He was called of his enemies <hi>Conjurer, Samaritane, wine-bibber,</hi>

               <hi>Sabath-breaker,</hi> &amp;c. was <hi>scoft</hi> at, <hi>scorned,</hi> scourged, <hi>crucified,</hi> and what not. Yea he suffered <hi>in every place, in every part</hi>: In every place, <hi>hunger</hi> in the Desart, <hi>resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> in the Temple, <hi>sorrow</hi> in the Garden, <hi>contumelies</hi> in the Judgement Hall, <hi>crucifying</hi> without the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In every part, <hi>his eyes</hi> ran downe with teares, <hi>his temples</hi> with blood, his <hi>eares tingled</hi> with buffettings, <hi>glowed</hi> with reproaches: They afflicted <hi>his taste</hi> with gall, spit in his <hi>face,</hi> pierc't his <hi>head</hi> with thornes, his <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feete</hi> with nailes, his <hi>side</hi> with a spear, <hi>his heart</hi> was full of sorrow, <hi>his soule</hi> with anguish, his <hi>whole body</hi> was sacrificed as an offering for sinne: And yet he suffered all for us, <hi>to the end he might leave us an example that we should follow his steps.</hi> Neither was it so much <hi>what</hi> he suffered, as <hi>with what affection, willingnesse,</hi> and <hi>patience he suffered</hi>; that did nobilitate the merit of his sufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Disciple is not above his Master,</hi> Matth. 10.24, 25. Shall wee then thinke much to <hi>taste</hi> of <hi>that Cup of which our Saviour dranke so deep. Christ</hi> wore <hi>a Crowne of Thornes for me,</hi> and shall I grudge to weare this <hi>Paper cap for him?</hi> said <hi>John Huss,</hi> when they put a cap upon his head, that had ugly Devils painted on it, with the Title of Heresie. The <hi>Apostle</hi> gives a generall testimony of all the <hi>Saints in the Old Testament,</hi> saying, <hi>some endured the violence of five, some were wrack'd, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were tryed by mockings, and scourgings, bonds and imprisonments, some stoned, some heaven in sunder, some slain with the sword,</hi> and the like, <hi>being such as the world was not worthy of,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Yea, our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> most willingly under-went those <hi>fiery trials,</hi> and shall any of <hi>Christs hand</hi> shrinke under the burthen of an <hi>ayery tryall onely?</hi>

            <p>Neither have any of <hi>Gods Children,</hi> (from the first to the last) been exempt from suffering what you do; namely <hi>tongue-persecution.</hi> And it is an everlasting rule, <hi>He that is borne after the flesh, will persecute him that is borne after the spirit,</hi> Gal. 4, 29. When <hi>CHRIST</hi> was borne, all <hi>Jerusalem was troubled,</hi> and <hi>Herod cut the throats if all the children in Bethlehem,</hi> Matth. 2.3. 10 22.—<hi>All</hi> was <hi>quiet at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus before St.</hi> Paul <hi>came thither:</hi> but <hi>then there arose no small strife about that way,</hi> Acts 19.23. &amp;c. Again,</p>
            <p>Sect. 6. Fifthly, Are you scoft and scorned? how can the <hi>world pleasure or honour you more?</hi> First, <hi>for Honour; Reproach in Gods service is the best preferment</hi>: For as in the <hi>Wars,</hi> to have the <hi>hottest</hi> and <hi>most dangerous service</hi> imposed upon them by their <hi>Generall,</hi> is accounted the greatest honour. Neither will he confer the same upon any, but the <hi>stoutest and most valiant</hi>: So even <hi>

And <hi>our Saviours</hi> words to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> Acts 1.8. Yea, sayes Father <hi>Latimer, to suffer for Christ,</hi> is <hi>the greatest priviledge</hi> that <hi>God</hi> gives in this world. And the story of <hi>Job</hi> is a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case to prove it. Yea, the same <hi>Job</hi> professes, <hi>that if his adversary should write a Booke against him, he would esteem it his crowne,</hi> Job 31.35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p>Whence <hi>Moses esteemed the rebuke of Christ greater rules then all the treasures of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> Heb. 11.26. Whence <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, when they were beaten and imprisoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Councell, rejoycing, that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for Christs Name,</hi> Acts 5.41. They esteemed it <hi>a grace to be disgraced</hi> for him. And so it hath been accounted by the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest</hi> ever since. They that reproach me, saith St. <hi>Austine,</hi> do against their wills increase my <hi>honour,</hi> both <hi>with God and good men.</hi> And another of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> It is the highest degree of reputation to be <hi>euill spoken if for well doing.</hi> It is no small credit <hi>with the vile,</hi> to have <hi>a vile estimation. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> thought much the better of <hi>Christianity, because</hi> Nero <hi>persecuted it. Calvin</hi> made the reproaches, and evill speeches of his enemies a matter of great joy to him.

            <p>Sect. 7. 2ly. <hi>For profit</hi>; Let a good man be scoft and scorned for a fault, lie will be the <hi>better for it</hi> to his dying day. His enemies by <hi>their evill tongues</hi> shall <hi>beget in him a good and holy life.</hi> For happily they shall <hi>bring to his remembrance sins forgotten, weàn him from the love of the world, discover whether he be sincere or no, make him humble, exercise and improve his patience, and all his other graces,</hi> and <hi>augment his glory.</hi> Yea, his <hi>patient suffering shall be rewarded here,</hi> as well as <hi>hereafter,</hi> Deut. 23.5. 2 Sam. 16.12.</p>

               <hi>Blessed are they which suffer for righteousness, for theirs is the kingdome of heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.10. to 14.

By our crosses san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, weight is added to our Crowne of Hisse. Our Enemies, saith</hi> Bernard, <hi>are</hi> but <hi>our Fathers Goldsmiths, working to add pearls to the Crowns of the Saints.</hi> Whence <hi>Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,</hi> Heb. 11.26. And hence it is that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> calls upon us to <hi>rejoyce, and be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, when men shall revile, and persecute, and say all manner of evill against us falsely for Christs sake:</hi> and tels us, <hi>we are blessed and happy, for that the spirit of glory, and of God does so much the more rest upon us, which on their parts is evill spoken of, but on our part is glorified,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.12, 13, 14. Mat. 5.11, 12. Phil. 1.28, 29. Rev. 2.13. And this hath made thousands to embrace the very flames, when they might easily have been freed, by exchanging <hi>eternall happiness, for temporary and transitory.</hi>

            <p>Sect. 8. Now if in conclusion, the <hi>most malicious practices of our worst and greatest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi> (by the <hi>blessing of God,</hi> and <hi>our well husbanding of them</hi>) prove no other in effect to us then did the <hi>malice of</hi> Josephs <hi>brethren, Mistris, and Lord</hi> to him, then the <hi>malice of</hi> Haman <hi>to</hi> Mordecai <hi>and the Jewes:</hi> Then <hi>Balacks malice to the Children of Israel</hi>: Then the <hi>Devils spight to</hi> Job: Then <hi>the malice of</hi> Achitophel &amp; Shimei <hi>to</hi> David: Or then the <hi>Arians malice to Paphnutius</hi>; all which made for their inestimable <hi>good, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> and <hi>advantage.</hi> Then grutch not at it, neither <hi>mutter at the matter,</hi> but receive what ever comes, with <hi>humility, patience, piety</hi> and <hi>thankefulness.</hi> Yea, if none but <hi>evill men</hi> do it, and that <hi>because you do better, or fare better then they</hi>; and that what you suffer, is nothing to what <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; the best of <hi>Saints</hi> have exceeded you in: Let it make you <hi>no less joyfull then thankefull</hi>: Yea, let it cause you to cry out, <hi>O the wonderfull and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign goodness of our God! that turns even our poysons into cordials.</hi> And henceforth, <hi>thinke it no shame, but count it your glory.</hi> Be not <hi>grieved,</hi> when you have so much cause to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi>; for it shews <hi>you to be borne of God, your enemies to be the seed of the Serpent. The worlds hating you, shewes that Christ loves you, and hath chosen you out of the world.</hi> Yea, this <hi>is to your Adversaries a sure token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</hi>

            <p>Yea, do nor only <hi>beare with them, but pitty and pray for them,</hi> for they need no helpe to be miserable: As <hi>who sell them on worke,</hi> but <hi>he that will pay them with damnation</hi> (though <hi>God</hi> offers them better wages) <hi>Nor is it so much they, as the Devill in, and by them.</hi> It is <hi>his minde</hi> in <hi>their mouth, his heart in their lips, his Arrow shot by mans Bow; He lendeth them his lyes and malice, and borroweth their tongues to utter them,</hi> because the <hi>Devill wants a tongue,</hi>

True, <hi>they have sworn themselves Christs faithfull servants and souldiers</hi>: but they will <hi>fight only for sin and Satan.</hi> And least <hi>their owne sins</hi> should <hi>not damn them deep enough; they do, what in them lyes, draw others to damnation</hi>: For it is not enough for them to be <hi>bad themselves, except they raile at, and persecute the good,</hi> and that <hi>against their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi> As for example, <hi>Pilate judged Christ guiltlesse, yet he put him to death</hi>; and <hi>Festus acknowledged</hi> Paul <hi>without crime, yet he left him in prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely they have <hi>some wit in their anger</hi>: For <hi>how should</hi> Naboth <hi>be clenly put to death, if he be not first accused of blasphemy?</hi> 1 Kings 21.13. And the like of <hi>Joseph, Elias, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Paul, Stephen,</hi> and <hi>our Saviour Christ</hi> himself. Indeed these want that power that their fellow persecutors have had: and therefore can onely shew their <hi>teeth,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise their <hi>hearts</hi> are as <hi>bloody, and as full of the Serpents enmity as</hi> Doegs <hi>was.</hi> In the mean time we are safe enough, since their words are but like <hi>a boyes squib,</hi> that <hi>slashes,</hi> and <hi>cracks,</hi> and <hi>stincks, but is nothing.</hi> And how little is that man hurt, whom <hi>malice condemns on earth, and God commends in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely I wish they would take notice, that he is <hi>bottomlesly ill,</hi> who is so farre from being good himselfe, that he hates goodness in others. They are <hi>desperately wicked,</hi> that cannot so much as indure the sight of godlinesse; that are <hi>displeased with others,</hi> because <hi>they please God,</hi> and <hi>murmur</hi> like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> at the same things whereat <hi>the Angels rejoyce.</hi> Such an one is <hi>upon the very threshold of Hell,</hi> and none but a <hi>Cain, or a Devill in condition will do so.</hi> Nor could they do it, if the <hi>Devill</hi> were not <hi>in their hearts.</hi>

            <p>Sect. 9. <hi>Object.</hi> But their usual objection is, why will you be so singular? are you wiser then all? this is but want of discretion.</p>

It was <hi>Noah's happinesse,</hi> that he followed not <hi>the Old worlds fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; It was <hi>Lots happinesse,</hi> that he was <hi>singular in Sodome.</hi> It was good for <hi>Nichodemus</hi> that he was <hi>singular among the Rulers.</hi> Yea, it was happy for <hi>Ruben,</hi> that he was <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to all his brethren.

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. And now for conclusion; Let all <hi>Scoffers take notice,</hi> that <hi>as they scoffe at us, so God laughes at them in</hi> Psal. 2.4. Yea, <hi>judgements are prepared for</hi> these <hi>scorners, and stripes for the backs of these fools,</hi> Pro. 19.29. <hi>God shall rain down fire &amp; brimstone</hi> upon such scorners of his word, and blasphemers of his people as thou art, said Mr. <hi>Philpos the Martyr, to mocking Morgan,</hi> and the rest of <hi>his persecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary, let not the taunts of an <hi>Ishmael</hi> make any <hi>Isaac</hi> out of love with his <hi>Inheritance. A wise man</hi> will not be <hi>scoft out of his money,</hi> nor a <hi>iust man be stouted out of his Faith.</hi> Yea, for a man to be scoft out of his goodnesse, by those that are lewd, is all one, as if <hi>a man that seeth, should blinde-fold</hi> himself, or <hi>put out his eyes,</hi> because some blinde wretches, revile and scoffe at him for seeing. Or as if one that is <hi>found of limbs,</hi> should <hi>lump or maym himselfe</hi> to please the <hi>Criple,</hi> and avoid his taunts. Wherefore proceed good Sir, without ever growing faint: Let others serve <hi>the God of this world,</hi> resolve you to <hi>serve the God of heaven.</hi>
