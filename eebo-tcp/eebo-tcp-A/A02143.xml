         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong al the Passions wherewith humane
mindes are perplexed, there is none that so
galleth with restlesse despight, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
soare of Iealousie: for all other griefes
are eyther to bee appeased with sensible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
to be cured with wholesome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
to be relieued in want, or by tract of tune
to be worne out, (Iealousie only excepted) which is so sawsed with
suspitious doubtes, and pinching mistrust, that whoso seekes by
friendly counsaile to rase out this hellish passion, it foorthwith sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
that he geueth this aduise to couer his owne guiltinesse.
Yea, who so is payned with this restlesse torment doubteth all,
dystrusteth him-selfe, is alwayes frosen with feare, and fired with
suspition, hauing that wherein consisteth all his ioy, to be the br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his miserie. Yea, it is such a heauy enemy to that holy estate
of matrimony, sowing betweene the married couples such deadly
seedes of secret hatred, as Loue being once rased out by spightful
distrust, there oft ensueth bloudy reuenge, as this ensuing Hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
manifestly prooueth: wherein <hi>Pandosto</hi> (furiously incensed
by causelesse Iealousie) procured the death of his most loving and
loyall wife, and his owne endlesse sorrow and misery.</p>
            <p>IN the Countrey of <hi>Bohemia</hi> there raygned a King called
<hi>Pandosto,</hi> whose fortunate successe in warres against his foes,
and bountifull curtesie towardes his friendes in peace, made him
to be greatly feared and loued of all men. This <hi>Pandosto</hi> had to
Wife a Ladie called <hi>Bellaria,</hi> by birth royall, learned by educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
faire by nature, by vertues famous, so that it was hard to
iudge whether her beautie, fortune, or vertue, wanne the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:9036:4"/>
commendations. These two lincked together in perfect loue, led
their liues with such fortunate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, that their Subiects great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reioyced to sée their quiet disposition. They had not beene mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
long, but Fortune (willing to increase their happines) lent
them a sonne, so adorned with the gifts of nature, as the perfection
of the Childe greatly augmented the loue of the parentes, and
the ioy of their commons: in so much that the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> to shew
their inward ioyes by outwarde actions, made Bonefires and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
throughout all the Kingdome, appointing Iustes and
Turneyes for the honour of their young Prince: whether resorted
not only his Nobles, but also diuers Kings and Princes which
were his neighbours, willing to shewe their friendship they ought
to <hi>Pandosto,</hi> and to win fame and glory by their prowesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
<hi>Pandosto,</hi> whose minde was fraught with princely liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
entertayned the Kings, Princes, and noble men with such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
curtesie, and magnifical bounty, that they all sawe how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
he was to gratifie their good wils, making a generall feast
for his Subiects, which continued by the space of twentie dayes:
all which time the Iustes and Turneys were kept to the great
content both of the Lordes &amp; Ladies there present. This solemne
tryumph being once ended, the assembly taking their leaue of
<hi>Pandosto</hi> and <hi>Bellaria</hi>: the young sonne (who was called <hi>Garin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
was nursed vp in the house, to the great ioy and content of the
parents. Fortune enuious of such happy successe, willing to
shewe some signe of her inconstantie, turned her wheele, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their bright sun of prosperitie, with the mistie cloudes of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap
and misery. For it so happened that <hi>Egistus</hi> King of <hi>Sycilia,</hi>
who in his youth had bene brought vp with <hi>Pandosto,</hi> desirous to
shewe that neither tracte of time, nor distance of place could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
their former friendship, prouided a nauie of ships, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into <hi>Bohemia</hi> to visite his old friend and companion, who
hearing of his arriuall, went himselfe in person, and his wife <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laria,</hi>
accompanied with a great traine of Lords and Ladies, to
meete <hi>Egistus</hi>: and espying him, alighted from his horse, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
him very louingly, protesting that nothing in the world
could haue happened more acceptable to him then his comming,
wishing his wife to welcome his olde friend and acquaintance:
who (to shewe how she liked him whom her husband loued) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
<pb facs="tcp:9036:4"/>
him with such familiar curtesie, as <hi>Egistus</hi> perceiued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bée verie well welcome. After they had thus saluted and
embraced eche other, they mounted againe on horsbacke, and rode
toward the Citie, deuising and recounting, howe being children
they had passed their youth in friendely pastimes: where, by the
meanes of the Citizens, <hi>Egistus</hi> was receyued with triumphs and
showes in such sort, that he maruelled how on so small a warning
they coulde make such preparation. Passing the streetes thus with
such rare sightes, they rode on to the Pallace, where <hi>Pandosto</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
<hi>Egistus</hi> and his <hi>Sycilians</hi> with such banqueting and
sumptuous cheare, so royally, as they all had cause to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his
princely liberality, yea, the verie basest slaue that was knowne to
come from <hi>Sycilia</hi> was vsed with such curtesie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Egistus</hi> might
easily perceiue how both hee and his were honored for his friendes
sake. <hi>Bellaria</hi> (who in her time was the flower of curtesie, willing
to shew how vnfaynedly shee looued her husband by his friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
vsed him likewise so familiarly, that her countenance
bewraied how her minde was affected towardes him: oftentimes
comming her selfe into his bed chamber, to sée that nothing should
be amis to mislike him. This honest familiarity increased dayly
more and more betwixt them: for <hi>Bellaria</hi> noting in <hi>Egistus</hi> a
princely and bountifull minde, adorned with sundrie and excellent
qualities, and <hi>Egistus</hi> finding in her a vertuous and curteous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
there grew such a secret vniting of their affections, that
the one could not well be without the company of the other: in so
much that when <hi>Pandosto</hi> was busied with such vrgent affaires,
that hee could not bee present with his friend <hi>Egistus, Bellaria</hi>
would walke with him into the Garden, where they two in priuat
and pleasant deuises would passe away the time to both their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.
This custome still continuing betwixt them, a certaine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
passion entring the minde of <hi>Pandosto,</hi> draue him into
sundry and doubtfull thoughts. First, he called to minde the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his wife <hi>Bellaria,</hi> the comelines and brauerie of his friend
<hi>Egistus,</hi> thinking that Loue was aboue all Lawes, and therefore
to be staied with no Law: that it was hard to put fire and flaxe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
without burning: that their open pleasures might breede
his secrete displeasures. He considered with himselfe that <hi>Egistus</hi>
was a man, and must needes loue: that his wife was a woman,
<pb facs="tcp:9036:5"/>
and therfore subiect vnto loue, and that where fancy forced, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
was of no force. These and such like doubtfull thoughtes a
long time smoothering in his stomacke, beganne at last to kindle in
his minde a secret mistrust, which increased by suspition, grewe at
last to a flaming Iealousie, that so tormented him as he could take
no rest. He then began to measure all their actions, and to miscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue
of their too priuate familiaritie, iudging that it was not for
honest affection, but for disordinate fancy, so that hee began to
watch them more narrowely, to sée if hée could gette any true or
certaine proofe to confirme his doubtfull suspition. While thus he
noted their lookes and gestures, and suspected their thoughtes and
meaninges, they two séely soules who doubted nothing of this his
treacherous intent, freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted daily eache others companie, which
draue him into such a franticke passion, that he beganne to beare a
secret hate to <hi>Egistus,</hi> and a lowring countenaunce to <hi>Bellaria,</hi>
who marueiling at such vnaccustomed frowns, began to cast bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Moone, and to enter into a thousand sundrie thoughtes,
which way she should offend her husband: but finding in her selfe a
cleare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, ceassed to muse, vntil such time as she might find
fit opportunitie to demaund the cause of his dumps. In the meane
time <hi>Pandostoes</hi> minde was so farre charged with Iealousy, that
he did no longer doubt, but was assu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Friend <hi>Egistus</hi> had entered a wrong pointe in his tables, and so
had played him false play: whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desirous to reuenge so great
an iniury, he thought best to dissemble the grudge with a faire and
friendly countenance: and so vnder the shape of a friend, to shew
him the tricke of a foe. Deuising with himself a long time how he
might best put away <hi>Egistus</hi> without suspition of treacherous
murder, hee concluded at last to poyson him: which opinion plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his humour, he became resolute in his determination, and the
better to bring the matter to passe he called vnto him his cupbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
with whom in secret he brake the matter: promising to him for
the performance thereof, to geue him a thowsande crownes of
yearely reuenues: his cupbearer eyther being of a good conscience,
or willing for fashion sake, to deny such a bloudy request, began
with great reasons to perswade <hi>Pandosto</hi> from his determinate
mischief: shewing him what an offence murther was to the Gods:

carried into the midst of the sea, and there left to the wind &amp; waue
as the destinies please to appoint. The very shipmen seeing the
sweete countenance of the yong babe, began to accuse the King of
rigor, and to pity the childs hard fortune: but feare constrayned
them to that which their nature did abhorre: so that they placed it
in one of the ends of the boat, and with a few greene bows made a
homely cabben to shroud it as they could from wind and weather:
hauing thus trimmed the boat they tied it to a ship, and so haled it
into the mayne Sea, and then cut in sunder the coarde, which they
had no sooner done, but there arose a mighty tempest, which tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the little Boate so vehemently in the waues, that the shipmen
thought it coulde not continue longe without sincking, yea the
storme grewe so great, that with much labour and perill they got
to the shoare. But leauing the Childe to her fortunes. Againe to
<hi>Pandosto,</hi> who not yet glutted with sufficient reuenge, deuised
which way he should best increase his Wiues calamitie. But first
assembling his Nobles and Counsellors, hee called her for the
more reproch into open Court, where it was obiected against her,
that she had committed adulterie with <hi>Egistus,</hi> and conspired with
<hi>Franion</hi> to poyson <hi>Pondosto</hi> her husband, but their pretence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partely spyed, shee counselled them to flie away by night for
their better safety. <hi>Bellaria,</hi> who standing like a prisoner at the
Barre, feeling in her selfe a cleare Conscience to withstand her
false accusers: seeing that no lesse then death could pacifie her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
wrath, waxed bolde, and desired that she might haue Lawe
and Iustice, for mercy shee neyther craued nor hoped for, and that
those periured wretches, which had falsly accused her to the King,
might be brought before her face, to giue in euidence. But <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosto,</hi>
whose rage and Iealousie was such, as no reason, nor equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
could appease: tolde her, that for her accusers they were of such
credite, as their wordes were sufficient witnesse, and that the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
&amp; secret flight of <hi>Egistus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Franion</hi> confirmed that which
they had confessed: and as for her, it was her parte to deny such a
monstrus crime, and to be impudent in forswearing the fact, since
shee had past all shame in committing the fault: but her stale
countenaunce should stand for no coyne, for as the Bastard which

cleared before all, sith she had bene accused openly. This pleased
the King so, that he appointed the day, and assembled al his Lords
and Commons, and caused the Quéene to be brought in before the

was the ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>yng of his Shéepe. Wherefore looking more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowely,
as he cast his eye to the Sea, he spyed a little boate, from
whence as he attentiuely listened, he might heare the cry to come:
standing a good while in a maze, at last he went to the shoare, and
wading to the boate, as he looked in, he saw the little babe lying al
alone, many to die for hunger and colde, wrapped in a Mantle of
Scarlet, richely imbrodered with Golde, and hauing a chayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the necke. The Shéepeheard, who before had neuer séene so
faire a Babe, not so riche Iewels, thought assuredly, that it was
some little God, and began with great deuocion to knock on his
breast. The Babe, who wrythed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, to seeke for the pay,
began againe to cry afresh, whereby the poore man knew that it
<pb facs="tcp:9036:11"/>
was a Childe, which by some sinister meanes was driuen thither
by distresse of weather: maruailing how such a seely infant, which
by the Mantle, and the Chayne, could not be but borne of Noble
Parentage, should be so hardly crossed with deadly mishap. The
poore sheepheard perplexed thus with diuers thoughts, tooke pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the childe, and determined with himselfe to carry it to the
King, that there it might be brought vp, according to the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of birth: for his ability coulde not afforde to foster it, though
his good minde was willing to further it. Taking therefore the
Chylde in his armes, as he foulded the mantle together, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to defend if from colde, there fell downe at his foote a very faire
and riche purse, wherein he founde a great summe of golde: which
sight so reuiued the shepheards spirits, as he was greatly rauished
with ioy, and daunted with feare: Ioyfull to see such a summe in
his power, and fearefull if it should be knowne, that it might bréede
his further daunger. Necessitie wisht him at the least, to retaine
the Golde, though he would not kéepe the childe: the simplicity
if his conscience feared him from such deceiptfull briberie. Thus
was the poore manne perplexed with a doubtfull <hi>Dilemma,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
at last the couetousnesse of the coyne ouercame him: for what
will not the gréedy desire of Golde cause a man to doe? So that
he was resolued in himselfe to foster the child, and with the summe
to relieue his want: resting thus resolute in this point, he left sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his shéepe, and as couertly, and secretly as he coulde, went
by a by-way to his house, least any of his neighbours should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
his carriage: assoone as he was got home, entring in at the
doore, the childe began to crie, which his wife hearing, and séeing
her husband with a yong babe in his armes, began to bée some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ielousse, yet marueiling that her husband should be so wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
abroad, sith he was so quiet at home: but as women are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
giuen to beléeue the worste, so his wife thinking it was some
bastard: beganne to crow against her goodman, and taking vp a
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>gel (for the most maister went bréethles) sware solenmly that
shee would make clubs trumps, if hee brought any bastard brat
within her dores. The goodman seeing his wife in her maiestie
with her mate in her hand, thought it was time to bowe for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eare
of blowes, &amp; desired her to be quiet, for there was non such matter:
but if she could holde her peace, they were made for euen and with
<pb facs="tcp:9036:11"/>
that he told her the whole matter, how he had found the childe
in a little boat, without any succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>r, wrapped in that costly
mantle, and hauing that rich chain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> about the neck: but at last
when he shewed her the purse full of gold, she began to simper
something swéetely, and taking her husband about the neck,
kissed him after her homely fashion: saying that she hoped God
had séene their want, and now ment to reliéeue their pouerty,
and séeing they could get no children, had sent them this little
babe to be their heire. Take héede in any case (quoth the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd)
that you be secret, and blabbe it not out when you méete
with your gossippes, for if you doe, we are like not only to
loose the Golde and Iewels, but our other goodes and liues.
Tush (quoth his wife) profit is a good hatch before the doore:
feare not, I haue other things to talke of then of this: but I
pray you let vs lay vp the money surely, and the Iewels, least
by any mishap it be spied. After that they had set all things in
order, the shepheard went to his shéepe with a merry note, and
the good wife learned to sing lull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>by at home with her yong
babe, wrapping it in a homely blanket in sted of a rich mantle:
nourishing in so clenly and carefully as it began to bee a iolly
girle, in so much that they began both of them to be very fond
of it, séeing, as it waxed in age, so it increased in beauty. The
shepheard euery night at his comming home, would sing and
daunce it on his knée, and prattle, that in a short time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to speake and call him Dad, and her Mam: at last when
it grew to ripe yeeres, that it was about seuen yeares olde,
the shepheard lest keeping of other mens sheepe, and with the
money he found in the purse, he bought him the lease of a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
farme, and got a smal flocke of shéepe, which when <hi>Fawnia</hi>
(for so they named the child) came to the age of ten yeres, hee
set her to keepe, and shee with such diligence performed her
charge as the sheepe prospered marueilously vnder her hand.

in the meane time to breake with his sonne: finding
therfore on a day fit oportunity he spake to him in these father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tearmes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOrastus,</hi> thy youth warneth me to preuent the worst, and
mine age to prouide the best. Oportunities neglected, are
signes of folly: actions measured by time, are seldome bitten
with repentance: thou art young, and I olde: age hath taught
me that, which thy youth cannot yet conceiue.</p>
            <p>I therefore will counsell thee as a father, hoping thou wilt
obey as a childe. Thou séest my white hayres are blossomes
for the graue, and thy freshe colour fruite for time and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
so that it behooueth me to thinke how to dye, and for thée
to care how to liue. My crowne I must leaue by death, and
thou enioy my Kingdome by succession, wherein I hope thy
vertue and prowesse shall bee such, as though my subiectes
want my person, yet they shall see in thee my perfection. That
nothing either may faile to satisfie thy minde, or increase thy
dignities: the onely care I haue, is to see thee well marryed
before I die, and thou become olde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorastus</hi> who from his infancy, delighted rather to die
with <hi>Mars</hi> in the Fielde, then to dally with <hi>Venus</hi> in the
Chamber: fearing to displease his father, and yet not willing
to be wed, made him this reuerent answere.</p>
            <p>SIr, there is no greater bond then duetie, nor no straiter law
then nature: disobedience in youth is often galled with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
in age. The commaund of the father ought to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
to the childe: so parentes willes are laws, so they passe
not all lawes: may it please your Grace therefore to appoint

            <p>But <hi>Dorastus</hi> was more impatient in his passions: for
loue so fiercely assayled him, that neither companie, nor mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
could mittigate his martirdome, but did rather far

counsaile in this case, nor feare of his Fathers displeasure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyle
it to any secrete friend: but hee was saine to make a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie
of himselfe, and to participate his thoughtes with his

at last stealing secretely from the court without either
men or Page, hée went to sée if hée coulde espie <hi>Fawnia</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
abroade in the field: but as one hauing a great deale more
skill to retriue the partridge with his spaniels, then to hunt
after such a straunge pray, he sought, but was little the better:
which crosse lucke draue him into a great choler, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
both to accuse loue and fortune. But as he was readie to
retire, he sawe <hi>Fawnia</hi> sitting all alone vnder the side of a hill,
making a garland of such homely flowres as the fields did
afoord. This sight so reuiued his spirites that he drewe nigh,
with more iudgement to take a view of her singular perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which hée found to bée such, as in that countrey attyre shée
stained al the courtlie Dames of <hi>Sicilia.</hi> While thus he stoode
gazing with pearcing lookes on her surpassing beautie,
<hi>Fawnia</hi> cast her eye aside, and spyed <hi>Dorastus,</hi> with sudden
fight made the poore girle to blush, and to die her christal chéeks
with a vermilion red: which gaue her such a grace, as she sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
farre more beautiful. And with that she rose vp, saluting
the Prince with such modest curtesies, as he wondred how a
country maid could afoord such courtly behauiour. <hi>Dorastus,</hi>
repaying her curtesie with a smiling countenance, began to
parlie with her on this manner.</p>

            <p>SIr, what richer state then content, or what swéeter life then

            <p>THis wittie answer of <hi>Fawnia</hi> so inflamed <hi>Dorastus</hi> fancy,

to stode out the mistres of his affection: but as he went

began to smile at his owne folly, and to reproue his fondnesse,
in these tearmes.</p>
            <p>WEll said <hi>Dorastus,</hi> thou kéepest a right <hi>decorum,</hi> base
desires and homely attires: thy thoughtes are fit for
none but a shepheard, and thy apparell such as only become a

destinies? Or thy crooked desires, that appointeth thée this
penance? Ah <hi>Dorastus</hi> thou canst but loue, and vnlesse thou loue,
thou art like to perish for loue. Yet fond foole, choose flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

earthly thoughtes: <hi>Neptune</hi> became a Ram, <hi>Iupiter</hi> a
Bul, <hi>Apollo</hi> a shepheard: they Gods, and yet in loue: and thou
a man appointed to loue.</p>
            <p>Deuising thus with himselfe, hée drew nigh to the place
where <hi>Fawnia</hi> was kéeping her shepe, who casting her eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and seeing such a manerly shepheard, perfectly limmed,
and comming with so good a pace, she began halfe to forget

shee might both loue and obtaine: but as shee was in these

wherfore she rose vp, and reuerently saluted him. <hi>Dora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
taking her by the hand, repaied her curtesie with a sweete

the batterie.</p>
            <p>IF thou maruell <hi>Fawnia</hi> at my strange attyre, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
more muse at my vnaccustomed thoughtes: the one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceth
but my outward shape, the other disturbeth my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sences. I loue <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and therefore what loue liketh
I cannot mislike. <hi>Fawnia</hi> thou hast promised to loue, and I
<pb facs="tcp:9036:18"/>
hope thou wilt performe no lesse: I haue fulfilled thy request,
and now thou canst but graunt my desire. Thou wert con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to loue <hi>Dorastus</hi> when he ceast to be a Prince; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a shepheard, and see I haue made the change, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to misse of my choice.</p>
            <p>TRueth, quoth <hi>Fawnia,</hi> but all that weare Cooles are not
Monkes: painted Eagles are pictures, not Eagles,
<hi>Zeusis</hi> Grapes were like Grapes, yet shadowes: rich cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
make not princes: nor homely attyre beggers: shepheards
are not called shepheardes, because they were hookes and
bagges: but that they are borne poore, and liue to keepe sheepe,
so this attire hath not made <hi>Dorastus</hi> a shepherd, but to steme
like a shephherd.</p>
            <p>WEll <hi>Fawnia,</hi> answered <hi>Dorastus</hi>: were I a shepherd,
I could not but like thee, and being a prince I am forst
to loue thee. Take heed <hi>Fawnia,</hi> be not proud of beauties
painting, for it is a flower that fadeth in the blossome. Those
which disdayne in youth are despised in age: Beauties sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
are trickt vp with times colours, which being set to
drie in the sunne are stained with the sunne, scarce pleasing the
sight ere they beginne not to be worth the sight, not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the herbe <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> which flourisheth in the morning
and is withered before the sunne setting: if my desire were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
lawe, thou mightest iustly deny me by reason, but I
loue thee <hi>Fawnia,</hi> not to misuse thee as a Concubine, but to
vse thee as my wife: I can promise no more, and meane to
performe no lesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fawnia</hi> hearing this solemne protestation of <hi>Dorastus,</hi>
could no longer withstand the assault, but yeelded vp the forte
in these friendly tearmes.</p>
            <p>AH <hi>Dorastus,</hi> I shame to expresse that thou forcest me with
thy sugred speeche to confesse: my base birth causeth the
one, and thy high dignities the other. Beggars thoughts

I am a shepherd, but the Gods know I haue honored
<hi>Dorastus</hi> (pardon if I say amisse) yea and loued <hi>Dorastus</hi>
with such dutiful affection as <hi>Fawnia</hi> can performe, or <hi>Dora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>

resting <hi>Dorastus</hi> handmaid ready to obey his wil, if no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
at all to his honour, nor to my credit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOrastus</hi> hearing this freendly conclusion of <hi>Fawnia</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
her in his armes, swearing that neither distance,
time, nor aduerse fortune should diminish his affection: but
that in despight of the destinies he would remaine loyall vnto
death. Hauing thus plight their troath each to other, seeing
they could not haue the full fruition of their loue in <hi>Sycilia</hi>
for that <hi>Egistus</hi> consent woulde neuer bee graunted to so
meane a match, <hi>Dorastus</hi> determined assone as time and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
would giue them leaue, to prouide a great masse of
money, and many rich &amp; costly iewels, for the easier cariage,
and then to transporte them selues and their treasure into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where they should leade a contented life, vntil, such time as
either he could be reconciled to his Father, or els by sucession
come to the Kingdome. This deuise was greatly praysed of
<hi>Fawnia,</hi> for she feared if the King his father should but heare of
the contract, that his furie would be such as no lesse then death
would stand for payment: she therefore tould him, that delay
bred daunger: that many mishaps did fall out betweene the
cup and the lip, and that to auoid danger, it were best with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
speed as might be, to passe out of <hi>Sycilia,</hi> least fortune
might preuent their pretence with some newe despight: <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastus,</hi>
whom loue pricked forward with desire, promised to
dispatch his affaires with as great hast, as either time or opor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tunitie
would geue him leaue: an so resting vpon this point,
after many imbracings and sweete kisses they departed. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastus</hi>
hauing taken his leaue of his best beloued <hi>Fawnia,</hi>
went to the Groue where hee had his rich apparel, and there
vncasting himself as secretly as might be, hiding vp his shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
attire, till occasion should serue againe to vse it: hee
went to the pallace, shewing by his merrie countenaunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the state of his body was amended, or the case of his minde
<pb facs="tcp:9036:19"/>
greatly redressed: <hi>Fawnia</hi> poore soule was no lesse ioyful, that
being a shepheard, fortune had fauoured her so, as to reward
her with the loue of a Prince, hoping in time to be aduaunced
from the daughter of a poore farmer, to be the wife of a riche
King: so that she thought euery houre a yeere, till by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
they might preuent danger, not ceasing still to goe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
daye to her sheepe, not so much for the care of her flock,
as for the desire she had to see her loue and Lord <hi>Dorastus</hi>: who
oftentimes, when oportunitie would serue, repaired thither to
féede his fancy with the sweet content of <hi>Fawnias,</hi> presence:
and although he neuer went to visit her, but in his shepheards
ragges, yet his ofte repaire made him not onely suspected, but
knowne to diuers of their neighbours: who for the good will
they bare to old <hi>Porrus,</hi> tould him secretly of the matter, wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to keepe his daughter at home, least she went so oft
to the field that shee brought him home a yong sonne: for they
feared that <hi>Fawnia</hi> being so beautifull, the yong Prince
would allure her to folly. <hi>Porrus</hi> was striken into a dump at
these newes, so that thanking his neighboures for their good
will: hee hyed him home to his wife, and calling her aside,
wringing his handes, and shedding foorth teares, he brake the
matter to her in these tearmes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am afraid wife, that my daughter <hi>Fawnia</hi> hath made her
selfe so fine, that she will buy repentance too deare. I heare
newes, which if they be true, some will wish they had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

if it be so, I will not geue her a halfepenp for her honestiect

speakest like a foole, if the King should knowe that <hi>Dorastus</hi>
had begotten our daughter with childe (as I feare it will fall
out little better) the Kings furie would be such as no doubt we
should both loose our goodes and liues: necessitie therefore
hath no lawe, and I will preuent this mischiefe with a newe
deuise that is come in my head, which shall neither offend the
King, nor displease <hi>Dorastus.</hi> I meane to take the chaine and
the iewels that I found with <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and carrie them to the
King, letting him then to vnderstand how she is none of my
daughter, but that I found her beaten vp with the water alone
in a little boate wrapped in a riche Mantle, wherein was inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this treasure. By this meanes I hope the King will take
<hi>Fawnia</hi> into his seruice, and we whatsoeuer chaunceth shal be
blamelesse. This deuice pleased the good wife very well, so
that they determined assoone as they might know the King
at leisure, to make him priuie to this case. In the meane time
<hi>Dorastus</hi> was not slacke in his affaires, but applyed his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with such diligence, that he prouided all thinges fitte for
their iourney. Treasure and Iewels he had gotten great store,
thincking there was no better friend then money in a strange
countrey: rich attire he had prouided for <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and because
he could not bring the matter to passe with out the helpe and
aduise of some one, he made an old seruant of his called <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi>
who had serued him from his childhood, priuie to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires:
who seeing no perswasions could preuaile to diuert him
from his setled determination, gaue his consent and dealt so
secretly in the cause, that within short space hee had gotten a
ship ready for their passage: the Mariners seeing a fit gale of
winde for their purpose, wished <hi>Capnio</hi> to make no delayes,
<pb facs="tcp:9036:21"/>
least if they pretermitted this good weather, they might stay
long ere they had such a fayre winde. <hi>Capnio</hi> fearing that his
negligence should hinder the iourney, in the night time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
the trunckes full of treasure into the shippe, and by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crette
meanes let <hi>Fawnia</hi> vnderstand, that the next morning
they meant to depart: she vpon this newes slept verie little
that night, but gotte vp very early, and wente to her sheepe,
looking euery minute when she should see <hi>Dorastus,</hi> who cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not long, for feare delay might breede daunger, but came as
fast as he could gallop, and without any great circumstance
tooke <hi>Fawnia</hi> vp behinde him and rode to the hauen, where
the shippe lay, which was not three quarters of a mile distant
from that place. He no sooner came there, but the Marriners
were readie with their Cockboate to set them aboard, where
being coucht together in a Cabben they past away the time in
 recounting their old loues, til their man <hi>Capnio</hi> should come.
<hi>Porrus</hi> who had heard that this morning the King would go
abroad to take the ayre, called in haste to his wife to bring him
his holyday hose and his best Iacket, that he might goe like
an honest substantiall man to tell his tale. His Wife a good
cleanly wenche, brought him all things fitte, and spungd him
vp very handsomlie, giuing him the chaines and Iewels in a
little boxe, which <hi>Porrus</hi> for the more safety put in his bosom.
Hauing thus all his trinkets in a readines, taking his staffe
in his hand he had his wife kisse him for good lucke, and so hée
went towards the Pallace. But as he was going, fortune
(who meant to showe him a little false play) preuented his
purpose in this wise.</p>
            <p>He met by chaunce in his way <hi>Capnio,</hi> who trudging as
fast as he could with a little coffer vnder his arme to the ship,
and spying <hi>Porrus</hi> whome he knewe to be <hi>Fawnias</hi> Father,
going towardes the Pallace, being a wylie fellow, began to
doubt the worst, and therefore crost him the way, and askt him
whither he was going so earely this morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Porrus</hi> (who knew by his face that he was one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court)
meaning simply, told him that the Kings son <hi>Dorastus</hi> dealt
hardly with him: for he had but one Daughter who was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Beautifull, and that his neighboures told him the young
<pb facs="tcp:9036:21"/>
Prince had allured her to folly, he went therefore now to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
to the King how greatly he was abused.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Capnio</hi> (who straight way smelt the whole matter) began
to soth him in his talke, and said, that <hi>Dorastus</hi> dealt not like
a Prince to spoyle and poore manes daughter in that sort: he
therefore would doe the best for him he could, because he knew
he was an honest man. But (quoth <hi>Capnio</hi>) you lose your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in going to the Pallace, for the King meanes this day to
take the aire of the Sea, and to goe aboord of a shippe that
lies in the hauen, I am going before, you see, to prouide all
things in a redinesse, and if you wil follow my counsaile, turne
back with me to the hauen, where I will set you in such a fitte
place as you may speake to the King at your pleasure. <hi>Porrus</hi>
giuing credit to <hi>Capnios</hi> smooth tale, gaue him a thousand
thanks for his frendly aduise, and went with him to the hauen,
making all the way his complaintes of <hi>Dorastus,</hi> yet concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
secretlie the chaine and the Iewels. Assone as they were
come to the Sea side, the marriners seeing <hi>Capnio,</hi> came a
land with their cock-boate, who still dissembling the matter,
demaunded of <hi>Porrus</hi> if he would go see the ship, who vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and fearing the worst, because he was not well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with <hi>Capnio,</hi> made his excuse that he could not brooke the
Sea, therefore would not trouble him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Capnio,</hi> seeing that by faire meanes hee could not get him
aboord, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the mariners that by violence they should
carrie him into the shippe, who like sturdy knaues hoisted the
poore shepheard on their backes, and bearing him to the boate,
lanched from the land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Porrus</hi> seeing himselfe so cunningly betraied durst not crie
out, for hee sawe it would not preuaile, but began to intreate
<hi>Capnio</hi> and the mariners to be good to him, and to pittie his
estate, hee was but a poore man that liued by his labour: they
laughing to see the shepheard so afraide, made as much haste
as they could, and sette him aboorde. <hi>Porrus</hi> was no sooner in
the shippe, but he saw <hi>Dorastus</hi> walking with <hi>Fawnia,</hi> yet he
scarfe knew her: for she had attired her selfe in riche apparell,
which, so increased her beauty, that shee resembled rather an
Angell then a mortall creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9036:22"/>
               <hi>Dorastus</hi> and <hi>Fawnia,</hi> were halfe astonished to see the olde
shepherd, maruailing greatly what wind had brought him
thither, til <hi>Capino</hi> told them al the whole discourse: how <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
was going to make his complaint to the King, if by polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he had not preuented him, and therefore now sith he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord,
for the auoiding of further danger, it were best to carrie
him into Italy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorastus</hi> praised greatly his mans deuise, and allowed of
his counsaile: but <hi>Fawnia,</hi> (who stil feared <hi>Porrus,</hi> as her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
began to blush for shame, that by her meanes he should
either incure daunger or displeasure.</p>
            <p>The old shephard hearing this hard sentence, that he should
on such a sodaine be caried from his Wife, his country and
kinsfolke, into a forraine Lande amongst straungers, began
with bitter teares to make his complaint, and on his knees to
intreate <hi>Dorastus,</hi> that pardoning his vnaduised folly he
would giue him leaue to goe home: swearing that hee would
keepe all thinges as secret as they could wish. But these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
could not preuaile, although <hi>Fawnia</hi> intreated <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastus</hi>
very earnestly, but the mariners hoisting their maine
sailes waied ankers, and hailed into the deepe, where we leaue
them to the fauour of the wind and seas, &amp; returne to <hi>Egistus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHo hauing appointed this day to hunt in one of his
Forrests, called for his sonne <hi>Dorastus</hi> to go sport
himselfe, because hee saw that of late hee began to loure: but
his men made answer that hee was gone abroade none knew
whither, except he were gone to the groue to walke all alone,
as his custome was to doe euery day.</p>
            <p>The King willing to waken him out of his dumpes, sent
one of his men to goe seeke him, but in vaine, for at last he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
but finde him he could not, so that the King went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to goe see the sport: where passing away the day, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at night from hunting, hee asked for his sonne, but hee
could not be heard of, which draue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King into a great choler:
where vpon most of his Noblemen and other Courtiers, poa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
abroad to séek him, but they could not heare of him through
all <hi>Sicilia,</hi> onely they missed <hi>Capnio</hi> his man which againe
<pb facs="tcp:9036:22"/>
made the King suspect that he was not gone farre.</p>
            <p>Two or three daies being passed, and no newes heard of
<hi>Dorastus, Egistus</hi> began to feare that he was deuoured with
some wilde beastes, and vpon that made out a greate troupe of
men to go seeke him: who coasted through all the Countrey
and searched in euerie daungerous and secrete place, vntill at
last they mette with a Fisherman that was sitting in a little
couert harde by the sea side mending his nettes, when <hi>Dora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
and <hi>Fawnia</hi> tooke shipping: who being examined if he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knewe or heard where the Kings Sonne was, without
any secrecie at all reuealed the whole matter, how he was say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
two dayes past, &amp; had in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany his man <hi>Capnio, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and his faire Daughter <hi>Fawnia.</hi> This heauie newes was
presently caryed to the King, who halfe dead for sorow, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<hi>Porrus</hi> wife to bee sent for: she being come to the
Pallace, after due examination, confessed that her neighbours
had oft told her that the Kings Sonne was too familier with
<hi>Fawnia</hi> her Daughter: wherevppon, her husband fearing the
worst, about two dayes past (hearing the King should goe an
hunting) rose earely in the morning and went to make his
complaint, but since she neither hearde of him, nor saw him.
<hi>Egistus</hi> perceiuing the womans vnfeyned simplicity, let her
depart without incurring further displeasure, conceiling such
secret greefe for his Sonnes recklesse follie, that he had so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
his honour and parentage, by so base a choise to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
his Father, and discredit himselfe, that with very care and
thought he fel into a quartan feuer, which was so vnfit for his
aged yeeres and complexion, that he became so weake, as the
Phisitions would graunt him no life.</p>
            <p>But his sonne <hi>Dorastus</hi> little regarded either father, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:

smyling on this young nouice, lent him so lucky a gale of

ouer boord, the sayles were torne, the tacklings went in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the storme raging still so furiously that poore <hi>Fawnia</hi> was
almost dead for feare, but that she was greatly comforted with
the presence of <hi>Dorastus.</hi> The tempest continued thrée dayes,
al which time the Mariners euerie minute looked for death,
and the aire was so darkned with cloudes that the Maister
could not tell by his compasse in what Coast they were. But
vpon the fourth day about ten of the clocke, the wind began
to cease: the sea to wax calme, and the sky to be cleare, and the
Mariners descryed the coast of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> shooting of their
ordnance for ioy that they had escaped such a fearefull tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorastus</hi> hearing that they were arriued at some harbour,
sweetly kissed <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and bad her be of good cheare: when
they tolde him that the port belonged vnto the cheife Cittie of
<hi>Bohemia</hi> where <hi>Pandosto</hi> kept his Court, <hi>Dorastus</hi> began
to be sad: knowing that his Father hated no man so much as
<hi>Pandosto,</hi> and that the King himself had sought secretly to
betray <hi>Egistus</hi>: this considered, he was halfe afraid to goe on
land, but that <hi>Capnio</hi> counselled him to chaunge his name
and his countrey, vntil such time as they could get some other
Barke to transport them into <hi>Italy. Dorastus</hi> liking this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
made his case priuy to the Marriners, rewarding them
bountifully for their paines, and charging them to saye that he
was a Gentleman of <hi>Trapalonia</hi> called <hi>Meleagrus.</hi> The
shipmen willing to shew what friendship they could to <hi>Dora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
promised to be as secret as they could, or hee might wish,
and vppon this they landed in a little village a mile distant
from the Citie, where after they had rested a day, thinking to
make prouision for their mariage: the fame of <hi>Fawnias</hi> beauty
was spread throughout all the Citie, so that it came to the
eares of <hi>Pandosto</hi>: who then being about the age of fifty, had
notwithstanding yong and freshe affections: so that he desired
greatly to see <hi>Fawnia,</hi> and to bring this matter the better to
passe, hearing they had but one man, and how they rested at a
very homely house: he caused them to be apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as spies,
and sent a dozen of his garde to take them: who being come
to their lodging, tolde them the Kings message: <hi>Dorastus</hi> no
<pb facs="tcp:9036:24"/>
whit dismayed, accompanied with <hi>Fawnia</hi> and <hi>Capnio,</hi> went
to the court (for they left <hi>Porrus</hi> to keepe the stuffe) who being
admitted to the Kings presence. <hi>Dorastus</hi> and <hi>Fawnia</hi> with
humble obeysance saluted his maiestie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandosto</hi> amased at the singular perfection of <hi>Fawnia,</hi> stood
halfe astonished, viewing her beauty, so that he had almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
himselfe what hee had to doe: at last with stearne counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
he demaunded their names, and of what countrey they
were, and what caused them to land in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Sir (quoth
<hi>Dorastus</hi>) know that my name <hi>Meleagrus</hi> is a Knight borne
and brought vp in <hi>Trapalonia,</hi> and this Gentlewoman, whom
I meane to take to my wife is an <hi>Italian</hi> borne in <hi>Padua,</hi> from
whence I haue now brought her. The Cause I haue so small
a trayne with me, is for that her friends vnwilling to consent,
I intended secretly to conuey her into <hi>Trapalonia:</hi> whither
as I was sailing, by distresse of weather I was driuen into
these coasts: thus haue you heard my name, my country, and
the cause of my voiage. <hi>Pandosto</hi> starting from his seat as one
in choller, made this rough reply.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meleagrus,</hi> I feare this smooth tale hath but small trueth,
and that thou couerest a foule skin with faire paintings. No
doubt this Ladie by her grace and beauty is of her degree
more meete for a mighty Prince, then for a simple knight, and
thou like a periured traitour hast bereft her of her parents, to
their present griefe, and her insuing sorrow. Till therefore I
heare more of her parentage and of thy calling, I wil stay you
both here in <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorastus,</hi> in whome rested nothing but Kingly valor, was
not able to suffer the reproches of <hi>Pandosto,</hi> but that he made
him this answer.</p>
            <p>IT is not meete for a King, without due proofe to appeach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man of ill behauiour, nor vpon suspition to inferre beléefe:
straungers ought to bee entertained with courtesie, not to bee
intreated with crueltie, least being forced by want to put vp
iniuries: the Gods reuenge their cause with rigor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandosto</hi> hearing <hi>Dorastus</hi> vtter these wordes, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that he should straight be committed to prison, vntill such
<pb facs="tcp:9036:25"/>
time as they heard further of his pleasure, but as for <hi>Fawnia,</hi>
he charged that she should be entertained in the Court, with
such curtesie as belonged to a straunger and her calling. The
rest of the shipmen he put into the Dungeon.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus hardly handled the supposed <hi>Trapalonians:
Pandosto</hi> contrarie to his aged yeaxes began to be somwhat
tickled with the beauty of <hi>Fawnia,</hi> in so much that hee could
take no rest, but cast in his old head a thousand new deuises: at
last he fell into these thoughtes.</p>
            <p>HOw art thou pestred <hi>Pandosto</hi> with fresh affections,
and vnfitte fancies, wishing to possesse with an vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mynde, and a hot desire troubled with a could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine:
Shalt thy mynde yeeld in age to that thou hast resisted
in youth? Peace <hi>Pandosto,</hi> blabbe not out that which thou
maiest be ashamed to reueale to thy self. Ah <hi>Fawnia</hi> is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and it is not for thine honour (fond foole) to name her that
is thy Captiue, and an other mans Concubine. Alas, I reach
at that with my hand which my hart would faine refuse: play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like the bird Ibys in Egipt, which hateth Serpents, yet
feedeth on their egges.</p>
            <p>Tush, hot desires turne oftentimes to colde disdaine: Loue
is brittle, where appetite, not reason beares the sway: Kinges
thoughtes ought not to climbe so high as the heauens, but to
looke no lower then honour: better it is to pecke at the starres
with the young Eagles, then to pray on dead carkasses with
the Uulture: tis more honourable for <hi>Pandosto</hi> to dye by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
Loue, their to enioy such vnfitte Loue. Dooth <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosto</hi>
then loue? Yea: whome? A maide vnknowne, yea and
perhapps, immodest, stragled out of her owne countrie: beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but not therefore chast: comely in bodie, but perhappes
crooked in minde. Cease then <hi>Pandosto</hi> to looke at <hi>Fawnia,</hi>
much lesse to loue her: be not ouertaken with a womans beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whose eyes are framed by arte to inamour, whose hearte is
framed by nature to inchaunt, whose false teares knowe their
true times<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and whose sweete wordes pearce deeper then
sharpe swordes. Here <hi>Pandosto</hi> ceased from his talke, but not
from his loue: for although he sought by reason, and wisedome
<pb facs="tcp:9036:25"/>
to suppresse this franticke affection: yet he could take no rest,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> beautie of <hi>Fawnia</hi> had made such a déepe impression in his
heart. But on a day walking abroad into a Parke which was
hard adioyning to his house, he sent by one of his seruants for
<hi>Fawnia,</hi> vnto whome he vttered these wordes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FAwnia,</hi> I commend thy beauty and wit, and now pittie
thy distresse and want: but if thou wilt forsake Sir <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagrus,</hi>
whose pouerty, though a Knight, is not able to
maintaine an estate aunswerable to thy beauty, and yeld thy
consent to <hi>Pandosto</hi>: I wil both increase thee with dignities
and riches. No sir, answered <hi>Fawnia</hi>: <hi>Meleagrus</hi> is a knight
that hath wonne me by loue, and none but he shal weare me:
his sinister mischance shall not diminishe my affection, but
rather increase my good will: thinke not though your Grace
hath imprisoned him without cause, that feare shall make mee
yéeld my consent: I had rather be <hi>Meleagrus</hi> wife, and a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then liue in plenty, and be <hi>Pandostos</hi> Concubine. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosto</hi>
hearing the assured aunswere of <hi>Fawnia,</hi> would, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
prosecute his suite to the vttermost: séeking with
faire words and great promises in scale the fort of her chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
swearing that if she would graunt to his desire, <hi>Meleagrus</hi>
should not only he fet at libertie, but honored in his course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his Nobles: but these alluring baytes could not intise
her minde from the loue of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

had it bene for thée, by sitting lowe, to haue had quiet, then by

mine owne daunger, but <hi>Dorastus</hi> displeasure. Ah swéete

With that feching a déepe sigh, she ceased fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her complaints,

            <p>Ah vnfortunate wretch borne to mishappe, now thy folly

not the house, but burneth it: assure thy selfe thou shalt die, and
thou old doating foole, whose follie hath bene such, as to suffer

without cause I am condemned to die: I am yet glad I
haue opportunitie to disburde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my conscience before my death:
I will tel you as much as I know, and yet no more than is
true: whereas I am accused that I haue bene a supporter of
<hi>Fawnias</hi> pride, and shee disdained as a vilde begger, so it is,
that I am neither Father vnto her, nor she daughter vnto me.</p>
            <p>For so it happened that I being a poore shepheard in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
liuing by kéeping others mens flockes: one of my shéepe
straying downe to the sea side, as I went to séeke her, I saw a
little boat driuen vpon the shoare, wherein I found a babe of
sixe daies olde, wrapped in a mantle of skarlet, hauing about
the necke this chain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> : I pittying the child, and desirous of the
treasure, carried it home to my wife, who with great care nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it vp, and set it to keepe sheepe. Heere is the chaine and
the Iewels, and this <hi>Fawnia</hi> is the childe whome I found
in the boate, what shee is, or of what parentage I knowe not,

               </gap>t this I am assured that shee is none of mine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pandosto</hi> would scarce suffer him to tell out his tale, but
that he enquired the time of the yeere, the manner of the boate,
and other circumstaunces, which when he found agreeing to
his count, he sodainelie leapt from his seate, and kissed <hi>Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
wetting her tender cheeks with his teares, and crying my
daughter <hi>Fawnia,</hi> ah swtete <hi>Fawnia,</hi> I am thy Father, <hi>Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
This sodaine passion of the King draue them all into a
maze, especially <hi>Fawnia</hi> and <hi>Dorastus.</hi> But when the
King had breathed himselfe a while in this newe ioy, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed
beefore the Embassadours the whole matter, how
hee hadde entreated his wife <hi>Bellaria</hi> for iealousie, and
that this was the childe whome hee sent to floate in the
seas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fawnia</hi> was not more ioyfull that she had found such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then <hi>Dorastus</hi> was glad he should get such a wife. The
<pb facs="tcp:9036:28"/>
Embassadors reioyced that their yong prince had made such a
choice, that those Kingdomes which through enmitie had long
time bin disseuered, should now through perpetual amitie be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
and reconciled. The Citizens and subiects of <hi>Bohemia</hi>
(hearing that the King had found againe his Daughter,
which was supposed dead, ioyfull that there was an heire apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to his Kingdome) made Bonstres and showes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Cittie: The Courtiers and Knights appointed Iusts
and Turneis, to signifie their willing mindes in gratifying
the Kings hap.</p>
            <p>Eighteene daies being past in these princely sports, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosto</hi>
willing to recompence old <hi>Porrus,</hi> of a shepheard made
him a Knight: which done, prouiding a sufficient Nauie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him and his retinue, accompanied with <hi>Dorastus, Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Embassadours, he sailed towards <hi>Sicilia,</hi>
where he was most princelie entertained by <hi>Egistus</hi>: who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this comicall euent, reioyced greatly at his sonnes good
happe, and without delay (to the perpetuall ioy of the two
yong Louers) celebrated the marriage: which was no sooner
ended, but <hi>Pandosto</hi> (calling to mind how first he betraied his
friend <hi>Egistus,</hi> how his iealousie was the cause of <hi>Bellarias</hi>
death, that contrarie to the law of nature hee had lusted after
his owne Daughter) moued with these desperate thoughts, he
fell in a melancholie fit, and to close vp the Comedie with a
Tragicall stratageme, hee slewe himselfe, whose death being
many daies bewailed of <hi>Fawnia, Dorastus,</hi> and his deere
friend <hi>Egistus, Dorastus</hi> taking his leaue of his father,
went with his wife and the dead corps into <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi>
