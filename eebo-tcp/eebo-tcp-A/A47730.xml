         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And 'tis this, Sir, that gets you the Love, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,

ever they ſpeak of your Royal Highneſs, 'tis
with ſentiments of Veneration, and with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Zeal for your Service and Honour,
which plainly ſhew, how agreeable your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
is to them, and with what ſincerity they
bleſs Heav'n for the ſweetneſs of your Reign

that zealous reſpect, which they preſerved for

great a paſſion as the beſt of them for a Prince

and am not I your Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are not you my
Soveraign, although neither <hi>Piedmont, Savoy,</hi>

You enjoy a Soveraignty, that extends it
ſelf farther then the bounds of your Provinces,
which procures you Subjects in all the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Sir, thoſe nine immortal Ladies have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
you in all places where they have any
intereſt, to teſtify their acknowledgement of
thoſe many Favours your Royal Highneſs hath
made them receive. The good entertainment
you oblige them with, is an infallible ſigne, that
you are not ignorant of their Beauties, and that
you have a perfect knowledge of their Merits.</p>
               <p>We ought not to wonder when we ſee them
but little eſteemed in a great part of the world;
none can eſteem them but thoſe that know them,
and that is an advantage that Heaven doth not
commonly beſtow; your Royal Highneſs is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of this precious advantage, and I am very
certain that you poſſeſs it in a very eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
that quick, ſubtle, and delicate Wit of
yours, is skill'd even to admiration, in all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,

This is that Divine Quality, Sir, that gives a
Luſtre to all your Heroick ones, and crowns you
King of all the Wits of the age: Your Valour,
Juſtice, and Generoſity are great Virtues I muſt
confeſs; That ſweetneſs and obliging entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with that agreeable Air which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
all your Actions, and Charms all thoſe that
have the Honour to approach your Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
that Galantry which is ſo natural to you,
which gets you the inclinations of the Ladies,
and renders your Court, and all your divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo Noble and Magnificent, are glorious
advantages, I muſt avow it. But all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vertues and glorious advantages, would,
it is poſſible, be confined to your own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Strangers, and Poſterity would never
ſo much as hear of them, were they not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that our Love of the Muſes. Had it not
been for this Honourable inclination, <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
never had received ſo many Elogies as he did,
and his Glory, it may be, had never reached
our Ears. It is this that makes your Vertues
commended and talkt of beyond the limits of
your Provinces, and ſhall do too, far beyond
that ſhort courſe of your life, that you ſpend
ſo gloriouſly, and that merited Eternity; it is
this that inveſts you with a Soveraignty over all
the <hi>Vertuoſi</hi> in the world, and to which I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
for the happineſs I enjoy, to ſtile my ſelf
your Subject. It is poſſible it is an exceſs of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in me to reckon my ſelf among the Wits;
but when one has once obtain'd the happineſs to
pleaſe your Royal Highneſs, he may without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
aſſume that glorious Title with all its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100546:11"/>
and in that condition to which your
Royal Highneſs has been pleaſed to advance
me; I ſhould offend your judgement, ſhould I
have a bad opinion of any thing that I call mine.
I have ſo highly eſteemed my parts, ſince I was
informed your Royal Highneſs did not deſpiſe
them, I judged them capable of conferring ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
to your Royal pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Since my firſt works have taken the boldneſs
to paſs over the <hi>Alps</hi> without my Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet had the happineſs to pleaſe all your
Court, though I durſt not hope it; I imagined,
that thoſe I ſhould my ſelf ſend over thither, and
which had no other deſigne but that of your
Royal Highneſſes Divertiſement, would not be
ſo unhappy, as to come off worſe then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>It is a great deſign without queſtion, that I
engage upon, and I ſhould ſay even a raſh and
inconſiderate one, if a perſon had not adviſed
me to it, that I am confident is too prudent to
counſel me to any ſuch undertakings: it is, Sir,
a Gentleman of your Dominions that hath the
honour both to be known and belov'd of his
Prince, that hath been pleaſed to give himſelf the
trouble to bring my Muſe into your Court, and
that hath wrote me word of the good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
it received from your Royal Highneſs.
This generous friend of mine could not poſſibly
procure me a more glorious, advantage nor one
that I more vehemently deſired; but that which
hath exceeded all my hopes, and created in me
the moſt pleaſant ſurprize imaginable, is that
incomparable goodneſ that he was pleaſed to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100546:11"/>
have for me in communicating a Letter of your
Royal Highneſs to me, in which you graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
vouchſafed to witneſs, that you eſteemed
my works, and that you ſhould be very well
ſatisfied to ſee me make ſome more of them for
your divertiſement. This Letter was a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and indiſputable Order for me, but it was
no unpleaſant one, and I can ſafely ſwear, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with as great a joy as ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>It is this, Sir, that obliged me to the writing
of this piece of Gallantry, the gayety whereof
it is not impoſſible may not diſpleaſe you. It may
be too, it may diſſipate for ſome moments thoſe
troubleſome thoughts, that your Politick affairs
commonly leave behind them, and ſome of thoſe
cares which the conduct of great Eſtates almoſt
always plague us with.</p>
               <p>If I can compaſs ſo noble a deſigne as this, I
ſhall get my ſelf reputation, and ſhall perſwade
my ſelf, that your Subjects are ſomething en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to me into the bargain. It is not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
but they know, that when one diverted
<hi>Ceſar,</hi> he obliged the Republick, and I am very
certain, that <hi>Ceſar</hi> had not more noble qualities
then your Royal Highneſs; and that the <hi>Romans</hi>
had not a more tender affection, or profound
reſpect for him, then thoſe of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
have for their Soveraign.</p>
               <p>Theſe are truths, Sir, that your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
may eaſily be ſatisfied of, from a forreign
Countrey. If they were told you by your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
you might ſuſpect, they ſaid ſo for their
own intereſt, or to flatter you, and ſo receive
their praiſes as a common homage, which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100546:12"/>
ſeldom refuſe their Soveraigns; but when
an Elogie proceeds to you from a Province not
ſubject to your Royal Highneſs, you may aſſure
your ſelf, Sir, that he who gave you theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
was confident of the truth of them.
It is from ſtrangers that a Prince may learn infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly,
what Sentiments the world has of him,
and what their judgement is of his Qualities and
his Conduct.</p>
               <p>And ſince it is ſo, Sir, your Royal Highneſs
ought to be entirely ſatisfied; thoſe strangers
which are not intereſſed in your Highneſs, praiſe
and bleſs you; and I, Sir, that have made ſome
voyages into forraign Countreys, can witneſs the
truth of it: Whereever they ſpeak of your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs, they compare you to thoſe great
Princes from whence you drew your being. As
all the world is very well ſatisfied that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
can ſurprize you, and that your courage ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acknowledges no dangers, or makes them
immediately ceaſe to be ſo, they compare you
to the Illuſtrious <hi>Amedees,</hi> which all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
power of the <hi>Turks</hi> could never terrifie, and
that preſerved <hi>Rhodes</hi> with ſo much glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the force of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor.
They count you too, as good as that <hi>Louis,</hi> that
was ſo much belov'd of his Subjects, for his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and clemency, as wiſe as that <hi>Charles,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the Warrier, that was as well the moſt
prudent as accompliſhed Prince of his Age; as
knowing, as that other <hi>Charles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſurnamed the
Good, who ſo dearly loved Scholars, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and as quick and active as the great <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100546:12"/>
Philibert,</hi> that ſhow'd ſo incomparable an
addreſs in all his bodily exerciſes.</p>
               <p>I have often heard your Royal Highneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
too, to all your famous Anceſtors, but
moſt commonly they do it with your Illuſtrious
Grandfather, to that great Prince whoſe name
you own, and whoſe Vertues you are maſter of.
In the time he lived in, he was eſteemed a
Man that had the moſt glorious reputation in
the world. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the VIII, our <hi>Henry</hi> the
Great, and <hi>James</hi> the VIII. King of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
gave him commendations, that poſterity
ſhould never be unmindful of; and the great
Cardinal of <hi>Richielieu,</hi> which knew as well as any
man, all theſe Vertues that are neceſſary for a
Prince; ſaid of him, of whom I am a ſpeaking,
that he never knew a more ſtrong, active, and
univerſal Wit in his life; the moſt eloquent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of his time have ſung of his Merit. That
<hi>Taſſo</hi> that he loved with ſo much tenderneſs, the
<hi>Ciabrera,</hi> the <hi>Marines,</hi> and <hi>Caſſines,</hi> thought
they ſhould render themſelves immortal, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
ſuch a Princes Commendations in their
Works, whoſe name and memory ought to be
immortal. If all thoſe great Men were ſtill alive,
I am confident, they would conſpire to tell you,
that the <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> of our age, is a Son
worthy that <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> that was ſo juſtly
praiſed by all thoſe great Princes, and ſo bravely
ſung of by all thoſe illuſtrious Poets. Why have
not I the Wit and Eloquence of the laſt, which
I would wholly employ with all my ſoul to make
an Elogie for your Royal Highneſs. I'd tell
the future ages of thoſe Vertues, whereof ours
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100546:13"/>
is ſo ſtrongly perſwaded; your great Spirit, I
mean your Gcneroſity, your Bounty, your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and all your other Qualities; at leaſt as far
as my Wit would permit me, that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them with the blood of that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conqueror <hi>Amedees,</hi> your Auguſt Father.</p>
               <p>Since theſe great qualities, which before were
onely ſeen afar off, were in your voyage to
<hi>Lyons</hi> more nearly conſidered by all our Court;
our great Monarch has conceived Sentiments of
Love and Eſteem for your Royal Highneſs, and
thoſe too are ſpread through his whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And would not the French be injuſt,
ſhould they not doat upon ſuch a Prince, which
always expreſſes ſo great a love for <hi>France;</hi>
a Prince, that no ſooner ſaw, that his trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
deſtiny had broke thoſe ties that engaged
him to our Crown, but he ſought out for new
ones with all the vehemence in the world: how
infinitely reaſonable was this vehemence, ſince
its Object was a Princeſs ſo accompliſhed? a
Princeſs whoſe charms deſerve ſo much Love,
Reſpect, and Devotion, that in the greatneſs
of her Soul, is the accurate Portraicture of your
Illuſtrious Mother, and that by her Vertues
would revive her memory, if it was poſſible,
that it ever could be extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>What a joy it was to your Subjects, Sir, to
ſee your Royal Highneſs bound in an Eternal
knot to that incomparable Princeſs? and what
a glory it would be for me, if my Story were
pleaſant enough to divert two Perſons of ſo high
a Rank, and ſo ſublime Ingenuity. I dare
avow, Sir, that in ſpight of my accuſtomed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100546:13"/>
I conceived very great hopes of it.
When one has a deſigne to pleaſe you, 'tis very
difficult to think of any thing that is low and
contemptible; the Soul raiſes it ſelf in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
ſo great an enterpriſe: and as for my
particular, I believe that mine has excelled it
ſelf, ever ſince the very inſtant that I intended
to make my Image of <hi>Zelotyde,</hi> becauſe I had a
deſign to ſend it to your Royal Highneſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
you with all the Lineaments of her Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and gave all your Court a ſufficient occaſion
to laugh at her ſuſpicious, and ridiculous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, Sir, the Comedians have handled the
jealous Gentlemen, with all the cruelty imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and have commonly ſpar'd the jealous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
But for all that, there are ſome of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Sex as ſubject to this paſſion, as the moſt
whining Romantick Lover among Men, and it
will be convenient to acquaint them in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
how prejudicious this pretty Frenſie is to
their repoſe, how extravagant it renders them,
and how they deſerve to be hated by all their
Gallants, for this raſcally method of making
Love.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe therefore your Royal Highneſs,
to caſt an Eye on my pretty jealous Creature's
extravagant adventures, which your goodneſs
makes me aſſume the liberty to make the recital
of, and which I ſhall do with all the Gayety that
my Subject requires, and with all the Reſpect I
owe your Royal Highneſs.</p>

Reformed Officers, and the moſt noble and brave

plaguing all they met with, with an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

               </p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Officers of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment

but all of them were not ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
inclin'd: ſome few of them were more
Gentile and Courtly, and preferred a handſome
obliging Lady, before all the Pots in Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Lycidas</hi> was one of theſe civil Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and without all queſtion, Sir, he might paſs
for one of the prettieſt fellows in the Regiment;
he was young and wity, and as well made as the
beſt of them; and to advance all theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
his Cloaths were as fine, and Al-a-mode,
as they could poſſibly be out of <hi>Paris;</hi> his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100546:14"/>
variety of Garnitures, and his good large plume
of Feathers, that quite cover'd his little empty
Noddle, made him preſently be taken notice of;
all the Ladies mightily admired him, and doing
as they uſe to do in the like occaſions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
taken with him, and there was not one
Lady in all the Town, that was not hatching
ſome amorous deſign, how to impriſon this our
handſome ſtranger.</p>
               <p>As he was alwaies a profeſt Servant of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and he long'd to ſee all the Beauties of the
place, in as ſhort a time as he could; he, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his deſign, got acquaintance with a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
of the Town, that had formerly been a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
too, and now at preſent.</p>
               <p>This talkative ill-natured Cavalier, I forgot
to tell you what he was before, would not for all
the world but have brought <hi>Lycidas</hi> to Maſs, that
is the amorous rendezvous of the Town; and 'tis
very likely had not <hi>Lycidas</hi> been acquainted, that
he ſhould find good ſtore of Beauties there, he
would have been more gentile, and leſs ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
than to go to that place of Devotion.
Here it was a Man might ſee at once all that
thought themſelves handſome; and it was here
that our Courtly Soldier learned all the names
of the Ladies, for he was better bred then to
caſt an Eie, or ſpeak a Syllable of any thing elſe,
while there was ſomething like a Woman in the
company. This is very fair you will ſay, for
the firſt bout; but our Gallant goes further, and
learns what Love intrigue this and that Lady has
with that and the other Gentleman, and in as
ſhort a time as can be imagined, his precious

intelligence made him a perfect relation of their

you may ſwear he would not leave off,
he went continually to Maſs, and that out of

dreſs'd as fine as hands could make him; all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

placed himſelf in a fit Poſt to have his finery taken

In a word, Sir, he was the moſt civil obliging
perſon that breath'd, Nay, faith, Sir, there are
ſome will tell you, that his very civility grew
trouble ſome and impertinent, he had ſo much
of it; but for all this, take him all together, he
was a very extraordinary perſon, at leaſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

ſtately proper perſon, young, and ſomething
yellow-hair'd, and her Air and Mein had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them extreamly taking.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>When in the Church ſhe did appear;</l>
                  <l>How her fair Eies of Eies attractive were,</l>
                  <l>And like the Sun no Star was ſeen but her?</l>
                  <l>From her ſweet violence</l>
                  <l>Altars prov'd no defence,</l>
                  <l>Her ſacrilegious charms pull'd captives thence.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>In a word, where ever ſhe was, none could
be ſeen or look'd upon, but her; and all this, ſhe
term'd the effects of her Beauty, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
herſelf, that ſhe really merited a greater
eſteem then the reſt. She, as well as the reſt
had ſome ill deſign on our new Cavalier (but,
I'faith, I think I'm out there, and a Captain of
the Infantry cannot be well called ſo) and having
reſolv'd upon it, ſhe dreſſed her ſelf with more
care then ordinary, and forgot not any of thoſe
helps, that Art could furniſh her with, to ſet off
thoſe advantages that nature had made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p>The Lady being ſuch as I have deſcrib'd her,
your Royal Highneſs may eaſily imagine, that ſhe
had enough of <hi>Lycidas's</hi> humble reverences;
wherever ſhe met him, and that at Church, he
particularly oblig'd her by his amorous glances;
and I vow, 'tis well he did ſo, for the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
had he not given her that eſteem ſhe
thought ſhe deſerv'd, would not have eaſily been
comforted for her misfortunes; ſhe had indeed
as quick a wit, as any Lady in the Town, but
ſhe had a very ſtrange kind of humour though.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100546:16"/>
Her jealouſie was ſo exceſſive, that ſhe grew
jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of all the world, nay, of thoſe perſons ſhe
never knew, nor heard of, neither Friends nor
Enemies could ſcape her; I have heard a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pretty ſtories of her Jealouſie, of one of
her acquaintance, and they're all extreamly
pleaſant and extraordinary. She was ſo damn'd
jealous.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>If ſome kind doating Husband chanc'd to kiſs,</l>
                  <l>What now he call, d his Wife, before his Miſs;</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Zelotide</hi> but chanc'd to ſpie,</l>
                  <l>The mutual charming Language of their Eie;</l>
                  <l>She dams, ſhe curſes their chaſt Fire,</l>
                  <l>And longs to ſee their purer Flames expire.</l>
                  <l>Who ever does careſs, what e're it is,</l>
                  <l>Be't Wife or Miſs,</l>
                  <l>She frets, ſhe pines, ſhe ſighs,</l>
                  <l>To ſee the conqueſt of another's Eies,</l>
                  <l>That any Face but hers, could make ſuch victories.</l>
                  <l>If the fond Lacquey chanc'd to kiſs the Maid,</l>
                  <l>Or by ſome pretty ſign his Love betray'd,</l>
                  <l>She the poor Innocent</l>
                  <l>Did miſerably torment,</l>
                  <l>And Rival-like, ſtill thwarted her intent,</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But yet, Sir, ſhe did not do all this out of any
averſion ſhe had to love, but the covetous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would have had all the world doat upon her;
ſhe would be the only Beauty, and the only Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs
of all that could conceive that noble paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
She went indeed ſometimes to ſee a Play
and ſometimes ſhe would read Romances; but
all this onely augmented her calamity, and theſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100546:17"/>
pretty divertiſements were the greateſt plagues
in nature to her. At a Play ſhe would fain get
<hi>Celadon</hi> from <hi>Florimel,</hi> or <hi>Dauphire</hi> from the
Collegiate Ladies, and could not endure to hear
<hi>Romeo</hi> compliment his <hi>Juliet.</hi> And then
in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
ſhe was confounded, mad to ſee <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
ſo paſſionate for his <hi>Pamela;</hi> ſhe
could with all
her ſoul have ſtrangled the fair
<hi>Caſſandra,</hi> to
get her <hi>Oroondates:</hi> All the actions of thoſe
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
Heroes, that they perform'd with ſo much
Courage and Generoſity to expreſs their Love,
and do things worthy of it, were ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
blows that ſtab'd her contentment; and
in that transport of fury, that their amorous
declarations had put her; ſhe threw away the
Romance, nay, and ſometimes threw it into the
fire too, to revenge her ſelf for that injury, that
ſhe fancied had been put upon her: but yet ſhe
had ſome wit with her madneſs, at leaſt, ſo
much as
to conceal her extravagance from the eyes of the
world, ſo that you could not poſſibly diſcover
it
in her, without a long and a familiar acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Having now learn'd her Character, your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs may eaſily imagine, what an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
trouble ſhe was condemn'd to every day at
Maſs, where <hi>Lycidas</hi> never fail'd to meet
her.
For though ſhe had the greateſt ſhare of his
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Glances, his Reverences, and all thoſe
petty pieces of Gallantry, ſhe grew ſtark mad,
and all this would not content her.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>If the fair ſtranger chanc'd to caſt an Eye</l>
                  <l>On any pretty Creature nigh;</l>
                  <l>She rag'd, ſhe ſtorm'd, and ſwore they both
muſt die.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100546:17"/>
Thus ev'ry thing ſhe ſaw conferr'd,</l>
                  <l>To heighten the misfortunes, ſhe indur'd,</l>
                  <l>If the next Lady did without deſign</l>
                  <l>Receive a glance or two,</l>
                  <l>As any pretty thing from <hi>Lycidas</hi> might
do,</l>
                  <l>She ſtorm'd, and would his Eies to her
confine.</l>
                  <l>His glances, his ſalutes are all her own,</l>
                  <l>And ſhe robs her, that does receive ev'n one.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Nevertheleſs her jealous Ladyſhip was fain to
conceal her reſentments for ten or twelve days,
for <hi>Lycidas</hi> was ſo long without viſiting the
Ladies at their ſeveral Houſes, and our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
did not this without all the reaſon in the
world, for he knew very well (though my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
did not inform me, how he came to
know it) how much a man expoſes himſelf in
company, when he is ignorant of their Intrigues,
which make the greateſt part of the diſcourſe,
and for this reaſon he reſolv'd to be fully
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the ſtory of the Town, before he
engaged in company. And truly, that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Hiſtorian, that ill-natured Satyriſt, I mean,
that I told you of before, was as good a Maſter to
inſtruct him, as he could wiſh, and one that
proved very neceſſary to him in that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and upon this conſideration (for faith I
know nothing elſe could induce him to it) he
was ſcarce ever out of his company.</p>
               <p>In a fair day they both went a walking together,
to enjoy the ſweetneſs of the Air, and ſee how
the
Spring had with her natural Artifice, (that you
will ſay now is a ſtrange one I hope) paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Trees and Meadows with her inviſible
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100546:18"/>
Pencil, beyond the happy curioſity of all the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Angelos; they went, if I am not miſtaken, to
a certain Garden not far out of Town, and when
they came to the Gate of it, they ſaw two
Coaches there, which made them ſuſpect there
was company in the Garden wherupon they
enquir'd of the Coachman, who told them that
a kinſman of our Cavaliers, had Coach'd ſome
ſeven or eight Ladies thither: Now who would
not pity this poor Gentleman among ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Women, were he nine times a Man,
that's about fourſcore times more than a Tailor,
he could never be enough for them: Why, a
hundred Mouths would be little enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them and kiſs them, and a thouſand hands
would not ſuffice to clip them, hug them, and
hand them; but I leave the Gentleman to the
mercy of the Ladies, and muſt ſee what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are a doing. They had no ſooner learn'd
of the Coachman, what I told you of, but they
both agreed very prudently to go ſeek out ſome
other ſolitary place, that would be more fit and
proper for their purpoſe, and without more adoe,
were marching back again, when the Maſter of
the Feaſt chanced to ſpie them, and running to
them to ſtop them, he made uſe of that civil
piece of violence, we commonly do in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to engage them to come into this company.
The Femals that thought one man to ſeven of
them, was moſt intolerable, were not very much
diſpleas'd at the arrival of theſe two Gentlemen;
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> that was one of the company, and knew
the Cavalier, went to meet him, pretending
ſome buſineſs ſhe had to tell him of, but it was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100546:18"/>
for nothing elſe but to lay hold of <hi>Lycidas</hi> firſt
of all; her project took, the ſtranger fell to her
ſhare, and he, being a very pretty fellow, and one
that ſpoke the fineſt things in the world, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a very happy faculty to love when he would,
or, what was all one, to make people believe
ſo.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>He then reſolv'd his parts ſhould not be hid,</l>
                  <l>And if he did not love, you'd ſwear he did.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And really, Sir, this firſt enterview, while the
treatment was providing, <hi>Zelotide</hi> had reaſon to
be ſatisfied with him. They walked a great many
turns of the Allie together, and <hi>Lycidas</hi> being
no ſcrupulous perſon in making his Love-Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Swore preſently ten thouſand Oaths</l>
                  <l>Beſides his pretty Faiths and Troths,</l>
                  <l>That from the moment he firſt ſaw,</l>
                  <l>Her charms, her charms, kept all his ſoul in aw,</l>
                  <l>And gently forc'd him to accept their Law.</l>
                  <l>That though ſhe ſcorn'd his paſſion</l>
                  <l>And did his torments with contempt look on.</l>
                  <l>Yet ſhe, yet onely ſhe,</l>
                  <l>Should be the Empreſs of his liberty.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>He had not quite finiſh'd his proteſtations,
when Dinner was ſerved up, and they were call'd
to ſit down. It was then, if ever, that <hi>Lycidas</hi>
made a good uſe of his wit, and ſpoke a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
the pleaſanteſt things that ever were
heard, ſo that the company was extreamly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him; and <hi>Zelotide</hi> conceived all the joy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100546:19"/>
imaginable, to ſee a perſon that ſhe had ſome
good will for, appear ſo amiable to all the world
beſides. But then her damn'd humour made her
reflect, and think with her ſelf, that if this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
took her ſo infinitely, her companions too
might be more taken with him, then ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And though ſhe lov'd thoſe charms ſhe did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry,</l>
                  <l>Both in his Lips and Eye</l>
                  <l>And all his beauteous harmony,</l>
                  <l>She wiſh'd thoſe charms away</l>
                  <l>That might ſome other Lady make their prey.</l>
                  <l>Leſt he ſhould love elſewhere, or elſe be lov'd,</l>
                  <l>What cruel miſeries her poor heart prov'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Her trouble was ſtill augmented, and his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as ſhe imagined, juſtified her ſuſpitions;
for the Gentleman did not, as ſhe expected, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chooſe out the choice bits to preſent her with
them, but took as much care too to pleaſure
the reſt, and did it with a pretty grace, that
charm'd the company, and made poor <hi>Zelotide</hi>
run deſperate; and this was the reaſon why they
ſate not long at Table, for our jealous Lady being
one of the moſt conſiderable among them, roſe
up firſt, and obliged all the reſt to follow her.
They walked for ſome ſmall time in the Garden,
and then all the company retired. <hi>Lycidas</hi>
mann'd <hi>Zelotide</hi> home, and by the way, beg'd
of her moſt vehemently, the permiſſion to wait
upon her Ladyſhip ſometimes, which ſhe moſt
courteouſly obliged him with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100546:19"/>
They both parted very well ſatisfied with one
another, and thought every hour an age till
they met again. <hi>Zelotide</hi> was over joyed at her
Conqueſt, and perſwaded her ſelf, that now ſhe
had triumphed over the reſt of the Ladies; and
<hi>Lycidas</hi> was no leſs pleaſed to have begun his
Female-acquaintance, with the moſt handſome
and conſiderable Lady of the Town, and being
yet ignorant of <hi>Zelotides</hi> ill humour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
ſhe was no cruel Lady, he aſſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that her Husband being now at <hi>Paris</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome important buſineſs, his Love would
find no oppoſition.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>He thought he now might own his Love,</l>
                  <l>And that the charming Dame</l>
                  <l>Could not ſo cruel or inhumane prove</l>
                  <l>As to condemn his Flame.</l>
                  <l>Her Vertue and her Honour were</l>
                  <l>The only enemies his Love could fear,</l>
                  <l>For her ſweet Air, proclaim'd her not ſevere.</l>
                  <l>He thought thoſe fooliſh Oppoſites, his Love</l>
                  <l>Might well without a Miracle remove,</l>
               </lg>
               <p>In a word, Sir, he promiſed himſelf all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
imaginable from his new Gallantry, and
never dreamed of thoſe troubles it would ingage
him in; on the morrow he put on the moſt
proper and becoming Cloaths he had, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
with impatience, the hour when he might
ſee the Ladies; Well, at laſt it came, though
to his thinking, moſt curſed ſlowly; and the
Gallant goes to my Lady <hi>Zelotides,</hi> where he
found her, in his judgement, a thouſand times
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100546:20"/>
more handſome then ever ſhe was before, either
at Church or the Garden; and ſhe truly had
done all ſhe could to ſet her ſelf off.</p>
               <p>There were two Couſins of hers with her at
that time, of which the name of the one was
<hi>Melite,</hi> and the other <hi>Cleonia:</hi> both of them
young, both handſome, and both of the moſt
pleaſant and gay humour, that ever you met
with. Theſe three amiable perſons were very
familiar, and ſcarce ever out of one anothers
company. <hi>Lycidas</hi> that had naturally a very brisk
wit, and made the beſt uſe of it he could in all
Ladies company he came into, and a pretty kind
of inſinuation, was immediately received into
this handſome Troop, and judg'd a very fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for their amorous commerce, and one that
they might talk too without ceremony; ſo that
<hi>Zelotide</hi> would not any longer conceal her ſelf,
but ſpoke to him in the name of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
either this, or much like it.</p>
               <p>IF we may credit all your proteſtations, Sir, we
may well perſwade our ſelves, that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
is not diſagreeable to you, and that whilſt you
ſtay in Town, we ſhall ſomething oblige you in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of thoſe viſits you make us. It is our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
therefore to oblige you thus, and we receive
you into our ſociety, if you think your ſelf capable
to perform ſome certain conditions, without which,
you ſhall never come among us. It is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Sir, that in that little time you have ſeen us,
you have made a very advantageous judgement of
the merits of my Couſins, and I dare aſſume the
vanity to tell you, that no Ladies in Town ought
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100546:20"/>
to be preferred to us, ſo that the Law we preſcribe
you, cannot juſtly ſeem too rigid and intolerable; to
ſee no Lady, and admire or love any thing out of
Breeches, but us; you have got a very inconſtant
mind with you, and I ſhrowdly ſuſpect you for a fickle
perſon, and one fit to abuſe all the Women you meet
with: your amorous lies and pretty perjuries, I'faith
Sir, I muſt tell you our reſolution; either renounce
this humour, or our ſociety, for they are incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
there are indeed in Town, ſome things in Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats
that will admit of your Courtly wenching
actions, but faith Sir, we ſhall not; we are too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of our own worth and excellence, to come in
ſharers with perſons ſo much below us, and we muſt
have you wholly ours, or not at all. Go, Sir, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
your ſelf, and ſee whither you can endure to
keep us company upon theſe conditions; and I dare
aſſure you, that if you can, you will not repent of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> did not forget one word of this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,
and though it had been longer, his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
would not have been the leſs. So ſtrange
a ſurprize, as this diſcourſe muſt needs put him
into, made him ſtand mute and immoveable,
and he was aſtoniſhed to hear them make him
ſuch a Declaration at the firſt viſit. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
when he ſaw <hi>Zelotide</hi> had ended her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,
I made her an anſwer agreeable to her
wiſhes; and though he had never been reduced
to ſuch hard terms before, as to ſee but three
Ladies in a whole Town, he ſwore the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were too reaſonable and obliging to be
refuſed; and though they had not engaged him
to them, he ſhould have followed them out of
his own inclination: And to confirm all this, he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100546:21"/>
vow'd and proteſted, that they, though but
three of them, were worth all he had ever ſeen
before, and that any one of them were enough
to make a moſt conſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lover of the moſt fickle
Man in Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zelotide</hi> was very well ſatisfy'd with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
and infinitely pleaſed for ſome few
days, to ſee him moſt regularly obſerve his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
And <hi>Lycidas</hi> had really not yet ſeen any
Lady, but theſe three fair ones. But <hi>Zelotyde</hi>
for all this Exceſs of fidelity in him, was not
yet contented, for ſeeing he viſited her Couſins
almoſt as often as her, ſhe was extreamly vexed
that ſhe had not bin more preciſe in her Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and ſhe became as jealous of her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,
as the reſt of the Ladies; but ſhe could not
now civilly forbid him her Couſins Lodgings;
for being bound to them in a very ſtrict kind of
friendſhip, ſhe very often went to ſee them,
and was glad to ſee her <hi>Lycidas</hi> there. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
too, had he only viſited her, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> would be
taken notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and her reputation might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

that it was an inconvenience ſhe could not
poſſibly avoid; and that ſhe was engaged upon
all conſiderations, to let the ſtranger viſit <hi>Milite</hi>
and <hi>Cleonia;</hi> but obſerving that the former of
them had ſome affection for him, and was very
well diſpoſed to rob her of her Gallant, and

                  <l>And the kind Lady was his Conqueror.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Being hurried on by this fear of hers, which
was but too well grounded, ſhe reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
her Couſins Favours, and make ſure of her
Lover, that ſeemed yet in ſuſpence what to fix
upon; ſo that having very happily found an
opportunity to ſpeak to him in private, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
her thoughts to him, with all the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that ſhe could; <hi>Lycidas</hi> promiſed her moſt
faithfully his eternal Fidelity, and for ſome time
afterwards, they lived in a very good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
one of another; he often viſited the
two Couſins, but with ſuch caution, that
the jealous was out of the world to ſee it. All
was very well for ſome days among them, but
<hi>Lycidas</hi> muſt have his ſwing again, and you might
confine Fire with leſs difficulty, then his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Inconſtancy; he had not ſo narrow a Soul
as to bound his happineſs, and he is juſt of ſuch
a humour as I ſhall tell you now.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Not all the Beauties in the world could tye</l>
                  <l>His Soul to make it keep a twelve hours conſtancy</l>
                  <l>Free as the Mountain-winds he roves,</l>
                  <l>Both when he's lov'd, and when he loves.</l>
                  <l>Though Ladies cruel are</l>
                  <l>He ſtill loves one without deſpair,</l>
                  <l>Nay ſometimes he</l>
                  <l>Quits Favours for their petty cruelty,</l>
                  <l>And rather had be ſcorn'd, then loſe his Liberty.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100546:22"/>
Though <hi>Zelotide</hi> was indoubtedly the hand
ſomeſt Lady of the three, and perhaps of all the
Town too; <hi>Melite</hi> begun to pleaſe him better
then ſhe did; her Soul was more mild and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and he imagined he ſhould endure a more
eaſie ſlavery under her, then the former, ſo that
he reſolved to turn unfaithful to <hi>Zelotide;</hi> and
feeing that it was very difficult for him to be ſo,
both becauſe the two Ladies were almoſt always
together, and becauſe <hi>Zelotide</hi> was very happy
at diſcoveries, he reſolved to make uſe of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
and cheat her for all her jealouſie to her
face; that is, to be her ſervant in appearance,
but to devote himſelf really to the young and
pretty <hi>Melite.</hi> He found his loving fair one of
ſuch a diſpoſition, as very much advanced the
plot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this good Good Couſin of <hi>Zelotide</hi> made
no conſcience to cheat her. In ſuch concerns of
Gallantry as theſe are, I can aſſure your Royal
Highneſs, that there are not many Women in
<hi>France</hi> that ſtickle for their faithfulneſs.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>She that would count it a damn'd Sin,</l>
                  <l>To ſteal a Ribbon, nay a Pin</l>
                  <l>From a meer ſtranger, would not make</l>
                  <l>A ſcruple to partake</l>
                  <l>Of her fair Siſters deareſt victories,</l>
                  <l>And make her Siſters ſhare her prize.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And truly <hi>Melite</hi> was no more ſcrupulous then
another, and ſhe was overjoyed that ſhe could
rob her Couſin ſo neatly, ſhe never refus'd <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi>
and after by a thouſand amorous Oaths,
that the Courtly Gallant was never ſparing of,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100546:22"/>
he had perſwaded her, that ſhe was the only
perſon in the world that he moſt dearly affected,
ſhe very frankly confeſſed to him, that ſhe had
ſomething of Love for him too.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And by a certain pretty method did</l>
                  <l>Diſcover, though ſhe ſeem'd to wiſh it hid,</l>
                  <l>Her unfain'd Love with ſuch a ſweet addreſs,</l>
                  <l>And ſuch a ſprightly wit</l>
                  <l>That none could doubt of it.</l>
                  <l>You'd ſwear 'twas true, nor than ſhe made it leſs.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Now they are both in a perfect union, and both
agreed to mannage the buſineſs with all the Art
they can; but to what purpoſe pray? as if any
thing could be hid from the eyes of Jealouſie.
Though <hi>Lycidas</hi> viſited <hi>Zelotyde</hi> daily, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated
the Lover as well as could be; for all his
Artifice, ſhe ſmelt out his Infidelity, both by the
coolneſs of his Addreſſes, and that want of care
he took to pleaſe her: whereupon, ſhe ſearch'd
out the cauſe of it, and was not long before ſhe
lighted on it; ſhe turned ſpie over all their
actions.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>She read it in their Words and Eies</l>
                  <l>And ſtill confirm'd her Jealouſies</l>
                  <l>By ſomething in it ſelf indifferent,</l>
                  <l>Which ſhe ſtill wreſted to a bad intent,</l>
                  <l>She made it am'rous what e're 'twas meant.</l>
                  <l>Her eye ſtill track'd 'em out</l>
                  <l>(Too faithful Scout)</l>
                  <l>And in two days ſo much of 'em did ſee,</l>
                  <l>She grew more certain then ſhe wiſh'd to be.</l>
               </lg>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100546:23"/>
               <p>Immediately hereupon, ſhe reſolves to break
with her Couſin, what ever ſtir might come of
it; but upon better conſideration, ſhe judged
it better to diſſemble her reſentments, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to retrieve her <hi>Lycidas,</hi> by telling him of
his Ingratitude, and the injuſtice of his change.</p>
               <p>One evening, when ſhe was walking alone
with him in a Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where all the beauties ſpend
ſome part of the night in the Spring time, ſhe
thought ſhe had now a good opportunity to tell
him of his falſhood; <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who thought he
could always abuſe her into any opinion he
would, began to cajol her as he uſe to do, and
to aſſure her of his Love and Paſſion, a hundred
manner of ways: but <hi>Zelotyde</hi> anſwered all his
proteſtations with raillery, why all this to me, Sir,
ſaid ſhe, you miſtake your ſelf ſure, and think you
are with <hi>Melite;</hi> have you forgot who I am, and
dare you be thus prodigal of your kindneſſes in
the abſence of your Miſtriſs; I vow, Sir, ſhould
ſhe come to know of this, I am confident ſhe'd
ſeverely puniſh you. You ſurprize me Madam,
anſwered <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and I can't tell what to make
of this, what the Devil do you mean it for, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or raillery? You cannot without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
ſuſpect me of any Intelligence with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite.</hi>
'Tis true, ſhe is very amiable, but it is alſo
infallibly true, that ſince I had the happineſs to
love you, I never ſo much as thought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful:
I have ſeen your Kinſwoman, I avow
it, and have made her ſome viſits, but you may
bepleaſed to remember, that I did all this by your
order; and I dare ſafely ſwear upon a Book, that
were it not for the pleaſure I took in obeying
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100546:23"/>
your Commands, I ſhould never have endured to
keep one company, that I ſo little care for, and
which, it is very probable, cares as little for
me.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>If you had heard him ſwear,</l>
                  <l>You'd ſwear he faithful were,</l>
                  <l>For ſtill he talk'd of Love and Faithfulneſs,</l>
                  <l>He talk'd of nothing more, and thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs.</l>
                  <l>And did all this with ſuch a ſweet addreſs,</l>
                  <l>That none e're yet us'd more ſincerity,</l>
                  <l>To clear a Truth, then he to prove a Lie.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But for all this, all his Rhetorick could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> for when he ſtill perſiſted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelf, becauſe ſhe had commanded him
to viſit her Kinſwomen, ſhe interrupted him
with a great tranſport of fury; what ingrateful
Man, did I Command you to betray me, and
turn unfaithful? and did you in purſuance of my
command hecome a Servant, to that young
brisk Jade, and leave me for a perſon in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
inferior to me? and do you take me for
ſo eaſie a fool as to believe all this? no, baſe
Man, I do not, I ſhall never believe it; what
did you two when you were alone together, if
you muſt needs ſhew your Love before me:
That affected coldneſs which you ſeem to have
for one another, and then ſome cunning kind of
looks that ſcape you in ſpite of all your affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
your words of two meanings, that are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood by you and your Chronie, and
then that care you always take to have your
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100546:24"/>
Garnitures of the ſame colour, to have all the
new Plays and Romances continually from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
to pleaſure your Lady, your hugging the
hornify'd Gentleman, and your inſinuating your
ſelves into his Love and Favour; your leaving
Money after Play, upon the Board, to get the
Servants your Creatures, your bringing alway
Sugar-plums in your pocket for the Paraqueto,
and above all, your petty quarrels when people
are by, and ſecret ſigns with your Feet, when
you think no body takes notice of them; Theſe
Mr. Infidel, and a hundred things more, which I
am aſhamed to ſpeak of, will not permit me to
doubt of your perfidiouſneſs. Go, for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Man, as you are, that do not deſerve
to be ſpoke to, though in reproaches and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
nor be honoured with a reproof, I ſhould,
continued ſhe, have revenged my ſelf on my
unfaithful Couſin; Did I not perſwade my ſelf,
that you would ſave me trouble of doing it,
and ſhe would no longer keep you faithful then
I have done; I too well am acquainted with your
inconſtancy, and it was my unhappineſs I knew
it not ſooner, and was kept too long in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that Favours and Obligations diſpleaſe
you, and that they are the ready means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
your affections.</p>
               <p>Then was a great deal of rage in all this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
of <hi>Zelotide's,</hi> but her laſt words had
ſomething more of ſweetneſs then fury, ſo that
they might well have touch'd with pity, a harder
heart than <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s, and he was truly very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of her reproaches.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100546:24"/>
               <lg>
                  <l>He grew at her complaint compaſſionate,</l>
                  <l>And his inconſtancy begun to hate.</l>
                  <l>But his good ſoul, to give the Devil his due,</l>
                  <l>With ſuch compaſſion had not long to do.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Yet he ſtill did all he could to prove, that her
ſuſpicions were injuſt and groundleſs, and that
ſhe ought not to reſt ſatify'd with appearances.
But ſeeing hit obſtinate denials the more
enraged her, he at laſt, avow'd his infidelity,
and begged his pardon in the moſt moving
words imaginable; he forgot not Oaths, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
her, that he would never again viſit <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
and promiſed her moſt faithfully, to live ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
according to her preſcriptions; Though
<hi>Zelotide</hi> had no reaſon to believe his oaths any
longer, ſhe deſired the truth of them ſo much,
that ſhe muſt abuſe her ſelf into an opinion of
his fidelity once again.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>His wit could now ſupply no juſt excuſe</l>
                  <l>To juſtify his damn'd abuſe.</l>
                  <l>But they that do the guilty perſon love,</l>
                  <l>The worſt excuſe do willingly approve.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And ſo ſhe pardoned them, Sir, and they
went out of the Garden in very good terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
But the unfortunate <hi>Zelotide,</hi> that thought
ſhe had wrought miracles by her diſcourſe, and
obliged <hi>Lycidas</hi> to a perpetual fidelity, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly
given ſubject for an Intrigue, that ſince
has plagued her ſufficiently.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100546:25"/>
               <p>The Cavalier, <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s friend, and firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
was one that had no great buſineſs
to imploy himſelf in, and therefore he made it
his buſineſs to ſeek it out; he was continually
running from place to place, and where ever he
came, ſetting all he met with together by the
ears; He was in a word, one of thoſe Creatures
we call Fopps, Buſie-bodies, contriving-Aſſes,
&amp;c. Fools that neither love themſelves nor any
body elſe; Confounded Coxcombs that would
willingly undo themſelves, might they bury an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in their ruines.</p>
               <p>This vertuous Gentleman was very often with
a company of Ladies, that could not endure our
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> of which, the moſt conſiderable, was
<hi>Cephiſa,</hi> ſome important. Caſe at Law, or ſome
conteſt at a meeting about their preeminence
(for truly I was not certainly informed of it) had
raiſed an enmity between their Families, whence
this mortal hatred was tranſmitted to our two
fair ones. The quarrel had been decided for
ſome months before by their Friends, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and ſomething like a reconciliation was
made between them; but for all their peaceable
friends could do in it, ſomething of the old
grudge remained yet, which all the Town was
very ſenſible of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our Cavalier therefore, that
was mighty great with this Troop of Ladies was
by chance in the Garden, when <hi>Lycidas</hi> led in
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> and ſeeing them alone by themſelves,
was infinitely overjoyed at ſo happy an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to ſearch out what intelligence was betwixt
them, which he ſhrowdly ſuſpected: To which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100546:25"/>
purpoſe he hid himſelf among the Trees of a
blind Ally, not far from that in which our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
entertained his <hi>Zelotide,</hi> whence without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perceived, he heard the greateſt part of the
Ladies complaints, and diſcovered, as faith he
well might, that ſhe was paſſionately in love
with <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and that more then all this, ſhe
was diveliſh jealous of him. Never was any
perſon more ſatisfied at the beſt news in the
world, then he at this. He was already framing
ten thouſand malicious deſignes againſt the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pair, and promiſed himſelf as much diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
as he could wiſh from ſo pleaſant an
adventure. He was not long, e're he diſcovered
it to <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> and if my intelligence deceive me
not, it was on the very next morning. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Lady is as hugely pleaſed with it, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
as well as the Cavalier, to draw no ſmall
advantage from ſo welcome a diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Having laught their Bellies full, together, and
conſulted what they ought to do in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture;
they at laſt concluded, that if <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi>
was ſo jealous of her own Couſin, ſhe would
be abominably jealous of another Lady, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if that Lady were her enemy; and that
therefore, if they could perſwade <hi>Lycidas</hi> to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
their company, <hi>Zelotide</hi> would even die with
deſpite, but before her departure, ſhe would
be guilty of ſome pretty extravagancies, which
would give them matter enough to laugh at it.</p>
               <p>After theſe grave determinations, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
engaged to bring <hi>Lycidas</hi> to give her a
viſit, and ſhe on her part very confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100546:26"/>
miſed him, that ſuppoſing he brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he ſhould be made to come again.</p>
               <p>Thus were they plotting, Sir, againſt the poor
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> that never dreamed of thoſe miſeries
they deſigned her, whilſt ſhe poor Lady enjoyed
all the happineſs ſhe could wiſh for, for <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
forbore to ſee <hi>Melite,</hi> and had performed
all he was bound to, at leaſt, in her opinion he
had. But faith, Sir, to tell you the plain truth,
he was half a weary of <hi>Zelotides</hi> Tyranny, and
without queſtion, he had not remained faithful
ſo long as he did, had not Fear more then Love
perſwaded him to't, for now he was no longer
ignorant of her Fury and Jealouſie, and feared
them too, no leſs, then he loved and admired
her Beauty.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The ſweets of Love</l>
                  <l>He ſtill deſir'd to prove,</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But then thoſe ſweets of Love to him would be
Inſipid, when for them he loſt his liberty.</p>
               <p>He of the humour he then was, had rather
enjoy the liberty to gaze on all the Ladies
in the
world, without any other advantage, then that
of ſubſcribing himſelf their ſervant, then to be
reduced to thoſe hard terms of ſeeing but one,
though ſhe loved and favoured him, as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth would come together. And it
was this inclination of his, that rendred <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide's</hi>
Empire ſo odious to him, but he could
not well diſingage himſelf; and faith, though
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100546:26"/>
he was a Soldier, I dare ſwear he durſt not: He
knew Madam <hi>Zelotide</hi> and her confounded hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
well enough, to know what treatment
he muſt expect of her if he forſook her; and
it was not improbable, that her kindred that were
very conſiderable in the Town, would very much
reſent his ill uſage of the Lady, ſhould the ſecret
ever be diſcovered, as ſhe was like enough to
do it. So that he was engaged to viſit no other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the Town, and almoſt reſolved too, and
that as ſeriouſly as one of his humour could, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to give her any more reaſon to be jealous
of him, But, faith, it was no hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
his reſolutions; and truly our Cavalier,
though no incomparable Orator, had not much
to do to perſwade him to go ſee the fair <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> knew very well the preſent ſtate of the
Town, and by conſequence could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of that averſion <hi>Zelotide</hi> had for her, nor
what his Miſ's ſentiment would be of this viſit;
and truly this conſideration made him for ſome
few minutes, reſiſt the temptation, when the
Gentleman perſwaded him, but when he was
ſomething urged to it, both becauſe he was her
neighbor, and thereupon at leaſt ingaged to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
her, and for ſome other petty reaſons, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
as the firſt, he conſented to it, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that <hi>Zelotide</hi> might never know of it,</p>
               <p>Being now fully perſwaded, the Cavalier leads
him to ſee <hi>Cephiſa;</hi> ſhe was a pretty young gay
Creature, ſo that any one of her many rare Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
would be ſufficient to have engaged a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100546:27"/>
heart then <hi>Lycidas's;</hi> and telling you this, I
need not tell you that our Gallant grew deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
in love with her, that is, as deſperately
in love as he could be. He preſently forgot his
jealous Lady, and doing as he uſed to do, had
not the patience to delay his amorous Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
until the next viſit.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>He had ſtill ready made.</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cephiſa</hi> now had got him at the point ſhe
wiſhed, and therefore to keep him there, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his addreſſes moſt obligingly, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
his Declaration, with all the civility ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
ſo that when he left her, he was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as much as ſhe could wiſh him, and was now
fully reſolved to viſit her as often as poſſibly he
could.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:100546:27"/>
               <p>As ſoon as he was got home, he fell a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what a horrid trouble he ſhould be
brought into, if <hi>Zelotide,</hi> ſhould chance to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his new engagement; but being very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to flatter himſelf, he thought, though he had
but little reaſon to do ſo; that <hi>Cephiſa</hi> living in a
by-corner of the Town, and never ſpeaking to
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> the buſineſs might very well be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his troubleſome jealous Lady.</p>
               <p>And to effect his deſign, he parted his viſits
betwixt his two Miſtreſſes, with all the care ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
and truly his diligence was very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.
For <hi>Cephiſa</hi> and the ill-natured Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
would not have his new paſſion talked of,
till it was out of poſſibility to be deſtroyed; and
that <hi>Zelotide</hi> might be the more enraged, when
ſhe knew how long <hi>Lycidas</hi> had been unfaithful
to her. Our pretty jealous Creature therefore
knew nothing of his viſits for a week or two,
but ſhe had obſerved ſomething however, that
began to diſquiet her; and that ſhe might look
to't in time, ſhe reſolved to ſpeak to <hi>Lycidas</hi> of
it, when next ſhe ſaw him.</p>
               <p>On that very day that ſhe had taken this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
he failed not to wait upon her, and
their diſcourſe very happily chancing to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fidelity, he commended his, own to her
with all the vehemence imaginable, and ſwore
that ſtrict obedience he had rendred her, ſince
ſhe was pleaſed to forbid him the company of
<hi>Melite,</hi> was ſo uncommon, and admirable, that
ſhe was very much obliged to him for it: Yes,
Sir, anſwered ſhe, I muſt confeſs I cannot blame
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100546:28"/>
you for viſiting my Couſin, but for Heavens ſake
take heed you give me not a more juſt occaſion
to complain of you upon ſome other account.
I have perceived ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that makes me very
much ſuſpect your unfaithfulneſs; for Gods ſake
do not juſtifie my ſuſpitions and let it not be
true, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> affects <hi>Cephiſa</hi> You know I
hate her moſt mortally, and that I had rather you
ſhould wait on all the Ladies in the Town, then
that enemy of our Family. And know, Sir, it is
not without reaſon I tell you of her.</p>
               <p>On Sunday you ſaluted her at Church with
greater reſpect then I could have wiſhed, and
ſhe returned your reverence with an obliging
Air, and a look ſo paſſionate, that it plainly
witneſſed ſome intelligence betwixt you.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> I ſaw your Man and her Maid
together, in ſo familiar a conference, that I fear
the Maſter and Miſtriſs were concerned in
it.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday I was informed, though not from
you, Sir, you changed your Lodging near <hi>Cephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa's,</hi>
and that your Landlady had ſometimes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her, and was ſtill very often with her. This
Neighborhood, this Landlady, and this Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
between them, you muſt needs grant is
ſuſpicious.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> you pardoned a Soldier that
fled his Colours, at the Requeſt of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of my Enemy, though you had refuſed
before to pardon him, when all the Town en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100546:28"/>
On <hi>Thurſday</hi> when her Coach was over-turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you broke through the croud to help her,
though I am confident you were not ignorant,
that you would have very much obliged me,
had you let her die there.</p>
               <p>And yeſterday, I was told that you took her
Taylor and Shoomaker; and faith, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt
tell you, people think very ſtrangely of theſe
Taylors and Shoomakers, that work both for
Men as well as Women; there are thoſe will
ſwear they meddle with ſomething elſe beſides
their Trade; and making Shooes and Cloaths is
not all they are employed in: the Taylor eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
thoſe gentile Mechanicks, that can with
ſuch a dreſs, joyn Breeches and Peticoats.</p>
               <p>So that there is not one day all this week, that
I have not had juſt reaſon to ſuſpect you. For
to compleat the week, this morning I am very
credibly informed, that in company where you
were, you commended <hi>Cephiſa</hi> before all the
Ladies in the Town. And now, ſweet Sir, let
me aſſume the confidence to demand of you,
whither one can praiſe a Lady ſo extreamly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing her, or know her without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me; ſince I hate her unmercifully, and it is
the moſt ſenſible affront I can receive of any
friend of mine, to viſit her.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Zelotide</hi> had ended her Bill of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Lycidas</hi> did all he could to pacify her. He
proved to her that all her ſuſpitions were very
ſlightly grounded, and at laſt made no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to ſwear to her moſt Religiouſly, that, he
never went to ſee that Lady, nor never would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100546:29"/>
while he breathed. <hi>Zelotide</hi> was willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, but all his Rhetorick could not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
perſwade her, and undoubtedly your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs will not blame her incredulity, which
was at preſent moſt reaſonable. The poor jealous
Lady after a troubleſome night, gave order next
morning to her Lacquey, to go take a fit poſt
in a blind Allie before <hi>Cephiſas</hi> Gate, to ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being diſcovered, whether <hi>Lycidas</hi> entred
there or no.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The little fool might then have cur'd</l>
                  <l>Thoſe tortures ſhe endur'd</l>
                  <l>And by an inn'cent lie</l>
                  <l>Her reſt, her peace procur'd</l>
                  <l>And ſilenc'd her diſtracting jealouſie.</l>
                  <l>Thus diſobedience might his faith expreſs;</l>
                  <l>He'd ſerv'd her better had he obey'd her leſs.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>She was now aſſur'dly her too zealous Lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey,
that ſhe was abuſed, and-that her Lover
viſited her Enemy; ſhe longed to ſee him again-to
puniſh him for his miſdemeanors. But <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
not coming all next day to wait upon her,
ſeeing it was fair, and fit for a walk, ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed
towards the evening to turn ſcout her ſelf,
and go watch the unfaithful <hi>Lycidas;</hi> upon this
deſigne ſhe takes onely her Lacquey with her,
and under pretence of going to ſee a Woman,
that nurs'd a Child of hers, and that lived
in the Suburbs; where ſhe knew that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa</hi>
and all her company commonly walked,
ſhe ſtood Sentinel in the Houſe to ſee whether
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100546:29"/>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> were among them. But all her trouble,
that ſhe gave her ſelf, was to no purpoſe, for <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa</hi>
being ſomething indiſpoſed, went not out
that evening, and <hi>Zelotide</hi> was now benighted,
when ſhe returned homewards. As ſhe was going
through the ſtreet where <hi>Cephiſa</hi> lived, and was
got hard by the Gate, ſhe heard <hi>Lycidas</hi> his voice
not above ſix yards from her; whereupon ſhe
ſtopped to hearken what he ſaid, and was not
long e're ſhe heard him ſpeak to the Cavalier,
and promiſed him to ſtay for him at <hi>Cephiſa</hi>'s.
Being now an Ear-witneſs of his unfaithfulneſs,
ſhe thought on nothing, but following the dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
of her Anger and Jealouſie, ſhe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Lacquey to retire, and making uſe of the
favour of the night, ſhe entred the Gate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſcovery, and ſo got upon the Stair-caſe
where ſhe reſolved to expect <hi>Lycidas; Lycidas</hi>
having left the Cavalier, entred very briskly,
and never dreaming of the Ambuſcado that was
laid for him.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Spurr'd on by Love, away he run,</l>
                  <l>And up the Stairs he got as ſoon</l>
                  <l>In ſpite of night, as if he'd ſeen the Sun.</l>
                  <l>Deſire, ſweet ſweet deſire led on the way</l>
                  <l>Who could to ſeek a Miſtriſs, go aſtray?</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But your Royal Highneſs may very well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how ſurprized he was, when he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſtopped, and perceived he was in the
Arms of a Woman; he thought at firſt it had
been <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> who came out of roguery to fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100546:30"/>
him (for he never ſo much as thought of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotide</hi>)
and hereupon cryed out; <hi>Fair</hi> Cephiſa,
<hi>you thought to frighten me, and thought I ſhould
not know you; but your bright Eies have betrayed
you, and their light Madam, hath ſpoiled your plot
to keep your ſelf undiſcovered: and now faith, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I muſt have ſatisfaction for this malicious
deſigne upon me, and the place is ſo fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for my revenge, that I never deſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neiſs,
if I let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Had the croſs Lady but conſented to't,</l>
                  <l>He would have ſoon perform'd what e'r ſhe
pleas'd;</l>
                  <l>Had but the jealous Creature let him do't,</l>
                  <l>He had her Anger and her Rage,</l>
                  <l>Moſt manfully aſſwag'd.</l>
                  <l>Spite of her ſelf, he had her ſelf appeas'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But he was ſtrangely aſtoniſhed, when in ſtead
of that Courteſie, he expected, the unknown
Lady careſs'd him with all her natural weapons,;
Tooth and Nail ſhe was at it, and her Feet were
not idle neither. For anger had ſo tranſported
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> that at firſt ſhe had loſt the uſe of her
Speech, but faith Sir, ſhe retained the natural
faculty of biting, ſcratching, and kicking. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi>
was never ſo handſomely entertained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and in the midſt of his ſurprize, he could
not imagine whence proceeded all this obliging
Treatment; but at laſt he came to be informed
of it, by thoſe reproaches that <hi>Zelotide,</hi> after
ſhe had got her ſpeech again, moſt bitterly por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100546:30"/>
him with; <hi>Ingrateful Man, ſaid ſhe, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
wretch, doſt thou thus obſerve thy Oaths, thy
Vows, and Promiſes; yea, you ſwore to me with
all the impudence in the world, that you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
viſit</hi> Cephiſa, <hi>and yet I catch you here my
ſelf in the night time, and in ſuch a condition too,
that ſhows you are in no bad terms with her.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And ſtill purſuing her fierce rage,</l>
                  <l>Which the poor Gentleman could ne'r aſſwage,</l>
                  <l>Her Feet, her Nail, her Teeth again</l>
                  <l>Began to ſtorm amain,</l>
                  <l>She bit, ſhe ſcratch'd, ſhe flung,</l>
                  <l>While ſtill her Tongue</l>
                  <l>Such a damn'd peal rung,</l>
                  <l>That for its violence the ſtorm could ne'r be long</l>
                  <l>O had ſhe had a Ponyard in her hand</l>
                  <l>How ſhe'd a ſtab'd the faithleſs Gentleman;</l>
                  <l>He from her rage muſt needs have found his
death,</l>
                  <l>Though ſhe for grief next minute loſt her
breath.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>All that ever the poor <hi>Lycidas</hi> could do in this
conjuncture, was to make uſe of all the ſtrength
he had, to carry her away in his Arms, and
bear her by plain force into the ſtreet; for he
very wiſely conſidered, that <hi>Cephiſa</hi>'s Stair-caſe
was no very convenient place to make his recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
in with <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and that if this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
came to be known, then might, God knows
what come of it. But he could not carry her
away ſo ſuddainly, but <hi>Cephiſa</hi> heard the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100546:31"/>
noiſe, though ſhe knew not exactly what the
matter was, and the noiſe ceaſing on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
ſhe believed that ſome of the Houſhold
had been playing the fool together.</p>
               <p>At laſt <hi>Lycidas</hi> having got <hi>Zelotide</hi> into the
ſtreet, and given her his hand to lead her home,
he began to ſhow how imprudently ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
her ſelf; how that if her extravagance
had been known, ſhe would have given a very
ample ſubject for <hi>Cephiſa</hi> and the malicious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
to laugh at, nay, and all the Town too, and
that hence-forward ſhe ought to take a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
care of her Honour and Reputation. Take thou
then a greater care of it, replyed the poor Lady
weeping; <hi>Cruel Man! ſince thou knoweſt to what
tranſports thy Love carries me, oughteſt thou to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
me to all occaſions of them? and ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not
you out of gratitude and acknowledgement, to ceaſe
to viſit that Woman, that I hate above all the
world, and which you ought to hate too, had you
any love or reſpect for</hi> Zelotide?</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus to fierce rage ſucceeds ſoft tenderneſs,</l>
                  <l>And a wiſe Lover can make uſe of this.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And ſo did our <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who feeing his <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi>
ſomething pacified, hoped he might wholly
pacify her; ſo that having walked along for
ſome time, and now brought her almoſt home,
he deſired her to wipe away her Tears, and to
put her ſelf in order as well as ſhe could leſt the
Houſe might take notice; And then he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her, that as ſoon as ſhe was got home, he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100546:31"/>
would juſtify himſelf better then ſhe thought
'twas poſſible he could; nay, he engaged he
would bring her ſuch reaſons, as ſhould abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
ſatisfy her; and as ſoon as they were got
into the houſe, both of them ſeating themſelves
on a Couch together, and out of all hearing, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi>
ſpoke either this, or ſomething like it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Muſt confeſs, Madam, I promiſed you never
to viſit <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> nor was I ignorant of your
averſion for that Lady, nor how much I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
you, ſhould I admit of any engagement with
your enemy; yet after all this my frank confeſſion
of thoſe faults you charge me with, be pleaſed but to
conſider how I committed the crime, and you will be
enforced to confeſs it was not ſo great as you would
pleaſe to make it. The firſt viſit I made Cephiſa,
I was abſolutely neceſſitated to. You remember,
Madam, that day the Coach was overturned, I
happened to be ſo nigh the place, that civility enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me to ſuccor the Lady; and then it was, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that <hi>I</hi> was conſtrained to lead her home; on the
morrow ſhe ſent her Husband to return me thanks
for my civility, ſo that I ſhould have been the meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Clown in nature, had I not waited upon her.
About two or three days after, <hi>I</hi> went to acquit
my ſelf of this obligation, and there I met a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
at Cards, where they would needs make me a
Gameſter; and then having loſt all my Money, not to
abuſe you, Madam, it was that onely conſideration
drew me thither, as Gameſters moſt commonly do all
they can to ſave themſelves. It is true, Madam, I
never made you acquainted with it, and I was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100546:32"/>
it might diſpleaſe you, ſhould you come to know of
it; and I cannot deny neither, ſince you will know all,
that ſometimes when I was at <hi>Cephiſa's,</hi> I never
playd neither, but be pleaſed to know then, it was
becauſe I found no convenient company; and you
know very will, Madam, ſince your Husbands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Town, I cannot have the liberty to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you ſo often as I could wiſh, ſo that not knowing
whither to go, I have ſometimes gone thither; this
Houſe of <hi>Cephiſa's</hi> is not far from my Lodging,
ſo that I have ſpent ſome hours there, more for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
or convenience, then for any inclination: I have
been there ſometimes after dinner, but faith; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
it was becauſe I knew not how to ſpend my
time elſewhere, and ſometimes a croſs humour of mine
hath kept me there, only out of deſign to vex the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and the Cavalier, for I ſaw my preſence gave
reſtraint to their company, ſo that, Madam, did
you but know how I carry my ſelf there, hating
<hi>Caphiſa</hi> as much as you can for the hear of you;
you would be very well ſatisfied at thoſe viſits I
render her: ſometimes I compliment her, but it is
after ſo mad a ſtrain, that neither ſhe, nor I my
ſelf underſtand a word of it: and after all theſe
obliging fooleries for divertiſement, I pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with her, and rip up all her faults to her face;
in a word, Madam, I treat her like a perſon that
you hate.</p>
               <p>I believe, Sir, theſe excuſes will not ſeem very
plauſible, and it is poſſible, too long too, to be
ſpoke to an impatient Lady without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but <hi>Zelotide</hi> I can aſſure you, heard them
moſt attentively, and highly approved them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100546:32"/>
the fear ſhe conceived of loſing <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and
the joy ſhe reſented to ſee him excuſe himſelf,
with ſo much ſubmiſſion, after ſuch an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when ſhe might reaſonably expect he would
have broke with her, appeaſed her inſtantly,
nay and made her repent too of her raſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings:
ſhe promiſed therefore <hi>Lycidas</hi> to
love him as much as ever, upon condition he
would no more ſee <hi>Cephiſa. Lycidas</hi> told her,
he could not ſo ſoon leave off ſeeing her, leſt it
might occaſion ſome ſtrange reports in the
Town, and make people ſuſpect them; but he
aſſured her, the next time he played there, he
would raiſe ſome quarrel, that he might have
ſome pretence for his retreat thence. <hi>Zelotide</hi>
was very well ſatisfied with his deſign.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>So the two Lovers march'd along,</l>
                  <l>And o're and o're</l>
                  <l>They vow'd and ſwore</l>
                  <l>They never more</l>
                  <l>Would their true Love and ſweet contentment wrong.</l>
                  <l>The peace thus formally concluded was,</l>
                  <l>When <hi>Zelotide</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>The more to ſtrengthen it, thought good</l>
                  <l>To Sign the Treaty with their Blood.</l>
                  <l>They now redoubled all their kindneſſes,</l>
                  <l>And their true love more firmly to expreſs;</l>
                  <l>Did with true Fleſh and Blood,</l>
                  <l>What luſty Lovers do, and whiners wiſh they cou'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>When <hi>Lycidas</hi> promiſed <hi>Zelotide</hi> to diſingage
himſelfe from <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> he really intended it. But
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100546:33"/>
he no ſooner ſaw that lovely Lady, but he grew
conſcious of his diſability to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>For when he ſaw the pretty Dame again,</l>
                  <l>His Faith recoil'd,</l>
                  <l>His Loyalty was baſely foil'd,</l>
                  <l>Nor could he any more his word maintain,</l>
                  <l>And if he ſaw her once, he muſt again.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And beſides all this, he had not yet obtained
the fruition of his wiſhes, and a kiſs, and the like,
had been all he had yet received of her, ſo that
reſolving not to loſe all that trouble he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ingaged in, he purſued his viſits; the jealous
Lady was very well acquainted with them, but
when ever ſhe ſpoke of them to <hi>Lycidas,</hi> he told
her he was juſt upon the point to leave her, and
that he had not yet found any occaſion to ſtart a
quarrel, as he told her he would.</p>
               <p>That plotting Fop the Cavalier did not yet
know a word of what had paſt upon the Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
ſo that he ſuffered a very conſiderable loſs
in it, for had he come to know ſo pleaſant an
adventure, that malice of his that was ſo natural
to him, had drawn very fine advantages thence,
and that talkative humour of his, would have been
extreamly gratified in publiſhing the ſecret with
all the expedition imaginable. But though he
miſſed of this, he hit upon one far better, and
he was continually hammering ſomething to
diſturb the beſt friends he had in the world,
he lighted on a moſt curſed Intrigue that plagued
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100546:33"/>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Zelotide</hi> no leſs, then it ſatisfied the
Author and <hi>Cephiſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One evening, that was one of the moſt ſerene
and pleaſant that ever had been ſeen, and that
invited all the Town to walk Abroad in ſo ſweet
a ſeaſon; all the handſome Creatures in the
Town, went abroad to take the Air in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
I told you of before. <hi>Lycidas</hi> led <hi>Zelotide</hi>
thither too, where they had not taken above
three or four turns, before the Cavalier and
<hi>Cephiſa</hi> diſcovered them, and thinking they had
a moſt happy opportunity to practice a diveliſh
project of theirs, that they had been plotting for
ſome time before, they reſolved to put it in pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice.
The Gentleman projector would needs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
it himſelf, who meeting a Lacquey of a
Friend of his, gave him inductions what he had
to do, and to encourage him to perform his part
with the greater willingneſs, gave him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
the Lacquey was very willing to ſerve
him, and took the Letter that the Cavalier had
provided before hand, and following the orders
had been given him, he went to ſeek out <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
and having found him without any great
difficulty, he delivered him the Letter in <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide's</hi>
company, and told him a Lady that he
knew not, had commanded him to give him it.
The young Rogue ſtaid not long enough to be
asked many queſtions, but immediately diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
(if I can properly ſay one diſappears in
the night, when there is almoſt no appearing)
The Letter produced moſt effectually what it
was deſigned for. For <hi>Zelotide</hi> conſidering how
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100546:34"/>
it was delivered; ſuſpected ſome new
engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thought <hi>Lycidas</hi> was got again at his
infidelity.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now for ſome Treaſon <hi>Lycidas</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Suſpected was.</l>
                  <l>On the leaſt ſubject ſhe</l>
                  <l>Reviv'd her Jealouſie.</l>
                  <l>Whilſt her curſt humour did her ſoul inſpire,</l>
                  <l>From the leaſt ſpark, ſhe'd ſtrait advance a fire.</l>
                  <l>Her rage muſt ſtill oppoſe what e'r withſtood,</l>
                  <l>And what you would not have her ſee, ſhe wou'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>It was for this reaſon that ſhe preſently ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Letter out of <hi>Lycidas's</hi> hands, and was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolved to read it: the two ſpies that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them at ſome diſtance, and were a preparing
themſelves to laugh their guts out, were not at
all deceived in their expectation. They heard
<hi>Zelotide</hi> very urgent with <hi>Lycidas</hi> to go
out of
the Garden, to ſee for a Light to read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
while that poor Lover was diſſwading her
to no purpoſe. For though he was wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
whence the Billet came, he was fearful there
might be ſomething in it, that her jealouſie might
make ſome ill interpretation of, and for this
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he did all he could to keep her in the Garden,
and uſed all the wit he was maſter of to get the
Letter from her. But his endeavors proved
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsleſs,
and <hi>Zelotide</hi> ſpying a Light in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners,
ſhe forced <hi>Lycidas</hi> thither with her. The
poor Gentleman ſo hung an Arſe, you might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
perceive, with what regret he went forward,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100546:34"/>
and the jealous Lady trooped along with ſuch
precipitation, that by her pace you might ſee her
impatience. <hi>Cephiſa</hi> and the Cavalier
followed
them undiſcovered, and took a very convenient
poſt under a little blind window of a ground-Chamber,
whence they might eaſily ſee without
diſcovery, and hear through the Glaſs all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
between the Lovers. The impatient Creature
was no ſooner got nigh a Lamp, that gave light to
all the little houſe, but ſhe examined the Seal of
the Letter, but not knowing it ſhe at laſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, but faith, drew as little ſatisfaction from
that, as ſhe had from the Seal before; ſhe found
nothing there but ſtrange conjuring kind of
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
that ſhe underſtood not one tittle of;
and it is very probable no body elſe. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to tell you what an exceſs of grief and
deſpite, ſhe reſented at ſo ſtrange a
rencounter.
She was preſently perſwaded that theſe were
ſome Cyphers or other that <hi>Lycidas</hi>
underſtood,
and that without queſtion, this Billet invited him
to ſome Aſſignation with ſome new
Miſtriſs of
his. Hereupon ſhe begs of him, ſhe threatens
him, ſhe perſecutes him to diſcover this
My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.
But the Divel was in him if he did, for he
underſtood no more of it, then ſhe did, and all
he could do, was to ſwear he could not deviſe
the meaning of it, that without doubt the
Lacquey and miſtaken him for ſome body elſe,
and delivered the Letter to a falſe perſon. All this
was true, he told her, for the Cavalier had ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over the Paper with thoſe Arabian Pothooks,
onely to diſtract the poor <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and expoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100546:35"/>
her ridiculous jealouſie and extravagance: But
<hi>Lycydas</hi> might ſwear long enough before ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him; ſhe ſtill reſted perſwaded ſhe was
betrayed again by the unfaithful <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and
took this Letter for an undoubted proof of it.
Being grown now almoſt deſperate, and never
hoping to get the ſecret out of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſhe
makes uſe of her laſt effects of Goodneſs, of
Rage, and all the Eloquence they had inſpired
her with.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nay my dear <hi>Lycidas</hi> I prethee tell.</l>
                  <l>I'faith you muſt, and all ſhall ſtrait be well,</l>
                  <l>I'le gently pardon my dear Infidel.</l>

                  <l>Though I the torments of a Rival prove,</l>

                  <l>I'le think ſome handſomer</l>

               <p>But ſeeing ſhe'd prevail'd nothing by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
ſhe deſcended to her Rage and Fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
which it will be extreamly difficult to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
to your Royal Highneſs.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100546:35"/>
               <lg>
                  <l>Cruel inhumane Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſaid,</l>

                  <l>Yes, I will know that wicked Jilt</l>

                  <l>Let 'em condemn my Rage, or juſtify;</l>
                  <l>Credit's a thing remote, when injur'd Love is by.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>If your Royal Highneſs could poſſibly be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
at any thing, it would without doubt, to
ſee a Woman make Verſes thus <hi>extempore;</hi> But
if that opinion be true that tells us, that Poetry
hath ſomething of Enthuſiaſme and Fury in it, you
muſt needs confeſs, Sir, that <hi>Zelotide</hi> was in a
moſt incomparable vein Poetical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> was now infinitely troubled with her
Pray'rs and her Menaces; But it was out of his
pow'r to ſatisfy her, and unfold a miſtery, that he
himſelf was utterly ignorant of. And now <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi>
ſeeing neither her p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay'rs nor her threats
could force the ſecret from him, very happily
thought upon a ſtratagem, that muſt of neceſſity
convince him. She was confident, that he had
received more Letters then this one, from his
new Miſtriſs, and that if ſhe ſearched him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100546:36"/>
upon the ſpot, ſhe ſhould find ſome
other tokens of his perfidie about him. Having
abuſed her ſelf into this opinion, ſhe muſt ſearch
his pockets, where ſhe found a great company of
Letters that he received from his friends and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
ſhe had the patience to open all, one after
another, and finding there ſome few of 'em of a
Womans hand, ſhe read them over and over,
and unhappily meeting with ſomething in them
that ſhe did not well underſtand, ſhe preſently
concluded they came from her unknown Rival;
for though <hi>Lycidas</hi> was Treated as a Couſin or
Brother in them, ſhe ſaid, that was only out of
confederacy to hide their deceit. In fine, having
read over five or ſix of them, and diſcovered
nothing conſiderable, ſhe went to open ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſeeing by the Superſcription,
that it came from his Siſter, about ſome buſineſs
that concerned his Family, which for many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
he was engaged to conceal; he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it from her, and told her that he could not
poſſibly let her read that, and immediately tore
it in pieces. Your Royal Highneſs may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that there needed no more to perſwade
her that this Letter came from her Rival, and
might have diſcovered all the ſecret to her.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Seeing him tear the Letter, up ſhe flew,</l>
                  <l>She tore his Face and Hair,</l>
                  <l>Or by his Hair along the Lover drew,</l>
                  <l>Such were the dictates of her fell diſpair.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:100546:36"/>
And could her Nails have reach'd his Heart,</l>
                  <l>(Where her fair eies had often play'd their
part.</l>
                  <l>And ſtamp'd her Image with ſo ſweet an Art)</l>
                  <l>She would his Heart have torn in pieces too,</l>
                  <l>And pul'd her Image thence,</l>
                  <l>She with that loſs could eaſily diſpence,</l>
                  <l>Could ſhe but give the faithleſs Man his due,</l>
                  <l>And he that firſt the fierce <hi>Megera</hi> drew</l>
                  <l>Might very well have took her Image hence.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But the good honeſt Gardener, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read of <hi>Megera,</hi> nor perhaps heard of her,
took her for ſome Woman bit by a mad Dog,
and thereupon armed himſelf with all his Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils,
his Bill and his Knife, &amp;c. that he might upon
occaſion turn <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and fight with Sword
and Dagger, and I cannot tell what beſides, leſt
ſhe ſhould do him a miſchief. <hi>Cephiſa</hi> and the
Cavalier were not altogether ſo fearful; all the
pain they were in, at leaſt the moſt conſiderable,
was to forbear laughing out, leſt they ſhould be
diſcovered.</p>
               <p>All that the poor Gallant, (I think I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call him ſo in this adventure) could do after
his mad Treatment, to fly his mad Miſtriſs, (and
faith I believe he did it as heartily as ever he
ſought her before,) and ſave his Honour in the
ſight of the Gardener and his Wife, who as he
thought, were the only ſpectators of the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
was to anſwer her fury with railery, and get
out of her hands as ſoon as he could; ſo that ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome Kinſmen of <hi>Zelotide's</hi> a walking in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100546:37"/>
Garden, and as good fortune would have it,
ſomething near the Gardeners, he went out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
briskly, having firſt taken the Letters from the
pretty fretful Lady, and entreated them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<hi>Zelotide</hi> home, for he was engaged to
leave her there, to quell ſome diſorder that had
happened among the Soldiers of his Company.
He was glad he got off ſo, and was now fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
never more to expoſe himſelf to her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious
extravagancies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zelotyde</hi> hearing how handſomely he had
made out the ſtory to her friends, had ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to ſee with what prudence and diſcretion he
had excuſed her, and made uſe of the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as he had done. Her credulous Kinſmen
were eaſily abuſed thus, but <hi>Cephiſa</hi> and her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
that had ſeen what had paſt at the full
length, knew the truth of all but too well for
her repoſe and reputation. They laughed to
ſome purpoſe, you need not doubt it, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable
Creatures were not content to
laugh among themſelves, they muſt needs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it too, and communicate the ſucceſs of their
Intrigue. And your R. H. need not wonder at it.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>For ſtifled Joy does to a torment turn,</l>
                  <l>And what was made too warm, begins to burn.</l>
                  <l>Its force is ſprightly, quick, and vigorous,</l>
                  <l>And if you keep it in, more active grows,</l>
                  <l>But then its force one Heart can ne'r contain;</l>
                  <l>Diſperſe thy Joy, and 'twill return with gain.</l>
                  <l>This pretty contradiction pleaſures have,</l>
                  <l>For ſtill their Joys encreas'd, the more they gave</l>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:100546:37"/>
And it ſeems the Cavalier was very certain
of this, for he had rather have loſt the better half
of Blood, then the pleaſure to publiſh ſo pleaſant
a ſtory; on the morrow therefore (ſo that it
ſeems, the Cavalier was ſomething mannerly not
to call up his friends out of Bed at that time of
night to tell it them) it was Town-talk, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a dull Droll had bin paſt upon it. And now
the Cavalier was as happy as he could wiſh to be;
oh how he hug'd himſelf, and it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
took himſelf for the greateſt wit of the Age,
after ſo brave an Intrigue, ſo gallantly managed?
ſo that you may eaſily imagine he told it to all
he met with, what intereſt he had in it, how it
was he that wrote the Letter, and took care to
ſee it delivered. He ſpoke beſides this, all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
things he could upon that ſubject, and ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
upon it after a horrible rate, where ever he
could find any that had the patience to hear him.
<hi>Lycidas</hi> was told of it that very day, and ſeeing
what bad effects this raillery might produce, that
it was too bitter for a friend; and beſides, he
was engaged in Honour to teſtify by ſome gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
action, that he had not ſpread the report
about, but ſome body elſe, he ſought out the
Cavalier, and deſiring to be informed of the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
report that came from him, he could get no
other ſatisfaction from him, but ſome new abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
ſo that bidding him draw immediately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could be parted, he wounded him in
the Arm in two ſeveral places.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100546:38"/>
               <lg>
                  <l>And thus our petty Satyriſts came off</l>
                  <l>After the pleaſure of a ſcoff,</l>
                  <l>When on their heads their Railleries ſtill fall,</l>
                  <l>And as they tal'kd, ſo now they ſuffer all:</l>
                  <l>They find themſelves undone,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe they laugh'd too ſoon:</l>
                  <l>They damn their Drollery</l>
                  <l>And now too late they ſee,</l>
                  <l>When all the danger's paſt</l>
                  <l>'Tis then the happineſs to laugh at laſt.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The combat happening to be in a publick
place, it could not be of any long continuance.
The Combatants were preſently parted, but the
news of their quarrel being ſuddainly diſperſed,
their friends immediately made thither, and
ranked themſelves on one ſide and the other. The
Cavalier had many very conſiderable Kinſmen in
Town. But <hi>Lycidas</hi> was in the head of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo that they could not eaſily make aſſault
upon him. Their common friends ſeeing that
the Cavaliers wounds were not dangerous, and
the ſtir that the quarrel had raiſed among the
people, might break out into ſome diſorders, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to take order betimes about it. <hi>Cephiſas</hi>
Gentleman, the Man I mean that ſhe call'd Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
was one of the moſt active among them,
to bring the Combatants to ſome agreement;
for having learned that his Lady was concerned
in the ſcandalous report, he judged himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to ſilence it, with all the expedition he
could. To which purpoſe he went with ſome
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100546:38"/>
friends of his to the principal Officers of the
Regiment, who were very glad to ſee themſelves
prevented in treating for a pacification; and
to requite his civility, they agreed that the peace
ſhould be concluded at his Houſe. The two fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were led thither, and there they embraced
one another, after ſome petty ſatisfactions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to <hi>Lycidas,</hi> which my Intelligence
did not acquaint me with, and which, it is no
matter whither your Royal Highneſs know or
no, ſince they are not material to the ſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zelotide</hi> preſently heard of the quarrel, but
was not acquainted with the cauſe of it, for no
body was ſo imprudent and uncivil as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
her or her Husband with that raillery
that had paſt all the Town through upon the
Garden-adventure. So that the jealous Creature
not knowing what <hi>Lycidas</hi> and the Cavalier
fought about, gueſſed at the cauſe of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
as a jealous Lady ſhould do, She believed
that the Cavalier that had ſerved <hi>Cephiſa</hi> a long
time before, could not endure her engagement
with <hi>Lycidas.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>For Rivals, if they once but chance to meet</l>
                  <l>With odd careſſes do each other greet,</l>
                  <l>Honour and Love Command them to fight on,</l>
                  <l>He for the Girl the Honour has to dye,</l>
                  <l>And he lives ſtill the fair one to enjoy,</l>
                  <l>For one can ne'r be well, till th' other's gone.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This opinion of hers very much augmented
her jealouſie, if it was any longer capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100546:39"/>
and the poor Lady for five or ſix days,
was plagued worſe then ever. For ſince the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of the Letter, <hi>Lycidas</hi> had never wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her, ſo that ſhe could not have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to tell him of his infidelity, nor the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
ſhe deſired, to know the certainty of
her ſuſpitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe was now throughly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that <hi>Lycidas</hi> had quite deſerted her, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<hi>Cephiſa</hi> with the greater convenience, that her
Rival triumphed over her and her Beauty, and that
it was probable they were diverting themſelves
with her extravagance.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Theſe thoughts of hers ſo diſtracted her,</l>
                  <l>That when her fury grew leſs violent,</l>
                  <l>She of her jealouſie would oft repent,</l>
                  <l>And thinking on thoſe miſeries,</l>
                  <l>Thoſe briny Tears and bitter Sighs,</l>
                  <l>Her humour did ſo fruitfully create.</l>
                  <l>Her Rage, her Fury, ſhe her ſelf would hate.</l>
                  <l>But then conſidering</l>
                  <l>With what high reaſon ſhe had jealous been,</l>
                  <l>What reaſon then ſhe had</l>
                  <l>To Storm, to Rage, to bid her Soul run mad;</l>
                  <l>Her jealouſie ſhe juſtify'd,</l>
                  <l>And ſwore ſhe'd ſtill be jealous, though ſhe dy'd</l>
                  <l>Of her repentance ſhe repented too,</l>
                  <l>All was unjuſt but what her Fury prompted to.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>She had an hundred different reſolutions in an
inſtant, and ſome of them abſolutely deſtructive
of all the reſt, but at laſt having conſulted her
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100546:39"/>
own ſoul, ſhe reſolved to do her uttermoſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
her <hi>Lycidas.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>She hop'd he ſtill might think her fair,</l>
                  <l>Her Eyes were ſtill as charming as they were,</l>
                  <l>When they firſt conquer'd him,</l>
                  <l>And did ſo lovely ſeem.</l>
                  <l>And if ſhe muſt deſpair,</l>
                  <l>Her former Conqueſts ever to repair,</l>
                  <l>She judg'd it better ſtill</l>
                  <l>To ſee him, though an Infidel,</l>
                  <l>Then ne'r to ſee the Man ſhe lov'd ſo well.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This reſolution ſeemed ſo plauſible to her, that
ſhe preſerved it for ſome days, and while ſhe was
in this mind, ſhe very happily met an Officer of
the Regiment, that ſhe had ſome little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of, and that was a very intimate friend of
our <hi>Lycidas's,</hi> and if I am not very much
miſtaken, ſhe met him as ſhe was coming out of
the Church one day. The Officer, being very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
to the Ladies, as all <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s his Chronies
muſt needs be, offered her his ſervice to hand
her to her Coach, which ſhe very willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
becauſe ſhe imagined, ſhe might learn
of him the ground of the quarrel; and truly,
though my Author mentions it hot, I can eaſily
be perſwaded, it was as well to get a new ſervant,
as to enquire after the old one. The Officer was
extreamly ſurpriſed to ſee her ignorant of what
all the Town talked of, and wherein ſhe had ſo
particular a concern, and could not believe but
that it was only a piece of her Countenance, to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100546:40"/>
endeavour to perſwade him that ſhe was not the
cauſe of it. But ſhe ſpoke to him ſo ſeriouſly,
and ſo earneſtly intreated him to inform her,
that at laſt he was perſwaded to it, both to ſerve
the Lady, and do <hi>Lycidas</hi> a kindneſs: He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
her therefore, that the Garden-adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was known all the Town over; that <hi>Cephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>
and the Cavalier had divulged it, having firſt
been the eye-witneſſes of it in the Garden; that
the Cavalier was Author of that Letter that had
made all that diſturbance, and that talking of it
in all company he came into, <hi>Lycidas</hi> came to
hear of it, and judging himſelf in Honour obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to demand reaſon for the injury; and
Duel a perſon that had expoſed that Lady
that he moſt paſſionately affected, to the laughtter
and abuſive raillery of all the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
wounded the Cavalier, though not dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the buſineſs was taken up at Madam <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa</hi>'s,
becauſe her Husband had very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
himſelf in their agreement.</p>
               <p>Though this Relation very much afflicted <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotide,</hi>
when ſhe heard how her extravagancies
were laughed at, and what an ill opinion the
Town might juſtly conceive of her Vertue, yet
ſhe could not chuſe in the midſt of all her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
but reſent the greateſt joy conceivable.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>She lov'd her Honour ne'r the worſe for this,</l>
                  <l>Her Fame and Credit ſhe did ſtill prefer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>To life, and what was elſe more dear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>Yet Love muſt bear down all, what e'r it is.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100546:40"/>
Her kind eſteem of both of them was great,</l>
                  <l>Great as eſteem divided well could be,</l>
                  <l>But if the one of them muſt needs retreat,</l>
                  <l>Poor Honour then that one muſt be.</l>
                  <l>Love forc'd her to't with ſuch a ſweet neceſſity</l>
                  <l>That what e'r Honour urg'd in his defence,</l>
                  <l>Was foolery,</l>
                  <l>Scarce Sence.</l>
                  <l>Thus that ſhe might her Love more truly prove,</l>
                  <l>She ſacrific'd her Honour to her Love.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>So that, Sir, you may eaſily imagine that <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi>
was not extreamly troubled, and that ſhe
could admit of ſome Conſolation in the midſt of
her afflictions; for though ſhe had loſt her
reputation, ſhe was more concerned at the loſs
of her Lover, whom now ſhe hoped ſhe might
recover. She could now no longer preſerve her
anger againſt <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſince ſhe found her ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of him were unjuſt, and he was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
than ſhe imagined, and had behaved
himſelf like a Man of Honour in maintaining
the intereſts of his Miſtriſs with ſuch vigor, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the malice of a Rival, and the raillery of
an Enemy. And then ſhe immediately was plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
how to revenge her ſelf on <hi>Cephiſa</hi> and the
Cavalier, but ſhe thought it now more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to think of Love than Revenge, and by all
means to recall her <hi>Lycidas.</hi> She would not let
ſlip ſo happy an opportunity, but humbly thank'd
the Courteous Officer for the trouble he was
pleaſed to give himſelf in acquainting her with
the cauſe, and full relation of the quarrel;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100546:41"/>
again aſſuring him, that till that moment ſhe
had been kept in ignorance of what ſo much
concerned her; ſhe told him, ſhe acknowledged
her ſelf infinitely obliged to <hi>Lycidas</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of her Honour, and having now found by
his diſcourſe, that the Officer was <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
and acquainted with all his ſecrets, ſhe
very ingeniouſly confeſſed to him, that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inclination, ſhe had for his friend, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by this obliging confidence drawn him into
her Intereſt; ſhe avow'd to him, that <hi>Lycidas</hi>
had never ſeen her ſince the adventure in the
Garden; that ſhe was intollerably troubled at it,
and that he would oblige her eternally, would
he bring his friend along with him to honour her
with a viſit; that the chief reaſon why ſhe longed
to ſee him, was to beg his pardon for her unjuſt
ſuſpitions of him, and expreſs her gratitude for
the zeal he uſed in her ſervice.</p>
               <p>This civil obliging Officer promiſed her all
ſee deſired of him, and ſo left her, with a firm
reſolution to oblige <hi>Lycidas</hi> to wait upon her as
much as formerly. The Lady had mov'd him
with her pretty-taking converſation, and her
Wit and Beauty pleaſed him ſo much, and ſhe
was ſo wholly amiable in his Eies, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
ſhe deſerv'd to be ſerved with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in the world; that any Man of Honour
or Conſcience ought to reſt ſatisfied with ſuch a
happineſs, and that his friend was too too blame
for his infidelity to ſo incomparable a Lady;
and truly it ſeems he really thought ſo, for he
kept his word moſt exactly; he told <hi>Lycidas</hi> of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100546:41"/>
all the diſcourſe he had with <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to him, that he was engaged to wait upon
her, that he ought to take thoſe extrvagant ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of her jealouſie for the marks of an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
affection, and that if Love could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to ſee her, yet fear might perſwade
him to't, for what might he not with juſtice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
from a Lady as mad and deſperate, as
amorous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſince his Quarrel with the Cavalier,
had not ſeen <hi>Zelotide</hi> indeed, but then neither
had he ſeen <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> having learned that ſhe was
an accomplice of his enemy; and ſo at that
time his Love lay fallow, and without employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For, Sir, I cannot juſtly count thoſe for
viſits, that he made then (for it ſeems by my
intelligence, he was with ſome more of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
of the Town then two, though I have not
learned their names nor quality) becauſe he
could not loſe his liberty to any of the Ladies.
But his humour would not permit him to live
long thus.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Unhappy he</l>
                  <l>Should he for two whole days without a Miſtriſs be</l>
                  <l>Two ſuch whole days to him might well appear</l>
                  <l>More then a thouſand year.</l>
                  <l>Ceſſation from his Love made ſeem</l>
                  <l>Each minute a whole age to him.</l>
                  <l>That muſty reſt to him appear'd more rude,</l>
                  <l>Then all the Lovers ſervitude,</l>

                  <l>Could not be quiet in tranquillity,</l>

He a true Soldier</l>
                  <l>Without the War</l>
                  <l>Would quickly broken be.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Beſides, Sir, he could not be out with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs
for above eight days for the heart of him;
and however they had plagued him, he forgot
all their cruelties in a very ſhort time. So that
there needed not much perſwaſion to draw him
to Madam <hi>Zelotide</hi>'s, His careful friend led him
thither on the morrow, and knowing very well
that when a pair of Lovers is once met, they, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
among themſelves a great deal better, then
they would by the mediation of a third perſon,
he left them either to be honeſt together, or do
what they would; and they poor ſouls were ſo
well employed, that they never ſaw their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
friend ſneak away from them.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And though at firſt they both diſſembled well,<note place="margin">And faith here I think the Poet is in as bad a humour as his Lover.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>She perſonated the cruel,</l>
                  <l>And he as ſurly was as none can tell,</l>
                  <l>But he that wrote Squire <hi>Witherington's</hi> Knell;</l>
                  <l>He left Love to be judg'd of their quarrel.</l>

               <p>This little ſupreme Judge knows his Art at well,
as can be and draws conſiderable advantages from
ſuch diſorders, and thoſe which pretend to have

               <lg>
                  <l>That he exacts his Fee</l>

                  <hi>Zelotide</hi> was never more ſatisfied ſince ſhe
breathed, and <hi>Lycidas</hi> was never more contented;
<hi>Zelotide</hi> was raviſhed to find by the effect of her
Garden-Adventure, that her ſervant was more
innocent then ſhe thought he was; and that
that happy unhappy adventure, had made him
renounce her Rival too. <hi>Lycidas</hi> was no leſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
at this conjuncture, that proved him a
moſt conſtant Inamorato, when if one might
have ſearched his heart for him, he would have
found him otherwiſe, and that furniſhed him
with freſh means to deceive the poor <hi>Zelotide.</hi>
They being thus equally overjoyed, the two
Lovers, at laſt parted, and reſolved to meet as
often as they poſſibly could.</p>
               <p>While the two Lovers were thus happy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
the fair <hi>Cephiſa</hi> muſt not be forgotten, who
as brisk as ſhe was, began to be troubled at <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s
abſence; ſhe now began to perceive that
her laughing had coſt her dear, and that her
raillery had made her loſe a man that ſhe loved
great deal more then ſhe thought ſhe did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he left her. She now repented of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
and her deſignes upon <hi>Zelotide,</hi> though
ſhe hated her more now then ever, ſince they
muſt all fall upon her. She heard of <hi>Lycidas</hi> and
her Rivals agreement, and thereupon redoubled
her Hate of <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and Love of <hi>Lycidas.</hi>
While the Cavalier had entertained her with
his fooleries, laughing, and diverting her ſelf at
the expence of her Rival, was all her employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                  <l>That Man of Men, that lovely he,</l>
                  <l>Was fit for ſomething elſe then Raillery,</l>
               </lg>
               <p>She was reſolved to retrieve her Gallant, but
here was the Divel on it, ſhe could not deviſe
how to effect her wiſhes, and recall her injur'd
Lover. The, Cavalier, after their quarrel was
no fit perſon for ſuch a meſſage, and
<hi>Lycidas</hi> had
left his Landlady that had formerly been her
ſervant, ſo that every thing ran contrary to this
unfortunate fair one. But, Sir, meer chance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
her with the happieſt opportunity ſhe could
have wiſhed, and that it was impoſſible ſhe
ſhould ever have thought on. She very happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
met <hi>Lycidas</hi> at one of her Couſins, that ſhe
went to viſit; and this Couſin, as good luck
would have it, had got a Gentleman with her,
that ſhe had no averſion for, ſo that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100546:44"/>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> to entertain <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> ſhe talked in
private with this perſon, for truly, Sir, I have
not learned hit quality; <hi>Lycidas</hi> now very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
engaged without the leaſt deſign of his, to
talk with Madam <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> he began his diſcourſe
with reproaches; but the Lady made ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
and proteſted ſo unfeignedly, and with ſo
great a tenderneſs, that ſhe was extreamly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for what was paſt, that the eaſie <hi>Lycidas</hi> was
touched with her ſubmiſſion. And truly who
could deny ſo diſtreſſed a Beauty any thing?
certainly <hi>Lycidas</hi> could not eaſily do it. Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
I dare be ſworn for him, was none of
his crime.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>When any Miſs of his</l>
                  <l>Had by ſome baſe deviſe</l>
                  <l>(None e'r diſplea'd him with their cruelties)</l>
                  <l>Anger'd the injur'd Lover,</l>
                  <l>And in his Air did his juſt rage diſcover.</l>
                  <l>She might her pardon eaſily procure,</l>
                  <l>Poor <hi>Lycidas</hi> could ne'r endure,</l>
                  <l>(Ladies you'l praiſe his pity ſure)</l>
                  <l>Not to give pardon and himſelf unto her.</l>
                  <l>When his reſentments rag'd as high,</l>
                  <l>As injuries could make 'em flie.</l>
                  <l>He the offence could eaſily forgive,</l>

                  <l>Though by malicious ſubtilty</l>
                  <l>He by the pretty Sex ſhould cheated be,</l>
                  <l>He'd ſtill retain his clemency,</l>
                  <l>And might the Judgement be referr'd to him,</l>
                  <l>No witty Beauty, would long guilty ſeem.</l>

One cannot therefore wonder if theſe ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and charming excuſes of <hi>Cephiſa</hi>'s did not
very ſenſibly move our <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Your Royal
Higheſs will undoubtedly avow, that any one
elſe, far more inſenſible, and obdurate then our
Gentleman was, would be extreamly touched
with them; if you pleaſe to conſider, with how ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Air our pretty Criminal uttered them.
Nay, ſhe purſued her ſubmiſſion ſtill and told
him, that if by any fault of another nature, ſhe
could expiate her paſt one, ſhe was ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in it, and prefer his Love to her Innocence;
and that in a word, ſhe would moſt willingly
procure his pardon at the expence of what ſhe
held moſt dear in the world. The cunning La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
managed her buſineſs rood incomparably, for
the pacified <hi>Lycidas</hi> founded his happineſs upon
her promiſes, and truly his hopes did not abuſe
him; for after ſome ſmall ſtay there, he led <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa</hi>
home again, where the peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the great contentment of both parties.
After this formality was once over, they agreed
upon certain rules for their living together in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
intelligence, and managing their pleaſures
for the future with prudence, the longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
them: Then they fell a talking of poor
<hi>Zelotide,</hi> and her extravagant jealouſie; but <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi>
being very unwilling to claſh with her any
more, told <hi>Cephiſa</hi> very ingeniouſly, that he muſt
needs wait on her ſtill; but he aſſured her, it
ſhould be only out of policy, to avoid any new
diſorders, that her mad Love and Jealouſie might
produce. It was not long before <hi>Zelotide</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100546:45"/>
of their reconciliation, and of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits
the Gentleman made <hi>Cephiſa</hi> after their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement;
but <hi>Lycidas</hi> excuſed himſelf very
plauſibly to her, and told her it was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for him not to ſee <hi>Cephiſa</hi> ſometimes, ſince
all the Gameſters continually met there, and all
the ſpiritual and ingenious perſons of the Town
made her Houſe their Rendezvous; and then
he ſwore he had no private acquaintance with
her, and never ſaw her but in company; and
thus the pretty Gentleman deceived the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, You ſee all is quiet, the Cavalier
and the two Rival Ladies agree very well with
our Gallant; but damned ill luck muſt raiſe up
a new diſorder among them, and diſturb their
tranquility as much as formerly.</p>
               <p>A Conſin of <hi>Zelotides,</hi> we called her <hi>Cleonice</hi>
in the beginning of this Hiſtory, was to marry
one of her Siſters (but truly, Sir, I could never
learn what hey called her, though I uſed all
poſſible means to find it out) to a very near
kinſman of <hi>Cephiſa</hi>'s (but faith, I cannot tell
who he was neither.) Being the Wedding was
to be publick, and very magnificent (whence
I gather it was no <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> one, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the couple ſcorned to have more honeſty
then our Engliſh fools that are to be married
at the place aforeſaid) the Gallant (for yet I
think I may call him ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before he's brought to the
Altar to ſacrifice his liberty, and debauch his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs
into that dull and inſignificant thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called a Wife) for his part invited <hi>Cephiſa</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:100546:45"/>
and her Gentleman; and the Lady-Bride invited
her friends thither, and among the reſt, <hi>Zelotide</hi>
and the thing ſhe called Husband. Theſe two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
as I told you before, for all that feigned
reconciliation, hated each other ſtill moſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
but they concealed their enmity; they
faintly ſaluted, one another when they chanced
to meet, and when ill fortune brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
company together, they were civilly complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
juſt as we are to ſtrangers commonly, ſo
that they could not handſomely refuſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
though they knew before hand who
they muſt expect to meet there. The Gentleman
that was deſigned for the Groom had been an
Officer in <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s Regiment, and had been for
ſome time an intimate friend of his; ſo that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi>
was alſo invited. The Feaſt was to be kept
at a Villa of <hi>Cleonice</hi>'s, about two miles out of
Town. They all kept their Aſſignation very
exactly; and <hi>Lycidas</hi> that came ſomething later
then the reſt was in the greateſt trouble in the
world to meet his two Miſtreſſes both together
in the ſame company.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now <hi>Lycidas</hi> muſt neds confeſs</l>
                  <l>That Happineſs</l>
                  <l>Has its exceſs,</l>
                  <l>And can to miſery degenerate.</l>
                  <l>Thus plagu'd by two ſuch loving Miſtreſſes</l>
                  <l>He wiſh'd their favour leſs,</l>
                  <l>Their Love diſturbs him more then would their hate</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:100546:46"/>
Now he muſt part his Favours too,</l>
                  <l>And his kind Graces juſtly ſhare;</l>
                  <l>What ſhould the poor diſtracted Lover do?</l>
                  <l>They both are witty, ſweet, and fair,</l>
                  <l>Sweet as when gentle <hi>Zephyrs</hi> Fan the Air,</l>
                  <l>That does unto ſome Flowry Vale repair.</l>
                  <l>Brought to this ſad diſtreſs</l>
                  <l>Both how to leave and chuſe a Miſtreſs,</l>
                  <l>He all their charms look'd o're</l>
                  <l>And found them both as charming as before.</l>
                  <l>What ſhall I do? he cry'd,</l>
                  <l>Can I thoſe Lips and ſprightly Eies forſake,</l>
                  <l>That would of <hi>Iove</hi> again a Satyr make,</l>
                  <l>Or force him ſo me new ſhape to take?</l>
                  <l>No, no, I can't leave either,</l>
                  <l>Nor can I my true Love divide.</l>
                  <l>Then I mud keep &amp; love them both together.</l>
                  <l>While thus confounded his poor foul remains,</l>
                  <l>Now on his <hi>Zelotide</hi> he caſts a glance,</l>
                  <l>And thence he did his love the more advance,</l>
                  <l>While he new Beauties ſpy'd, and charms by
chance,</l>
                  <l>That loaded him with more of th' Lovers
Chains.</l>
                  <l>But when he look'd on his <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> then</l>
                  <l>His Love for her return'd agen.</l>
                  <l>While thus in diſtracion he lay</l>
                  <l>Now leaning this, now th' other way,</l>
                  <l>Now the ſweet Girl, now th' jealous bore the
ſway,</l>
                  <l>At laſt hit Fetters he would needs retain,</l>
                  <l>And conſtant unto both remain;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100546:46"/>
But now at preſent he muſt ſee</l>
                  <l>How to divert his miſery;</l>
                  <l>And leaſt he ſhould diſpleaſe either,</l>
                  <l>Reſolv'd at preſent to chuſe neither.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>So that he reſolved that I may tell it your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs in Proſe as well as Verſe, for that day
to renounce both his Miſtreſſes, and apply himſelf
to Madam <hi>Cleonice.</hi> Being ſhe was the Miſtreſs
of the houſe, and he had ſome acquaintance
with her ever ſince he firſt ſaw <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and no
body ever ſuſpected him of any particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with her, he thought he had taken
the leſs dangerous reſolution, and that by this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
means he might keep his Favour with both his
Ladies. And truly the reasonable <hi>Cephiſa</hi> was
contented to ſee him beſtow his love any where
elſe but on <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and reckoned her ſelf infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
engaged to him; but <hi>Zelotide</hi> was not of ſo
tame a humour, ſhe could not endure that her
ſervant ſhould careſs any body beſides her dear
ſelf; and though ſhe was overjoyed to ſee that
<hi>Lycidas</hi> did not ſo much as look upon <hi>Cephiſas;</hi>
ſhe was not ſatisfied with that, but would have
had him caſt an Eye on no body elſe: but her
prudence in this conjuncture, maſtered her ſoul,
and concealed her reſentments, ſo that by her
actions none could judge of her inward motions,
though ſhe ſuffered all the torments that Rage
and Jealouſie could inflict, while our <hi>Lycidas</hi> at
the Ball, at the Banquet, or where ever he was,
was always with Madam <hi>Cleonice,</hi> and carried
himſelf ſo diſcreetly, that one would have ſworn
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100546:47"/>
he had not the leaſt inclination for <hi>Zelotide</hi> or
<hi>Cephiſa,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi> came off thus a day and for ſome
part of the night, till the Lady was brought
whither ſhe would be, to her Husbands em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
(for hang it, now that dull name muſt be
uſed) where we ſhall leave them between the
Sheets to their pleaſures, (for, for the firſt night
they will be ſomething ſatisfied with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſure, or elſe they never will) and ſee what
the reſt do, for you may gueſs at the married
couples employment. <hi>Cleonice</hi> was now enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to leave the company to go and give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for ſomething about the houſe, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi>
though he was very unwilling to part
with her, was at laſt forced to leave her; ſo
that now he was at a loſs how to carry himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Ladies were at play in two ſeveral compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
whereof <hi>Cephiſa</hi> was of the one, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotide</hi>
of the other. So that for fear of diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either of his Miſtriſſes, he would not ſtrike
in there: and the Men were as hot a fudling as
can be imagined, and the greater part of them
even dead drunk, with a pretty kind of Wine
they had got, that charm'd them ſo ſweetly, that
they could have been content to have died over
again, might they have ſo agreeable an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.
<hi>Lycidas</hi> was engaged there for ſome
time, but ſtaied not long among them; for this
ſport diſpleaſed him worſe then the former, ſo
that at laſt he thought it beſt to leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and retire into ſome dark chamber, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpeaking a Syllable, leſt he might be diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100546:47"/>
from his reſolution. He was no ſooner got
where he intended, and laid himſelf upon a Bed,
that very happily he light upon in the dark, but
finding himſelf exceſſive weary with Dancing,
he compoſed himſelf to take a nap, where he
fell aſleep very ſoundly, with his Cloaths on,
and had lain ruff all night, had not a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
adventure raiſed him: He had not been
aſleep much above an hour (it is poſſible it
might be an hour and half quarter) when he
felt ſomething pull him by the Arm, and he was
not well awake, when by ſome careſſing, and
amorous kind of injuries, he perceived <hi>Zelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides</hi>
voice; the prudent Gentleman foreſeeing
what inconveniences might hence ariſe, if ſhe
was caught with him in the dark, told her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
civilly, ſhe expoſed her ſelf to too great a
danger; that ſome ſervant might eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them together, and that the preſervation of
her Honour engaged her to leave him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and avoid the diſpleaſure that ſhe muſt
of neceſſity reſent, if any one ſhould ſple them
together.</p>
               <p>Any other Lover leſs prudent then <hi>Lycidas,</hi>
would not have troubled himſelf to mind his
Miſtriſs of her Duty in ſo happy an occaſion;
but, Sir, I am engaged to avow it to your
Royal Highneſs, for I know <hi>Lycidas</hi> to be
naturally a very prudent perſon, and one
that loves to lay his Love-Intrigues as ſure as
can be.</p>
               <p>But how gravely ſoever he preached to the
Lady, it was ail to no purpoſe: <hi>Zelotide</hi> told
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100546:48"/>
him that ſhe had juſt left play, and had left all
the company mighty eager at it; that all their
Husbands and their Servants were half drunk;
that ſhe thinking to find him there by himſelf,
had ſtoln up to him very ſecretly; that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
would mind her abſence, or if they did, would
think ſhe was gone to Bed; ſo that ſhe might
without the leaſt danger enjoy his ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
for ſome few moments.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Forgetting then his danger, up he drew,</l>
                  <l>And on his Prey he flew;</l>
                  <l>Now his dull prudence he did ſoon reject,</l>
                  <l>And nothing but hit Love reſpect,</l>
                  <l>His Love, his gameſom Love he thought upon;</l>
                  <l>Wiſdom &amp; Prudence with their gang begone,</l>
                  <l>To phlegmatick Philoſophers retire,</l>
                  <l>That tell you of content, &amp; dream of nothing higher.</l>
                  <l>Lovers muſt mount; they'r all, they'r all a fire,</l>
                  <l>What ſaucy danger dare his joys moleſt?</l>
                  <l>And pull the Lover from his Ladies Breaſt,</l>
                  <l>While he lies there 'twould impious be,</l>
                  <l>To think of ought but Loves felicity</l>
                  <l>And its fair Source, his lovely ſhe,</l>
                  <l>As in a Church 'twould impious be,</l>
                  <l>To think of ought beſides the Deity.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The Lady when ſhe ſaw her Gallant full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
took her place very obligingly on the
Bed-ſide next the Wall, and begun a very pleaſant
entertainment with the too too happy <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
whereat both parties were very well ſatisfied,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100546:48"/>
and I am confident, would never have been
tired before morning, had not an unlucky acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
intervened. The Lady had not long enjoyed
what ſhe deſired, before ſhe heard, as well as <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi>
ſome noiſe upon the Stairs. This ſuddain
troubleſome noiſe obliged them to keep ſilence,
and hearken what the matter was; immediately
after they heard their Chamber door open, and
ſome body come into them. Your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
may very well imagine what a condition
this unexpected rencounter put our two Lovers
in, they were afraid of all the world, and the
ſmalleſt fortune they could hope for, was to be
found together with <hi>Zelotides</hi> good Husband.
This, exceſſive fear of theirs had rendred them
immoveable, and ſo they continued till <hi>Lycidas</hi>
felt ſome thing very gently pull him by the Hair.
He ſtirred not for all that, but ſnorted moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly,
to perſwade the unknown Creature, if
he could, that he was ſound aſleep; but whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the incognito was, it pulled him ſo ſtrangely,
that he could not any longer perſonate the ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
beſides ſome pretty tender diſcourſes, and ſome
few claps of the cheeks, had now almoſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the perſon; and thoſe pretty ſweet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes
made him ſwear it was <hi>Cephiſa:</hi> and faith
ſhe was the very perſon that diſturbed the dark
entertainment, who having left off play, and
miſſing <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſhe looked for him among
the Debauche's, but not finding him there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhe came to look for him in this very
chamber; <hi>Zelotide</hi> that was got on the other ſide
of the Bed, durſt not ſo much as breath with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100546:49"/>
freedom, for fear ſhe ſhould be diſcovered, but
liſtened very attentively, and eaſily knew <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa</hi>
by here voice, and ſeeing with what familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhe careſſed her Servant, did but too plainly
ſee their engagement; whereupon ſhe grew
ſtark mad with <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and no leſs with <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa,</hi>
her deſpire crack'd her heart-ſtrings; and
that which very ſenſibly augmented theſe her
misfortunes, was, that ſhe durſt not reveal her
Sentiments, and unravel her Reſentments;
But though ſhe durſt not let her Rival
know her, and revenge her ſelf upon the
brisk Jilt for that injury ſhe received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Lycidas</hi>
muſt feel here fury; ſhe ſcratched and bit him by
the hand, Arm, and Face, and pulled him by the
Hair, of her ſide I mean, and in a word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
her Teeth and Nails could reach, ſhe claw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, as though the Divel were in her, or as
though the Divel were in him, and ſhe were to
draw blood of the Wizard.</p>

               <p>But neceſſity very much heightening his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
together with that apprehenſion, he
had, leſt ſome diſorder ſhould happen between
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100546:50"/>
the Rival Ladies, he very nimbly leaped off the
Bed, and taking <hi>Cephiſa</hi> by the hand; Faith, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid he I muſt be unhappy at preſent in
ſpite of all your goodneſs, and your Favours
muſt prove uſeleſs to me; nor can I embrace
that happineſs, which I would at any other time
have ſacrificed my life to have procured. I muſt
have more prudence than you in this conjuncture,
and preſerve your Honour at the expence of my
pleaſures. Come Madam, I muſt lead you out of
the chamber, and put you out of fear of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal;
without queſtion, Madam, I infinitely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
you in this, and make you ſhun an accident,
that would trouble you as long as you breathed.
He ſaid no more, but taking her away with a
pretty kind of violence, he led her out of the
chamber, and having brought her down ſtairs, he
left her at the Hall door, where all the Ladies
were ſtill a playing; ſhe, as the was a very neat
diſſembler, humbly thanked him, and confeſſed
he had very much obliged her. But, Sir, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
above Stairs had not been carried ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
that <hi>Cephiſa</hi> heard nothing of it; ſhe heard
ſomething juſt as <hi>Lycidas</hi> was taking her away,
and now muſt needs gratify her Curioſity, and
ſee what the matter is; ſo that <hi>Lycidas</hi> had no
ſooner left her, but ſhe followed him very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to the Chamber door, where our too
kind and loving Cavalier, and no leſs beloved
neither, was ſcarce entred, but <hi>Zelotide</hi> that had
now run mad with jealouſie, caught him by the
Hair, and with their Teeth, Nails, and Feet, did
ſo handle him, you would have pittied the poor
Gentleman.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>Thus the poor <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s deſtiny</l>
                  <l>Made him too late to ſee</l>
                  <l>What a misfortune 'tis,</l>
                  <l>How dull a bliſs</l>
                  <l>To have a furious Lady for a Miſs;</l>
                  <l>Thrice had the Man been Treated thus,</l>
                  <l>With furious hands, and words more furious.</l>
                  <l>At laſt aſſuming Courage, thus he ſaid,</l>

                  <l>No more, my Dear, no more,</l>
                  <l>Thy Fury has enough thy Love betray'd,</l>
                  <l>I ſee, I feel its vehemence,</l>
                  <l>Too ſmartly does it ſtrike the ſenſe.</l>
                  <l>I cannot with ſuch Favours well diſpence.</l>
                  <l>Thus I another <hi>ſimile</hi> may prove,</l>
                  <l>Deſtroyed by what I firſt deſired, my Love.</l>
                  <l>Nay now e'n moderate</l>
                  <l>Your too much Love, or your pretended Hate.</l>
                  <l>Let me not have ſo kind a Miſtriſs,</l>
                  <l>And if you'l love me, love me leſs;</l>
                  <l>Love in exceſs does to a torment turn,</l>
                  <l>And what at firſt but warm'd, begins to burn.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s Remonſtrance had no great
power over <hi>Zelotide's</hi> ſoul, her cries were ſtill
coutinued, and her Female weapons were ſtill
employed in expreſſing her reſentments. All this,
Sir, <hi>Cephiſa</hi> heard very diſtinctly, and thoſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reproaches that continually accompanied
her aſſaults, taught the curious Lady what was
the cauſe of the diſorder; ſhe knew very well
by what ſhe heard <hi>Zelotide</hi> ſay, that her ſecret
Commerce and Intelligence with <hi>Lycidas</hi> was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100546:51"/>
diſcovered, and that if the noiſe ſhe made were
heard by any of the houſe, all their myſteries
would come out, and her Honour be ruined eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
Whereupon, very wiſely conſidering for
ſome ſmall time, ſhe reckoned it an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
piece of prudence, to go and embrace
<hi>Zalotide,</hi> and deſire her, ſince they knew one
anothers intrigues, to live in good intelligence
with her, and like good friends very honeſtly
to ſhare <hi>Lycidas</hi> betwixt them; <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> who
was a very juſt good natured thing, would have
conſented to this Treaty with all her ſoul; but
<hi>Zelotide</hi> was not of ſo tame a humour to go
ſharers with any one, ſhe muſt engroſs the whole
Commodity; and truly in that Rage ſhe then
was, a more moderate perſon then <hi>Zelotide</hi> would
be mad at ſuch a Propoſition, as really ſhe
was, and Treated poor <hi>Cephiſa</hi> after the
ſtrangeſt manner that ever was heard of; ſhe
immediately left <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and fell ſoul upon her
Rival, and being incomparable good at kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
biting, and thoſe kind of laudable exerciſes;
ſhe attacked <hi>Cephiſa</hi> with ſo much cruelty, that
the poor Lady was neceſſitated to defend her
ſelf with the ſame weapons; <hi>Lycidas</hi> in the
mean time did all he poſſibly could to part
them, but they were ſo diveliſh hot at it, that
all his endeavors proved ineffectual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the noiſe

was preſently heard by ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and they very diligently, and with all the

that in an inſtant, the greateſt part of them, ran
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100546:51"/>
thither with lights, to diſcover the unknown ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.</p>
               <lg>

                  <l>Their Eyes did in their ſparkling Dialect,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>There was a great deal more worth your
Royal Highneſſes Obſervation, if I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it. But this may ſuffice to perſwade
you, that it was the prettieſt Scene imaginable.
The firſt care that the ſpectators took upon
them, was to part the Combatants; but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
had proceeded farther, had not ſome
peaceable perſons among them took up the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
For the Husbands being got half fudled,
without examination, ran on like mad caps to
take their Wives parts, ſo that the Battle was
beginning again as bloudily as ever, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſo, had not the Maſter of the Houſe,
with the aſſiſtance of ſome Friends, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
mediated betwixt them, and treated a
ceſſation from Arms on both parties, until the
cauſe of the quarrel could be known. They ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100546:52"/>
                  <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> and asked <hi>Zelotide</hi> what occaſioned
their engagement, but neither of them anſwer'd
a word to purpoſe, but continued ſcolding at
one another, as though they had been brought up
at <hi>Billing sgate,</hi> and ſtood ſix times in the Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtool;
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> that had always a very
quick invention in ſuch conjunctures, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pumpt for a lie in his life, ſaw all was loſt,
if he did not light on ſome ſuddain expedient,
to bring all off again, and conceal their Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and ſave his Ladies reputation. His ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagination immediately furniſhed him with
the happieſt device in the world; whereupon
he offered to inform the company of the true
cauſe of the diſorder; and when he ſaw them
all keep ſilence, he told them, <hi>That</hi> Cephiſa <hi>and</hi>
Zelotide <hi>(as ill luck would have it) had ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
at the ſame time to go up the ſame pair of
Stairs, and that they went up with ſo much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation,
that they had not time to call for a light;
that in the dark, not ſeeing one another, they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the Stair-head to juſtle very furiouſly; And
that having no good will for one another, as all
the Town knows, they took it for an abuſe: And
thereupon came to words about it, and from words
to blows, ſo that he lying in chamber hard by,
whither he bad retired from the Debauch, to ſleep
a little, was awaked by their noiſe, and went out
to end the quarrel; That he had by main force
brought one of the Ladies into hit Chamber, to
keep her from her Enemy; But that the other had
purſued her ſo furiouſly, and they both continued
ſo obſtinate in their fighting humour, that they had
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100546:53"/>
treated one another juſt ſo as they ſaw, and had put
him in that condition they found him in, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to part them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While <hi>Lycidas</hi> was carrying on his relation,
the Rival-Ladies came to themselves a little, and
began to fear, leaſt the ſubject of their quarrel
ſhould be diſcovered; but ſeeing, Sir, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
their common Lover had excuſed
them, and brought all off again, they avow'd
all he ſaid, and made a fit uſe of his probable
excuſes. She juſtled me, cryed one, and ſhe juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me ſaid the other,; and were ſo hot at it
preſently, that their friends came to hold them
in, leſt they ſhould again commence the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
But the Maſter of the Houſe, and ſome
other friends that Tere there, eaſily quieted this
ſecond emotion, and remedied the relapſe. I hey
told the two intereſſed Gentlemen, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was injured, that all was by meer chance,
and that the blows were ſo equally divided, that
neither could boaſt of her ſucceſs, The ſage and
prudent Husbands having very gravely heard all
the particulars, were the firſt perſons that laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the adventure, and ſwore their Wives
were as drunk as they were, and called the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
combatants Fools, and Goſſips, and God
knows what; but begged <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s pardon a
thouſand times over, made him all the excuſes
they could think on, engaged their fighting
Beauties to make <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſatisfaction for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
he had received, and without more ado
reeled to their debauch again. The two Rival-Ladies
embraced one another, at the requeſt of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100546:53"/>
the company of the Women, and were overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſo dangerous a conjuncture, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their Honour, they laughed as hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the reſt, at the pleaſant extravagance of
their quarrel, and told it juſt ſo as <hi>Lycidas</hi> had
done before them.</p>
               <p>The Husbands being got pretty well drunk
by this time, and the Ladies having, laughed
their laugh out, all the company went to bed,
and among the reſt, the Bride and her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
for though I told you they went to bed
before, you muſt know that they poor ſouls roſe
again, and came to ſee another kind of combat
then what they were engaged in, but now the
Company once again brought them together,
where we ſhall leave them, for I think we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
leave them better: On the morrow the
company parted, having firſt agreed, and judged
it requiſite, that the two reconciled Ladies, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſa</hi>
and <hi>Zelotide</hi> ſhould go to Town in the ſame
Coach; and their Husbands fearing leaſt <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
had not heartily pardoned them for all the
ſcratches, together with the bites and bruiſes he
had received, would by all means perſwade him
to go along with them, without any other ſoul
with him, but his two Miſtreſſes; and theſe good
obliging Cornutos charged their Wives to pacify
him too, and do all they could to procure his
pardon.</p>

                  <l>No, he himſelf wou'd their content procure,</l>
                  <l>And never trouble their Amour,</l>
                  <l>He lets her meet him when ſhe will,</l>
                  <l>And both of one another have their fill;</l>

               <p>Our Galllant and the two Rival-Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now together in the ſame Coach, your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highneſs may eaſily conjecture, after ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
an adventure; that their converſation was
not unpleaſant, and that a great many fine things
were ſpoken amongſt them. <hi>Lycidas</hi> began to
make them ſee their imprudence, and told them,
if his addreſs had not helpt them out at a dead
lift, their extravagance might have had very
bad conſequences; both the Ladies were of his
opinion, and rendered him their hearty thanks
for ſo high an obligation. And now they were
in ſuch a condition, that they could no longer
conceal their affairs from one another, ſo that
by the mediation of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> they were made
very good friends again, and there paſt between
them the fineſt Raillery, but yet the moſt civil
and innocent, about their Loves, that ever was
heard. <hi>Cephiſa</hi> told <hi>Zelotide</hi> of her jealouſie,
and <hi>Zelotide</hi> rally'd on <hi>Cephiſa</hi> for being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with her leavings, and all this had ſo little
harſhneſs in it, and was ſo extreamly and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
that two Rivals were never yet more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconciled then they.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>What marvels did ingenious Love then do?</l>
                  <l>Love like the States could then admit of more,</l>
                  <l>While the fair Prize was ſhar'd between the
two.</l>
                  <l>This was a wonder never ſeen before.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:100546:55"/>
The pains and pleaſures they do both partake,</l>
                  <l>And willingly their common chain endure.</l>
                  <l>Friendſhip from Hate he did with eaſe procure</l>
                  <l>That did at firſt their ſpirits captive make.</l>
                  <l>Since in one common third they both agre,</l>
                  <l>Let one the Lover of the other be.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Before they came to Town, they very ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covenanted, the better to ſilence the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Lampooners of the Town, and to cheat
their Husbands the more dexterouſly, to part
<hi>Lycidas</hi> betwixt them, as a good that was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
common to both of them. They moreover
fully reſolved and agreed to do all they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could, to hinder any third Lady from rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
them of ſo agreeable a Treaſure. And that
if through any Caprichio of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhould fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the one more then the other, the agriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lady ſhould not make any publick diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
about it, and that all the Arms ſhe ſhould
make uſe of to retrieve the fugitive, ſhould be
careſſes and obligations, Theſe condition thus
formerly agreed on, were ſo advantagious for
<hi>Lycidas,</hi> that he could not with reaſon refuſe
them, as really he did not. But aſſured his two
Ladies, that he was very well ſatisfied with
them, and ſwore he would never on his part
violate the Articles.</p>
               <p>For ſome weeks the two Rivals, with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
third perſon, the beloved <hi>Lycidas</hi> lived in
very good intelligence, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
agreed upon in the laſt Treaty. The
Ladies were infinitely happy, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100546:55"/>
ſo too, but <hi>Lycidas</hi> began to ſurfet on their
goodneſs, and was preſently cloy'd With ſo much
ſweetneſs. This good intelligence of theirs
plagued him moſt unmercifully, and at laſt he
found by ſad experience, that he might with
leſs difficulty content his two Miſtreſſes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their diviſion, then now he had made them
friends, Theſe two handſome perſons loved one
another with as great a paſſion, as they hated
each other formerly, they were never out of
one anothers company, and that former precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Lycidas</hi>'s, that he had before ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
obſerved, and that the obſervance of ſo
much, troubled him, became now uſeleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus when the one ſpy'd with what gallantry,</l>
                  <l>He did his Love unto her friend addreſs,</l>
                  <l>She never wiſh'd it leſs,</l>
                  <l>But knew he'd make her happy by and by;</l>
                  <l>When he exactly ſhow'd the ſame confer</l>
                  <l>As much as to a glance or word on her,</l>
                  <l>She never blam'd her Rivals kiſſes</l>
                  <l>Nor envy'd thoſe more great and ſolid bliſſes</l>
                  <l>Since by and by</l>
                  <l>She the same Gallantry</l>
                  <l>Muſt without diminution enjoy.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This accurate kind of diſtributive juſtice was
mighty troubleſome to the too too much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Lycidas;</hi> and I eaſily perſward my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that as well ſton'd as he was of endearing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes,
(and truly, Sir, I believe few perſons in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100546:56"/>
France could vie with him) all his ſtock would
have been ſoon exhauſted, and he have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to extream beggery, and if there had
not come an Order from his Majeſty to change
his Garriſon, and lead his Regiment into a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel,
upon the frontiers of <hi>picardy.</hi> How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
this Order was to <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that was
now even tired and more then ſatiated with
their amorous Delicates, your Royal Highneſs
may eaſily conjecture; but the poor Ladies
were ſtruck dead with the dreadful news, all
the Thunders in nature could not have ſo much
diſturbed their ſouls; but in fine, there was an
abſolute neceſſity for their enduring of it;
the King muſt be obeyed, and they muſt loſe
their <hi>Lycidas. Lycidas</hi> went to take his farwel
of them, when they were both together, and
this ſad farwel of his, coſt the poor Ladies a
multinude of Tears, and <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſhed ſome
too, though I believe, out of a very different
conſideration, and they were only Tears of joy
for the recovery of his liberty, and his diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
from ſo troubleſome a happineſs,
while his ſad Miſtreſſes wept moſt exceſſively,
and cared not to preſerve the glories of their
bright Circles, when the only Man they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the world had deſerted them, and they
could ſee nothing now worth the captivating:
They entreated him to honour them with a viſit
as ſoon as poſſibly he could, and to return the
ſame <hi>Lycidas</hi> to their embraces, that he was
with that ſame ſprightly Air, and Gayety of
his, and above all, with that ardent paſſion (for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100546:56"/>
ſo they call'd it) he was pleaſed to have for them.
<hi>Lycidas</hi> promiſed them moſt liberally, all they
could deſire, but I can aſſure your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that to this moment he never performed
a word of theſe his promiſes, and it is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
nine months ſince he left them. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was pleaſed to tell me this ſtory, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he aſſur'd me, that there were very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and courtly Officers in that Regiment
that came to relieve them, and perſons that
without doubt were capable to undertake any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
adventure. As ſoon as they have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Garriſon, I do not queſtion but ſome
one or other among them will bring us more
news of <hi>Zelotide,</hi> and her extravagant Jealouſie.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, I ſhall own the ambition, to
ſay, I hope as well as wiſh, that my <hi>Zelotide,</hi>
with all her faults, may have the happineſs to
pleaſe your Royal Highneſs, which if I ſhall be
once aſſured of, my Muſe ſtirred up by ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an encouragement, and ſo brave a ſucceſs,
ſhall ſtill continue in her deſign of diverting your
Royal Highneſs. Our French Gallantries are ſo
frequent and uſual, that I ſhall never want a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for Stories of this nature, and they always
are in themſelves ſo pleaſant and agreeable, that
they can't chuſe but take, if the Hiſtorian ſpoils
not their native graces. What an Honour ſhall
I be bleſſed with, if this foolery of mine ſhall
prove fortunate enough to pleaſe your Royal
Highneſs! and what an infinite joy ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
if my Pen at your Commands were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in writing a more ſerious Hiſtory!

Could I be the happy eye-witneſs of ſo glorious
a life as yours, and be then Commanded to
tranſmit it to poſterity, adorned with all its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſo brave a Subject would inſpire me with new
flights, and that my ſtyle advanced and lifted up
