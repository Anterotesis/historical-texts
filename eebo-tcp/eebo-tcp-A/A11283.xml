         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHo so in surging Seas, his season will consume,</l>
               <l>And meanes thereof to make his onely trade to liue:</l>
               <l>That man must surely knowe the shifting Sunne &amp; Moone,</l>

               <l>So must he duely seeke the Eclipticke course of Sunne,</l>
               <l>How he from West to East his proper course doth keepe:</l>
               <l>His labour then (God knowes) as yet is but begunne,</l>
               <l>For he must watch and ward, and shake off sluggish sleepe.</l>

               <l>And swelling Seas likewise, the Ship may ouer-whelme,</l>
               <l>Or set her on the shore, without the Pylots eye.</l>

               <l>When <hi>Boreas</hi> is abroad, and blustring blasts doe blowe,</l>
               <l>In season must he seeke to short in loftye sayle:</l>
               <l>For that, if not in time he very well doth knowe,</l>
               <l>That all too late indeede, no labour will preuayle.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when the raging stormes doe swinge the ship on hye,</l>
               <l>Ofte times (against his will) he spoones before the seas:</l>
               <l>Else in goes all the sayles, and takes her from her trye,</l>
               <l>In haste to driue or hull, till God the same appease.</l>

And when you are without Thyoorte, then goe Northeast so long, till you haue brought Markerkerke with the lowe Land o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> Edam. And then keepe so, till that you haue brought Amsterdam a good way open to the northwards of the Chappel of Thyoort, and then keep your course Northeast and by east, and East Northeast till you haue brought Edam by East Merken, &amp; then you are past Pampus. Then goe northeast towards Urke, and when you see Urke beare northeast &amp; by north from you, or more Northerlye, then are you in the right course. And hauing obserued these pointes, you shal finde hard ground, and then againe soft ground, and a better depth, and then are you in the right Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nel. But if Urke beare northeast from you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> are you verie nigh to the north shore sand. Then goe nowe and then more westerlye, till you haue brought the Church and the houses in one, &amp; then goe west northwest with the Hoft, &amp; keepe the church &amp; the houses in one, vntil you haue brought Memelick a little without the land of the Uen, and keepe it so, till you haue brought the end of the Uen directly ouer Ankenson, keeping this course &amp; the markes in one till you bring Grosbrocke and it together, they haue two sharp steeples, and keep Memelick open to the northwards of the Castle, as much as the breadth of the Castle or more. These are the markes of the Channel, you shall haue 4. fatham, and in the best 5. fath. 3. foote lesse, and hard streamy ground.</p>
