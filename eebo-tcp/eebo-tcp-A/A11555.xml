         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The generall Loue,<note place="margin">3. The loue of all men with the ſence of ſmelling.</note> whereby of

               <p>The ſence of hearing diſcerneth

out from the fleſh, as not hauing

that is onely cauſed by the obedience
of Gods commaundement, which bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

               <p>But the ſight aboue all other,<note place="margin">5. The loue of god, with the ſence of ſeeing.</note> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
to it ſelfe the ſimilitude of the
diuine and holy loue of God, in that it
is moſt excellent, of a ſingular nature,
more cléere and ſpirituall then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſences, and diſcerneth thinges
moſt farre off, and knoweth the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of manie thinges.</p>
               <p>For though the ſmelling and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
doo perceyue thinges ſomewhat
farre off: yet it is more by drawing
to of the ayre, that commeth from the
obiect or thing that ſmelleth or ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

not ſo, but it ſeemeth rather to goe
<pb facs="tcp:2088:31"/>
foorth and procéede to thinges verye
farre off, as it may be figured in theſe
manners of louing. Héereby we doe
in manner drawe vnto vs our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,

whom we loue for this cauſe, that

with all our ſoule, with all our

faſt and moſt ſwiftly, as the eye doth
to the moſt delectable obiect, we caſte
all our loue to him, who is the moſte
vnſpeakable hygh goodneſſe, aboue
vs and all creatures, hauing no
reſpect to our owne profit or pleaſure
no more then the eie can reflect the
ſight to ſée it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But to take it for the moſt high
perfection and delight, onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
and loue him, in whom we may
perfectlie and abſolutely beholde our
ſelues and all creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2088:32"/>
This is perfection enough, and plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure
largely ſuffiſing, what neede we
to looke for other, ſith there is none
but this witneſſe Chriſte Ieſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

doth principally excell all the other,
the hearing excéeding the other three,
and ſo one is better in dignitye, and
more noble then another, after the
order and diſpoſition of the organes
and members that they be in: So in
like manner the loue of God is moſte
high, moſt excellent of all loues, and
<pb facs="tcp:2088:32"/>
of greateſt worthines. The looue of
our enemy next vnto this former, is
beſt in rewarde. The iuſt loue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
perſon one to another, the more
it is extended and ſhewed, the more
worthy and acceptable is it in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſight
of God. The loue of our neighbors,
kindred, fréendes, and companions, is
very neceſſary, as thoſe other ſences
are, whichif they fayled, the life were
maymed and impeached, and all the
other ſences of loue ſhould decay. If a

god? The thing that thou loueſt moſt

that doſt thou rather &amp; ſoneſt chuſe,
take good heede therefore thou faint

any thing in the worlde to be loued?
what is there then where the maker
of the world dwelleth? loue therfore

the better choyſe. Chuſe then looue,

               <p>It cauſed God to make man, it
drewe him from heauen to earth to
redéeme him againe from ſeruitude
of the deuill. It ioyned the moſt high
and pure nature to the moſt low and
vile nature, wherin it wrought moſte
meruailous thinges, in rayſing deade
men, healing Leapers and al manner
of diſeaſes. And at the laſt it wounded
Chriſt full bitterly, and ſlew him full
pittiouſly, that our dead ſoules might
be quickened to eternall life. It ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him againe gloriouſly for our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
and redemption. It lifted
him to heauen triumphantly, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
mankind in hys kingdome. It
drewe vp <hi>Stephen</hi> victoriouſly, and
crowned him with the garlande of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
happines. It conuerted
ſuddainly Saint <hi>Paule.</hi> and fixed him
ſo faſt to his Maſter Chriſt Ieſus:
<hi>that neyther tribulation,</hi>

ſworde, or any other perrilles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could
ſeperate him from the loue of Chriſt.</hi>
Yea, and it made Paule ſo ſtrong,
that he ſayd more of himſelfe and hys
followers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2088:59"/>
That neyther death, neither life,
neither Angelles in heauen,<note place="margin">Ro, 8, 38, 39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> nor rule,

Chriſt Ieſu our Lord.</p>
               <p>And after them, this loue made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
people to reiect and caſt
away all worldly thinges, and to run
after Chriſt, not ſparing nor fearing
fire, ſworde, payne, or any manner of
torments whatſoeuer: but gladlye

               <p>And thus not onely in ſtrong
men, but alſo in women and children
weake &amp; fraile, &amp; in young tender vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
who were made by this loue
more ſtrong then all the Tyrants: ſo
that they feared neither king nor Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour,
but ouercame them both in
wyſedome and ſtrength, in endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:2088:60"/>
more paines then their tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
could put them to, and ſo vtterly
confounded them.</p>
               <p>O immortall and diuine loue, if I
vnworthy and ſinfull wretch, haue
preſumed to prayſe and ſhewe thy glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious
