            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eroique Poesie has alwayes been sacred to Princes and to <hi>Heroes.</hi> Thus <hi>Virgil</hi> inscrib'd his <hi>Aeneids</hi> to <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>; and, of latter Ages, <hi>Tasso</hi> and <hi>Ariosto</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Poems to the house of <hi>Est.</hi> 'Tis, indeed, but justice, that the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and most profitable kind of writing, should be addressed by Poets to such persons whose Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters have, for the most part, been the guides and patterns of their imitation. And Poets, while they imitate, instruct. The feign'd Heroe inflames the
<pb facs="tcp:58014:3"/>
true: and the dead vertue animates the living. Since, therefore, the World is govern'd by precept and Example; and both these can onely have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from those persons who are above us, that kind of Poesy which excites to vertue the greatest men, is of greatest use to humane kind.</p>
            <p>'Tis from this consideration, that I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd to dedicate to your Royal Highness these faint representations of your own worth and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in Heroique Poetry: or, to speak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, not to dedicate, but to restore to you those Ideas, which, in the more perfect part of my characters, I have taken from you. Heroes may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be delighted with their own praises, both as they are farther incitements to their vertue, and as they are the highest returns which mankind can make them for it.</p>
            <p>And certainly, if ever Nation were oblig'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the conduct, the personal valour, or the good fortune of a Leader, the <hi>English</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, in all of them, to your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Your whole life has been a continu'd Series of Heroique Actions: which you began so early that you were no sooner nam'd in the world, but it was with praise and Admiration. Even the first blossomes of your youth paid us all that could be expected from a ripening manhood. While you practis'd but the rudiments of War you out-went all other Captains: and have since found none to surpass, but your self alone. the opening of your
<pb facs="tcp:58014:3"/>
glory was like that of light: you shone to us from afar; and disclos'd your first beams on distant Nations. yet so, that the lustre of them was spred abroad, and reflected brightly on your native Country. You were then an honour to it, when it was a reproach to it self: and, when the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Usurper sent his arms to <hi>Flanders,</hi> many of the adverse party were vanquish'd by your fame, e're they try'd your valour. the report of it drew over to your Ensigns whole Troops and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of converted Rebels: and made them forsake successfull wickedness to follow an oppress'd and exil'd vertue. your reputation wag'd war with the Enemies of your royal family, even within their trenches; and the more obstinate, or more guilty of them, were forc'd to be spyes over those whom they commanded: lest the name of <hi>YORK</hi> should disband that Army in whose fate it was to defeat the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and force <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to surrender. Yet, those victorious forces of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells were not able to sustain your arms: where you charg'd in person you were a Conqueror: 'tis true they afterwards recover'd Courage; and wrested that Victory from others which they had lost to you. And it was a greater action for them to rally than it was to overcome. Thus, by the presence of your Royal Highness, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish on both sides remain'd victorious: and that Army, which was broken by your valour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a terror to those for whom they conquer'd.
<pb facs="tcp:58014:4"/>
Then it was that at the cost of other Nations you inform'd and cultivated that Valour which was to defend your native Country, and to vindicate its honour from the insolence of our incroaching Neighbours. When the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to withdraw themselves from the obedience which they ow'd their lawful Sovereign, affronted those by whose Charity they were first protected: and, (being swell'd up to a preheminence of Trade, by a supine negligence on our side, and a sordid parsimony on their own,) dar'd to dispute the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of the Seas; the eyes of three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were then cast on you: and, by the joynt suffrage of King and People, you were chosen to revenge their common injuries<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to which, though you had an undoubted title by your birth, you had yet a greater by your courage. Neither did the success deceive our hopes and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. the most glorious victory which was gain'd by our Navy in that war, was in that first engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: wherein, even by the confession of our enemies, who ever palliate their own losses, and diminish our advantages, your absolute triumph was acknowledg'd. you conquer'd at the <hi>Hague</hi> as intirely as at <hi>London.</hi> and the return of a shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Fleet, without an Admiral, left not the most impudent among them the least pretence for a false bon-fire, or a dissembled day of publick Thanks-giving. All our atchievements against them afterwards, though we sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<pb facs="tcp:58014:4"/>
and were never overcome, were but a copy of that victory: and they still fell short of their original. somewhat of fortune was ever wanting, to fill up the title of so absolute a defeat. or, perhaps, the Guardian Angel of our Nation was not enough concern'd when you were absent: and would not employ his utmost vigour for a less important stake than the life and honor of a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Admiral.</p>
            <p>And, if since that memorable day, you have had leisure to enjoy in peace the fruits of so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a reputation, 'twas occasion onely has been wanting to your courage; for, that can never be wanting to occasion. the same ardor still incites you to Heroique actions: and the same concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all the interests of your King and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, continue to give you restless nights, and a generous emulation for your own glory. you are still meditating on new labours for your self, and new triumphs for the Nation. and when our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer enemies again provoke us, you will again so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite fate to provide you another Navy to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and another Admiral to be slain. You will, then, lead forth a Nation eager to revenge their past injuries: and, like the <hi>Romans,</hi> inexorable to Peace, till they have fully vanquish'd. Let our Enemies make their boast of a surprise; as the <hi>Samnites</hi> did of a successful stratagem: but the <hi>Furcae Caudinae</hi> will never be forgiv'n till they are reveng'd. I have alwaies observ'd in your Royal
<pb facs="tcp:58014:5"/>
Highness an extream concernment for the honour of your Country 'tis a passion common to you with a Brother, the most excellent of Kings: aud in your two persons, are eminent the Characters which <hi>Homer</hi> has given us of Heroique vertue: the commanding part in <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and the executive in <hi>Achilles.</hi> And I doubt not, from both your actions, but to have abundant matter to fill the Annals of a glorious Reign: and to perform the part of a just Historian to my Royal Master, without intermixing with it any thing of the Poet.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, while your Royal Highness is preparing fresh employments for our pens<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I have been examining my own forces, and making tryal of my self how I shall be able to transmit you to Posterity. I have form'd a Heroe, I confess, not absolutely perfect: but of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive and overboyling courage. but <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Tasso</hi> are my precedents. both the Greek and the Italian Poet had well consider'd that a tame Heroe who never transgresses the bounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertue, would shine but dimly in an Epick poem. the strictness of those Rules might well give precepts to the Reader, but would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister little of occasion to the writer. But a character of an excentrique vertue is the more exact Image of humane life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he not wholy exempted from its frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. such a person is <hi>Almanzor:</hi> whom I present,
<pb facs="tcp:58014:5"/>
with all humility, to the Patronage of your Royal Highness. I design'd in him a roughness of Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, impatient of injuries; and a confidence of himself, almost approaching to an arrogance. but these errors are incident only to great spirits. they are moles and dimples which hinder not a face from being beautifull; though that beauty be not regular. they are of the number of those amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imperfections which we see in Mistrisses<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and which we pass over, without a strict examination, when they are accompanied with greater graces. And such, in <hi>Almanzor,</hi> are a frank and noble openness of Nature<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> an easiness to forgive his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd enemies; and to protect them in distress; and above all, an inviolable faith in this affection. This, Sir, I have briefly shaddow'd to your Royal Highness, that you may not be asham'd of that Heroe whose protection you undertake. Neither would I dedicate him to so illustrious a name, if I were conscious to my self that he did or said any thing, which was wholy unworthy of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, since it is not just that your Royal Highness shou'd defend or own, what, possibly, may be my errour, I bring before you this accus'd <hi>Almanzor,</hi> in the nature of a suspected Criminal. By the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of the most and best he already is acquitted; and by the sentence of some, condemn'd. But, as I have no reason to stand to the award of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, so neither dare I trust the partiality of my friends. I make my last appeal to your Royal
<pb facs="tcp:58014:6"/>
Highness, as to a Soveraign Tribunal. Heroes shou'd onely be judg'd by Heroes; because they onely are capable of measuring great and Heroick actions by the rule and standard of their own. If <hi>Almanzor</hi> has fail'd in any point of Honor, I must therein acknowledge that he deviates from your Royal Highness, who are the patern of it. But, if at any time he fulfils the parts of personal Vallour and of conduct, of a Souldier, and of a General; or, if I could yet give him a Character more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than what he has; of the most unshaken friend, the greatest of Subjects, and the best of Masters, I shou'd then draw to all the world, a true resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of your worth and vertues; at least as farr as they are capable of being copied, by the mean abilities of</p>

            <head>OF HEROIQUE PLAYES. An Essay.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether Heroique verse ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into serious Playes, is not now to be disputed: 'tis already in possession of the Stage: and I dare confidently affirm, that very few Tragedies, in this Age, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd without it. All the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are form'd against it, can amount to no more than this, that it is not so near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation as Prose; and therefore not so natural. But it is very clear to all, who understand Poetry, that serious Playes ought not to imitate Conversation too nearly. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were to be rais'd above that level, the foundation of Poetry would be destroy'd. and, if you once admit of a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that thoughts may be exalted, and that Images and Actions may be rais'd above the life, and describ'd in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure without Rhyme, that leads you insensibly, from your own Principles to mine: You are already so far onward of your way, that you have forsaken the imitation of ordinary converse. You are gone beyond it; and, to continue where you are, is to lodge in the open field, betwixt two Inns. Yon have lost that which you call natural, and have not acquir'd the last perfection of Art. But it was onely custome which cozen'd
<pb facs="tcp:58014:7"/>
us so long: we thought, because <hi>Shakespear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> went no farther, that there the Pillars of Poetry were to be erected. That, because they excellently describ'd Passion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rhyme, therefore Rhyme was not capable of describing it. but time has now convinc'd most men of that Error. 'Tis indeed, so difficult to write verse, that the Adversaries of it have a good plea against many who undertake that task, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being form'd by Art or Nature for it. Yet, even they who have written worst in it, would have written worse without it. they have cozen'd many with their sound, who never took the pains to examine their sence. In fine, they have succeeded: though 'tis true they have more dishonour'd Rhyme by their good Success than they could have done by their ill. But I am willing to let fall this argument: 'tis free for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to write, or not to write, in verse, as he judges it to be, or not to be his Tallent; or as he imagines the Audience will receive it.</p>
            <p>For Heroick Plays, (in which onely I have us'd it without the mixture of Prose) the first light we had of them on the <hi>English Theatre</hi> was from the late Sir <hi>William D' Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>: It being forbidden him in the Rebellious times to act Tragedies and Comedies, becuase they contain'd some matter of Scandal to those good people, who could more easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess their lawful Sovereign than endure a wanton jeast; he was forc'd to turn his thoughts another way: and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the examples of moral vertue, writ in verse, and perform'd in <hi>Recitative Musique.</hi> The Original of this musick and of the Scenes which adorn'd his work, he had from the <hi>Italian Opera's</hi>: but he heightn'd his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters (as I may probably imagine) from the example of <hi>Corneille</hi> and some <hi>French Poets.</hi> In this Condition did this part of Poetry remain at his Majesties return. When growing bolder, as being now own'd by a publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he review'd his <hi>Siege of Rhodes,</hi> and caus'd it to be acted as a just <hi>Drama;</hi> but as few men have the happiness to begin and finish any new project, so neither did he live to make his design perfect: There wanted the fulness of a Plot, and the variety of Characters to form it as it ought: and,
<pb facs="tcp:58014:7"/>
perhaps, something might have been added to the beauty of the stile. All which he would have perform'd with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness had he pleas'd to have given us another work of the same nature. For my self and others, who come after him, we are bound, with all veneration to his memory, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what advantage we receiv'd from that excellent ground-work which he laid: and, since it is an easy thing to add to what already is invented, we ought all of us, without envy to him, or partiality to our selves, to yield him the precedence in it.</p>
            <p>Having done him this justice, as my guide; I may do my self so much, as to give an account of what I have perform'd after him. I observ'd then, as I said, what was wanting to the perfection of his <hi>Siege of Rhodes:</hi> which was design, and variety of Characters. And in the midst of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, by meer accident, I open'd the next Book that lay by me, which was an <hi>Ariosto</hi> in <hi>Italian;</hi> and the very first two lines of that Poem gave me light to all I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
<q>
                  <l>Le Donne, I Cavalier, L' arme, gli amori,</l>
                  <l>Le Cortesie, l' audace imprese jo canto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
for the very next reflection which I made was this, That an Heroick Play ought to be an imitation, in little of an Heroick Poem: and, consequently, that Love and Valour ought to be the Subject of it. Both these, Sir <hi>William D' Avenant</hi> had begun to shadow: but it was so, as first Discoverers draw their Maps, with headlands, and Promontories, and some few out-lines of somewhat taken at a distance, and which the designer saw not clearly. The common <hi>Drama</hi> oblig'd him to a Plot well-form'd and pleasant, or, as the Antients call'd it, one entire and great Action: but this he afforded not himself in a story, which he neither fill'd with Persons, nor beautified with Characters, nor varied with Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. The Laws of an Heroick Poem did not dispence with those of the other, but rais'd them to a greater height: and indulg'd him a farther liberty of Fancy, and of drawing all things as far above the ordinary proportion of the Stage,
<pb facs="tcp:58014:8"/>
as that is beyond the common words and actions of humane life: and therefore, in the scanting of his Images, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, he comply'd not enough with the greatness and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of an Heroick Poem.</p>
            <p>I am sorry I cannot discover my opinion of this kind of writing, without dissenting much from his; whose memory I love and honour. But I will do it with the same respect to him as if he were now alive, and overlooking my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per while I write. his judgment of an Heroick Poem was this, <hi>That it ought to be dress'd in a more familiar and easy shape: more fitted to the common actions and passions of humane life: and, in short, more like a glass of Nature, showing us our selves in our ordinary habits: and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a more practicable vertue to us, then was done by the Antients or Moderns:</hi> thus he takes the Image of an Heroick Poem from the <hi>Drama,</hi> or stage Poetry: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, intended to divide it into five Books, representing the same number of Acts; and every Book into several <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's,</hi> imitating the Scenes which compose our Acts.</p>
            <p>But this, I think, is rather Play in Narration (as I may call it) than an Heroick Poem. If at least you will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the opinion of a single man to the practice of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Authors both of Antient and latter ages. I am no admirer of Quotations; but you shall hear, if you please, one of the Ancients delivering his judgment on this question: 'tis <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> the most elegant, and one of the most judicious Authors of the Latine tongue: who, after he had given many admirable rules, for the structure, and beauties of an Epick Poem, concludes all in these following words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non enim res gestae versibus comprehendae sunt; quod longÃ¨ melius Historici faciunt: sed, perambages, Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque ministeria, praecipitandus est liber Spiritus, ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae orationis, sub testibus, fides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which sentence, and in his own Essay of a Poem, which immediately he gives you, it is thought he taxes <hi>Lucan;</hi> who follow'd too much the truth of history, crowded Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:58014:8"/>
together, was too full of points, and too often offer'd at somewhat which had more of the sting of an Epigram, than of the dignity and state of an Heroick Poem. <hi>Lucan</hi> us'd not much the help of his heathen Deities, there was neither the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Gods, nor the precipitation of the Soul, nor the fury of a Prophet, (of which my Author speaks) in his <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia:</hi> he treats you more like a Philosopher, than a Poet: and instructs you, in verse, with what he had been taught by his Vncle <hi>Seneca,</hi> in Prose. In one word, he walks so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, a foot, when he might fly. Yet <hi>Lucan</hi> is not alwayes this Religious historian. the Oracle of <hi>Appius,</hi> and the witchcraft of <hi>Erictho</hi> will somewhat attone for him, who was, indeed, bound up by an ill-chosen, and known argument, to follow truth, with great exactness. For my part, I am of opinion, that neither <hi>Homer, Virgil, Statius, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osto, Tasso,</hi> nor our <hi>English Spencer</hi> could have form'd their Poems half so beautiful, without those Gods and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and those Enthusiastick parts of Poetry, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the most noble parts of all their writings. and I will ask any man who loves Heroick Poetry, (for I will not dispute their tastes who do not) if the Ghost of <hi>Polydorus</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Enchanted wood in <hi>Tasso,</hi> and the Bower of bliss, in <hi>Spencer</hi> (which he borrows from that admirable <hi>Italian</hi>) could have been omitted without taking from their works some of the greatest beauties in them. and if any man object the improbabilities of a spirit appearing, or of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace rais'd by Magick, I boldly answer him, that an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Poet is not ty'd to a bare representation of what is true, or exceeding probable: but that he may let himself loose to visionary objects, and to the representation of such things, as depending not on sence, and therefore not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by knowledge, may give him a freer scope for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. 'Tis enough that in all ages and Religions, the greatest part of mankind have believ'd the power of Magick, and that there are Spirits, or Spectres, which have appear'd. This I say is foundation enough for Poetry: and I dare far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirm that the whole Doctrine of separated beings, whether those Spirits are incorporeal substances, (which
<pb facs="tcp:58014:9"/>
Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> with some reason thinks to imply a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,) or that they are a thinner and more Aerial sort of bodies (as some of the Fathers have conjectur'd) may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be explicated by Poets, than by Philosophers or Divines. For their speculations on this subject are wholy Poetical; they have onely their fancy for their guide, and that, being sharper in an excellent Poet, than it is likely it should in a phlegmatick, heavy gown-man, will see farther, in its own Empire, and produce more satisfactory notions on those dark and doubtful Problems.</p>
            <p>Some men think they have rais'd a great argument against the use of Spectres and Magique in Heroique Poetry, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, They are unnatural: but, whether they or I believe there are such things, is not material, 'tis enough that, for ought we know, they may be in Nature: and what ever is or may be, is not properly, unnatural. Neither am I much concern'd at Mr. <hi>Cowleys</hi> verses before <hi>Gondibert;</hi> (though his authority is almost sacred to me:) 'Tis true, he has resembled the old <hi>Epique</hi> Poetry to a fantastique fayery land: but he has contradicted himself by his own Example. For, he has himself made use of Angels, and Visions in his <hi>Davideis,</hi> as well as <hi>Tasso</hi> in his <hi>Godfrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have written on this Subject will not be thought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression by the Reader, if he please to remember what I said in the beginning of this Essay, that I have modell'd my He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roique Playes, by the Rules of an Heroique Poem. And, if that be the most noble, the most pleasant and the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive way of writing in verse, and, withall, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est patern of humane life, as all Poets have agreed, I shall need no other Argument to justifie my choice in this imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One advantage the <hi>Drama</hi> has above the other, namely, that it represents to view, what the Poem onely does relate, and, <hi>Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures, Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus,</hi> as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> tells us.</p>
            <p>To those who object my frequent use of Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; and my representations of Battels, I answer, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd them not on the English Stage, <hi>Shakespear</hi> us'd
<pb facs="tcp:58014:9"/>
them frequently: and, though <hi>Jonson</hi> shows no Battel in his <hi>Catiline,</hi> yet you hear from behind the Scenes, the sounding of Trumpets, and the shouts of fighting Armies. But, I add farther; that these warlike Instruments, and, even the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of fighting on the Stage, are no more than necessary to produce the effects of an Heroick Play. that is, to raise the imagination of the Audience, and to perswade them, for the time, that what they behold on the <hi>Theater</hi> is really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. The Poet is, then, to endeavour an absolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the minds of the Spectators: for, though our fancy will contribute to its own deceipt, yet a Writer ought to help its operation. and that the <hi>Red Bull</hi> has formerly done the same, is no more an Argument against our practice, than it would be for a Physician to forbear an approv'd medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Mountebank has us'd it with success.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a short account of Heroick Plays. I might now, with the usual eagerness of an Author, make a particular defence of this. but the common opinion (how unjust soever,) has been so much to my advantage, that I have reason to be satisfi'd: and to suffer, with patience, all that can be urg'd against it.</p>
            <p>For, otherwise, what can be more easy for me, than to defend the character of <hi>Almanzor,</hi> which is one great excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is made against the Play? 'Tis said that <hi>Almanzor</hi> is no perfect pattern of Heroick vertue: that he is a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Kings; and that he is made to perform impossibilities.</p>
            <p>I must therefore, avow, in the first place, from whence I took the Character. the first Image I had of him was from the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> the next from <hi>Tasso's Rinaldo,</hi> (who was a copy of the former:) and the third from the <hi>Artaban</hi> of <hi>Monsieur Calprenede</hi>: (who has imitated both.) the original of these, (<hi>Achilles</hi>) is taken by <hi>Homer</hi> for his Heroe: and is described by him as one, who in strength and courage surpass'd the rest of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army: but, withall, of so fiery a temper, so impatient of an injury, even from his King, and General, that, when his Mistress was to be forc'd from him by the command of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> he not onely disobey'd it; but return'd him an answer full of
<pb facs="tcp:58014:10"/>
contumely; and in the most approbrious terms he could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. they are <hi>Homers</hi> words which follow, and I have cited but some few amongst a multitude.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58014:10"/>You see how little these great Authors did esteem the point of Honour, so much magnified by the <hi>French,</hi> and so ridiculously ap'd by us. They made their <hi>Hero's</hi> men of honour; but so, as not to divest them quite of humane passions, and frailties. they contented themselves to show you, what men of great spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits would certainly do, when they were provok'd, not what they were oblig'd to do by the strict rules of moral vertue. for my own part, I declare my self for <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Tasso;</hi> and am more in love with <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> than with <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Oroondates.</hi> I shall never subject my characters to the <hi>French</hi> standard; where Love and Honour are to be weigh'd by drams and scruples. yet, where I have design'd the patterns of exact vertue, such as in this Play are the Parts of <hi>Almahide,</hi> of <hi>Ozmyn,</hi> and <hi>Benzayda,</hi> I may safely challenge the best of theirs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Almanzor</hi> is tax'd with changing sides: And what tye has he on him to the contrary? he is not born their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whom he serves: and he is injur'd by them to a very high degree. he threatens them, and speaks insolently of Sovereign Power: but so do <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Rinaldo;</hi> who were Subjects and Soldiers to <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloign.</hi> he talks extravagantly in his Passion: but, if I would take the pains to quote an hundred passages of <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi>'s <hi>Cethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> I could easily shew you that the <hi>Rhodomontades</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi> are neither so irrational as his<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor so impossible to be put in execution. for <hi>Cethegus</hi> threatens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Nature, and to raise a new one out of it: to kill all the Senate for his part of the action; to look <hi>Cato</hi> dead; and a thousand other things as extravagant, he sayes, but performs not one Action in the Play.</p>
            <p>But none of the former calumnies will stick: and, therefore, 'tis at last charg'd upon me that <hi>Almanzor</hi> does all things: or if you will have an absurd Accusation, in their non-sence who make it, that he performs impossibilities. they say, that being a stranger he appeases two fighting factions, when the Authority of their Lawful Soverign could not. this is, indeed, the most improbable of all his actions: but, 'tis far from being impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Their King had made himself contemptible to his
<pb facs="tcp:58014:11"/>
people, as the History of <hi>Granada</hi> tells us. and <hi>Almanzor,</hi> though a stranger, yet, was already known to them, by his gallantry in the <hi>Juego de toros,</hi> his engagement on the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er side, and, more especially, by the character of his person, and brave actions, given by <hi>Abdalla</hi> just before. and, after all, the greatness of the enterprize consisted onely in the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: for, he had the Kings guards to second him. but we have read both of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and many other Generals, who have not onely calm'd a Mutiny with a word, but have present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves single before an Army of their enemies; which, upon sight of them, has revolted from their own Leaders, and come over to their trenches. In the rest of <hi>Almanzors</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you see him for the most part victorious: but, the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has constantly attended many Heroes who were not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary. Yet, you see it no Inheritance to him. for, in the first Part, he is made a Prisoner: and, in the last, defeated; and not able to preserve the City from being taken. If the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the late Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> be true, he hazarded more and perform'd not less in <hi>Naples,</hi> than <hi>Almanzor</hi> is feign'd to have done in <hi>Granada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been too tedious in this Apology; but to make some satisfaction, I will leave the rest of my Play, expos'd to the Criticks, without defence.</p>
            <p>The concernment of it is wholly past from me, and ought to be in them, who have been favorable to it, and are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what oblig'd to defend their own opinions. That there are errors in it, I deny not:
<q>
                  <l>Aft opere in tanto fas est obrepere Somnum.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But I have already swept the stakes; and with the common good fortune of prosperous Gamesters, can be content to sit quietly; to hear my fortune curst by some, and my faults arraign'd by others, and to suffer both without reply.</p>

                  <p>Spoken by Mris. <hi>Ellen Guyn</hi> in a broad-brim'd hat, and wast belt.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>THis jeast was first of t'other houses making,</l>
                     <l>And, five times try'd, has never fail'd of taking.</l>
                     <l>For 'twere a shame a Poet shoud be kill'd</l>
                     <l>Vnder the shelter of so broad a shield.</l>
                     <l>This is that hat whose very sight did win yee</l>
                     <l>To laugh and clap, as though the Devil were in yee.</l>
                     <l>As then, for <hi>Nokes,</hi> so now, I hope, you'l be</l>
                     <l>So dull, to laugh, once more, for love of me.</l>
                     <l>I'll write a Play, sayes one, for I have got</l>
                     <l>A broad-brim'd hat, and wastbelt tow'rds a Plot.</l>
                     <l>Sayes t'other, I have one more large than that:</l>
                     <l>Thus they out-write each other with a hat.</l>
                     <l>The brims still grew with every Play they writ;</l>
                     <l>And grew so large, they cover'd all the wit.</l>
                     <l>Hat was the Play: 'twas language, wit and tale:</l>
                     <l>Like them that find, Meat, drink, and cloth, in Ale.</l>
                     <l>What dulness do these Mungrill-wits confess</l>
                     <l>When all their hope is acting of a dress!</l>
                     <l>Thus two, the best Comedians of the Age</l>
                     <l>Must be worn out, with being blocks o'th' Stage.</l>
                     <l>Like a young Girl, who better things has known,</l>
                     <l>Beneath their Poets Impotence they groan.</l>
                     <l>See now, what Charity it was to save!</l>
                     <l>They thought you lik'd, what onely you forgave:</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb facs="tcp:58014:12"/>And brought you more dull sence. -dull sence, much worse</l>
                     <l>Than brisk, gay Non-sence; and the heavyer Curse.</l>
                     <l>They bring old Ir'n, and glass upon the Stage,</l>
                     <l>To barter with the Indians of our Age.</l>
                     <l>Still they write on; and like great Authors show:</l>
                     <l>But 'tis as Rowlers in wet gardens grow;</l>
                     <l>Heavy with dirt, and gath'ring as they goe.</l>
                     <l>May none who have so little understood</l>
                     <l>To like such trash, presume to praise what's good!</l>
                     <l>And may those drudges of the Stage, whose fate</l>
                     <l>Is, damn'd dull farce more dully to translate,</l>
                     <l>Fall under that excise the State thinks fit</l>
                     <l>To set on all French wares, whose worst, is wit.</l>
                     <l>French farce worn out at home, is sent abroad;</l>
                     <l>And, patch'd up here, is made our English mode.</l>
                     <l>Hence forth, let Poets, 'ere allow'd to write,</l>
                     <l>Be search'd, like Duellists, before they fight,</l>
                     <l>For wheel-broad hats, dull humour, all that chasse,</l>
                     <l>Which makes you mourn, and makes the Vulgar laugh.</l>
                     <l>For these, in Playes, are as unlawful Arms,</l>
                     <l>As, in a Combat, Coats of Mayle, and Charms.</l>

                     <hi>A</hi> Pretty task! and so I told the Fool,</l>
                  <l>Who needs would undertake to please by Rule:</l>
                  <l>He thought that, if his Characters were good,</l>
                  <l>The Scenes entire, and freed from noise and bloud;</l>
                  <l>The Action great, yet circumscrib'd by Time,</l>
                  <l>The Words not forc'd, but sliding into Rhime,</l>
                  <l>The Passions rais'd and calm'd by just Degrees,</l>
                  <l>As Tides are swell'd, and then retire to Seas;</l>
                  <l>He thought, in hitting these, his bus'ness done,</l>
                  <l>Though he, perhaps, has fail'd in ev'ry one:</l>
                  <l>But, after all, a Poet must confess,</l>

                  <head>PROLOGUE To the Second Part, OF THE CONQUEST OF Granada.</head>
                  <l>THey who write Ill, and they who ne'r durst write,</l>
                  <l>Turn Critiques, out of meer Revenge and Spight:</l>
                  <l>A <hi>Play-house</hi> gives 'em Fame; and up there starts,</l>
                  <l>From a mean Fifth-rate Wit, a Man of Parts.</l>
                  <l>(So Common Faces on the Stage appear:</l>
                  <l>We take 'em in; and they turn Beauties here.)</l>
                  <l>Our Authour fears those Critiques as his Fate:</l>
                  <l>And those he Fears, by consequence, must Hate.</l>
                  <l>For they the Trafficque of all Wit, invade;</l>
                  <l>As Scriv'ners draw away the Bankers Trade.</l>
                  <l>Howe're, the Poet's safe enough to day:</l>
                  <l>They cannot censure an unfinish'd Play.</l>
                  <l>But, as when Vizard Masque appears in Pit,</l>
                  <l>Straight, every man who thinks himself a Wit,</l>
                  <l>Perks up; and, managing his Comb, with grace,</l>
                  <l>With his white Wigg sets off his Nut-brown Face:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58014:53"/>That done, bears up to th'prize, and views each Limb,</l>
                  <l>To know her by her Rigging and her Trimm:</l>
                  <l>Thou, the whole noise of Fopps to wagers go,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Pox on her,</hi> 't must be she; and <hi>Damm'ee</hi> no:</l>
                  <l>Iust so I Prophecy, these Wits to day,</l>
                  <l>Will blindly guess at our imperfect Play:</l>
                  <l>With what new Plots our Second Part is fill'd;</l>
                  <l>Who must be kept alive, and who be kill'd.</l>
                  <l>And as those Vizard Masques maintain that Fashion,</l>
                  <l>To sooth and tickle sweet Imagination:</l>
                  <l>So, our dull Poet keeps you on with Masquing;</l>
                  <l>To make you think there's something worth your asking:</l>
                  <l>But when 'tis shown, that which does now delight you,</l>
                  <l>Will prove a Dowdy, with a Face to fright you.</l>

                  <l>THey, who have best succeeded on the Stage,</l>
                  <l>Have still conform'd their Genius to their Age.</l>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Jonson</hi> did Mechanique humour show,</l>
                  <l>When men were dull, and conversation low.</l>
                  <l>Then, Comedy was faultless, but 'twas course:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Cobbs</hi> Tankard was a jest, and <hi>Otter's</hi> horse.</l>
                  <l>And as their Comedy, their love was mean:</l>
                  <l>Except, by chance, in some one labour'd Scene,</l>
                  <l>Which must attone for an ill-written Play.</l>
                  <l>They rose; but at their height could seldome stay.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Fame</hi> then was cheap, and the first commer sped;</l>
                  <l>And they have kept it since, by being dead,</l>
                  <l>But were they now to write when Critiques weigh</l>
                  <l>Each Line, and ev'ry word, throughout a Play,</l>
                  <l>None of 'em, no not <hi>Jonson,</hi> in his height</l>
                  <l>Could pass, without allowing grains for weight.</l>
                  <l>Think it not envy that these truths are told,</l>
                  <l>Our Poet's not malicious, though he's bold.</l>
                  <l>'Tis not to brand 'em that their faults are shown,</l>
                  <l>But, by their errours, to excuse his own.</l>
                  <l>If Love and Honour now are higher rais'd,</l>
                  <l>'Tis not the Poet, but the Age is prais'd.</l>
                  <l>Wit's now ariv'd to a more high degree;</l>
                  <l>Our native Language more refin'd and free.</l>
                  <l>Our Ladies and our men now speak more wit.</l>
                  <l>In conversation, than those Poets writ.</l>

                     <pb facs="tcp:58014:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>Then, one of these is, consequently, true;</l>
                  <l>That what this Poet writes comes short of you,</l>
                  <l>And imitates you ill, (which most he fears)</l>
                  <l>Or else his writing is not worse than theirs.</l>
                  <l>Yet, though you judge, (as sure the Critiques will)</l>
                  <l>That some before him writ with greater skill,</l>
                  <l>In this one praise he has their fame surpast,</l>
                  <l>To please an Age more Gallant than the last.</l>

                  <head>Defence of the EPILOGUE. Or, An Essay on the <hi>Dramatique Poetry</hi> of the last Age.</head>
                  <p>THe promises of Authors, that they will write again, are in effect, a threatning of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with some new impertinence, and they who perform not what they promise, will have their pardon on easy terms. 'Tis from this consideration that I could be glad to spare you the trouble which I am now giving you, of a Preface, if I were not oblig'd by many reasons to write somewhat concerning our present Playes, and those of our predecessors on the English stage. The truth is, I have so farr ingag'd my self in a bold <hi>Epilogue</hi> to this Play, wherein I have somewhat tax'd the former writing, that it was necessary for me either not to print it, or to show that I could defend it. Yet, I would so maintain my opinion of the present Age, as not to be wanting in my veneration for the past: I would ascribe to dead Authors their just praises, in those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have excell'd us: and in those wherein we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58014:97"/>
with them for the preheminence, I would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our advantages to the Age, and claim no victory from our wit. This being what I have propos'd to my self, I hope I shall not be thought arrogant when I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into their Errors. For, we live in an Age, so Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptical, that as it determines little, so it takes nothing from Antiquity on trust and I profess to have no other ambition in this Essay, than that Poetry may not go backward, when all other Arts and Sciences are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. Whoever censures me for this inquiry, let him hear his Character from <hi>Horace</hi>:
<q>
                        <l>Ingeniis non ille favet plauditque sepultis,</l>
                        <l>Nostra sed impugnat; nos nostraque Lividus odit.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He favours not dead wits, but hates the living.</p>
                  <p>It was upbraided to that excellent Poet that he was an enemy to the writings of his Predecessor <hi>Lucilius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had said, <hi>Lucilium luculentum fluere,</hi> that he ran muddy: and that he ought to have retrench'd from his Satyrs many unnecessary verses. But <hi>Horace</hi> makes <hi>Lucilius</hi> himself to justifie him from the imputation of Envy, by telling you that he would have done the same had he liv'd in an age which was more refin'd.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Si foret hoc nostrum, fato, delapsus in aevum,</l>
                     <l>Detraheret sibi multa, recideret omne quod ultra</l>
                     <l>Perfectum traheretur: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And, both in the whole course of that Satyr, and in his most admirable Epistle to <hi>Augustus,</hi> he makes it his business to prove that Antiquity alone is no plea for the excellency of a Poem: but, that one Age learning from another, the last (if we can suppose an equallity of wit in the writers,) has the advantage of knowing more, and better than the former. and this I think is the state of the question in dispute. It is therefore my part to make it clear, that the Language, Wit, and Conversation of our Age are improv'd and refin'd above the last: and then
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58014:98"/>
it will not be difficult, to inferr, that our Playes have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd some part of those advantages.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, therefore, it will be necessary to state, in general, what this refinement is of which we treat: and that I think will not be defin'd amiss: <hi>An improvement of our Wit, Language, and Conversation. or, an alteration in them for the better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with <hi>Language.</hi> That an Alteration is late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made in ours or since the Writers of the last Age (in which I comprehend <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Ionson</hi>) is manifest. Any man who reads those excellent Poets, and compares their language with what is now written, will see it almost in every line. But, that this is an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> of the Language, or an alteration for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will not so easily be granted. For many are of a contrary opinion, that the English tongue was then in the height of its perfection; that, from <hi>Ionsons</hi> time to ours, it has been in a continual declination; like that of the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Age of <hi>Virgil</hi> to <hi>Statius,</hi> and so downward to <hi>Claudian</hi>: of which, not onely <hi>Petronius,</hi> but <hi>Quintilian</hi> himself so much complains, under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Secundus,</hi> in his famous Dialogue <hi>de causis corruptae cloquentiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to shew that our Language is improv'd; and that those people have not a just value for the Age in which they live, let us consider in what the refinement of a language principally consists: that is, <hi>either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting such old words or phrases which are ill sounding, or improper, or in admitting new, which are more proper, more sounding and more significant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reader will easily take notice that when I speak of rejecting improper words and phrases I mention not such as are Antiquated by custome onely: and, as I may say, without any fault of theirs: for in this case the refinement can be but accidental: that is when the words and phrases which are rejected happen to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. Neither would I be understood (when I speak of impropriety in Language) either wholly to accuse
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58014:98"/>
the last Age, or to excuse the present; and least of all my self. For all writers have their imperfections and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but I may safely conclude in the general, that our improprieties are less frequent, and less gross than theirs. One Testimony of this is undeniable, that we are the first who have observ'd them. and, certainly, to observe errours is a great step to the correcting of them. But, malice and partiality set apart, let any man who understands English, read diligently the works of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi>; and I dare undertake that he will find, in every page either some <hi>Solecism</hi> of Speech, or some notorious flaw in Sence: and yet these men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd when we are not forgiven. That their wit is great and many times their expressions noble, envy it self cannot deny.
<q>
                        <l>â€”Neque ego illis detrahere ausim</l>

                     </q>
but the times were ignorant in which they liv'd. Poetry was then, if not in its infancy among us, at least not arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd its vigor and maturity: witness the lameness of their Plots: many of which, especially those which they writ first, (for even that Age refin'd it self in some measure,) were made up of some ridiculous, incoherent story, which, in one Play many times took up the business of an Age. I suppose I need not name <hi>Pericles Prince</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> nor the Historical Plays of <hi>Shakespear.</hi> Besides many of the rest as the <hi>Winters Tale, Love's labour lost, Measure for Measure,</hi> which were either grounded on impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or at least, so meanly written, that the Comedy neither caus'd your mirth, nor the serious part your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. If I would expatiate on this Subject, I could easily demonstrate that our admir'd <hi>Fletcher,</hi> who writ after him, neither understood correct Plotting, nor that which they call <hi>the Decorum of the Stage.</hi> I would not search in his worst Playes for examples: he who will consider his <hi>Philaster, his Humorous Lieutenant, his Faithful</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:58014:99"/>
Shepheardess; and many others which I could name, will find them much below the applause which is now given them. he will see <hi>Philaster</hi> wounding his Mistriss, and afterwards his Boy, to save himself: Not to mention the Clown who enters immediately, and not only has the advantage of the Combat against the Heroe, but diverts you from your serious concernment, with his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and absurd Raillery. In his <hi>Humorous Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> you find his <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Leoncius</hi> staying in the midst of a routed Army to hear the cold mirth of the <hi>Lieutenant:</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> afterwards appearing with a Pistol in his hand, in the next Age to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. And for his <hi>Shepheard,</hi> he falls twice into the former indecency of wounding Women. but these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, which those Poets committed, may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be call'd the Ages fault than theirs. for, besides the want of Education and Learning, (which was their particular unhappiness) they wanted the benefit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. but of that, I shall speak hereafter, in a place more proper for it. Their Audiences knew no better: and therefore were satisfy'd with what they brought. Those who call theirs the <hi>Golden Age of Poetry,</hi> have only this reason for it, that they were then content with Acorns, before they knew the use of Bread: or that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> was become a Proverb. They had many who admir'd them, and few who blam'd them. and, certainly, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Critique is the greatest help to a good Wit. he does the Office of a Friend, while he designs that of an Enemy: and his malice keeps a Poet within those bounds, which the Luxuriancy of his Fancy would tempt him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leap.</p>
                  <p>But it is not their Plots which I meant, principally to tax: I was speaking of their Sence and Language. and I dare almost challenge any man to show me a page toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is correct in both. As for <hi>Ben. Iohnson,</hi> I am loath to name him, because he is a most Judicsous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet he very often falls into these errors. And I once more beg the Readers pardon, for accusing him or them.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58014:99"/>
Onely let him consider that I live in an age where my least faulrs are severely censur'd: and that I have no way left to extenuate my failings but my showing as great in those whom we admire.

In reading some bombast speeches of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> which are not to be understood, he us'd to say that it was horrour. and I am much afraid that this is so.

                     </q>
The Sence is here extreamly perplex'd: and I doubt the word <hi>They</hi> is false Grammar.

A <hi>Synchoesis,</hi> or ill placing of words, of which <hi>Tully</hi> so much complains in Oratory.

                        <l>The Waves, and Dens of beasts cou'd not receive</l>

The Preposition in the end of the sentence; a common fault with him, and which I have but lately observ'd in my own writings.

                     </q>
Here are both the former faults: for, besides that the Preposition <hi>unto,</hi> is plac'd last in the verse, and at the half period, and is redundant, there is the former <hi>Synchoesis,</hi> in the words (<hi>The Sword nor Surfeits</hi>) which in constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to have been plac'd before the other.</p>

To <hi>go on upon,</hi> is onely to go on twice. to give fire at face of a full cloud, was not understood in his own time: (and stand his <hi>ire</hi>) besides the antiquated word <hi>ire</hi> there is the Article His, which makes false construction: and Giving fire at the face of a cloud, is a perfect image of shooting, however it came to be known in those daies to <hi>Catiline.</hi>

                  <p>Well placing of Words for the sweetness of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation was not known till Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> introduc'd it: and therefore 'tis not to be wonder'd if <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> has many such lines as these

                  </p>
                  <p>But meaness of expression one would think not to be his error in a Tragedy, which ought to be more high and sounding than any other kind of Poetry and yet amongst many others in <hi>Catiline</hi> I find these four lines together:
<q>
                        <l>So <hi>Asia,</hi> thou art cruelly even</l>
                        <l>With us, for all the blows thee given:</l>
                        <l>When we, whose Vertues conquer'd thee,</l>
                        <l>Thus, by thy Vices, ruin'd be.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be there</hi> is false <hi>English,</hi> for <hi>are</hi>: though the Rhyme hides it.</p>
                  <p>But I am willing to close the Book, partly out of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Author, partly out of weariness to pursue an argument which is so fruitful in so small a compass. And what correctness, after this, can be expected from <hi>Shakespear</hi> or from <hi>Fletcher,</hi> who wanted that Learning and Care which <hi>Iohnson</hi> had? I will therefore spare my own trouble of inquiring into their faults: who had they liv'd now, had doubtless written more correctly. I suppose it will be enough for me to affirm (as I think I safely may) that these and the like errors which I tax'd in the most correct of the last Age, are such, into which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58014:101"/>
we doe not ordinarily fall. I think few of our present Writers would have left behind them such a line as this,
<q>
                        <l>Contain your Spirit in more stricter bounds.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that gross way of two Comparatives was then, ordinary: and therefore more pardonable in <hi>Iohnson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the other part of refining, which consists in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving new Words and Phrases, I shall not insist much on it. 'Tis obvious that we have admitted many: some of which we wanted, and<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> therefore our Language is the richer for them: as it would be by importation of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: others are rather Ornamental than Necessary; yet by their admission, the Language is become more courtly: and our thoughts are better drest. These are to be found scatter'd in the Writers of our Age: and it is not my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to collect them. They who have lately written with most care, have, I believe, taken the Rule of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> for their guide; that is, not to be too hasty in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Words: but rather to stay till Custome has made them familiar to us,
<q>
                        <l>Quem penes, arbitrium est, &amp; jus &amp; norma loquendi.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For I cannot approve of their way of refining, who corrupt our <hi>English</hi> Idiom by mixing it too much with <hi>French</hi>: that is a Sophistication of Language, not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it: a turning <hi>English</hi> into <hi>French,</hi> rather than a refining of <hi>English</hi> by <hi>French.</hi> We meet daily with those Fopps, who value themselves on their Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and pretend they cannot express their meaning in <hi>English,</hi> because they would put off to us some <hi>French</hi> Phrase of the last Edition: without considering that, for ought they know, we have a better of our own; but these are not the men who are to refine us: their Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is to prescribe Fashions, not Words: at best they are onely serviceable to a Writer, so as <hi>Ennius</hi> was to <hi>Virgil.</hi> He may. <hi>Aurum ex stercore colligere.</hi> for 'tis hard if, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58014:101"/>
many insignificant Phrases, there happen not something worth preserving: though they themselves, like <hi>Indians,</hi> know not the value of their own Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another way of improving Language, which Poets especially have practic'd in all Ages: that is by applying receiv'd words to a new Signification. and this I believe, is meant by <hi>Horace,</hi> in that Precept which is so variously constru'd by Expositors:
<q>
                        <l>Dixeris EgregiÃ©, notum si callida verbum,</l>
                        <l>Reddiderit junctura novum.</l>
                     </q>
And, in this way, he himself had a particular happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: using all the Tropes, and particularly Metaphors, with that grace which is observable in his Odes: where the Beauty of Expression is often greater than that of thought. as in that one example, amongst an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others; <hi>Et vultus nimium lubricus aspici.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore though he innovated little, he may justly be call'd a great Refiner of the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue. This choice of words, and height'ning of their natural signification, was observ'd in him by the Writers of the following Ages: for <hi>Petronius</hi> says of him, <hi>&amp; Horatii curiosa faelicitas.</hi> By this graffing, as I may call it, on old words, has our Tongue been Beautified by the three fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Poets, <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Iohnson:</hi> whose Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies I can never enough admire. and in this, they have been follow'd especially by Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling</hi> and Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> who refin'd upon them. neither have they, who now succeed them, been wanting in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to adorn our Mother Tongue: but it is not so lawful for me to praise my living Contemporaries, as to admire my dead Predecessors.</p>
                  <p>I should now speak of the Refinement of Wit: but I have been so large on the former Subject that I am forc'd to contract my self in this. I will therefore onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to you, that the wit of the last Age, was yet
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58014:102"/>
more incorrect than their language. <hi>Shakespear,</hi> who many times has written better than any Poet, in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is yet so far from writing Wit always, or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that Wit according to the Dignity of the Subject, that he writes in many places, belowâ€”the dullest Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ours, or of any precedent Age. Never did any Author precipitate himself from such heights of thought to so low expressions, as he often does. He is the very <hi>Ianus</hi> of Poets; he wears, almost every where two faces<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and you have scarce begun to admire the one, e're you despise the other. Neither is the Luxuriance of <hi>Fletcher,</hi> (which his friends have tax'd in him,) a less fault than the carelessness of <hi>Shakespear.</hi> He does not well always, and, when he does, he is a true <hi>Englishman</hi>; he knows not when to give over. If he wakes in one Scene he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly slumbers in another: And if he pleases you in the first three Acts, he is frequently so tir'd with his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, that he goes heavily in the fourth and, sinks under his burden in the fifth.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Ben. Iohnson,</hi> the most judicious of Poets, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways writ properly; and as the Character requir'd: and I will not contest farther with my Friends who call that Wit. It being very certain, that even folly it self, well represented, is Wit in a larger signification: and that there is Fancy, as well as Judgement in it; though not so much or noble: because all Poetry being imitation, that of Folly is a lower exercise of Fancy, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as difficult as the other: for 'tis a kind of looking downward in the Poet; and representing that part of Mankind which is below him.</p>
                  <p>In these low Characters of Vice and Folly, lay the excellency of that inimitable Writer: who, when at any time, he aim'd at Wit, in the stricter sence, that is Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Conceit, was forc'd either to borrow from the Ancients, as, to my knowledge he did very much from <hi>Plautus:</hi> or, when he trusted himself alone, often fell into meanness of expression. Nay, he was not free from the lowest and most groveling kind of Wit, which we
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58014:102"/>
call clenches; of which, <hi>Every Man in his Humour,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely full. and, which is worse, the wittiest persons in the <hi>Drama</hi> speak them. His other Comedies are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from them: will you give me leave to name some few? <hi>Asper,</hi> in which Character he personates himself, (and he neither was, nor thought himself a fool.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against the ignorant Judges of the Age, speaks thus.</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>But, it may be you will object that this was <hi>Asper, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilente,</hi> or, <hi>Carlo Buffone</hi>: you shall, therefore, hear him speak in his own person: and, that, in the two last lines, or sting of an Epigram; 'tis Inscribd to <hi>Fine Grand</hi>: who, he says, was indebted to him for many things, which he reckons there: and concludes thus;
<q>
                        <l>Forty things more, <hi>dear Grand,</hi> which you know true,</l>
                        <l>For which, or pay me quickly, or I'le pay you.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was then the mode of wit, the vice of the Age and not <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi>'s. for you see, a little before him, that admirable wit, Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> perpetually playing with his words. In his time, I believe, it ascended first into the Pulpit: where (if you will give me leave to clench too) it yet finds the benefit of its Clergy. for they are commonly the first corrupters of Eloquence,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58014:103"/>
and the last reform'd from vicious Oratory: as a famous <hi>Italian</hi> has observ'd before me, in his Treatise of the Corruption of the <hi>Italian Tongue</hi>; which he principally ascribes to Priests and preaching Friars.</p>
                  <p>But, to conclude with what brevity I can; I will only add this in the defence of our present Writers, that if they reach not some excellencies of <hi>Ben. Ionson</hi>; (which no Age, I am confident, ever shall) yet, at least, they are above that meanness of thought which I have tax'd, and which is frequent in him.</p>
                  <p>That the wit of this Age is much more Courtly, may easily be prov'd by viewing the Characters of Gentlemen which were written in the last. First, for <hi>Ionson, True-Wit</hi> in the <hi>Silent Woman,</hi> was his Master-piece. and <hi>True-wit</hi> was a Scholar-like kind of man, a Gentleman with an allay of Pedantry: a man who seems mortifi'd to the world, by much reading. The best of his discourse, is drawn, not from the knowledge of the Town, but Books. and, in short, he would be a fine Gentleman, in an University. <hi>Shakespear</hi> show'd the best of his skill in his <hi>Mercutio,</hi> and he said himself, that he was forc'd to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being kill'd by him. But, for my part, I cannot find he was so dangerous a person: I see nothing in him but what was so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harmless, that he might have liv'd to the end of the Play, and dy'd in his bed, without offence to any man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fletcher's Don Iohn</hi> is our onely Bug-bear: and yet, I may affirm, without suspition of flattery, that he now speaks better, and that his Character is maintain'd with much more vigour in the fourth and fifth Acts than it was by <hi>Fletcher</hi> in the three former. I have alwayes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd the wit of our Predecessors, with all the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which becomes me, but, I am sure, their wit was not that of Gentlemen, there was ever somewhat that was ill-bred and Clownish in it: and which confest the conversation of the Authors.</p>
                  <p>And this leads me to the last and greatest advantage of our writing, which proceeds from conversation. In
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58014:103"/>
the Age, wherein those Poets liv'd, there was less of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry than in ours; neither did they keep the best com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of theirs. Their fortune has been much like that of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in the retirement of his Gardens: to live almost unknown, and to be celebrated after their decease. I cannot find that any of them were conversant in Courts, except <hi>Ben. Ionson:</hi> and his <hi>genius</hi> lay not so much that way, as to make an improvement by it. greatness was not, then, so easy of access, nor conversation so free as now it is. I cannot, therefore, conceive it any insolence to affirm, that, by the knowledge, and pattern of their wit, who writ before us, and by the advantage of our own conversation, the discourse and Raillery of our <hi>Comedies</hi> excell what has been written by them. and this will be deny'd by none, but some few old fellows who value themselves on their acquaintance with the <hi>Black-Friars:</hi> who, because they saw their Playes, would pretend a right to judge ours. The memory of these grave Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen is their only Plea for being Wits. they can tell a story of <hi>Ben. Ionson,</hi> and perhaps have had fancy enough to give a supper in <hi>Apollo</hi> that they might be call'd his Sons: and because they were drawn in to be laught at in those times, they think themselves now suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently intitled to laugh at ours. Learning I never saw in any of them, and wit no more than they could remember. In short, they were unlucky to have been bred in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polish'd Age, and more unlucky to live to a resin'd one. They have lasted beyond their own, and are cast behind ours: and not contented to have known little at the age of twenty, they boast of their ignorance at threescore.</p>
                  <p>Now, if any ask me, whence it is that our conversation is so much refin'd? I must freely, and without flattery, ascribe it to the Court: and, in it, particularly to the King; whose example gives a law to it. His own mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and the Nations, afforded him an opportunity, which is rarely allow'd to Sovereign Princes, I mean of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and being conversant in the most polish'd Courts of <hi>Europe</hi>; and, thereby, of cultivating a Spirit, which was

form'd by Nature, to receive the impressions of a gallant and generous education. At his return, he found a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lost as much in Barbarism as in Rebellion. and as the excellency of his Nature forgave the one, so the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his manners reform'd the other. the desire of imitating so great a pattern, first waken'd the dull and heavy spirits of the <hi>English,</hi> from their natural reserv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: loosen'd them, from their stiff forms of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and made them easy and plyant to each other in discourse. Thus, insensibly, our way of living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more free: and the fire of the English wit, which was before stifled under a constrain'd melancholy way of breeding, began first to display its force: by mixing the solidity of our Nation, with the air and gayety of our neighbours. This being granted to be true, it would be a wonder, if the Poets, whose work is imitation, should be the onely persons in three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, who should not receive advantage by it: or, if they should not more easily imitate the wit and conversation of the present age, than of the past.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore admire the beauties and the heights of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> without falling after him into a carelesness and (as I may call it) a Lethargy of thought, for whole Scenes together. Let us imitate, as we are able, the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and easiness of <hi>Fletcher,</hi> without proposing him as a pattern to us, either in the redundancy of his matter, or the incorrectness of his language. Let us admire his wit and sharpness of conceit; but, let us at the same time acknowledge that it was seldome so fix'd, and made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his characters, as that the same things might not be spoken by any person in the Play. let us applaud his Scenes of Love; but, let us confess that he understood not either greatness or perfect honour in the parts of any of his women. In fine, let us allow, that he had so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much fancy, as when he pleas'd he could write wit: but that he wanted so much Judgment as seldome to have written humour; or describ'd a pleasant folly. Let us ascribe to <hi>Ionson</hi> the height and accuracy of Judgment,

in the ordering of his Plots, his choice of characters, and maintaining what he had chosen, to the end. but let us not think him a perfect pattern of imitation; except it be in humour: for Love, which is the foundation of all <hi>Comedies</hi> in other Languages, is scarcely mention'd in any of his Playes. and for humour it self, the Poets of this Age will be more wary than to imitate the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his persons. Gentlemen will now be entertain'd with the follies of each other: and though they allow <hi>Cob</hi> and <hi>Tib</hi> to speak properly, yet they are not much pleas'd with their Tankard or with their Raggs: And, surely, their conversation can be no jest to them on the <hi>Theatre,</hi> when they would avoid it in the street.</p>
                  <p>To conclude all, let us render to our Predecessors what is their due, without confineing our selves to a servile imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all they writ: and, without assuming to our selves the Title of better Poets, let us ascribe to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and civility of our age the advantage which we have above them; and to our knowledge of the customs and manners of it, the happiness we have to please be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them.</p>
