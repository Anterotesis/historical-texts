            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Question, <hi>Whether it is
for the Interest of</hi> England, <hi>at
this time, to New-Coin their
Clipt-Money, according to the Old Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
both for Weight and Fineness, or
to Coin it somewhat Lighter?</hi> has been,
of late, the business of the Press, and
the common subject of Debate.</p>
            <p>And since there has been so much
wrote and said <hi>Pro &amp; Con</hi> about this
matter, and yet <hi>Gentlemen</hi> continue
still unsatisfied, and of different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
I could not hope, from any
thing I might write, to have better
success, and therefore did not intend
to appear in Publick in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy:
Tho' I had the same reason
which is given for answering Mr.
<hi>Lowndes;</hi> that is, that by my silence
I might seem to renounce my own
Opinion, having some time since
wrote a <hi>Discourse of Trade,</hi> wherein
<pb facs="tcp:50853:3"/>
the definition of Money differs from
what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> asserts.</p>
            <p>But having consider'd the fatal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of coining the Money by the old
Standard, and that it was not necessary
that those Argumeuts that should be
offered to prevent it, should wholly
convince those that are of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Opinion; but that they would
have the same success, if they did
but create a Doubt. It seeming very
reasonable, that Persons in Doubt of
their own Opinion in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
might be persuaded to consent to
the trial of the contrary; not only
that they might thereby discover the
Truth, but because by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there appears so plain an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as the multiplying the <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of the Coin, and saving the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
near a Million of Money, in a
time when they are engaged in so
chargeable a War.</p>
            <p>I was therefore encouraged, in hopes
of such success, to offer my Reasons,
for raising the Value of the Money,
to Publick Consideration, that they
<pb facs="tcp:50853:3"/>
might be the better weigh'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd,
and at the same time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
which, both from the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Person that writes them,
and the Reception they seem to have
had from great Personages before
they were published, are of greatest
force in this Debate.</p>
            <p>That which seems to be the greatest
difficulty in clearing this Controversy
is, That it being about a matter where
Profit accompanies the decision of it,
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> are jealous of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
lest they should be biass'd by
private Interest, and so run contrary
to the Truth: which lessens the force
of the Arguments that are used in
such Debates.</p>
            <p>But this is an equal Objection
to the Reason on both sides: For as
the raising the Value of the Money
may be profitable to those that have
Interest in Banks, having great Cashes
in Old Money; so on the other
hand, the Coining of the Money to
the Old Standard, may be as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:50853:4"/>
to Banks by melting of it down;
and if there be any difference of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
it must be to the latter: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
besides the Profit by melting,
Nothing can be of greater Advantage
to Banks than scarcity of Money, when
men will be glad to take a Bank-Note
for want of it. And on the contrary,
nothing can be more disadvantageous
to Banks, especially to those young in
Credit, than plenty of New Money,
when the Money may be sooner told
than a Note writ: so that if I were to
consider my private Interest, I ought
to be of the contrary Opinion to that
I argue for.</p>
            <p>And therefore I hope I shall be
believ'd, when I declare that I have
no other design in writing this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
than the service of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
and I have the same Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to believe it of those that have
wrote for the contrary Opinion; and
that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> and I do in this agree,
tho' in our Arguments we differ. For
I cannot believe that any Person, for
his own private Interest, will argue
<pb facs="tcp:50853:4"/>
for the Coining the Money by the Old
Standard, when the Consequence of
it, in my Opinion, will be so fatal to
his Countrey; which will be no less
than the want of the <hi>species</hi> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
a stop of <hi>Trade,</hi> and a <hi>general
Complaint</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> all over the
Nation.</p>
            <p>I have followed the same Method
in answering Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> as he has used
in answering Mr. <hi>Lownds;</hi> which is,
by laying down several Propositions
contrary to Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s, and from thence
to argue and shew wherein his are
mistaken.</p>
            <p>I have chose rather to sum up the
chief substance of his Arguments for
the sake of Brevity, than to recite his
sense in his own words. And if in
any place I have mistaken his sense, I
do beg his pardon, and do assure him
that it was not wilfully, but for want
of right understanding of it: For I
have the same design as Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi>
That Truth betwixt us might appear;
and therefore shall use his own words,
<hi>That I shall think my self oblig'd to
<pb facs="tcp:50853:5"/>
him, or any one else, who shall shew me,
or the Publick, any material mistake in
any thing I have here said, whereon any
part of the Question turns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The want of leisure from other
Affairs, might very well have been
pleaded for not writing in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate:
But if it may be allow'd me
for an Excuse in not writing so well
on this Subject as the weightiness of
it might require, either in respect of
the Stile, the Method of arguing, or
the omission of several things to the
clearing the Controversy, I shall not
think my time ill spent, especially if
any thing that I have wrote, may tend
to the service of the Publick.</p>

and Measure of Commerce by
its Intrinsick Value.</item>
               <item>The Intrinsick Value of Silver is the
Estimate which common consent hath
placed on it.</item>
               <item>Silver is the Measure of Commerce by
its Quantity, which is also the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of its Intrinsick Value. It is the
Quantity of Silver men give, take,
and contract for, that they Estimate
the Value of other things by, and
<pb facs="tcp:50853:6"/>
give and take in exchange for all other
Commodities.</item>
               <item>That Money differs from Vncoined Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
only in this, That the Quantity
of Silver in each Piece is ascertained
by its stamp; which is set there to be
a Publick Voucher for its Weight and
Fineness.</item>
               <item>That the <hi>Par</hi> of Money is a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Pieces of the Coin of one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
containing in them an equal Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Silver to that in another num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of pieces of the Coin of another
Countrey.</item>
               <item>That plenty of Money in a Countrey is
only made and preserved by the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>From these</hi> Propositions <hi>Mr.</hi> Lock
<hi>argues,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it will be no Advantage to raise
the Value of the Money, but a great Loss
to all the Creditors and Landed Men of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Bullion or Vncoined Silver ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Intrinsick Value, can never rise
<pb facs="tcp:50853:6"/>
nor fall: And money differing only
from Silver in this, That the Stamp
ascertains the weight and fineness of the
Silver in the money, Silver can never
be of a higher price than the money:
For an equal Quantity of Silver will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be of the same value to an equal
Quantity of Silver.</p>
            <p>That if the value of the money be
rais'd, the value of all Goods will rise
accordingly. For Silver being the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Commerce by its Quantity; and
it is the Quantity of Silver that men
contract for in selling their Goods; if
there be a less Quantity of Silver in
a Crown-Piece, it will buy a less Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Goods: Or if the Crown be rais'd
to Six shillings, those Goods that us'd
to be sold for a Crown will then cost Six
shillings.</p>
            <p>That it will be the same in all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Commodities and Foreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change:
For the Foreign Exchange
and <hi>Par</hi> of money being only from an
equal Quantity of Silver in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Coins of the several Countries;
if the money be made lighter, there
<pb facs="tcp:50853:7"/>
must then be a greater number of pieces
to make the <hi>Par,</hi> or Foreign Exchange
by Foreign money equal, or else the
Quantity of Silver will not be equal to
that in the Foreign Coin: So that the
Foreign Exchange and Price of all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Goods will rise in proportion to
what the value of the money is rais'd.
That which cost Twenty pounds before,
will cost five and twenty if the money
be raised a fifth; because there will be
no greater a Quantity of Silver in Five
and twenty pounds, than there was in
Twenty before the money was raised.</p>
            <p>That the raising the value of the
money will not prevent the carrying it
away, because that depends upon the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade. For if there be more
Foreign Goods bought of any Nation
and Imported, than there are of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Commodities Exported, the Balance
must be paid in money, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carry it out to pay the Debt till
the Balance of that Nation be alter'd;
which is, by Exporting more of the
Native Commodities, and Importing less
of the Foreign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50853:7"/>That there will be a great loss to all the
Creditors and Landlords of <hi>England;</hi>
for they letting their Land by the same
rule which is by the Quantity of Silver
in the money; if the money be made
lighter by a fifth part, they will lose a
fifth part by their Rent: They'll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but Eighty pounds instead of an
Hundred, because there will be no more
Silver in an Hundred, than there was
before in Eighty.</p>
            <p>That there will be the same loss to the
Creditors when they are paid their Bonds,
Debts and Contracts; so that the raising
of the money will put a very great Loss
and Hardship upon Landlords and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
and bring no advantage to the
Nation.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:50853:8"/>
               <head>The contrary Propositions in
Answer to Mr. LOCK are
these:</head>
               <item>THAT there is no Intrinsick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
in Silver, or any fixt or
certain Estimate that common consent
hath placed on it; but that it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
and riseth and falleth as other
Commodities do.</item>
               <item>That Money is the Instrument and
Measure of Commerce, and not Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</item>
               <item>That it is the Instrument of Commerce
from the Authority of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where it is Coined; and that by
the Stamp and Size of each piece the
value is known.</item>
               <item>That Money differs from Vncoined Silver
in this, That the Authority of the
Government gives a fixt and certain
<pb facs="tcp:50853:8"/>
value to each piece of Money, which is
generally beyond the value of the Silver
in it.</item>
               <item>That it is Money that men give, take
and contract with for all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and by which they estimate
the value of all other things; having
regard more to the stamp and currancy
of the Money, than to the quantity of
fine Silver in each piece.</item>
               <item>That raising the Value of the Money, will
not raise the Foreign Exchange, nor
Foreign Commodities.</item>
               <item>That if by the Balance of Trade in a
Nation the Money is carried away, the
only means to prevent it, is to raise

DISCOURSE
Concerning
Coining the New Money lighter, &amp;c.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Riches, and the Value of
Things.</head>
               <p>ALL the Arguments in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
Book against the raising the Value
of Money, are drawn from this
single Supposition, <hi>That there is an
Intrinsick Value in Silver, which is the Price
or Estimate that Common Consent hath placed on
it, by which it comes to be the Measure of the
Value of all other Things:</hi> which, if that
should not be true, then all his Consequences
must be mistaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50853:10"/>And to prove that he is so, It will be
necessary to discourse of RICHES in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and to shew how the Value of Things do
arise.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Riches,</hi> is meant all such Things as are
of great Value.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Value,</hi> is to be understood the Price of
Things; that is, what any thing is worth to
be sold: according to the old Maxim, <hi>Valet
quantum vendi potest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Value of all Things, arise from their
Use.</p>
               <p>Things of no Use, are of no Value; as
the <hi>English</hi> Phrase is, <hi>They are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two general Uses by which all
Things have a Value: They are either use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to supply the Wants of the Body, or the
Wants of the Mind.</p>
               <p>Things that have a Value from being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to supply the Wants of the Body, are
all such Things as are useful to support Life,
such as all sorts of Food and Physick.</p>
               <p>Things that have their Value by being
useful to supply the Wants of the Mind, are
all such Things that satisfy Desire, (Desire
implies Want; it is the Appetite of the Mind,
and as natural as Hunger to the Body:) such
are all those Things that are any ways useful
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50853:10"/>
to satisfy the Mind, by contributing to the
Ease, Pleasure, or Pomp of Life.</p>
               <p>By supplying these two general Wants, all
sorts of Things have a Value: But the
greatest Number of them have their Value
from supplying the Wants of the Mind; and
Things of the greatest Value are used, to set
orth the Pomp of Life; such as all sorts of
fine Draperies, Gold; Silver, Pearl, Diamonds,
and all sorts of precious Stones. They are
used to adorn and deck the Body. They are
Badges of Riches, and serve to make distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Preference amongst men.</p>
               <p>These two general Wants Mankind is born
with, and they are so natural to him, that he is
better distinguished by what he wants, than
what he enjoys. A Poor Man wants a
Pound, a Rich Man an Hundred, others
Thousands, and a Prince Hundreds of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.
Desire and Wants increase with
Riches. And from thence it is, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Man is the only Rich Man, because he
wants nothing.</p>
               <p>Things that supply the Wants of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and support Life, may be accounted to
have a real and natural value: They are at all
times and in all places of value; and if any
things could have an Intrinsick Value in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they would be Cattel and Corn; and
therefore in Ancient times the computation of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50853:11"/>
Riches was by the number of Cattel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the saying, <hi>Pauperis est numerare
pecus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some are of an opinion, that there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Intrinsick value in Gold and Silver, and
that they are only to be accounted Riches or
Treasure.</p>
               <p>This, it seems, has been an ancient opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which <hi>Ovid</hi> endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
by the Story of <hi>Midas.</hi> For <hi>Bacchus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entertained by <hi>Midas</hi> at a Feast, told him,
in requital, he would give him whatsoever
he should desire; and being of an opinion
that Gold was the only Riches, desir'd that
whatsoever he touch'd might be turn'd into
Gold. His request was granted, with which
he was very well pleased; but being hungry,
was convinc'd of his Mistake: For as soon as
he touch'd his Wine and Meat, they turn'd
into Gold; and <hi>Midas</hi> had been starv'd, had
not <hi>Bacchus</hi> for his kind entertainment sent
him to a River to wash in, and gave him
leave to change his Gold for Water, after he
had experienc'd that Water was of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
to quench his thirst than Gold.</p>
               <p>Things that supply the wants of the Mind,
have only an Imaginary or Artificial Value,
which depends only on opinion, and change
their Values according to the Humor and
Fancy of the persons that use them; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50853:11"/>
are like rich Apparel, that lose their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
because they are out of fashion.</p>
               <p>It is the occasion and usefulness of things
that creates the Value of them: And it is the
Plenty or Scarcity of things, in respect of
their occasion or use, that makes them of
greater or lesser Value: Plenty makes things
Cheap, and Scarcity Dear.</p>
               <p>By this rule the Value of all things is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned;
because the Value of things depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only on their use, if there be more than
can be used, the remainder can be of no Use,
and so of no Value. For the two common
wants of the Body and Mind being either for
Food or Ornament; those Commodities that
are for Food are perishable, and if not us'd
in time, are lost and good for nothing; and
those Commodities that are for Ornament,
Plenty making them common and cheap,
lose their use, and from thence their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
               <p>Rarity and Scarcity are the chief reasons
for the value of those things that are us'd for
Ornament, and not for any excellent quality
in the things themselves. That's the reason
that a Bracelet of Glass-Beads is of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
in <hi>Guiney</hi> than a Bracelet of Gold; because
it is there more rare, those people being not
acquainted with the Art of making Glass,
and having more plenty of Gold than Glass;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50853:12"/>
and by the same reason, Knives, and things
made of Iron and Steel are of more value in
those Countries where there are no Iron-Mines,
and have plenty of Silver-Mines:
And if the value of things were to arise
from the Qualities that belong to them,
those Things that are made of Iron and
Steel, ought to have a greater Value than
those that are made of Silver, because they
are much more useful.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that troubles this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
more, than for want of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betwixt Value and Vertue.</p>
               <p>Value is only the Price of Things: That
can never be certain, because it must be then
at all times, and in all places, of the same
Value; therefore nothing can have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
Value.</p>
               <p>But Things have an Intrinsick Vertue in
themselves, which in all places have the
same Vertue; as the Loadstone to attract
Iron, and the several qualities that belong
to Herbs, and Drugs, some Purgative, some
Diuretical, &amp;c. But these things, though
they may have great Virtues, may be of small
or no Value or Price, according to the place
where they are plenty or scarce; as the Red-Nettle,
though it be of excellent Virtue to
stop Bleeding, yet here it is a Weed of no
Value from its plenty: And so are Spices
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50853:12"/>
and Drugs in their own Native soil of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
but as common Shrubs and Weeds; but
with us of great Value, and yet in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the same Excellent Intrinsick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <p>Things common have no Value: For no
Man will pay for that which he may have for
gathering.</p>
               <p>The Plenty of one Commodity do's not
alter the Value of another, unless it be for
the same use. Plenty of Iron or Lead will
not make either Corn or Cloth cheaper or
dearer, because Iron or Lead can neither sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the want of Food or Clothing.</p>
               <p>Gold and Silver are Commodities as well
as Lead or Iron; and according to their
Plenty or Scarcity will make those things that
are made of them Dearer or Cheaper; to
wit, Gold and Silver-Plate, Lace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
they cannot make Corn, Cloth, Lead, or
Iron Dearer or Cheaper, because they cannot
supply the uses of those Commodities.</p>
               <p>There is no difference or distinction in
things of equal Value: That is, one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
is as good as another that's of the same
Value. An Hundred Pounds worth of Lead
or Iron, is of as great a value as an Hundred
Pounds worth of Silver or Gold: And an
Hundred Pounds worth of course Cloth is of
as great a value as an Hundred Pounds worth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50853:13"/>
of fine. The Man is as Rich that has an
Hundred Pounds worth of Corn or Cattel,
as he that has an Hundred Pounds in Money
by him, for his Corn and his Cattel may be
soon turn'd into so much Money: And the
Merchant and Trader are always changing
their Money for Commodities, because they
can get more by them than by Money; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Transporting of them where such
Commodities are most scarce, or else by
changing the shapes of them, by which they
are made more Useful, and thereby of more
Value.</p>
               <p>Now if the Value of all things arise from
their use: If Plenty or Scarcity makes things
Dear or Cheap: If Silver be a Commodity
for several uses, and more plentiful in some
places than in others; then it must necessarily
follow, that Silver can have no Certain or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
Value, and if Silver be of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Value, then it can never be the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Commerce and Traffick: For, that
which it uncertain in its own Value, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be a certain Measure of another Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> agrees this Consequence, and in
Page 21 allows Gold, and Lead, and other
Metals to be Commodities of uncertain va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50853:13"/>
and therefore cannot be the Measure of
another value; but it do's not appear to me
why he has separated Silver from Gold,
which in all Discourses us'd to go together;
or why that should not be a Commodity as
well as other Metals, which, had he pleas'd
to have allow'd, would have much shorten'd
the Debate.</p>
               <p>What Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> means when he says that
<hi>the Intrinsick Value of Silver is the Estimate that
common consent hath placed on it,</hi> I do not well
understand, therefore must be excused if I
do not well answer it. If he means <hi>that the
Estimate that Common consent hath placed on Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
that Mankind have agreed to set a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and fixt Price upon Silver; he ought to
have given account how and when they made
such agreement; I must confess I never hear'd
of any; if there was any such, it must be
lately: For there is no Goldsmith that has
been any considerable time at his Trade, but
has bought the same Sterling Silver for Four
Shillings Eight pence, Four and Ten pence,
and Five Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce, for which he
has given Five and Eight pence, Five and
Ten pence, and Six shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce.</p>
               <p>If he means <hi>by the Estimate that Common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
hath placed on Silver,</hi> That all Governments
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50853:14"/>
have agreed to make their Silver Monies equal
both for Weight and Fineness, that too will
prove a mistake. For the Silver Coins in all
Governments in <hi>Europe</hi> have been at one time
or other raised and alter'd; and they never
did agree in equal Quantities of fine Silver,
as will be shown in the Discourse of Money,
and the <hi>Par</hi> of the several Coins.</p>
               <p>That which I have endeavour'd to prove
in this Discourse, <hi>of Riches, and the Value of
Things,</hi> are these Five several Maxims, which
I have here set together, because I shall
have occasion to make use of them hereafter.
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That nothing has a Price or Value in
it self.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Price or Value of every thing
arises from the occasion or use for it.</item>
                  <item>3. That Plenty and Scarcity, in respect to
their occasion, makes things of greater or
lesser Value.</item>
                  <item>4. That the Plenty or Scarcity of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
do's not alter the Prices of other
Commodities which are not for the same
uses.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50853:14"/>5. That in Trade and Commerce there is
no difference in Commodities when their
Values are equal; that is, Twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
worth of Lead or Iron to some
Merchants is the same as Twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in Silver or Gold.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>MR.</hi> Lock <hi>says, pag:</hi> 22. That Money dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from Vncoin'd Silver only in this,
That the Quantity of Silver in each piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
is ascertain'd by the Stamp it bears; which
is set there, to be a Publick Voucher of its Weight
and Fineness.</p>
               <p>That it is the Quantity of Silver Mankind give
or take, or contract for, that they estimate the
value of other things, and satisfy for them;
and thus by its Quantity, Silver becomes the
Measure of Commerce.</p>
               <p>The Question betwixt us here will be,
Whether Money has its sole Value from the
Quantity of Silver in each piece of Coin?
Or whether Money has not some Value from
the Authority of the Government where it
is Coin'd, above the Value of the Silver in
each piece?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50853:15"/>For the better answering this Question, it
will be necessary to discourse in general of
Money, and the <hi>Par</hi> of the several Coins.</p>
               <p>Money is a Value given to a piece of Metal
by the Stamp of Publick Authority, which
is commonly greater than the Value of the
Metal that bears the Impression.</p>
               <p>The Value of each piece of Money is
known by the difference of the Stamp, Size
and Colour of the piece.</p>
               <p>Money is commonly made of some Metal,
but it is more for conveniency, than of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity. For the Value arising from
Publick Authority, it may as well be set to
any thing else that is as convenient, and can
be as well preserv'd from being counterfeited.
For in several Countries Money is not made
of Metals; as in some parts of <hi>Guiney</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is made of Shells. And Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
in <hi>India</hi> Money is by Yards of <hi>Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompeak.</hi>
And in <hi>England</hi> it was formerly
made of Leather, and from thence came the
Name of a <hi>Hide of Land,</hi> which did as well
describe the value of Land, now to say ten,
twenty, or a hundred pounds worth of Land.</p>
               <p>In ancient times, in the most civiliz'd parts
of the world, the Money was made of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
or Brass.</p>
               <p>It was Four hundred eighty four years
before the <hi>Romans</hi> had any Silver Money, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50853:16"/>
Sixty two years after, before they had any
Money made of Gold. And had but very
little of either, till they had greatly enlarg'd
their Empire. And from the Spoils of those
conquer'd rich Cities, <hi>Carthage, Athens,</hi> and
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> brought a greater plenty of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and Gold into their Exchequer. And
it always continued scarce in <hi>Europe,</hi> till the
discovery of the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are now in most Countries of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
three sorts of Money, Copper, Gold, and
Silver Money, and they are of equal Value,
according to what they are stamp'd at. The
Farthings of <hi>England,</hi> the Duyts of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Deniers of <hi>France,</hi> the Reas of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
and the Malvedies of <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c. do
buy and pay for all sorts of Commodities, as
well as the Money that is made of Silver or
Gold. And the Merchants both in their
Bills of Exchange, and in their Accompts,
do as often reckon by the Copper Money, as
by the Silver Money. And the Computation
of the Silver Money is often made from the
Value of the Copper Money; as in <hi>Portugal,</hi>
the Merchant does often draw his Bills of
Exchange to be paid in Rials of Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Reas, or Four hundred and fifty Reas.</p>
               <p>And so in <hi>Spain,</hi> he draws his Bill to
be paid in Rials of Three hundred seventy
two Malvedies, or more, according to the
rise of the Exchange. And in <hi>Holland</hi> some
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50853:16"/>
Merchants draw their Bills to be paid by
Groats, which is a base Money, as well as
others do to be paid by Shillings.</p>
               <p>For the Value of Money arising from the
Authority of the Government, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
be the same, the Value of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Silver, or Gold money, must be the same
in proportion to what they are set at: And
Copper being a Metal of lesser Value than
either Gold or Silver, is much better to make
small money of, because the pieces are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made larger and fitter for use and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>There are more Bargains made with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Money then either with Silver or Gold:
For those Commodities that are bought in
great parcels are sold by retail in small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
for common use; and for one Bargain
made with Silver or Gold Money, there are
ten made with Copper Money. Five or Ten
Quarter of Wheat which may cost Five or
Ten Pound in Silver Money at one Bargain,
is divided into Twopeny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peny, and Halfpeny
Loaves, and afterwards bought perhaps by a
Hundred persons, and paid for by the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Money of the Countrey: And there are
but few Bargains that can be made without
the use of some Copper Money to make the
Sum even. All Sums here in <hi>England</hi> between
Sixpence and Twelvepence are made up with
Farthings and Halfpence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50853:17"/>This shews Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s mistake, where he
says, <hi>That 'tis by the Quantity of Silver men
give or take, or contract for, that they Estimate the
Value of other things, and satisfy for them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the Baker, the Grocer, the Coffee-man,
and all the Retailers, sell great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Goods for the Copper Money wherein
there is not one grain of Silver, and yet they
are as well paid and satisfied for their
Goods with such Money, as the Farmer
or Merchant of whom they first bought
those Goods are with the Silver Money. For
the Copper Money may be Coin'd as near to
the Value of the Copper, as the Silver or
Gold Money may be to the Value of the
Silver or Gold; and the Authority of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that makes them all current being
the same, all sorts of Money must be of an
equal Value according to what they are
Stamp'd at.</p>
               <p>For the nature of the Metals can make
no difference if the Values be equal: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done only by proportioning the quantities
of the Metals in each piece of Money to their
different Values: For instance, supposing Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be at Twelvepence a pound, and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be at Three pound <hi>per</hi> pound, an
Ounce of Silver, which is Five Shillings, is
equal to Five pound of Copper: And there
being Threescore pence in Five Shillings, and
Threescore Ounces in Five pound, an Ounce
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50853:17"/>
of Copper being a piece of money about the
bigness of a Crown in Silver, is equal to the
value of a Penny in Silver; and an Half-penny
being half an Ounce, and of the size
of Half-acrown, is equal to an Half-penny in
Silver.</p>
               <p>If it had been the <hi>Quantity of Silver that
Men take, and contract for,</hi> Men would have
made their Bargains by the weight of Silver,
and not by the tale of money: For Silver is
as well divided for Traffick by weight, as
money is divided by number, and there
would be no occasion for Coining. For it is
as easy in making of a Bargain, when the
Question is ask'd, What shall I give? or
what will you take for such and such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities?
to say, I will give or take so
many Grains, Penny-weight, Ounces, or
Pounds of Silver; as to say, that I'll give
or take so many Pounds, Shillings, Pence, or
Half-pence.</p>
               <p>But Silver being a Commodity for other
Uses besides the making of money, and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Plenty or, Scarcity to supply
those Occasions is dearer or cheaper;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
money was invented, which by Publick
Authority sets and fixeth a certain value to
each piece of money; and it is that which
men give and take by tale and number of the
pieces, in exchange for all other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without regarding the <hi>weight and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50853:18"/>
of Silver in each piece.</hi> And if a man
should offer to buy Goods in the Market, by
saying, I'll give so many Grains, Ounces, or
Pounds of Silver; he would be presently
ask'd, What is Silver worth an Ounce? and
would be no more understood by Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
answer, <hi>That an Ounce of Silver is worth an
Ounce of Silver,</hi> than if a Country-man in a
market being ask'd, What is Corn worth a
Bushel? should say, 'Tis worth a Bushel of
Corn.</p>
               <p>And yet if Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s definition of money
be true, <hi>That it differs from uncoin'd Silver
only in this, That the Quantity of Silver in each
piece of money, is ascertain'd by the Stamp it
bears, which is set there to be a Publick Voucher
of its weight and fineness;</hi> there can be no
other Answer given to know the value of
Silver by. For if the Stamp to a Crown-piece,
which is an Ounce of Silver, be set
only to describe its weight and fineness; if
any man be ask'd the Question, What Silver
is worth? he can mean no more when he
says, 'Tis worth a Crown an Ounce, than
that an Ounce of Silver is worth an Ounce
of Silver: so that by his description of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
no man can describe the value of Silver.</p>
               <p>But that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> is mistaken in his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of money, will appear more plainly,
by discoursing of the <hi>Par</hi> of the several
Coins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50853:18"/>
                  <hi>He says,</hi> That the <hi>Par</hi> of Monies is certain
number of pieces of the Coin of one Country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an equal Quantity of Silver in another
number of pieces of the Coin of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>This is a general Opinion, and therefore
it is no wonder to find it here asserted by a
Gentleman who, I suppose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is only acquainted
with the Speculation and Theory of Foreign
Coins; when many Merchants and Traders,
whose business it has been to know the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick
part, and the difference of the value of
the several Coins, are of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>And yet if it be but consider'd, it will be
found to be a vulgar Error; and <hi>that the</hi> Par
<hi>of money is made, by computing the Valuation
that the several Governments set on their Coins;
which is not from the equal Quantity of Silver
in each piece of money.</hi> For there is scarce two
Mints that agree in the Standards of their
Coin. The Standard of <hi>Spain</hi> is Eleven
Ounces Four-penny weight fine, in a Pound
<hi>Troy. Mexico</hi> Eleven Ounces Three-penny
weight, Ten Grains. <hi>England</hi> Eleven Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Two-penny weight. <hi>France</hi> Ten Ounces
Ten-penny weight. <hi>Holland</hi> Nine Ounces.
And the same difference might be observ'd
in all the other Mints of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50853:19"/>Besides, The Pound <hi>Troy</hi> is divided into
a number of pieces differing in their weight,
and that no two Mints divide their money
alike. That in most pieces of money the
very Grains of Silver are divided, in some
a tenth, thirteenth, fifteenth, twentieth part
of a Grain and more; and that there is
scarce any one piece of money without Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Grains of Silver: so that in those
very Coins that are nearest in value by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
it will be found altogether impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable
for any Merchant to keep an account
of the <hi>Par</hi> of the several Coins, <hi>by the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Silver in each piece of money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would puzzle a good Arithmetician to
state the difference of the Grains of Silver in
those pieces that seem most to agree; as to
Instance:</p>
               <p>It is no easy matter to number the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Grains betwixt those Pieces of
Eight, that of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> with the
Pound <hi>Troy,</hi> being both divided into thirteen
pieces and an half.</p>
               <p>It is much more difficult to examine the
difference of the grains of silver in such pieces,
as the <hi>Sixpence</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Riall</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
the <hi>Shilling</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> with other Coins about
that value. But if the difference of the Grains,
with the innumerable Fractions of Grains be
examin'd in the <hi>Stivers</hi> of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
the <hi>Souz</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Crutizes</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50853:19"/>
with the <hi>Silver Pence</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the rest
of the small Silver monies of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
it will be found almost impossible for
the Merchant or any one else to keep an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the quantity of Silver in each piece
of Coin.</p>
               <p>This difference in the Standards of the
several Mints, and in the unequal division of
their money, shews plainly that there is no
common agreement about the quantity of
Silver in their Coins, and that <hi>Mr. Lock</hi> is
mistaken if this be his meaning <hi>of the Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Value of Silver, by the Estimate which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent hath placed on it, by the quantity of
Silver in their Coins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the measure of Commerce and Traffick
<hi>were by the Quantity of Silver in the Coin,</hi>
the Governments would certainly have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to have made their money of fine Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
without any Allay, and to have divided
it into pieces of equal weight; or, if it had
been necessary, to have put in some Allay,
that the money might bear the impression the
better, which is the Reason that <hi>Mr. Lock</hi>
gives for doing it; all the Mints by this
time would have certainly found out and
agreed in that proportion which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for that purpose, or at least the
greatest number of them. And therefore I
cannot agree to his Reason for putting in an
Allay; and the rather, because I have seen
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50853:20"/>
some Medals made of fine Silver that have
bore the impression very well, and look'd
more beautiful than the Stamp of any
New-coin'd money. And anciently in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
from <hi>Osbright</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King, to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
III. the money was without any Allay.
And the Coin of the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> is now
made of all fine Silver, and bears the Stamp
very well.</p>
               <p>Besides, It seems to be the only Reason
for making the money of such different Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
that the quantity of Silver in each piece,
and the mystery of the Mint, might not be
easily discovered, and the money not be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
after the price of Bullion, and thereby
prevent the Merchants, and those that deal
in Bullion, from buying and selling the Coin,
and melting it down upon a sudden rise
of Bullion. And this might reasonably be
thought a way to prevent it, because the
knowledge of the different Allays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Gold and Silver, is a mystery that
belongs only to a small number of men that
deal in it; who are either Moniers that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Mints, or Goldsmiths that serve an
Apprenticeship to acquire skill in it; and
yet, perhaps, not all of those acquainted with
the Chymical part of the mystery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of refining and essaying of Silver and
Gold; but content themselves to judge of
the difference of the fineness of the several
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50853:20"/>
Coins by the Touchstone, and colour of the
Metal.</p>
               <p>And it will yet more plainly appear, That
men do not buy and sell <hi>by the quantity of
Silver in the Coin,</hi> if it be consider'd, that
the Merchants and Traders buy and sell all
their Commodities by weight or measure,
and often make their Contracts by the price
of what one Yard, or one Pound will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to; which price is generally for an
odd sum of money, as Two-pence-farthing,
Three-pence-farthing, Half-penny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Three
Farthings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the loss of a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Pound or Yard by the <hi>Par</hi> of the
money, if they were to buy or sell <hi>by the
quantity of Silver,</hi> would make a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the profit of the Bargain in a great
sum, and much greater in the making of
many Bargains, and a continued Trade;
since it appears that there is no money with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fractions in the grains of Silver.</p>
               <p>Besides, It is no advantage to a Merchant
to make a computation of the <hi>quantity of
Silver</hi> in the several Foreign Coins: For he
always makes up the Accompt of the Profit
or Loss, by the mony of the Country where
he lives; and there can be no Accompt
made up, till the effects of his Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which he sends out, are return'd. And
if his Goods are sold by money not of the
same <hi>Par</hi> to the Coin of his own Country,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50853:21"/>
yet if such money buys the same quantity of
Goods as the Coin of his own Country
would do, it will be the same thing to him
as if the money was <hi>Par,</hi> and that there was
an equal quantity of Silver in the money that
bought those Goods. For Instance: If an
<hi>English</hi> Merchant sends into <hi>Portugal</hi> so many
Serges, or other Commodities, as cost him
here an hundred pounds, and they should be
sold for the <hi>Reas,</hi> which is the Copper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of that Country, or other Coin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
<hi>Par;</hi> and with that money <hi>Portugal</hi>
Wines are bought, and sent over into <hi>England:</hi>
The Merchant makes up the Accompt when
the Wines are sold, and if they produce him
an hundred and twenty pounds clear of all
charge, he gets twenty pound by the return.
And 'tis to no purpose for him to take an
Accompt of the difference of the <hi>Par</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Coin, or
whether his Goods were sold for Copper or
Silver money.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Par</hi> of monies was to be reckon'd
<hi>by the Quantity of Silver in each piece,</hi> and
that men made their Bargains only for the
quantity of Silver, to what purpose is there
any Copper money coin'd? which, reckoning
one Country with another, is a third part of
all the money in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true, Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> will not allow any
other but Silver money to be the measure of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50853:21"/>
Commerce and Traffick; and refuseth Gold
and all other Metals, because he allows
them to be Commodities which rise and fall
in their <hi>Value,</hi> and therefore not fit to make
<hi>Money</hi> of. This is grounded upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>that there is an Intrinsick</hi> Value <hi>in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and therefore do's not alter its Price.</hi> As to
the Intrinsick I have already answer'd; and
as to that, whether Gold and Copper are not
as fit to make <hi>Money</hi> of as Silver, I'll leave it
to those that continually take them in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to give a reason why they take such
<hi>Money,</hi> if they did not think the <hi>Value</hi> of
them to be as good as the Silver <hi>Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Money</hi> at all times, and in all places, has
been made of Copper and Gold: And if
they should not be allow'd as <hi>Money,</hi> there
would not be enough left to carry on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Traffick.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Publick Authority upon the Metal
that makes it <hi>Money;</hi> and without such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Silver would no more pass for <hi>Money</hi>
than Gold. There can't be a plainer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of this, than by what appears since
the Parliament has been debating about New
Coining of the <hi>Money,</hi> and setling the <hi>Value</hi>
of the Guineas: For, before their meeting,
the <hi>Clipt Money</hi> pass'd currant, as if it were
Unclipt. But their Considerations about
calling of it in, presently put a stop to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50853:22"/>
currancy of it; because, by their Debates,
the <hi>Value</hi> of it was made uncertain, and no
man knew where the Loss would fall. And
the same may be observ'd from their Debates
about setling the price of Guineas; For
Guineas, before their meeting, went currant
at Thirty shilings; but, upon the House of
Commons voting that they should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Eight and twenty, every man present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refus'd to take 'em for more. And upon
another resolution, That they should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Six and twenty, and not declaring at
what price they should be currant, no man
since will take them for more than Six and
twenty, most refuse to take 'em at so much,
and some refuse the taking of 'em at any
price: So that Silver would no more pass
for <hi>Money</hi> than Gold, unless the price of each
piece were fixt by Publick Authority.</p>
               <p>The Argument that has been us'd to shew
that 'tis impracticable to make up the <hi>Rar</hi> of
the Coins from the quantity of <hi>Money</hi> in each
piece, because of the great difference in the
Standard; the unequal division of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
and the Infinite number of fractions in
the quantity of Silver in every piece, is of
use to prove that the <hi>Par</hi> of <hi>Monies</hi> is from
the Valuation that each Government sets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Coin: Or else there could be no
Bargain made upon an equal foot, there being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50853:22"/>
such a certain difference in the Quantity of
the Silver in the several Coins, which could
never be remedied unless publick Authority
had fixt the <hi>Value</hi> to their <hi>Money,</hi> by which
all those Fractions and Inequalities in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Coins are even'd. And one piece of
<hi>Money</hi> is as good as another in the Countrey
where each piece is Coin'd according to the
Valuation that is set upon it, which is describ'd
by the Stamp and Size of the piece, tho'
they differ greatly in the Quantity of
Silver.</p>
               <p>Now if it be true in it self, That nothing
has a <hi>Value</hi> or <hi>Price:</hi> That the <hi>Value</hi> of all
things arises from their Use, it will be no
strange Consequence that <hi>Money</hi> should have
a <hi>Value,</hi> from the great use of it, above the
price of Bullion, or the Metal that bears the
Impression: And that the Government should
have power to set and fix a <hi>Value</hi> or <hi>Price</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their <hi>Money,</hi> as well as the Merchant and
Trader upon their Goods and Wares: And
that 'tis as reasonable to allow the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
some <hi>Value</hi> for their Stamp upon their
<hi>Money</hi> above the price of the Metal, as to pay
the Goldsmiths for the Fashion of their Plate,
or the Ingraver or Carver for the Impression
on his Medal. And why should it seem so
strange that a new piece of Coin should have
a <hi>Value</hi> above the price of the Metal, which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50853:23"/>
is seldom above Sixpence or Eight pence in
Five shillings, being not above a Tenth part
more than the <hi>Value</hi> of the Metal, when an
old piece of Coin grown scarce, is seldom
less than double the <hi>Value;</hi> and some of them
exceed ten, twenty, and a hundred times the
<hi>Value</hi> of the Metal. A Mill'd Crown of
<hi>Oliver</hi>'s is now worth Twenty shillings to be
sold; and an <hi>Otbo</hi>'s Head, and some other
<hi>Roman</hi> Coins, are worth a hundred times the
<hi>Value</hi> of the Metal that bears the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>Besides, there is a greater reason for the
<hi>Value</hi> of the <hi>Money;</hi> because by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Government it is made current
and lawful <hi>Money,</hi> and every body is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to take it; and therefore no person can
be a loser by taking of it, because another
person is to take it of him again for the
same <hi>Value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Stamp upon the <hi>Money</hi> is the Seal of
the Government; so that if there was not
a Law to make it current, and had only the
King's Seal or Stamp upon it, it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have a better, or at least the same <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi>
as a Bank Note, or any Private Person's
Bond or Seal; which only shews, that the
person whose Note or Seal it is, is oblig'd to
pay or exchange it. And it there were no
other obligation from the King's Stamp than
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50853:23"/>
to show that the King would take it in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
it would give it a sufficient currency,
tho' there were no Law to make it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>It is the currancy of the Coin that all men
regard more than the quantity of the Siver in
it: For the difference of the Fineness of the
Silver, and the number of the grains in each
piece of Silver, few persons are acquainted
with. Not one in a thousand can tell how
many grains of fine Silver there are in a
Crown, Halscrown, Shilling, or Sixpence.
Therefore, to what purpose should the
<hi>Stamp be set to be a Voucher to the Weight and
Fineness,</hi> as <hi>Mr. Locke</hi> affirms, which no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
inquires after or desires to know.
'Tis the Currant and Lawful <hi>Money</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
that men contract for, and oblige themselves
in their Bonds to pay; and if it were the
quantity of Silver in the <hi>Money</hi> that men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
they certainly would express it in
their Bonds and Contracts; and have
faid Currant and Lawful <hi>Money</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many Ounces and Grains of fine Silver.
For, <hi>Money</hi> do's wear and grow lighter
by often telling over; so that if it were true,
<hi>that 'tis the quantity of Silver in the</hi> Money <hi>that
men give, take, and contract for in exchange for
all other Commodities,</hi> they ought to make
their Bargains to be paid in <hi>Money</hi> Coin'd such
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50853:24"/>
and such a year, and so set the Price of
their Goods according to the Date of the
year the <hi>Money</hi> was Coin'd in: Or else they
will lose more by the difference in the
quantity of Silver, by the age and wearing
of the <hi>Money,</hi> than the profit by the Goods
amounts to. For 'tis very plain, that the old
Unclipp'd Broad <hi>Money</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is worn
Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> lighter than the new-Mill'd <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi>
So that is the quantity of the Silver in
the <hi>Money</hi> were to be regarded, it would
make Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> difference in the profit of
the Bargain. And yet no man will deny,
but that the Broad Unclipp'd <hi>Money</hi> will buy
as many Goods of the same <hi>Value,</hi> as the
New-mill'd <hi>Money</hi> will do: And that all
Bonds and Contracts are as well paid and
satisfied by such old <hi>Money,</hi> as by the new.</p>
               <p>It is the Denomination and Currency of
the <hi>Money</hi> that men regard in Bargaining,
<hi>and not the quantity of Silver:</hi> For in all parts
of <hi>Europe</hi> men buy and sell by the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of several sorts of <hi>Money,</hi> both
of Gold and Silver, that were formerly
currant, but now out of Use, and not
in being: As by several sorts of Dollars,
Guilder-Pieces, Florens, Marks, Nobles,
and Groats of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. For when Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are forced by the rise of Bullion to raise
their Coin and make their <hi>Money</hi> lighter,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50853:24"/>
they often change the Denomination; and
yet men keep their custom of making their
Bargains by the old Weighty <hi>Money,</hi> and pay
for their Goods by the New-coin'd lighter
<hi>Money.</hi> As to instance; in many Countries
here in <hi>England,</hi> they buy and sell their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
by Groats and Nobles, which was the
currant <hi>Money,</hi> and way of reckoning till
<hi>Edward</hi> the VIth's days; there being till
then, very little other Silver <hi>Money</hi> Coin'd
but Groats, and they were double the weight
in proportion to what the <hi>Money</hi> is now Coin'd
at. And yet in paying and receiving they
expect no more than to be paid by the now
current <hi>Money,</hi> though the quantity of Silver
be much less in this <hi>Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judges in setting their Fines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
use the old Denomination of a Mark,
which is the name of the Weight of Gold
and Silver in most places of <hi>Europe,</hi> contains
Eight Ounces of the pound <hi>Troy;</hi> and in
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, when our pound
Sterling weigh'd a pound <hi>Troy,</hi> a Mark was
a common name in payment, which then
contain'd Eight Ounces of Silver; and yet
the Judges by their Fine, intend no more
than that it should be paid by the Current
<hi>Money</hi> now in being, which is two Thirds of
a pound Sterling by tale, and not two
Thirds of a pound <hi>Troy</hi> by Weight, as the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50853:25"/>
Mark signifi'd when first in Use, which
would now amount to Forty shillings by
Tale, instead of Thirteen and Four pence;
which shews that <hi>Money</hi> is paid by a compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Valuation, <hi>and not by the quantity of Silver
in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same may be observ'd in examining
the <hi>Par</hi> of the several Coins; and that the
<hi>Par</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> is made solely by the Valuation
of the Coin according to what it is current
at, and not <hi>from the quantity of Silver in each piece.</hi>
In the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno</hi> 1586.
there was a <hi>Par</hi> of Monies agreed on betwixt
the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the States of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces; which was, That Three and
thirty of their shillings and Four Stivers,
should be equal to our Twenty shillings, an
<hi>English</hi> shilling being then valu'd at 10 Stivers.
And if any person will examine the quantity
of Silver in this <hi>Par,</hi> they will find that there
is more Silver in our Twenty shillings, than
in Eight and Thirty shillings of their <hi>Money.</hi>
In the year 1622, the States set out a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
wherein they prohibited all Foreign
Coins to pass, except what were nam'd in
that Ordinance of the States, according to
the Valuation there express'd, The <hi>English</hi>
shillings was one of the Foreign Coins that
was allow'd to be there current, which
was to pass for Ten Stivers and an half; so
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50853:25"/>
that by this second Valuation of our <hi>English
Money,</hi> they allow'd the <hi>Par</hi> of our Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shillings, to be equal to Five and Thirty
shillings two Stivers of their <hi>Money;</hi> and
yet our shilling was made lighter betwixt
the first time of the Valuation and the second,
by Two shillings in Three pounds. The <hi>French</hi>
Crown, which us'd to pass for Five and fifty
Stivers, is now current in <hi>Flanders</hi> for Seven
and fifty Stivers, since the <hi>French</hi> have rais'd
the <hi>Value</hi> of their <hi>Money;</hi> though there is no
more Silver in the Crown-piece than there
was before; which shews plainly that the <hi>Par</hi>
of <hi>Monies</hi> is a computed Valuation, and not
<hi>from the quantity of Silver in each piece of Coin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Par</hi> betwixt the <hi>Monies</hi> made of
Gold and Silver: That likewise is uncertain,
and depends somewhat upon the Valuation of
the <hi>Money;</hi> but because Gold is a Commodity
of great <hi>Value,</hi> the Gold <hi>Money</hi> is generally
Coin'd nearer to the Market-price of Gold,
than the Silver <hi>Money</hi> is to the Silver; and
therefore the Gold <hi>Money</hi> is often weigh'd,
because the difference of a grain or two
greatly alters the <hi>Value</hi> of the Piece of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To shew what the <hi>Par</hi> is betwixt Gold
and Silver, will be more proper in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50853:26"/>
of raising the Coin; therefore I shall
conclude this Debate of <hi>money,</hi> and the <hi>Par</hi>
of <hi>money,</hi> and submit the Question betwixt
us to consideration upon the Arguments that
have been us'd to prove, <hi>That Money has some
Valuation from the Authority of the Government
where 'tis Coin'd,</hi> and not <hi>its sole Value from
the quantity of Silver in each piece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That men regard the Currency and Stamp of
the Coin, and take it more upon the account that
it will pass again for the same value to another,
than for the quantity of Silver in each piece.</p>
               <p>And not as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> has asserted; that is,</p>
               <p>That the Stamp upon the Money is set there
only to be a Publick Voucher of its weight and
fineness.</p>
               <p>That in buying and selling, 'tis the quantity
of Silver that men give or take, or contract for,
that they estimate the value of other things, and
satisfy for them; and thus by its quantity, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
becomes the measure of Commerce.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE Balance of Trade,</hi> is us'd by Mr.
<hi>Lock</hi> as an Argument against <hi>raising the
Value of the Money;</hi> because the <hi>Balance of all
Foreign Accompts,</hi> as he supposes, <hi>are paid in
Money, which must be sent out to balance the
Accompt; and let the Value of it be what it
will that is set upon the Money, it will go for
no more in Foreign Countries, than according to the
quantity of Silver that is in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very popular Notion, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believ'd; yet if it be consider'd, it will
be found to be a mistake, and that there is no
such Usage as <hi>Balancing the Foreign Accompts
of Merchants, by the Money of a Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
But, if there were such an Usage, 'tis
the greatest Argument <hi>for raising the Value of
the Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is commonly meant by the
<hi>Balance of Trade,</hi> is the equal importing of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50853:27"/>
                  <hi>Foreign Commodities,</hi> with the exporting of
the Native. And they reckon that Nation
has the advantage in the <hi>Balance of Trade,</hi>
that exports more of the Native Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and imports less of the Foreign. And
the reason that is given for it is, That if the
Native Commodities be of a greater Value
that are exported, the <hi>Balance</hi> of that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
must be made up in <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Money;</hi>
and the Nation grows so much richer, as the
<hi>Balance</hi> of that Account amounts to.</p>
               <p>This Opinion is grounded upon this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>That Gold and Silver are the only
Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men lay so great a stress about the
enquiring into this <hi>Balance,</hi> that they are of
Opinion, <hi>That a Trading Nation may be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
and undone, if there been't Care taken,
by Laws, to regulate the Balance.</hi> And yet
there is nothing so difficult, as to find out
the <hi>Balance of Trade</hi> in any Nation; or to
know whether there ever was, or can be
such a thing as the making up the <hi>Balance
of Trade</hi> betwixt one Nation and another;
or to prove, if it could be found out, that
there is any thing got or lost by the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a Nation, as a Nation, never Trades;
'tis only the Inhabitants and Subjects of each
Nation that Trade: And there are no set
days or times for making up of a general
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50853:27"/>
Accompt, every Merchant makes up his own
private Accompt; and that's not done at any
set time, one Merchant makes it up one
week, and another in another week; so
that there can be no set time when to begin
that <hi>Balance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore those that rely so much upon
finding out the <hi>Balance of Trade,</hi> do it by
taking the Computation from the Trade of
several years of one Nation with another,
and think it may be done by examining the
Accompt of the Custom-House Books, and
us'd to give for Instance the <hi>French</hi> Trade;
because the Revenue that arose from those
Duties on <hi>French</hi> Wines, and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
that were imported, were so much
greater than the Duties on those Goods that
were sent into <hi>France,</hi> and therefore us'd to
cry out very much against the <hi>French</hi> Trade:
Tho', perhaps, if that were throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
the <hi>French</hi> Trade was as profitable
to the Nation as any other Foreign Trade;
which might be made to appear, if it were
proper for this Debate.</p>
               <p>But to make up the <hi>Balance of Trade</hi> by
the Custom-House Books, is a very uncertain
way of reckoning: For all Foreign Goods
that are imported, pay a greater Duty than
the Native Goods exported. 'Tis the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of all Trading Nations to lay easy
Customs (if any) upon their Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50853:28"/>
that they may be sent cheap to
Foreign Markets, and thereby encourage
both the making and exporting of them:
And to lay high Duties upon Foreign Wares,
that they might be dear, and so not lessen
by their cheapness the consumption of the
Native Commodities: So that there can be
no Computation of the <hi>Balance of Trade</hi>
from the difference of the Sum of Money
that's paid at the Custom-House for the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Goods imported, and the Native ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
               <p>But suppose there should be an Allowance
made, in casting up the Accompt, for the
greatness of the Duties that the Foreign
Goods pay more than the Native, yet that
can be no advantage in the discovering the
<hi>Balance of Trade;</hi> because they cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by the Custom-House Books, what the
Native Goods that are exported are sold for:
For the <hi>Balance of the Trade</hi> must arise from
the <hi>Value</hi> of the Goods that are sold, and
not from the Quantity that are exported or
imported. And that's known only to the
Merchant that sells the Goods, and 'tis not
for his Interest to acquaint others with it,
and thereby discover the Profits of his
Trade: So that there can be no finding out
the <hi>Balance of Trade</hi> by the Custom-House
Books.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:50853:28"/>Some are of the opinion, that the way to
find out the <hi>Balance of Trade,</hi> is by the <hi>Foreign
Exchange.</hi> And they reckon that if the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi>
run high upon a Nation, 'tis a sign
that there are more <hi>Foreign Goods</hi> imported,
than there are of the <hi>Native</hi> exported; and
therefore there are <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> drawn
to answer the Effects, and make up the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the <hi>Value</hi> of what the <hi>Native Goods</hi>
were sold for less than the <hi>Foreign.</hi> This
seems to be the nearest way of guessing of
the <hi>Balance of the Trade</hi> of a Nation; but this
is altogether as uncertain.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Exchanges</hi> rise and fall every week,
and at some particular times in the year run
high against a Nation, and at other times run
as high on the contrary. As against a Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
a great Mart, or some Publick Sale, the
<hi>Exchange</hi> may run higher to <hi>Bourdeaux, Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
or <hi>Holland,</hi> upon an <hi>East-India</hi> Sale: And
at other times the <hi>Exchange</hi> may have run to
the same places as much on the contrary; for
no <hi>Exchange</hi> can constantly run high against
a Nation; for then the Merchants that trade
to that Country, must always lose by their
Trade: For if the Goods that they export,
don't yield them as much profit as the Goods
they import, they must lose by the Return.
And it cannot be suppos'd that Merchants
will always Trade to a Country, where they
must always lose by Trading; therefore there
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50853:29"/>
can be no account of the <hi>Balance of Trade by
Foreign Exchange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the rise of the <hi>Exchange</hi> betwixt
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> that's not to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
as a Rule, because of the extraordinary
charge of the War at this time.</p>
               <p>But if there could be an account taken of
the <hi>Balance of Trade,</hi> I can't see where the
advantage of it could be. For the reason
that's given for it, <hi>That the Overplus is paid
in Bullion, and the Nation grows so much the
richer, because the Balance is made up in Bullion,</hi>
is altogether a mistake: For Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
are but Commodities; and one sort of
Commodity is as good as another, so it be
of the same value. An hundred pounds
worth of Copper is as good to a Merchant,
as if he imported an hundred pounds worth
of Silver, and he may get as much by it.
Besides, some Countries have no Gold and
Silver, and yet the Trade to these Countries
may be as profitable to the Merchant and
Nation, as to the other Countries from
whence they fetch the Gold and Silver; as
the Trade to <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> and the
Northern parts of the World, from whence
they fetch Pitch, Tar, Hemp, and Timber, is
as profitable to <hi>England,</hi> as the Trade to
<hi>Spain,</hi> from whence the Merchant fetches the
Bullion; tho' those very Goods, Pitch, Tar,
Hemp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are bought, for the most part,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50853:29"/>
with the Bullion that's brought from <hi>Spain:</hi>
For all Merchants get by their Trade; and
if they grow rich, the Nation thrives.</p>
               <p>For a Nation grows rich, by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
growing rich. Besides, those Goods,
Pitch, Tar, and Hemp, are more profitable
Commodities to <hi>England,</hi> than Bullion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are Materials for the building of
Ships, and employ more hands in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them after they are imported, than
Bullion does.</p>
               <p>And the only way to know what sort of
Goods and Trade are most profitable to a
Nation, is by examining which sort of Goods
employ most hands by importing and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing.
For every man that works, is
paid for his time; and the more there are
employ'd in a Nation, the richer the Nation
grows: And therefore the importing of
unwrought Goods, such as Flax, Raw-silk,
Cottons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all sorts of bulky and
weighty Goods, such as Wine, Pitch, Tar,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more profitable to a Nation, than
Wrought-silks, Linnens or Callicoes; or
Gold, Silver, and Goods of little Bulk in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to their weight: Because the Nation
gets the profit by the making of the Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silk,
Flax and Cottons into Wrought silks,
Linnen, and all such things as are made of
of Cotton. And by the bulky Goods, a
great profit from their Freight. But this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50853:30"/>
Rule all Trading Nations are acquainted
with, and therefore lay high Duties upon all
manufactur'd Goods, and a less Duty upon
those unmanufactur'd.</p>
               <p>Some, upon this Consideration, are for
prohibiting not only almost all sorts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactur'd
Goods, but several other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities;
because they think they hinder the
making and consuming of their own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
and Native Commodities. But in
this they are under a great mistake; and,
perhaps, there is nothing so prejudicial to
the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> as the many Laws for
prohibiting Commodities, or laying too high
a Duty, which amounts to a Prohibition:
For by such Prohibition, the Trade to such
a Country is wholly lost, by which the profit
that the <hi>English</hi> Merchant us'd to get by sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Foreign Goods, the profit of the
Owners of the Ship for the Freight, the
profit from the Native Commodities that
us'd to be sent in Exchange, with the profit
of the Customs to the Government, are lost.
By such Laws, several sorts of Linnens, and
other Commodities, are prohibited, and the
Trade to several parts of <hi>Germany, Russia,
Muscovy,</hi> &amp;c. is thereby almost lost.</p>
               <p>A well-regulated and proportion'd Duty
laid upon Foreign Wares, may be very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to a Trading Nation; but then it must be
so proportion'd, that it may not hinder the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50853:30"/>
importation of such Foreign Goods, nor
lessen the make and consumption of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Commodities that are for the same uses;
which may be done by setting the Duties so
high, as that the Native Commodities may
be afforded much cheaper. And then the
Foreign Wares will only be bought and us'd
by the richer sort of People, and the Native
Commodities will be us'd by the rest, which
are the great Body of the People, that cause
the great consumption. And that proportion
of the Native Commodities which, perhaps,
might have been us'd by the richer sort, if
such Foreign Wares had not been imported,
will be exported in Exchange by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
and be consum'd by the richer People
of those Countries from whence such Goods
were imported: So that the same quantity
of the Native Commodities will be made
and consum'd; the Owners of Ships, and
Mariners, will have profit by the Freight;
the Merchant by his Trade, and the King by
his Customs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For things have no Value in themselves;</hi>
It is opinion and fashion brings them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
use, and gives them a value: And all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Wares, especially the dearer sort, are
us'd chiefly for Ornaments, and as Badges of
Riches, because they are Foreign and rare;
and not from any extraordinary quality or
goodness in the make of them. And the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50853:31"/>
same humor and opinion is in all Nations.
The <hi>French</hi> value the <hi>English</hi> Cloth, Hats,
Gloves, and other <hi>English</hi> Wares, more than
their own; as we us'd to do <hi>French</hi> Stuffs,
Hats, and Jessamin Gloves, and other <hi>French</hi>
Goods. And this particular humor and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of valuing Foreign Commodities, is
the chief support of Foreign Trade, which
is so beneficial to all Nations. Therefore
there is nothing of so great a Concern to a
Trading Nation, as the well-regulating the
Custom House Rates.</p>
               <p>Those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that discourse much of the
<hi>Balance of Trade,</hi> do often find fault with
the wearing and consuming so much Foreign
Wares, which hinder, in their opinion, the
consumption of the Native. And therefore
us'd to exclaim much against the wearing of
Silk, and drinking so much <hi>French,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wines: And do believe, that if such
quantities of Foreign Goods were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and worn, the Return would be
made in Bullion, which would make the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
much richer. This is their general
Complaint: But, if it be consider'd, it will
be found that there is little reason for't; and
that the wearing of Silk, may be as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Nation as the wearing of Cloth.
That the importing of Wines makes the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as rich, as by importing of Bullion.
And that if the Inhabitants did not wear
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50853:31"/>
Silk, and drink Wine, they would neither
have Silk, Wine, nor Bullion.</p>
               <p>For this is a certain Maxim in Trade, <hi>That
the foundation of all Foreign Trade is from the
Native or Staple Commodities of each Country.</hi> It
is by the Exchange of the Staple Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>England,</hi> Tin, Lead, and all sorts of
Woollen Manufactures, that Gold, Silver,
Silk, Wines, and all sorts of Foreign Goods
are imported. And as a Nation has nothing
else at first to begin Traffick, but with its
Native Commodities, so it cannot be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
without. And whensoever those are
prohibited, the Trade to that Country must
be lost, with the profit that was got by that
Trade;) for there is no Foreign Trade but is
profitable to a Nation, or at least may be
made so;) and it is not for the Interest of a
Trading Nation, to use none but their own
Native Commodities. And therefore if Silks
were not worn here, then there would be
none imported; nor no Cloth nor Serges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and worn in those Countries from
whence we fetch our Silk: because they have
nothing to give in Exchange but Silk, which
is their Native Commodity.</p>
               <p>And it is more profitable for the Nation,
that the Woollen Manufactures should be
worn in Foreign Countries, than in their
own: because the profit of the carriage,
which is the exporting of the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50853:32"/>
and importing of the Silk, is
gain'd by it. And the same general Rule
maybe observ'd in the Trade for Wines, and
all Foreign Wares.</p>
               <p>And tho' the importing of <hi>Wines</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
cry'd out against, yet it is one of the
best Trades to <hi>England;</hi> for, being a very
bulky Commodity, it pays a great Freight:
And being for the use of the richer People, it
pays a greater Duty to the King, and that
without complaint. For <hi>England</hi> being an
Island, and the Riches and Strength of it
being from Trade and Shipping, those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
that are bulky, ought to be valued
as most profitable.</p>
               <p>And if some <hi>Gentlemen</hi> object, <hi>That the
greatest part of the</hi> French <hi>Wines us'd to be
bought with Bullion:</hi> They will answer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if they reflect that we have no Bullion
here in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore must have it
at first by the Exchange of some of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Commodities. And if it be fetch'd
from <hi>Spain</hi> by Bays, Serges, or other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and afterwards carried into <hi>France,</hi>
that's no disadvantage: For the Merchants
are paid for the double carriage of it, in the
price of the Wines by those that sell 'em;
for every Merchant expects profit in making
his Bargain.</p>
               <p>But some <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are of opinion, That
it is a great disadvantage to a Nation to carry
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50853:32"/>
out the Bullion, which is a Treasure, and not
perishable; and bring in Wines that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd,
and the Nation never the richer for
them after they are drank. And it is by this
way that they make up the account of the
Balance, whether a Nation gets or loses by
Trade, And for Argument, commonly use
a Simile, formerly publish'd by Mr. <hi>Mun</hi>
in his Discourse of the <hi>Balance of Trade;</hi> and
compare the Stock of a Nation to a private
person, suppos'd to have a thousand pound a
year, and two thousand pound in his Chest:
If he spends fifteen hundred a year, in four
years time his two thousand pound will be
spent. And so on the contrary, if he spends
but five hundred pounds a year, in the same
time he will double his money in his Chest.
The same will be to a Nation; so much as is
imported and consumed more of the Foreign
Commodities than is exported of the Native,
so much will the Stock of the Nation be
wasted. And so on the contrary, by how
much less is consumed of Foreign Wares
than is exported of the Native, so much will
the Stock of the Nation be increased, because
the Balance on either side must be return'd in
Bullion.</p>
               <p>Upon this Simile is founded the opinion
for the <hi>Balance of Trade,</hi> which is to enquire,
<hi>Whether a Nation gets or loses by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Trade, from the difference that each Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50853:33"/>
consumes in the perishable Goods of each
Country.</hi> But as the Arguments are grounded
on a Simile, so they have the Fate of all such
Arguments, to be lame, and not run upon all
four; according to the saying, <hi>Similitudo non
currit quatuor pedibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Stock of a Nation is vafily dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that of a private persons; the
one is infinite, the other finite. There is
every year a Harvest, a perpetual increase of
Cattel, and the Mines can never be exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So that the two thousand pounds in the
Chest may be spent, which is a limited Sum;
yet the Tin, Lead, Wooll, and those Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
that are made of them, can never
be consum'd; for no sort of Trade can
waste the Stock of a Nation.</p>
               <p>But if we consider a Nation as consisting
of a Body of People, the inhabitants may
be made richer or poorer; but it is not
by consuming the Stock of the Nation,
but for want of improving the Stock. It
is not by Trading, but for want of Trade.
That Nation is accounted rich, when the
greatest number of the inhabitants are rich.
And they are only made rich by Industry,
Arts, and Traffick. By Industry and Art,
the Minerals are dug out of the earth, and
made useful; the Land made more fertile,
by which is produced a greater increase of
the Native Stock: And from the profit of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50853:33"/>
this increase of Stock, the People are paid
for their Time, Art and Industry, which
makes such inhabitants rich. And by Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and Commerce the Merchant, Owners
of Ships, and Sailers grow rich, by being
paid for carrying away the surplus of what
is improved more than can be used in the
Country, and exchanging it for something
that's useful which that Country could not
produce; which surplus, if it was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away, would by its plenty bring down
the Value of the Native Stock, and put a
stop to the Labour and Industry of the
People, in further improving the Wares of
the Country.</p>
               <p>It is not material what sort of Foreign
Wares the surplus is exchang'd for, whether
they are perishable or not, so they do not
lessen the Industry of the People; which is
easily prevented, by putting such a Duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, as may make them too dear for
common use. For the Merchant, and those
that are concern'd in the shipping, grow
rich, and get as much by importing Wines,
Oils, Fruit, and other perishable Goods, as
they would do by importing Iron, Copper,
Silver, Gold, or other Goods as durable: or
perhaps more, because of the bulkiness of the
Oils, Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which pays a greater Freight
than the other Goods. And it is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Merchant, and to all Traders in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50853:34"/>
general, that the Goods they deal in are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishable;
because there is a continual occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to make and fetch more as fast as those
are spent. And if they were to deal only in
Wares that were not perishable, in a short
time there would be more imported of such
Goods than there was occasion for; and so
there would be an end of their Trade, and
a stop to the Industry of the People.</p>
               <p>So that the question of which Nation
thrives most, cannot be determined by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
which imports most Goods in value
that are perishable; but by observing which
imports most of such sorts of Goods that
most increase or lessen the Labour and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the People, and which Nation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
or exports most of such Goods by
which the greatest number of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are made rich.</p>
               <p>This can never be discern'd by the value of
Goods in the Custom-House Books, or by
any other Calculation that is propos'd for the
taking an account of the <hi>Balance of Trade.</hi>
For tho' a Nation should import and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
less in value of the Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
than are exported of the Native; and
the rest, which is the Balance, should be paid
in Bullion: yet such a Nation may grow
poor, and be undone.</p>
               <p>For suppose <hi>Antwerp</hi> were the Staple for
Wooll, (as 'twas formerly, before <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50853:34"/>
had the knowledge of making Cloth) and
the <hi>English</hi> Wooll was carried thither; and
in Exchange, the Merchants brought back as
much Cloth as was necessary to supply <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the rest they return'd in Bullion:
yet it is plain the Nation would be a great
loser by such a Trade, tho' it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
so much of their Foreign Cloth in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
as the <hi>Flemings</hi> did of our Wooll. For
by such a Trade, all those that us'd to make
the Cloth and Stuff, would grow poor for
want of employment, and the Nation would
lose the profit of their labour.</p>
               <p>And the same Argument might be us'd in
exporting of Raw Hides, or any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
that's unwrought. So that it is not
from the value of the Goods imported, but
from the difference in the nature and quality
of the Goods, that makes a Nation richer
or poorer.</p>
               <p>And the importing of Wines, or any other
Commodities that are only for the use of the
richer sort of People, which do not hinder
the labour and industry of the Nation, are
as profitable as the importing, of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
So that the taking an account of the
Poverty or Riches of a Nation by such a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade</hi> from the value of Goods, if such
accounts could be taken, would be of no use.</p>
               <p>There is but one infallible Symptom to
know when Trading Nations thrive and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50853:35"/>
grow rich; that is, when the Inhabitants
grow more populous; when they enlarge and
new-build their Cities and Towns; and
when they increase their Ships and Naval
Strength.</p>
               <p>I have insisted longer on this Subject than
was necessary in this Discourse; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because the <hi>Balance of Trade</hi> does so
generally perplex all Debates concerning
Trade. And that the Notion seems as if it
were at first invented by some Merchants, on
pu pose to mislead Mens Reasons about
Trade; because it is commonly us'd for an
Argument against any flourishing Trade, <hi>That
such a Trade is not for the Interest of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Merchants us'd to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Turky</hi> Company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>East-India</hi> Company. And now,
all of them against the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And all their
Arguments are drawn from the <hi>Balance of
Trade.</hi> By which Arguments they too often
prevail to get Prohibitions, and great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
to lessen such and such Trades,
for each Merchant's particular advantage,
and too often against the Interest of the
Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to return to the Question; that is,</hi>
Whether, if the Balance of Trade be against a
Nation, the Money will be carried out to pay the
Debt, be the Value of it rais'd or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50853:35"/>And tho' I am of an opinion, there never
was any <hi>Balance of Trade</hi> made up, nor can
be by any methods propos'd, as I have yet
hear'd of; nor any such uses to be made by
it, as is expected, if it could be found out:
yet because I cannot think that <hi>Gentlemen</hi> may
on a sudden alter their opinions by any thing
that I have wrote, against a Subject so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believ'd, I will therefore, for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
sake, suppose there is a <hi>Balance of
Trade,</hi> and that it is, or may be cast up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year with every Nation; yet it will not
follow that the Balance of the Account must
be paid in money. For if the Balance be
paid by Value, it is no matter by what sort
of Goods that Value is paid: <hi>For one sort of
Wares are as good as another, if the Values be
equal.</hi> An hundred pounds worth of Lead
or Iron, is as good as an hundred pounds
worth of Silver or Gold.</p>
               <p>The general way of Balancing all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
in Foreign Trade, is by Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.
For Foreign Exchange is the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sum of Money in one Country, to be
repaid the same Sum in the Foreign Coin of
another Country; with allowance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
for the time of paying it, according to
the Agreement; which is call'd with single
or double Usance.</p>
               <p>In the Infancy of Foreign Trade in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
all Foreign Exchange was made in an
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50853:36"/>
Office, set up on purpose to return Bills of
Exchange; which Office at first was setled
by Act of Parliament, and afterwards the
Kings granted Patents for the keeping of it.
The last Patent was granted to the Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
then Lord Treasurer, in the Reign of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Those that kept the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
did generally belong to the Mints, and
were well acquainted with Bullion and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Coins, but with no other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>In those days, being the beginning of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Trade, all sorts of Foreign Coins were
in all Trading Countries currant. In the
<hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> Foreign Coins were currant
till the year 1622, at which time a Placate
was set out, forbidding all Foreign Coins
to pass any otherwise than as Bullion, by
weight; except about half a score sorts of
Gold Coins, and as many Silver therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> all Foreign Coins were cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
till the year 1614, in the Reign of
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.</p>
               <p>In those days, all sorts of Money being
currant, the Money was often sent over <hi>in
Specie,</hi> from one Country to another to buy
Goods, and Balance Accompts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Reign of <hi>Harry</hi> VIII. the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
in the Kingdom being grown very
scarce, there was a great Complaint against
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50853:36"/>
the Exchangers, for sending away the Money
of the Kingdom; whereupon he ordered a
stop upon the Office of Foreign Exchange;
and prohibited, for some time, any Foreign
Bills to be either accepted or drawn, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the sending away of the Money.</p>
               <p>But since Foreign Trade is grown more
dispers'd and enlarg'd, almost every Merchant
accepts and draws Bills of Exchange. And
since no <hi>money</hi> now passes currant but in that
Country where it is coin'd, it is not usual
to send over Money <hi>in specie</hi> to buy Goods,
or balance the Accompt: For the Merchants
that draw and accept Bills of Exchange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
general Traders, and acquainted with the
Value of all sorts of Goods; and Money
being a Commodity, and reckon'd as Bullion
in a Foreign Country, if there be Effects of
the same Value to answer the Bill in any sort
of Goods, it is the same thing as if Money
was sent to answer it. And if the Merchant
has no effects in the Countrey where the Bill
is to be paid; yet if he has in any Foreign
Countrey, to which Bills of Exchange are
usually drawn, he may answer his Bill, and
pay the Balance of his accompt without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
by drawing Bills from one place to
another where his effects are.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> says, <hi>That
the Balance of the Foreign accompt must be sent
over and paid in Money,</hi> he must suppose that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50853:37"/>
the Nation has no other effects in any other
Foreign Countrey; but, that they are at
the self-same time even every where else,
which never was, nor never can be as long
as a Nation continues in Trade.</p>
               <p>And also that there must be a stop put to
Trade, till such an accompt be Balanc'd by
the payment of the Money; or else, a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that has any effects in Value, might send
over Goods to balance the accompt, without
sending over their Money.</p>
               <p>Besides, some Nations have little or no
Bullion in their Countrey; as <hi>Denmark,
Sueden,</hi> and the Northern parts of the World.
And yet the Merchants Accompts are as well
Paid and Balanc'd, as in any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where there is more plenty of Gold and
Silver.</p>
               <p>For, as the course of Foreign Trade now
is, there is no occasion to send over Money
to buy Goods, or Balance the Account; for
the Money is paid at the time when the Bill
is first drawn: So that there is no occasion
to send Money over where the Bill is to be
accepted and repaid; and the buying of
Goods, or Balancing of the Accompt, is
done by the Foreign Money of the Countrey,
which is receiv'd from the person that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
the Bill.</p>
               <p>Money is never carried out of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where it is Coin'd, except it be to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50853:37"/>
those Countries where the Bullion bears a
higher price than what the Money is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
at: Or when the Exchange runs so
high to any Country, as it will be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to the Merchant to melt down the <hi>money,</hi>
and send it over in <hi>Bullion,</hi> than by <hi>Bills of
Exchange.</hi> And in both these Cases it may
often fall out, that the <hi>money</hi> may be sent
over to a Country, and yet no Debt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in that Country. And therefore the
<hi>Balancing the Accompt,</hi> can't be the reason of
drawing the <hi>money</hi> out of a Nation.</p>
               <p>For tho' <hi>Spain</hi> were not indebted to any
Nation, yet the Gold and Silver would be
brought away: For being more plentiful
there than in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> because of
the <hi>West-Indies</hi> that belong to 'em, is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
there of a lower Value. And being
their chief Staple Commodity, having little
other Goods of Value, if they will Trade
with other Nations, and have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
they must give their <hi>Bullion in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi>
tho' their Laws are Capital that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
it. And yet every time they Traffick
with other Nations, there may be no Debts
left on either side.</p>
               <p>And the same likewise may be observ'd in
the course of <hi>Foreign Exchange.</hi> For the rise
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50853:38"/>
and fall of <hi>Foreign Exchange,</hi> is from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Sums that are to be return'd
in the <hi>Exchange:</hi> Just as all sorts of Goods
are cheaper or dearer, from their plenty or
scarcity; so the <hi>Exchange</hi> to any place is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
higher or lower, according to the greater
or lesser quantity of <hi>money</hi> that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
by the <hi>Exchange.</hi> Sometimes an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound may be worth five or ten <hi>per
cent.</hi> to be return'd; and a little while after,
to the same place, may be worth as much to
the contrary. And if it happens when the
<hi>Exchange</hi> is high, that there is as great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
in sending to the same place the
<hi>Bullion,</hi> as there is to get a <hi>Bill of Exchange;</hi>
the Merchant, to save five or ten <hi>per cent.</hi>
will send away the <hi>money.</hi> And this may
fall out, when there is no Debt owing at the
place. As to instance:</p>
               <p>If a Merchant were to buy Goods at
<hi>Francfort,</hi> or <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> at the Fair, or <hi>East-India</hi> Sale; if the <hi>Exchange</hi> be high, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:50853:38"/>The Inferences from this Discourse of the
<hi>Balance of Trade,</hi> and <hi>Foreign Exchange,</hi> are:</p>
               <p>That a Trading Nation is made Rich by Traffick,
and the Industry of the Inhabitants. And that
the Native Stock of a Nation can never be
wasted.</p>
               <p>That no sort of Commodities ought to be totally
prohibited. And that the freer the Trade is,
the better the Nation will thrive.</p>
               <p>That the Poverty and Riches of a Nation, does
not depend upon a lesser or greater consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of Foreign Goods, nor on the difference
of the Value of those Goods that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd.</p>
               <p>That the Balance of Trade is a Nation that
serves rather to puzzle all Debates of Trade,
than to discover any particular Advantages
that a Nation may get by regulating of
Trade.</p>
               <p>That the Balance of Trade (if there be one)
is not the cause of sending away the Money
out of a Nation: But that proceeds from the
difference of the Value of Bullion in several
Countries, and from the Profit that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50853:39"/>
makes by sending it away, more than by
the Bills of Exchange.</p>
               <p>That there is no Occasion to send away Money
or Bullion to pay bills of Exchange, or Balance
Accompts.</p>
               <p>That all sorts of Goods of the Value of the
Bill of Exchange, or the Balance of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
will answer the Bill, and Balance the
Accompt as well as Money.</p>

               <head>Of Raising the Value of
Money, with the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of it, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</head>
               <p>IT has been a Custom in all Ages, and
amongst all Nations, to Raise the Value
of their Money, and is as Ancient as the
Coinage of Money, and not a late Invention,
as some are of Opinion.</p>
               <p>It was a Custom among the <hi>Assyrians, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
and <hi>Grecians,</hi> as might be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if it were necessary. But, to shew
that it was no Modern Invention, will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
appear by the <hi>Romans</hi> Raising the
Value of their Coin. The <hi>As,</hi> being the
Copper Money of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was at first
Coin'd of a pound Weight. And in the first
<hi>Punick</hi> War, in the Dictatorship of <hi>Fabius
Maximus,</hi> it weigh'd but two Ounces, and
all the lesser pieces of it were abated in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50853:40"/>
The <hi>As</hi> was afterwards reduced to
an Ounce, and again by <hi>Papirius</hi> to half an
Ounce. When the <hi>Romans</hi> began first to
Coin Silver Money, the <hi>Denarius,</hi> which was
an Ounce of fine Silver, and about the Value
of our Crown, was made current for ten
<hi>Ases.</hi> The Half-<hi>Denarius,</hi> the <hi>Sestertius,</hi> and
the <hi>Sextula,</hi> which was Six in an Ounce,
were Coin'd to the same proportion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Denarius</hi> was Coin'd to Seven in
an Ounce; and after that to the Weight of
a <hi>Drachma,</hi> which is Eight in an Ounce:
And the lesser parts, as, the <hi>Sestertius,
Sextula,</hi> &amp;c. were abated in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Their Gold Money was also from time to
time Raised: Those Pieces called <hi>Solidi Aurei,</hi>
which were at first Coin'd to Forty Eight
Pieces in the pound, were at several times
Rais'd. And in the time of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the
Emperor, were coin'd to Seventy two Pieces
in the Pound.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> did not only Raise the Value
of their Money, by Coining of it Lighter;
but they did also Raise it by putting in an
Allay, which they did at several times, and
by several proportions. And in the time of
<hi>Livius Drusus,</hi> the Allay was so excessive,
that the mixture was Eight Ounces Copper,
and Four Ounces fine Silver in a Pound <hi>Troy.</hi>
This base Money created a disturbance
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50853:40"/>
amongst the People; which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of that saying in <hi>Tully</hi>'s Offices,
<q>
                     <l>Iactabatur enim illis Temporibus Nummis,</l>
                     <l>Vt nemo sciret quid haberet in Pecunia:</l>
                  </q>
Whereupon <hi>Marius Gratidianus,</hi> being <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vir
Monetae cudendae,</hi> brought in an Ordinance
for the Calling in, and Regulating this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for which he was in great Efteem
amongst the People.</p>
               <p>This is sufficient to shew, that the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Value of the Money is no late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
               <p>In these Latter Ages all the Kingdoms and
States of <hi>Europe</hi> have from time to time
Rais'd the <hi>Value of their Money,</hi> is very plain.
In <hi>France,</hi> the Ounce of their Standard Silver,
which is the <hi>French</hi> Crown, was at first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in Sixty <hi>Sous,</hi> afterwards the Crown
was rais'd to Sixty five, and of late to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
two <hi>Sous:</hi> And the New Crown was
from time to time made Lighter; that is,
the Pound <hi>Troy,</hi> which contains Twelve
Ounces, was at first divided into Twelve
Crowns, and afterwards into Thirteen
Crowns, and of late into Fourteen Crowns
and almost an half. And there are Old
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50853:41"/>
Crowns still current in <hi>France</hi> that have the
Stamps upon them, which shew how they
have been several times Rais'd.</p>
               <p>The Ounce or Dollar of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
was at first divided into Thirty six
Stivers, afterwards Rais'd to Forty, and
since higher, tho' they have another way of
Raising their Money, which is, by adding a
greater Allay. The Ounce, or Rix-Dollar
of the Emperor, which was at first Coin'd
at Fifty Crutzers, was Raised to Fifty five,
and after that to Sixty. In <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
every Merchant knows that has Traded
thither, that the Values, of their Monies
have been several times Raised.</p>
               <p>In <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>Osbright</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King,
till <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the Peny was a Peny
weight of fine Silver, and the Pound was
a Pound <hi>Troy</hi> Weight of fine Silver. He
Rais'd the Value of the Money by putting
Eighteen peny Weight of Allay into the
Pound <hi>Troy.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Lownds in his Report
containing an Essay for the Amendment of the
Silver Coins,</hi> has given a very exact Account
since <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's Time, taken from
the Records of the Mint, how the Money
of <hi>England</hi> has been from time to time Rais'd.
By which it appears, that the Silver Peny
which in the beginning of his Reign weigh'd
a Peny-Weight, there being then but Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50853:41"/>
pence in an Ounce, has been by Degrees,
in several Kings Reigns Coin'd lesser and
lighter; and the Ounce has been divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Twenty five pence, Thirty, Thirty seven
pence halfpeny, Forty five pence. And in the
beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, the
Crown, or Ounce, was divided into Sixty
pence: And in the latter end of her Reign
into Sixty two pence.</p>
               <p>The Standard and course of the Mint has
continued to this time without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
except what was made by an Act in
the Reign of King <hi>Charles II.</hi> which gave
away the charge of Coinage, being Two
shillings in the Pound <hi>Troy</hi> advantage, for
an incouragement to those that brought Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
into the Mint; which rais'd the price of
Bullion to the Nation, instead of raising the
Value of the Coin.</p>
               <p>The several States and Princes. of <hi>Italy</hi>
have Rais'd their Coins; and if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
it might be easily prov'd, that there
is not one Mint in <hi>Europe</hi> that has been of any
continuance, but has Coin'd their Money
lighter then they did at the first beginning
of their Coinage.</p>
               <p>The way of raising the Value of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
is not in all Countries alike. In the
<hi>Vnited Provinces, Flanders, Germany,</hi> and the
Northern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> it has been usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50853:42"/>
by putting in a greater Allay, and making
of it a little courser, and a little lighter.</p>
               <p>The Standard of the <hi>Vnited States</hi> was at
first Nine Ounces and an half fine Silver, and
Two and an half Allay in the pound <hi>Troy:</hi>
But since, by degrees, their Standard has
been brought to Nine Ounces fine, and Three
Ounces Allay. And likewise their new Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
have been Coined lighter; so that the
old Dollars that went before at Six and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Stivers, were rais'd to Forty. And the
same might be observ'd in all the rest of the
Mints of <hi>Flanders, Germany,</hi> and the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
parts.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the way of
raising their Coin, has been generally by
keeping the old Standard for fineness, and
only by altering the weight; from time to
time Coining their <hi>New Money</hi> lighter, as
they had occasion to raise the Value of their
<hi>Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the usual method
of raising their <hi>Money</hi> has not been by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Standard either in fineness or
weight; but by giving a Rise to their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
by a Computation made from the Value
of the <hi>Copper Money;</hi> that is, a <hi>Riall</hi> of Eight,
which in <hi>Spain</hi> was formerly of the Value of
Three hundred and seventy <hi>Malvedies,</hi> was
raised to pass currant for Four hundred <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedies,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50853:42"/>
which is their <hi>Copper Money,</hi> and so
higher from time to time.</p>
               <p>And the same is to be observ'd in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal:</hi>
They raise the Value of their <hi>Money</hi> by
their <hi>Reas,</hi> which is their <hi>Copper Money.</hi> And
the <hi>Ducat,</hi> or <hi>Crusado,</hi> that us'd to pass for
Four hundred <hi>Reas,</hi> has been rais'd to Four
hundred and fifty, and higher.</p>
               <p>The <hi>usual Proportion of Value</hi> that <hi>Princes</hi>
and <hi>States</hi> give to their Silver and Gold <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
when they Raise the Value of them, is
generally betwixt Ten and Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi>
above the Market-price of Silver and Gold.
The <hi>French Crown</hi> was Raised from Sixty
<hi>Sous,</hi> to Sixty five, which is about Ten <hi>percent.</hi>
And about three or four Years since,
the <hi>Crown</hi> was Raised to Seventy two <hi>Sous,</hi>
which is near Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> The <hi>Rix-Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
Coin'd at Fifty <hi>Stivers,</hi> was Raised to
Fifty five <hi>Stivers,</hi> and since to Sixty, which is
about Ten <hi>per cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have Rais'd their
<hi>Money</hi> from Twenty, to Twenty five, Thirty,
Thirty seven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whch is after the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as the Emperor, the <hi>French</hi> King, and
other <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have done.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> raise the Value of their <hi>Money</hi>
by adding a greater <hi>Allay</hi> (as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd)
which is less taken notice of, and so
does not disturb the minds of those persons
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50853:43"/>
who think the <hi>value of Money</hi> is solely from
the <hi>quantity of fine Silver in each piece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reason why <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to give no greater <hi>Proportion of Value</hi>
to their <hi>Money</hi> when they new raise it, than
betwixt Ten and Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> above the
currant price of <hi>Bullion,</hi> is, to prevent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting.</p>
               <p>For tho' there are Laws in all Countries,
with severe Penalties, to prohibit the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
of <hi>Money,</hi> yet none are kept and
observed, where there is great Profit to be
got by breaking of them. And no persons
will counterfeit the Stamp, and make the
<hi>Money</hi> the same both in weight and fineness,
for only Ten or Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> Profit. For
they must Coin a great quantity, to make
their Profit considerable; if they make the
<hi>Money</hi> of the same weight and fineness, it
will not be One hundred and forty pound
clear Profit in Coining of a Thousand pound
at Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> because of the charge of
Coinage. And none but the rich man can
vent a great quantity, and he'll not hazard
the loss of his Life and Estate for such small
Gain. The poor man cannot attempt it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he can neither get <hi>Bullion</hi> to Coin, nor
vent a quantity after 'tis Coin'd. And why
should any man venture his Life for such
small Profit, when every Merchant and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
gets more without any such hazard?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50853:43"/>Therefore those that coin false <hi>Money,</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
the Metal as well as the Stamp, to
make it profitable. But then it is much easier
discovered, and they are often punish'd with
death: For they must counterfeit the weight,
colour, and size of the Piece, as well as the
Stamp; which is much more difficult than
only to counterfeit the Stamp</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> may as safely
coin their <hi>Money</hi> Ten or Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> above
the price of <hi>Bullion,</hi> without danger of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting,
as if they should coin it exactly
to the Market-price.</p>
               <p>The Reason why the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi>
when they have rais'd the Value of their
<hi>Money,</hi> have not coin'd it nearer to the price
of <hi>Bullion,</hi> than about the difference of Ten
<hi>per cent.</hi> is to avoid the too often raising the
Value of their Coin; which, when ever it
is done, is apt to create some little murmur
and discontent amongst the People. And if
they should coin it near the Value, they
would be forced to raise their <hi>Money</hi> as oft as
Silver rises in its price above the Value of the
Coin, which would be every Five or Ten
Year; whereas by raising of it betwixt Ten
of Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> they have not usually
rais'd it but once in Fifty or Threescore
Years.</p>
               <p>As to instance from <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's
time to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was betwixt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50853:44"/>
Two hundred and fifty, and Three hundred
Years from the first raising of the <hi>Money,</hi>
from Twenty pence in an Ounce of Silver
to Threescore pence, is betwixt Ten or
Twelve <hi>per cent.</hi> for every Fifty Years. And
the like might be observ'd, if it were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
in all the Mints of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. when there
was so great an <hi>Allay</hi> put into the <hi>Money</hi> as
rais'd it to Forty or Fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> profit above
the price of Silver, there were Barrels of
counterfeit <hi>Money</hi> seiz'd at the Custom-house,
that were sent from Foreign parts. The
knowledge of that created so great a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy
and disturbance in the minds of the
People, that scarce any <hi>Money</hi> would pass,
for fear of receiving that which was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
               <p>For the knowledge of the goodness of
Silver, is a <hi>Mystery</hi> that few are acquainted
with; and when there is so great an <hi>Allay</hi>
put into the <hi>Money,</hi> those that counterfeit
may make the Metal as good, if not better
than the true <hi>Money,</hi> because there's profit
sufficient by only counterfeiting the Stamp.
And that may be so well imitated, as not
one in a thousand may discover the difference
betwixt the true and the false Stamp. And
tho' the Metal may be as good or better than
the true <hi>Money,</hi> yet it being counterfeited, it's
none of the Government's <hi>Money.</hi> And want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50853:44"/>
their Authority, by which it is made
currant, no man is oblig'd to take it; and
therefore every body refuses the <hi>Money</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for fear the loss should fall upon him
that last takes it; so that the <hi>Money</hi> becomes
useless, having lost the currancy and quality
of <hi>Money,</hi> and all the murmur and disorder
ensues that usually attends a Nation that
want <hi>Money</hi> to drive their Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>Other Instances might be given, but this,
with the common usage of not exceeding
Ten or Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> when the <hi>Money</hi> is
rais'd, may be sufficient to answer Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s
Objection, <hi>That the Governments cannot raise
their Money as high as they please; nor make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as Rich as they please.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The great Objection that Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>makes
against the raising the Value of</hi> Money, is,
That if the Government have a Power to give a
Value of Ten <hi>per cent.</hi> to their Money, why not
Twenty, Fifty, or as high as they please? And
then it would be in the Government's Power at
any time to make themselves as rich as they
please.</p>
               <p>Such a Power, at this time, were to be
wish'd for, when the Nation is engag'd in
so chargeable a War: But that's the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that attends us, that such a Power can
be only wish'd for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:50853:45"/>For tho' <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have a Power
to give a Value to their <hi>Money,</hi> yet that
Power is limited. And when ever they have
attempted to exceed those Limits, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an extraordinary emergency they have
sometimes done, they have fallen under
greater mischiefs, by reason the <hi>Money</hi> has
been always counterfeited, than the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
they propos'd to themselves amounted
to by doing of it; and have always been
forc'd to call in such <hi>Money,</hi> and reduce the
Value within its usual limits and bounds.</p>
               <p>There are two <hi>Causes</hi> why <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>States</hi> raise the Value of their <hi>money;</hi> the
one is <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and the other <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Common Cause</hi> of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Value of the Coin, is the Rise of
<hi>Bullion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gold and Silver are Commodities for
other Uses, besides the making of <hi>money;</hi> as
for making of Plate, Lace, Gilding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
besides, it's scarcer in some Countries, and
more plenty in others: And the <hi>Value of all
things arising from their Occasions;</hi> and <hi>Plenty
and Scarcity making things cheap and dear;</hi>
when ever the Goldsmiths, and the Makers
of Plate, Lace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Merchants to
export it to the <hi>Indies,</hi> or those Countries
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50853:45"/>
where 'tis more scarce, will give more for
<hi>Bullion</hi> to supply such occasions, than the Mints
can afford to do, according to the Value the
<hi>money</hi> is at, the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have
been forced from time to time to raise the
Value of their <hi>Coin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to prevent it from being
melted down, and carried away.</p>
               <p>The knowledge when <hi>Bullion</hi> is risen above
the Value of the <hi>money,</hi> is discover'd by the
Mints: For the Mints are the common Shops
and Market place for the Merchants to carry
in their <hi>Bullion.</hi> And when ever they forbear
the bringing of it thither, it is certain it will
yield them a better price in another place:
For <hi>Bullion</hi> never continues long in a place
unalter'd, because it yields no profit while it
continues so. But if it be carried to the Mint
to be Coin'd, it becomes useful for Trade
and Commerce, and saves the charge of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
<hi>money,</hi> or else may be put out to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
And if it be wrought into Plate,
Lace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it pays for the fashion and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship.
And if it be transported to the
<hi>Indies,</hi> or some Country where it's dearer, it
produces profit by the exchange of those
Goods that are bought with it.</p>
               <p>When ever any of the Princes and States
in <hi>Europe</hi> Raise the Value of their Coin,
the rest generally follow. It were too long
to give particular Instances; but if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
by the Records of the Mints of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50853:46"/>
Kings of <hi>France,</hi> with those of the Mints of
the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> it will appear, that
they have Rais'd their Money from time to
time, as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have done, or
rather higher. For that, since the time of
St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was co-temporary with <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the IIId. the <hi>Sols</hi> and Crowns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
then near six times more of fine
Silver, than the <hi>Sols</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Crowns do
that are lately Coin'd; which is a greater
proportion than the Money has Risen in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
since <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's Time, being
not quite four times lighter: The reason is,
it's almost a hundred years since the <hi>English</hi>
have Raised the Value of their Silver Coin;
and in the same time the <hi>French</hi> have Rais'd
theirs twice; which would have made the
<hi>English</hi> Money much of the same Rise, with
giving of allowance to the custom of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
who have always undervalued their
Silver Money, and overvalued their Gold,
in respect to their Neighbour Nations; and
have since twice Rais'd the value of their
Gold; to wit, in King <hi>Iames</hi> the First's
time, who Coin'd a twenty-Shilling-piece of
Gold lighter by Two shillings, than that
which he Coin'd in the beginning of his
Reign; which rais'd the value of his first
<hi>Iacobus</hi>'s to Two and Twenty Shillings.
And in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time, who
Coin'd the Guinea Two shillings lighter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50853:46"/>
han the Broad-Piece: So that when the
Guinea was currant at Twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
the Broad-Piece went for Two and
Twenty.</p>
               <p>There seems to be an absolute necessity for
the Princes aud States of <hi>Europe</hi> to Raise the
value of their Money much about the same
time, or else they cannot preserve it in their
Countries, notwithstanding any severe Laws
to prohibit the Melting and Exporting of it.
For there being a constant Commerce and
Traffick betwixt all the Countries of <hi>Europe;</hi>
If one Prince sets a much higher value on
his Money than another, the Merchants,
whose business it is to observe where they
can get most profit, will melt down the
Coin of one Countrey, and carry it to the
Mint of another Countrey, where the Money
is Rais'd, and will yield the greatest price.</p>
               <p>This will appear plain by an Instance here
in <hi>England:</hi> For the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not Rais'd their Silver Money since the
Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is about
a hundred years ago; and the rest of the
Princes and States of <hi>Europe</hi> having since that
time twice rais'd their several Coins, to wit,
in the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, and
about Four or Five years since: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there has been since that time Coin'd
in <hi>England</hi> (with allowance of what was
Coin'd in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign) the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50853:47"/>
Sum of 19429061 <hi>l. 19 s. 6 d.</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Records of the Mint; yet by
the Computation that Mr. <hi>Lownds</hi> makes,
there is not above Five Millions Six hundred
thousand pounds remaining; which, in my
opinion, is more than will be found to be,
upon the new Coinage of the Money, by the
calculation he makes from the Worn and
Clipp'd Money. So that there has been near
Fourteen Millions melted down and carried
away within this space of time. And had
it not been for some accidental causes that
brought Bullion to the Mint since the Foreign
Princes have rais'd the value of their Coins,
there had been very little Silver Money
Coin'd, and much less to be found now in
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time, by the
Civil Wars of <hi>England,</hi> the Plate was brought
to the Mints to be Coin'd; which was the
cause of the great sum of Silver Money Coin'd
in his Reign.</p>
               <p>The Calling in the Parliament-Money in
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time, and new
Coining of it: The Two or Three hundred
thousand pounds that were yearly sent into
<hi>England</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> upon some particular
occasions during his Reign, with the Money
that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was sold for: And the Act of
Parliament for giving away the charge of
Coinage, to incourage the Merchants to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50853:47"/>
bring Bullion to the Mint, being almost
Three and an Half <hi>per cent.</hi> were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Silver <hi>money</hi> Coin'd in his Reign.</p>
               <p>And if the two Sums Coined in these two
Kings Reigns, which make about Twelve
Millions, with the Money that was Coin'd in
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and a Million that
was Coin'd in the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the
First, before the Foreign Princes Rais'd the
value of their Coins, be put together, they
will make near eighteen Millions: So that
were it not for these accidental Causes, there
had not been Coin'd in the Mint of <hi>England</hi>
Two Millions of Silver Money since the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes Rais'd the Value of their Coins.
And had it not been for the wearing of some
of the old Money lighter by often telling it
over; and Clipping of the rest, by which
they were made unprofitable to melt down,
by this time, in all probability, there had
scarce been a Silver piece of Money to be
seen in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Raising the Coin in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
parts, and the not Raising the Silver
Coin in <hi>England,</hi> was the cause of melting
it down, and Transporting it, will plainly
appear from the plenty of the Gold here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the Silver. For, since the Forty
third of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being the last time
that the Silver Money was rais'd here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Gold has been twice greatly rais'd;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50853:48"/>
by which means, there is here double, if not
treble the quantity of Gold for Silver;
whereas in all other Kingdoms and States in
<hi>Europe,</hi> there is ten times more Silver Money
than Gold.</p>
               <p>For in the Forty third Year of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> (according to Mr. <hi>Lownds</hi>'s account
from the Records of the Mint, which all men
agree is very exact) a pound weight <hi>Troy</hi>
of Gold of the Standard of Twenty two
Carats fine, and Two Carats Allay, was
Coin'd into Thirty three Soveraigns and an
half, at Twenty shillings a piece, making
Thirty three pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> I. the Gold
was rais'd, and the same pound weight and
standard of Gold was coin'd into as many
Units, Double-Corowns, and other pieces
of Gold, as made up Forty pound eighteen
shillings and four pence.</p>
               <p>And in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time,
the Gold was again rais'd, and the same stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
and weight was coin'd into Forty four
Guineas and an half, at Twenty shillings a
piece. So that from Thirty three pound ten
shillings in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, to Forty
four pound ten shillings in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s
Reign, the Gold was rais'd near Three and
thirty <hi>per cent.</hi> since the Silver <hi>money</hi> has been
rais'd; which is the reason of the great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Gold, and scarcity of Silver. What
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50853:48"/>
was the reason that these two Princes rais'd
their Gold, and not their Silver, is not to be
imagin'd; unless it was from some powerful
Argument offer'd by the <hi>Guiney</hi> Company,
whose Interest it is to have Gold rais'd;
which does not appear.</p>
               <p>And that this raising the Gold is the cause
that it is more plentiful here in <hi>England</hi> than
Silver, will appear yet more plain, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the Mint be examin'd since King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Restauration: For since
that time there has been coin'd in the Mint
of <hi>England 7263836 l. 1 s. 5 d.</hi> and in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but <hi>4319585 l. 9 s. 5 d.</hi> which does
not want much of double the quantity of
Gold <hi>Money</hi> that has been coin'd more than
Silver.</p>
               <p>And when the Guineas had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Rise here in <hi>England,</hi> as to be currant
at Eight and twenty and Thirty shillings a
piece, there was above Seven hundred and
twenty thousand pounds in Gold coin'd in
little more than Nine months time; which
was more than was coin'd in six or eight
Years before; which shews plainly, that the
raising the Value of the Gold <hi>money</hi> here in
<hi>England,</hi> is the cause that so much is imported
and coin'd here. And on the contrary, the
not raising of the Silver <hi>money</hi> in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Foreign Mints have done, is the
cause of its being cons<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ntly melted down,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50853:49"/>
and carried away, notwithstanding the many
Laws to prohibit it.</p>
               <p>For there are severe Laws in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and States, that prohibit the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting,
clipping, melting, and exporting
the <hi>money.</hi> In all Countries 'tis death to
counterfeit and clip the <hi>money.</hi> In <hi>France,
England,</hi>
and several other Countries, it is a
high Crime to melt it down, and forfeiture
of the <hi>money</hi> to export it; and in <hi>Spain,</hi> 'tis
death to transport it. And yet, when ever
it has been profitable, it has been always
melted down, and carried away. So that
by experience <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have found,
that there is no other way to preserve it in
the Country, but by raising the Value of
their <hi>money</hi> so much above the price of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
that the Merchant may get more by
carrying away the <hi>Bullion,</hi> than the <hi>Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cause of raising the <hi>Money</hi> here in
<hi>Europe</hi> will always continue, as long as the
<hi>Europeans</hi> continue in Traffick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
for Trade makes a People rich, and
Gold and Silver are Badges of Riches; and
therefore as the People grow rich, the price
of Gold and Silver will rise, because the
occasions for Gold and Silver will still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</p>
               <p>Especially as long as the Trade continues
to the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country in the <hi>East-Indies:</hi> For
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50853:49"/>
the Princes and great People there believe;
that the possession of Gold and Silver is not
only an Honour to them while they are
alive, but that they shall have a Respect in
the next World, according to the quantity
of Gold and Silver they die possess'd of:
And therefore what-ever Gold and Silver
they get more than is absolutely necessary for
Commerce and Traffick, they from time to
time melt into a Mass, or Tank, which is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with them; so that great part of
what's dug out of the West, is buried in the
East.</p>
               <p>And altho' there have been great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Gold and Silver brought into <hi>Europe</hi>
since the Discovery of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> yet
the price of them has always risen; and will
always continue so, as long as the People
grow rich by Trade; which will make the
occasions for them greater than the quantity,
which is the Rule by which all things are
made dear.</p>
               <p>This continual Rise of Gold and Silver
will be no prejudice to the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi>
if they do but observe to raise and keep up
their <hi>money</hi> above the price of Silver and
Gold; for there will be the same quantity
of Silver and Gold in the Country, tho' the
<hi>money</hi> be lighter. And the difference will be
only, that there will be more in every man's
House, and less in his Pocket. And the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50853:50"/>
will have the same Value, tho' the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
be less, because it has its Value
from the Authority of the Government:
Just as if the Ingraver should cut the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Great Seal less, it would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Authority of the Seal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This may be sufficient to prove,</hi> That the
Ordinary Cause of Raising the Value of the
Money, is from the Rise of Bullion; which will
always continue in <hi>Europe,</hi> as long as the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
grow rich by Trade.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Extraordinary Cause</hi> of raising the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of money,</hi> has been the Extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for it. When <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have
been engag'd in great Wars, and wanting
<hi>money,</hi> they have sometimes rais'd the Value
of it to increase it, and make it last longer;
In such Cases they have not observ'd the
usual Bounds and Limits of raising the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of money</hi> Ten or Fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> above
the Market price of <hi>Bullion;</hi> but have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exceeded it to Thirty, Forty, Fifty <hi>per
cent.</hi> and more. But then, in all such Cases,
as soon as those extraordinary occasions were
over, they have call'd in such <hi>money</hi> as has
been so greatly rais'd, and reduc'd the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of it to its usual Bounds.</p>
               <p>In the first Punick War, the <hi>Romans</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>money,</hi> rais'd the Value of the <hi>As,</hi> which
was their Brass Coin, to six times more in
V<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lue than it was coin'd at; it weighing at
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50853:50"/>
first twelve Ounces, and afterwards but
two. And again wanting <hi>money, Hannibal</hi>
pressing hard upon the City, they increased
their <hi>money,</hi> by coining the <hi>As</hi> to an Ounce.
And the third time, <hi>Papirius</hi> raised the <hi>money</hi>
to double its Value, by coining it at half an
Ounce. They also rais'd their <hi>Denarius,</hi> which
was their <hi>Silver money,</hi> in proportion. By
which they carried on the War against the
<hi>Carthagenians,</hi> and suppli'd themselves under
great Necessities, and want of <hi>money. Livius

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>usus</hi> also greatly rais'd the <hi>Value of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
money,</hi> by putting in a great <hi>Allay:</hi> But
these excessive Rises were afterwards regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and reduc'd by <hi>Marius Gratidianus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Wars betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,
Harry</hi> the Fifth having conquer'd great part
of <hi>France, Charles</hi> the Seventh rais'd the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the <hi>French money</hi> in six Years time,
from Eight Livres, Nine Sols, the Mark, by
degrees to Three hundred and sixty Livres,
the Mark: which was rais'd, in that time,
above Forty times the Value. And as those
that write of the Mints of <hi>France</hi> observe,
'twas the chief means by which he expell'd
the <hi>English</hi> out of <hi>France.</hi> But as soon as
ever the War was over, he reduc'd the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
to Seven Livres Ten Sols; which was
within the usual Limits of raising the <hi>money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time <hi>Harry</hi> the Fifth raised
the <hi>money</hi> of <hi>England</hi> from Twenty five shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50853:51"/>
in a Pound weight, to Thirty. And
<hi>Harry</hi> the Sixth, his Son, the next Year rais'd
it to Thirty seven and six-pence: so that it
was rais'd a third part more in Value in two
Years time, than it had been ever since the
Twenty seventh of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. And
in the Fourth Year of <hi>Harry</hi> the Sixth, after
<hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh had reduc'd his <hi>money,</hi> he
lower'd the <hi>English money</hi> again to 30 <hi>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth alter'd the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of <hi>England,</hi> and extraordinarily rais'd
the <hi>Value of the money</hi> by putting in a great
<hi>Allay;</hi> which alteration at first was by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in but two Ounces <hi>Allay,</hi> to ten Ounces
of fine Silver; afterwards six Ounces, and
at last eight Ounces <hi>Allay,</hi> to four Ounces of
fine Silver. By which, in three Years time,
he rais'd the <hi>Value of the money</hi> above three
times higher than it was before; but it was
when he had spent his <hi>money</hi> in the War of
<hi>Bullen.</hi> And the Nation was never at peace
and quiet in their Commerce and Traffick,
till the <hi>Value of the money</hi> was reduc'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its Bounds; which was begun by <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth, and finish'd by Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Extraordinary Causes</hi> of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Value of money,</hi> to supply Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Necessities; which have no sooner been
over, but the <hi>Value of the money</hi> has been
reduc'd within its usual Limits: For if the
Rise had been continued, the Mischiefs would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50853:51"/>
have been greater than the Advantages they
receiv'd, by raising it so high. And there
can be no Rule or Measure taken of the <hi>Value</hi>
that the <hi>money</hi> may be rais'd to from such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents,
but only from the ill effects in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Effects</hi> of Raising the <hi>Value</hi> of the
Money, are:</p>
               <p>That it <hi>increases the species of the Money,</hi> and
<hi>preserves it in the Countrey where 'tis Coin'd.</hi> If
the <hi>English</hi> Crown were Rais'd to Six shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
or Coin'd in such a proportion lighter,
there will be a Sixth part more Money in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
than if it be Coin'd to the old Standard.
And, if the Money be Rais'd above the price
of Bullion, it will not be the Interest of
Goldsmiths and Merchants to melt it down.
From both which Effects a Nation receives
great Advantage.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> is of a contrary opinion, and
thinks that the Raising of the Money will
produce Two great Mischiefs, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the</hi> Raising the Value of the Money
will Raise the Value of all Commodities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the</hi> Landlords and Creditors will lose
just so much in their Rents, Bonds, Debts,
and Contracts, as the Money is Rais'd.</p>
               <p>These are the Two great Objections that
are commonly us'd in all Debates about
Raising the Value of the Money; and are
grounded upon this supposition, <hi>That the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50853:52"/>
of the Money is solely from the quantity of
Silver in each piece; and that 'tis the quantity of
Silver that in Buying and Selling, Men give, take,
and contract for:</hi> So that if there be less Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the Money, men will have less Goods
for it; and just so much as the Money is
Rais'd in Value, the Goods will Rise: And
the same Consequence will be if the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
did let their Land according to the
<hi>quantity of Silver in the Money;</hi> they will lose
just so much Rent if the Money be Rais'd,
as it has less Silver in it: And so will the
Creditors in their Bonds, Debts, and Contracts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if it appear by what has been said on
this Subject, and that Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>is mistaken
in his supposition,</hi> That the Money has its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
from the Authority of that Government where
it is Coin'd, by which it is made Current and
Lawful Money: <hi>And</hi> that 'tis the Current and
Lawful Money of <hi>England</hi> that men contract and
sell their Goods for, and in their Bonds and
Leases Covenant to pay, Then there will be no such
ill effects from Raising of the Old Money, and
Coining the New Lighter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if it be true,</hi> That the Plenty or Scarcity
of all Commodities, in respect to their occasion,
makes them Cheaper or Dearer; <hi>And</hi> that the
Plenty of one Commodity do's not make another
Commodity dearer or cheaper that is not for the
same use; <hi>then the Plenty of Gold and Silver,
or a greater or lesser quantity of it in the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50853:52"/>
money, will no more alter the price of
Goods, than the Plenty of Lead or Iron
can alter the price of Butter or Cheese,
which are not to supply the same Occasions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> in Page 52 seems to be of this
opinion, and answers himself, tho' he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
quite otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He says,</hi> Corn it is evident do's not rise or
fall by the difference of more or less plenty of
Money; but, by the plenty and scarcity that God
gives. For our Money in appearance remaining
the same, the price of Corn is double one year, to
what it was the precedent: <hi>But from thence
infers,</hi> we must certainly make account, that if the
Money be made a fifth Lighter, it will buy one
fifth less Corn <hi>Communibus Annis. I must
confess I cannot understand this consequence,
when in the beginning he says,</hi> Corn do's not
rise and fall from the difference of the Money.</p>
               <p>For, if the Lightness or Heaviness of the
Money had any influence over the price of
Commodities, then all sorts of Commodities
ought to be cheap when the Money is Heavy,
and dear when the Money is Light: And the
price of things could never alter, but when
the Money alters; for the cause being the
same, the Effects ought to be the same.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is plain some Goods never
alter their price: As the Beer and Ale that's
sold: The Brewer runs the Risque of the
dearness of the Coals, Hops, and Mault.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50853:53"/>
When those Goods are dear, he gains less
by Brewing; but always sells his Beer and
Ale at one price, let the Money be what it
will: Other Goods, such as all sorts of Grain,
Coals, and other Commodities alter their
price almost every Month: And the Coals are
sometimes but half the value to what they
were the Month before. So that if these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Alterations in prices arose from the value
of the Money, it will follow that both the good
and bad Money makes things dear as well as
cheap; and the same cause at the same time to
have two contrary effects, which cannot be.</p>
               <p>But to conclude with answering this
Objection, If the Arguments that have been
already us'd to shew that Money has not its
Value from the quantity of Silver in each
piece, do not satisfy; I would advise such
Gentlemen always to receive their Money by
Weight, and try if they can introduce such
a custom: For, they can never have their
Money equal by Tale: For, if any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
and Hundred pounds, and divides it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Five twenties, there will be the difference
(unless it be all new Money) of five or ten
shillings in the Weight of some of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pounds, tho' by the Tale they are even.</p>
               <p>As to the Objection that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> makes
from a simile when he says, <hi>That Money is the
Measure of Commerce and Traffick; so that if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
be made lighter, 'twould be the same thing as if
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50853:53"/>
the Government should cut their Yard shorter.</hi> The
Cloth that is measur'd by such a Yard would
be so much less; and so will the quantity of
the Goods be that are bought with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
that's made lighter. It is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same supposition, and would be true,
if Money were the measure of Commerce by
the quantity of Silver in each piece. But if
it be the Measure of Commerce from the
Authority of the Government; if the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
be the same, the Measure will no more
be alter'd by making the Money lighter, than
if the Yard were split in two, so that the
length be not alter'd, it will then make two
Yards, and measure as much Cloth as if it
had not been split, tho' there be but half the
quantity of Wood in each Yard.</p>
               <p>As to the other Objection of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
and Creditors, <hi>That if the Money should
be made lighter, they'l lose so much in their Rents,
Debts, and Contracts.</hi> The Answer is; That
the Money having its Value from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Government, is always of
the same Goodness and Value. And that
the Money, if it were made Lighter, would
be as good to all purposes, as Money, as
it was in the Reign of <hi>Harry</hi> the Sixth,
when it had double the weight of Silver
in it, which would be no advantage but
to those that melt it: And therefore they
cannot lose in t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eir Rents, Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50853:54"/>
the Money be always of the same Value.</p>
               <p>And if they are not satisfied with the
Arguments that have been us'd to prove
that Money has its Value from the Authority
of the Government; That such persons may
not be losers in their imagination, if the
Parliament should think fit to alter the
Standard, and raise the Crown to Six
shillings, they shall have my Vote for
a Proviso in the Act, That all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that have let their Land, or lent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon Mortgage, Bonds, or Contracts,
within these last one or two and twenty
years, (which is as long as Leases are
Let, and longer then Mortgages or Bonds
generally continue) shall have the same
weight of Money paid them out of the
Exchequer, as the Money Weigh'd when
they Let such Land, or Lent it upon Bonds,
Mortgages, or Contracts. And because
such Gentlemen, perhaps, may not keep
an account of what their money weigh'd
then, let the accompt be taken from the
Teller's Book in the Exchequer, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their custom to weigh every Hundred
pounds after 'twas told, and enter the
weight in their Books, and put a Ticket
of the weight to the Bag, to save 'em
the trouble of telling the money twice.
By this Proposal such Gentlemen will have
no reason to complain; for, according to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50853:54"/>
their own opinion, if they have the same
weight of Silver they can't be losers. And
yet, I believe the Government would be
a gainer by the Proposition, though the
money were Coin'd a Sixth part ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than according to the present Standard.</p>
               <p>For if those Books were examin'd, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it will be found, that an Hundred
Pound has not weigh'd, one Bag with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Seven and twenty Pound, for these last
One or two and twenty Years; whereas it
ought to weigh. according to the Standard,
Thirty two Pound three Ounces. By such a
Proviso these Gentlemen being sav'd, they
may thereupon consent to the raising of
the <hi>money,</hi> to prevent those great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
which, in my opinion, will certainly
follow, if the <hi>money</hi> be not rais'd.</p>
               <p>There is another Objection which some
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> use against Raising the Value of
the Money, <hi>That it will be a Discredit to the
Nation, to make their Money lighter.</hi> And in
their Arguments contend much for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Standard of <hi>England,</hi> and think
it is their Duty to defend it: And that His
Majesty's Money ought to be of as great
Weight and Value as His Predecessors; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the opinion, <hi>That the Money has its
sole Value from the quantity of Silver in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Argument, in my opinion, they seem
to be but young Courtiers, and make an ill sort
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50853:55"/>
of Compliment to His Majesty, by giving a
greater Value and Respect to the Metal, than
to the <hi>Effigies</hi> of the King, when they
won't allow that the Stamp and <hi>Effigies</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Coin,</hi> gives a Value to the <hi>money,</hi> and
that the King's Authority makes it currant;
when all the <hi>Coins</hi> of his Predecessors were no
otherwise made the current <hi>money of England,</hi>
but by their Proclamation.</p>
               <p>These are the chief Objections against
<hi>Raising the Value of the Money,</hi> which, I hope,
I have fully answer'd, and shewn, <hi>That they
are only imaginary Mischiefs.</hi> But if the <hi>Money</hi>
be not Rais'd, the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> will be real,
and Consequences very fatal to the Nation.</p>
               <p>For, if the <hi>money</hi> be new-coin'd according
to the old Standard, it will be certainly
melted down, and carried away as fast as
'tis Coin'd, notwithstanding all the Laws
that can be made to prevent it, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be left without <hi>money:</hi> The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
whereof will be; That Trade will be
at a stand; The prices of all Commodities
will fall; And a general Poverty and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
over the whole Nation ensue.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Money</hi> is the measure of Commerce;
And for a Nation to be without <hi>money,</hi> is the
same thing as if it were without measures,
and had neither Yards, Scales, nor Bushels in
the Country; without some of which, no
Bargain can be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50853:55"/>In those Countries where the Inhabitants
do not live upon Trade, but a Country-life,
every man having always Provisions suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But he proposes to have his Return made of
his <hi>Bill,</hi> by the Goods and Effects of the Country from
whence the <hi>Bill</hi> was sent, and that will be much
more for the advantage of the Nation; for the
Stock of the Nation is perpetual. There is a new
Crop of Corn and Wooll every Year, and the Mines
are never to be exhausted. And the paying of the
<hi>Foreign Bills</hi> with the Native Stock of the Country,
which is the usual way that all <hi>Foreign Bills</hi> are paid,
can never prejudice a Nation.</p>
               <p>Besides, If it were not in a time of War, the <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
money</hi> ought to be Rais'd, because the Foreign
Princes have Rais'd their <hi>money</hi> twice, since the <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
money</hi> has been Rais'd in <hi>England.</hi> And 'tis the
constant usage of all the Foreign Princes and States
in <hi>Europe,</hi> to set a pretty equal Valuation upon their
<hi>money</hi> above the price of <hi>Bullion,</hi> and to Raise their
<hi>money</hi> much about the same time; or else the <hi>money</hi>
of the Country where 'tis not Rais'd, would be
melted down by the Merchants, and carried to the
Mints of those Countries where it is Rais'd, and the
<hi>Bullion</hi> yields a greater profit; and so, in a short time,
there would be no <hi>money</hi> left in that Country. The
truth of which has been sufficiently shewn from the
great quantity of <hi>Silver money,</hi> being above Fifteen
Millions, that has been melted down since the <hi>Silver
money</hi> was Rais'd in <hi>England;</hi> and there will be the
same Consequence, if the <hi>money</hi> be now coin'd to
the old Standard, because the <hi>money</hi> is of more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
when 'tis melted into <hi>Bullion,</hi> than in <hi>Coin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that the way to keep the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Money</hi> in the Nation, is to sink the price of the
Gold; And would have Guineas brought to Two
and twenty, believing that the Silver <hi>Money</hi> will be
bought up by the Gold, and exported. By this way of
arguing, they must agree that Silver is of a greater
Value in another Country; or else, there would be
no advantage got by exporting it. And if the Gold
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50853:57"/>
be set at Two and Twenty, or Five and twenty, it
won't preserve the Silver; because every Merchant
and Trader may take the Silver <hi>Money</hi> by the Sale of
his Goods, and need not buy it with the Gold. And
if Guineas be sunk to Two and twenty, it will be a
severe Loss to those People that have taken them at
higher Rates; And a damage to the Nation, by less<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the quantity of the Coin; and by low'ring
the price of them, may cause them to be exported:
So that there will be neither Gold nor Silver left in
the Nation.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Discourse: If nothing in it self
has a certain Price or <hi>Value;</hi> If Gold and Silver are
Commodities of uncertain <hi>Values.</hi> If Money has
its <hi>Value</hi> from the Authority of the Government,
which makes it currant, and fixes the price of each
piece of Metal; Then the <hi>Money</hi> will be of as good
<hi>Value,</hi> to all intents and purposes. when it is coin'd
lighter. For, the Authority being the same, the <hi>Value</hi>
will be the same. It will buy as much Goods: The
Landlord will have as much Rent; And the Nation
will save a <hi>Million of Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> at a time when they have
so great occasion for it. Besides the preventing those
fatal Consequences that follow the Coining the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
