            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>2 The preciouſneſſe and worth of the matter

and often and earneſtly meditated and

            <p>This Part, or Portion, which wee have now in

many worthy and gracious Leſſons for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

unto us out of the practice and Chriſtian car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of this holy Prophet, and <hi>Man of God, David,</hi>
a perfect patterne of all true zeale and pietie.</p>
            <p>In the thirteenth Portion,<note place="margin">Two things obſervable in the 13. Part.</note> immediately going
before, <hi>David</hi> had delivered ſpecially two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How by his love, reading, ſtudy, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
in Gods Word,<note place="margin">1 How <hi>David</hi> became wiſer than his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> he had attained moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
knowledge, wiſedome, and underſtanding;
ſo that thereby he was become <hi>farre more wiſe than
his enemies;</hi> that is, than <hi>Saul</hi> and all his politike
Courtiers and Counſellors of State. Hee had
<hi>more underſtanding than his Teachers,</hi> than the great
Doctors, and Rabbins; for all their deepe Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
being not ſanctified unto them. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
more than the grave and ancient men, for all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7160:4"/>
the worldly wiſedome and great experience they
had gathered in many yeeres, and through length
of dayes. Where, by the way, take this Leſſon.</p>
            <p>There is no wit or policie,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> not all the Learning
in the World,<note place="margin">True wiſdome to be had only from and in the Word.</note> or worldly wiſedome, can make a

happineſſe in this life, for a few and evill dayes,
and leaves the Soule in a ſinfull and wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate;
ſhortly, in the day of Viſitation, to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
and fearefully confounded with ſtrange a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhments,

wofully to be tormented amongſt wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in the Lake that burnes with fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
for evermore. But wiſedome out of the
Word of God doth ſo furniſh a mans Soule with
Grace, and all holy Vertues, that in deſpight of
all creatures, hee may live comfortably in this
Vale of teares, and in endleſſe joyes in the World
to come.</p>
            <p>Now (I pray you) tell me, whether is truly the
wiſer man; hee, that for an inch of time makes
much of his wretched Body, that muſt ſhortly
rot in the grave, and be devoured of Wormes, and
turned into duſt; but in the meane time lets his
immortall Soule, that can never die, ſinke into the
Dungeon of everlaſting woe and miſerie: or hee,
which by taking ſound and ſaving counſell and
direction out of the Word of God, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7160:4"/>
he be hated and neglected of this vaine
World, yet yeelding chearefull and conſtant obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
thereunto, provides unſpeakable comfort,
reſt, and bleſſedneſſe both for Body and Soule,
through all eternitie?</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the ſecond part and foure laſt
Verſes of the former Portion,<note place="margin">2 He ſets downe the fruits of his knowledge</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> ſets downe

would give you this other Leſſon.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7160:5"/>
and the precious fruit and benefit he had reaped

that he is wholly and onely enlightened and led

and bleſſed eſtate of Chriſtianitie, but
doth alſo conduct and guide him in all the paths

<hi>and a Light unto my paths</hi>] that is, a guide to direct

up himſelfe to be guided and governed by
the glorious Light of Gods holy Word, appeares
in the Verſes following.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1 Verſ. 106.</note> in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 106. by a ſolemne Oath and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7160:5"/>
For, except he had loved and followed
the Light of divine Truth, whenſoever the fire of

and teach me thy judgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 109, 110. by his ſtedfaſtneſſe
and ſticking to the Law and Word of God,<note place="margin">4 Verſ. 109, 110.</note>
though hee was beſet and ſtrongly incompaſſed
with ſnares, with dangers, and with death it ſelfe:
<hi>His ſoule was continually in his hand;</hi> that is, hee was
ready and reſolved every houre rather to part with
his life, than with a good Conſcience; to ſhed his
bloud, rather than to forſake the Truth and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements

a ſnare for me, yet I erred not from thy Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the two laſt Verſes, upon the former reaſons
hee concludes the Point;<note place="margin">5 Verſ. 111, 112.</note> That his heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

A ſecond ariſeth out of the ſecond Verſe:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Verſ.</hi> 106.</note>
Every Child of God doth not onely promiſe,
vow,<note place="margin">He performes all his Vowes.</note> and purpoſe to forſake and abandon all his

over all his wayes, to delight in and to ſort
himſelfe with godly and gracious companie, to
have a reſpect to all his Commandements, and to
keepe his righteous Iudgements; but hee doth
alſo truly and throughly performe it: hee goes
through-ſtitch with his ſpirituall affaires, and
with conſtancie and courage walkes in a ſetled
courſe of Chriſtianitie.<note place="margin">An unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man doth not pay them.</note> But the unregenerate

in the time of Sickneſſe, of ſome great

by the Miniſterie of the Word, when he ſeriouſly
thinkes upon the day of his death, and of that
great and laſt Iudgement, or the like; hee makes
Vowes with himſelfe, perhaps, that hee will be a
new man, and change his courſes: But when he is
once out of danger againe, when he comes to the
point, and practice, he is not ſo good as his word,
he doth not pay and performe his former Vowes
and purpoſes; hee is preſently choaked againe
with worldly Cares, and drowned in earthly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:

            <p>A fourth marke may be gathered out of the

in the mouth of Gods Child,<note place="margin">He is frequent in praying and prayſing. The other not.</note> are frequent, free,

Gods Child is very ſenſible of his corruptions,<note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note>
and wants, hee ſtill longs and gaſpes for more
grace, with a ſpirituall taſte he ſweetly reliſheth
Gods great mercie and goodneſſe unto him; he
hath the love of God and the ſpirit of prayer
ſhed into his heart by the Spirit of Adoption;
and therefore his heart is as full as the Moone, of
godly motions and meditations, which like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
Spring ſends out groanes and ſighes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable,
many zealous and faithfull prayers and
thankſgivings unto his gracious God with a free
and feeling affection. But the carnall Goſpeller,
becauſe his underſtanding was never enlightened,
his heart never truly humbled, his affections never
ſanctified; becauſe he hath no ſence of his wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
eſtate, nor preſent feeling of grace, nor ſound
hope and aſſurance of happineſſe in Heaven; why,
therefore he hath no great mind, or heart, or liſt to
prayer; hee hath no great delight, or exerciſe, in
this holy buſineſſe: and if he doe pray (which is
but ſeldome, and coldly) it is but lip-labour, and
loſt labour, becauſe it is without faith, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
for faſhion, cuſtome, or company, becauſe
he was ſo taught in his youth; or that he ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly
thinkes, the very worke wrought, and a
number of prayers ſolemnely ſaid over, will ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
him.</p>
            <p>A fifth marke may be gathered out of the ſixt
and ſeventh Verſes:<note place="margin">5 Verſ. 109, 110.</note> The Child of God doth not
onely paſſe through with patience,<note place="margin">He will loſe his life for God.</note> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Gods truth and ſinceritie, leſſe and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7160:8"/>
miſeries; as loſſe of goods, loſſe of friends
and reputation with the World, ſlanders, diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and wrongs: but hee alſo <hi>holds his ſoule</hi> (as it
were) <hi>continually in his hand,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> here ſayes
of himſelfe; readie (if need be, and the times
ſo require) even to ſhed his bloud vnder the Sword
of Perſecution, or to lay downe his life in the
flames, rather than to diſhonour ſo mercifull a
God, to betray his holy Truth; or, by his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding
and falling away, to hazard that Crowne
of Glory, which by the eye of faith he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in ſight.<note place="margin">A temporarie is offended.</note> But the carnall Goſpeller, in time
of peace and plentie, while he lives quietly, and at
eaſe, without croſſe or trouble, in faire and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine

            <p>The ſixt marke is gathered out of the two laſt

               <hi>thouſands of Gold and Silver:</hi> It is the joy of his

and fulfill all his Commandements. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
though the true Chriſtian find moſt ſound
and unconceivable delight in the Word of God,<note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note>
the Doctrine of Heaven: For by it, he is borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
and made heire of Heaven: by the Light of
it, he ſees his Name written in the Booke of Life,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7160:8"/>
never to be raced out by man,<note place="margin">A Chriſtian man hath ſuch aſſurance in the good things of the world to come, that he can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily moderate his affections as touching earthly and tranſitorie things. It is otherwiſe with an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</note> or Devill; all the
ſweet and gracious promiſes of ſalvation and
comfort revealed in it, are ſure his owne: So that
thence he knowes, and is perſwaded undoubtedly,
that after a few and evill dayes ſpent in this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
life, he ſhall remaine and reigne eternally in
the glory of God, of Chriſt Ieſus, the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the holy Angels. But it is otherwiſe with
the carnall Goſpeller; for whatſoever ſhew or
proteſtation he makes to the contrary, yet indeed
in his heart, affections, and practice, hee preferres
his pleaſures, riches, and profit, before hearing of
Gods Word, ſanctifying his Sabbaths, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Commandements.<note place="margin">And why?</note> And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell:
for becauſe hee yet never lived the life of
faith, but is a meere ſtranger to the myſterie of
godlineſſe, hee hath no true intereſt nor ſound aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
in the joyes of another World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
feeds onely and fills himſelfe with tranſitorie
and earthly contentments.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you (beloved in Chriſt Ieſus)
let every one with ſingleneſſe of heart and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
examine his owne Soule, and the ſpirituall
ſtate of his Conſcience, by theſe ſignes and marks
which I have now delivered to you, out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

            <p>6 That you have more comfort and delight in

               <hi>David,</hi>
the man of God, had the Word of God working
powerfully upon his ſoule, as a Light: that is;
As a Lampe is to the life and ſafetie of the body,
in darke and dangerous places; ſo was this Light
to the life and ſalvation of <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule, in the
darkeneſſe of this World, and ſhadow of death:
<hi>To guide his feet and paths;</hi> that is, his mind, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
thoughts, actions, his whole life, all his wayes,
and every particular ſtep and paſſage thereof.</p>
            <p>This Verſe being thus underſtood, let us now
come to gather ſome Leſſons and Doctrines for
our inſtruction.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſhall be this:</p>
            <p>There is no man can hit the way to Heaven,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> or
walke in the paths of Righteouſneſſe, through
the Kingdome of Grace in this World, unto the
Kingdome of Glory in the World to come, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he be inlightened, informed, and inſtructed
in the holy Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:7160:11"/>
The ſecond Note wee gather out of this Verſe,
ſhall be this:</p>
            <p>The Word of God is a Light,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> not onely to
guide us into the way to Heaven, and inſtruct us
in our generall calling of Chriſtianitie; but alſo
to leade us along in a courſe of godlineſſe, and to
direct us particularly in our ſpeciall calling.</p>
            <p>I will firſt follow the former Doctrine; which
in few words, and plainely, I thus propoſe unto
you.</p>
            <p>No man can at firſt finde the entrance,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> or after
hit the way to Heaven, except he be enlightened
and led along by the holy Word of God. For
<hi>David,</hi> as here wee ſee, a man of great worth, and
underſtanding, otherwiſe excellently and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
qualified; could not find out, or follow
any other Guide, or direction to Heaven, but onely
the Light of Gods Word.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of this Doctrine, may be theſe
which follow.</p>
            <p>The firſt may be taken from the inſufficiencie
and inabilitie of all other meanes,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> to bring us to
Heaven:<note place="margin">No other meanes can bring us to Heaven.</note> as,</p>
            <p>1 All the greateſt Learning and deepeſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the World,<note place="margin">Not humane Learning.</note> will ſtand us in little ſtead in
this buſineſſe: Otherwiſe it had gone well with
many ancient Heathens and Philoſophers of old,
who fadomed as deepe, and reached as high in
the depths and myſteries of all humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and knowledge, as the light of Reaſon and
ſtrength of Nature could poſſibly bring them:
And yet they were utterly ſtrangers to the life of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7160:12"/>
grace,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> and <hi>without God in the World. When they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsed
themſelves to be wiſe, they became fooles,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. They were puffed up with a
little vaine-glorious knowledge here upon Earth,
and got them a Name amongſt men: But, alas,
what was this? When as for the want of the
Light of Divine Truth, they loſt their Soules in
another World, and their Names never came in
the Booke of Life. <hi>Where is the wiſe?</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Paul</hi> in another place) <hi>Where is the Scribe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Where
is the Diſputer of this World?</hi> As if hee ſhould
have ſaid: All the knowledge of the greateſt
Doctors and learnedeſt Rabbins in the World,
without Grace, vaniſheth into nothing, into
vaine-glory, emptineſſe, and aire; nay, caſts
them with greater horror, and confuſion, into
the Pit of Hell. <hi>Every man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ieremie) is
a Beast by his owne knowledge,</hi>

he be enlightened from above, and have

can come no neerer the happineſſe of Heaven,
than a very Beaſt.</p>
            <p>2 Worldly wiſedome and policie is ſo farre
from making men wiſe unto ſalvation,<note place="margin">Not worldly wiſedome. The wiſedome of Gods Book, &amp; mans brain, ſtand at oddes, with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7.</note> that it is
not onely ſtarke fooliſhneſſe with God and good
men, but it doth ſtrongly ſet it ſelfe and is at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
againſt God. Therefore, ſaith God; <hi>I will
destroy the wiſedome of the wiſe, and will cast away the
underſtanding of the prudent,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 19.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Ahitophel</hi>
was ſo wiſe even in the affaires of Kingdomes, and
buſineſſe of State,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 23.</note> that <hi>the counſell which he counſelled
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7160:12"/>
in thoſe dayes, was like as one had asked counſell at the
Oracle of God;</hi> and yet all this great wiſedome in
the end ended in extreme folly: for upon a little
diſcontent and diſgrace in the World,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 23.</note> 
               <hi>he ſadled his
Aſse, and went home unto his Citie, and put his houſehold
in order, and hanged himſelfe,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.
23. Although the end of all worldly wiſedome
be not ſo ſhamefull in the eye of the World, yet
undoubtedly it is moſt miſerable and wofull in
the World to come, except their wiſedome be
ſanctified and over-ruled by the Light of Gods
Word. Carnall wiſedome can neither preſerve a
man from death, nor prepare him to die bleſſedly:
it cannot ſtay his Life from going, neither can it
ſtop the Curſe from comming; it cannot deliver
him from damnation in the World to come, but
rather encreaſeth the grievouſneſſe of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for in this life it hath kept poſſeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
heavenly wiſedome, it made him uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all good inſtructions, it made him impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of any rebuke, and held him in ignorance and
diſobedience all his life.</p>
            <p>3 No good meanings or intentions,<note place="margin">Not good meanings.</note> without
knowledge and warrant in the Word of God, will
ever ſerve our turne for ſalvation; nay, indeed
they are abominable and hatefull in Gods ſight.
Howſoever, thouſands deceive themſelves in this
point.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Vzzah</hi> had a good meaning, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6.
when hee put his hand to the Arke of God, and
held it; for the Oxen did ſhake it: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
the Lord was very wroth with <hi>Vzzah,</hi> and
God ſmote him in the ſame place, and there hee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7160:13"/>
died. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had good meanings, when
they called for fire from Heaven to conſume the
Samaritan, that would not entertaine Chriſt;
but Ieſus rebuked them,<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 54, 55. 1 Sam. 15.</note> and told them, <hi>they knew
not of what ſpirit they were. Saul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. had a
good meaning, when he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and the beſt
of the Sheepe, and of the Oxen, to ſacrifice them
unto the Lord; but notwithſtanding <hi>Samuel</hi> tells
him, that <hi>he had done wickedly in the ſight of the Lord,
and that the Lord had rent the Kingdome of Iſrael from
him that day. Peter</hi> had a good meaning, when in
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 8.<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 8.</note> he would not ſuffer Chriſt to waſh his
feet; but Ieſus anſwered him, and told him, <hi>If I
waſh thee not, thou ſhalt have no part with me.</hi> Good
meanings then are wicked miſſings of the true
ſervice of God, except they be guided by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
warrant, and ground out of the Booke of
God. Let no man then tell of his good meaning,
if he be ignorant in the Will and Word of God,
for certainely it will never ſerve the turne, it will
never hold out in the Day of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>4 No will-worſhip,<note place="margin">Not will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> or will-ſervice, or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
Religion,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 23.</note> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23.
which is forged and framed out of a mans owne
braine, humour, and conceit, without ground or
warrant in the Booke of God; though it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with never ſo glorious a ſhew of zeale and
paines, yet it is not any way availeable for our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
good, and eternall happineſſe: nay indeed,
it is moſt odious in the eyes of God, and ever ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a very high degree of his wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>

               <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets,<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 28.</note> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 28. were ſo hot and

vow Continencie, perpetuall Povertie, and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Obedience, and yet is the profeſſion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

Iewes worſhipped God after the deviſed faſhions
of the Gentiles, though their meaning was to
worſhip nothing but God, yet the Text ſaith, <hi>they
worſhipped nothing but Devils,</hi>

Letter, without the ſpirituall meaning, and the
finger of Gods Spirit to apply it powerfully to
our ſoules and conſciences, is any ſufficient rule
of life, or able to bring us into the Light of Grace.
This appeares in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who was a great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
in the Law,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 10.</note> and the Prophets, a chiefe <hi>Maſter
and Teacher in Iſrael;</hi> yet was a very Infant and
Ideot in the power of Grace, and myſterie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.
For all his learning in the Letter of the
Law, he had not yet made one ſtep towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
for hee was not onely ignorant of, but had a
very abſurd and groſſe conceit of the new birth;
which is the very firſt entrance into the Kingdome
of Grace. For when Chriſt told him, hee could
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7160:14"/>
not be ſaved, except hee were new borne, hee
ſtrangely and fooliſhly replyes;<note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> 
               <hi>How can a man
be borne, which is old? How can he enter into his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Wombe againe, and be borne?</hi> Thus you ſee,
there can no other meanes be named, or thought
upon; not all humane Knowledge, nor worldly
Wiſedome, nor good Meanings, nor Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,
nor the Word it ſelfe in the Letter,
which can leade us into the wayes of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
or bring us unto Heaven; but onely
the Light of Gods holy Word, holden out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>A ſecond Reaſon of my Doctrine may be this:<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note>
No man can ever ſee the Kingdome of God,<note place="margin">The Word workes rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, no ſalvation.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he be borne againe, except he be a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a new man, as is plaine in Chriſts words
unto <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> For our new birth, or regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is the neceſſarie paſſage from Nature to
Grace;<note place="margin">What regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is?</note> from prophaneneſſe, to ſinceritie: It is
that whereby wee are wholly ſanctified and ſet
apart unto God, from the ſinfnll corruption of
our naturall birth, and the evill fruits thereof,
to ſerve God in our whole man, both body,
ſoule, and ſpirit. Now you muſt conceive, that
this new birth muſt neceſſarily ſpring from the
<hi>immortall Seed of the word of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23.</note> for ſo it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. It is the Seed of our new birth,

well looke for Come to grow up in your fields

to the inmoſt thoughts and the ſecret cogitations

able to bridle them, or bring them within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe;
no Law of Nature, or Nations, can affright
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7160:15"/>
or reſtraine the freedome and wanderings of

            </p>
            <p>1 Becauſe, whereas we naturally live under the
ſhadow of death, and in the darkeneſſe of ſinne, it
quickens us with a new and ſpirituall life,<note place="margin">It quickens.</note> it

            <p>2 The Word may be called Living, becauſe it
ſelfe is immortall,<note place="margin">It laſts for ever.</note> and laſteth forever; as doth the
living and eternall God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 89.</note> the Author of it.</p>
            <p>3 But moſt eſpecially, and agreeably to the
place in the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">It diſperſeth it ſelfe, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of the ſoule.</note> it is called <hi>lively,</hi> becauſe
it enters with great power and ſecret inſinuation
into every part and power both of ſoule and body:
So that as our life is ſcattered and diſperſed into
every little part, and leaſt veine in us, and we feele
it both in paine and pleaſure; even ſo the vertue
of the Word of God pierceth into every member,
into the moſt ſecret and hidden Cloſet of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7160:15"/>
heart, either to breake and bruiſe with terror and
aſtoniſhment the very bones, &amp; cruſh the ſinewes
of the ſinfull ſoule; or to fill them with marrow
and fatneſſe, and to refreſh the affections of the
truly penitent with joy unſpeakable, and glorious.
God tells us in <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 29.</note> that his Word is like <hi>fire;</hi>
and therefore it can eaſily inſinuate into all the
creekes and corners of our corruptions; it can
fully and clearely enlighten our Conſciences, and
diſcover unto us the ſinfulneſſe of the moſt lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and ſecret thoughts.</p>
            <p>Thus you have this firſt Doctrine plainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and confirmed unto you.</p>
            <p>No man can at firſt finde the entrance, or after

            <p>No other meanes, which the power of Nature,
Wiſedome, Learning, or the whole World can
afford, will ſerve the turne in this buſineſſe of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
It is the Seed of our new birth (as I told
you;) there can be no growing of grace, or reaping

Whoſe cruell and craftie Religion (for, bloud of

many dangerous and fearefull wayes; wherein,
at every ſtep, he wounds his Conſcience with one

never a foot of the way, take no direction by the
Light of Gods Word, nor ſet one ſtep, by new

But indeed and truth they doe very fearefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and over-ſhoot themſelves:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> And their caſe

with the Revenues, Soveraignetie, and

thinking, that skill in the Booke of God,

hope of ſalvation, without all truth or ground:
But when upon their Death-bed, their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Theſe are the bitter and poyſoned fruits of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

and that they ſhall wiſh full many times,

And yet, God knoweth, hee cannot conceive the
thouſand part of thoſe horrible torments which
the ignorant and wicked perſons endure for ever.
For as the heart of man cannot comprehend thoſe
bleſſed and glorious joyes,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

to vertue, from knowledge to knowledge,
from grace to grace,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> untill hee become <hi>a perfect
man in Christ Ieſus.</hi> It may be, as the faireſt Sunne
may ſometimes be over-caſt, and darkened with
Clouds, and Miſts; ſo the holineſſe of a godly
man may be over-clouded and diſgraced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
by falls into a ſinne, upon infirmitie, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
heedleſneſſe, or the like: But, if he be ſo
overtaken; after his paſſing through ſorrow and
griefe of heart for the ſame, and his riſing againe
by repentance; hee ſhines farre more brightly
and pleaſantly both to God and man, in ſinceritie
and all holy graces; he afterwards runnes a more
ſwift and ſetled courſe in the race of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that ordinarily all Gods children <hi>ſhine
as Lights in the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>in the midst of a naughtie and

               <hi>and the Starres

I beſeech you: whoſoever hath alreadie given
his Name unto Chriſt, taſted of the good Word
of God, and received into his ſoule ſome glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of heavenly Light; let him be ſure to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hard towards the Marke, for the Prize of the
high calling of God, in Chriſt Ieſus: Let him
ſet his beſt deſires, affections, and endeavours,
to grow and proceed in all holy knowledge, in
the Light of Gods Word, and chearefull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto the ſame. For it is a ſpeciall note
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7160:22"/>
and marke of a man that is truly religious, to goe
forward, and encreaſe in grace and underſtanding:
Hee muſt be like the Sunne, which, riſing in the
Eaſt, enlargeth his glorious light and heat, untill
he reach the height of Heaven. But, as one well
notes; the true Chriſtian muſt not be like <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi>
Sunne,<note place="margin">Iſai. 38. 8.</note> which went backward: If a man
back-ſlide, waxe worſe, and fall away from good
beginnings, he addes weight unto the wrath of
God, and doubles his damnation: Hee muſt not
be like <hi>Ioſhuahs</hi> Sunne,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 10. 12.</note> that ſtood ſtill. It is ſo
farre to Heaven, and the way ſo narrow, ſo rough,
and full of dangers and difficulties, that he which
ſtands at a ſtay, will light ſhort: The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
will be entred in,<note place="margin">Math. 25. 10.</note> and the Gate ſhut, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he come. Hee that hath ſo much grace, that
hee deſires no more, did never truly deſire any:
And he that endeavours not to be better, will by
little and little grow worſe, and at length become
ſtarke naught. He therefore muſt be like <hi>Davids</hi>
Sunne, that great and glorious Gyant of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<hi>that like a Bridegroome comes out of his Chamber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 4, 5.</note>
               <hi>and as a Champion rejoyceth to runne his Race.</hi> One
grace in Gods child, begets another; and one
holy action, performed with ſinceritie of heart,
doth inflame his affections with love and zeale,
with courage and reſolution, to undertake moe,
and to goe through-ſtitch with all the affaires of
God, and good cauſes. For he alone knowes the
invaluable worth, and ineſtimable price of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Iewels; and therefore he is raviſhed with
their beautie, and growes unſatiable in his deſires
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7160:22"/>
and longings after them. He is ſtill toyling and
labouring in the Trade of Chriſtianitie, for more
gaine of grace, encreaſe of comfort, and further
aſſurance and ſecuritie of the joyes of Heaven.
Sith hee hath alreadie taſted and fed upon cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
and ſpirituall food, he findes in that ſuch
unutterable ſweetneſſe, and pleaſant relliſh, that
hee for ever after hungers and thirſts after it. If
then you would be aſſured, that you are in the way
to happineſſe, be ſure to be led on by the Light
of the Word in all heavenly knowledge, ſpirituall

               </note> to ſtirre us up to a reverend regard
and attention, in hearing the Word of God, to a
love and liking of the heavenly knowledge therein
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7160:23"/>
contained,<note place="margin">The Word is a Love-Letter from God.</note> and to a ſound and ſincere practice
of it, in our lives and converſations, may be this:
The Word of God is, as it were, <hi>an Epistle or
Letter</hi> (as one of the Fathers calls it) <hi>written from
God Almightie</hi> unto us miſerable men,<note place="margin">Quid eſt autem Scriptura ſacra, niſi quaedam Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtola Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Dei ad creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram ſuam? Greg. Epiſt. lib. 4. Epiſt. 48.</note> publiſhed
by his owne Sonne, ſealed by his Spirit, witneſſed
by his Angels, conveyed unto us by his Church,
<hi>the Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> confirmed with the
bloud of millions of Martyrs,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> which hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
brought thouſands of ſoules to Heaven, and
fills every heart that underſtands it, and is wholly
guided by it, with Light and Life, with Grace and
Salvation.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Now let us imagine a man to have a
Letter ſent unto him but by an Earthly King, or
ſome great Prince in the World; wherein hee
ſhould have a Pardon granted him for ſome capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Crime, and high Offence, whereby hee were
lyable to a terrible kind of death; or wherein hee
ſhould be fore-warned of ſome great and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
danger hanging over his head, and readie eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
houre to fall upon him; or, wherein hee ſhould
have aſſured and confirmed unto him, under the
Kings Seale, ſome rich Donation, or great Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Now I ſay, if a man ſhould receive but a
Letter from ſome high and mightie Potentate
upon Earth, wherein any of theſe favours ſhould
be conveyed unto him; how reverently would he
receive it? how thankfully would he accept of it?
how often would he reade it? how warily would
he keepe it? how highly would he eſteeme of it?
Why, in this royall and ſacred Letter ſent from
the King and great Commander both of Heaven
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7160:23"/>
and Earth, all theſe favours, and a thouſand more
joyes and comforts, are conveyed unto every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
and practiſer thereof. In that, we are fore-warned,
leſt by our ignorance, impietie, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie,
wee fall into the Pit of Hell, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
horror: In that, we have promiſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto us the pardon and remiſſion of all our
ſinnes, whereby wee juſtly ſtand guiltie of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death, and the endleſſe torments of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
By the vertue of it, we are not onely comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with grace in this World; but ſhall undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
be crowned with peace, glory, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in the World to come. Such a Letter as this,
hath the mightie and terrible God, moſt glorious
in all Power and Majeſtie, who is even <hi>a conſuming
and devouring fire;</hi> ſent unto us miſerable men, by
nature wretched and forlorne creatures, Duſt and
Aſhes: why then, with what reverence, cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and zeale, ought wee to receive, reade, heare,
marke, learne, underſtand, and obey it?</p>
            <p>A ſecond Motive,<note place="margin">2 The matter contained in it, is excellent and precious.</note> may be the precious, golden,
and divine matter which is contained in the Booke
of God, and that true and ever-during happineſſe,
to which it onely can bring us. There is nothing
propoſed and handled in the Word of God, but
things of greateſt weight, and higheſt excellency:
As, the infinite majeſty, power, and mercy of God;
the unſpeakable love and ſtrange ſufferings of the
Sonne of God, for our ſakes; the mighty and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
working of the holy Spirit upon the
ſoules of men. There is nothing in this Treaſury,
but Orient Pearles, and rich Iewels; as, promiſes of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7160:24"/>
grace, ſpirituall comfort, confuſion of ſinne, the
triumph of godlines, refreſhing of wearied ſoules,
the beautie of Angels, the holineſſe of Saints, the
ſtate of Heaven, ſalvation of ſinners, &amp; everlaſting
life. What Swine are they, that neglecting theſe
precious Pearles, root only in the Earth, wallow in
worldly pleaſures, feede upon vanities, tranſitorie
traſh, and vaniſhing riches, which in their greateſt
need will <hi>take them to their wings, like an Eagle, and flie
into the Heavens?</hi> Beſides, the Word of God is only
able to prepare us for true happineſſe in this world,
and to poſſeſſe us of it, in the world to come. It
only begets in us a true, intire, and univerſall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<hi>without which,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>none ſhall ever ſee the face of God,</hi>
or the glory of Heaven: for it is impoſſible, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to live the life of glory &amp; bleſſednes in Heaven,
if we live not here the life of grace and ſincerity, in
all our waies.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23.</note> It is called <hi>the immortall Seed,</hi> becauſe
it regenerates and renewes us both in our Spirits,
Soules, and Bodies: <hi>in our Spirits;</hi> that is, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
memory, &amp; conſcience: <hi>in our Soules;</hi> that is,
in our will and affections: <hi>in our Bodies;</hi> that is, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
member. If the Prince of this world hath not
blinded the eyes of our minds, and that we be not
reprobats, as concerning ſalvation, it only is able to
inlighten our underſtandings, to rectifie our wills,
to ſanctifie our hearts, to mortifie our affections; to
ſet <hi>Davids Doore</hi> before our <hi>lips,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 3. Iob 31. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that are offend not with
our tongues;</hi> to ſet <hi>Iobs Doore</hi> before our <hi>eyes, that they
behold not vanity;</hi> to manacle our hands &amp; feet with
the cords and bands of Gods Law, that they do not
walke or worke wickedly: nay, and it is able to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7160:24"/>
furniſh and ſupply us with ſufficiencie of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſtrength, to continue in all theſe good things,
and in a godly courſe vnto the end. And if we be
once thus qualified, we are rightly fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the glory that is to be revealed. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
this holy Word did tranſlate us from the
darkneſſe of ſinne, into the light of grace; it can
now much more eaſily, with joy and triumph,
bring us, from the light of grace, to the light of
immortalitie, and everlaſting pleaſures at Gods
right hand.</p>
            <p>A third Motive may be this:<note place="margin">3 We muſt be judged by the Word.</note> Wee muſt be
judged by the Word of God at the laſt Day. <hi>If
any man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 47, 48.) <hi>heare my
words,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 47, 48.</note> 
               <hi>and beleeve not, I judge him not; for I came not
to judge the World, but to ſave the World: He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
judgeth him; the word that I have ſpoken, it ſhall judge
him in the last Day.</hi> Whenſoever wee ſhall come
to judgement, and appeare before Gods Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
(and wee little know how neere it is) two
Bookes ſhall be layd open unto us; the one, of
Gods Law; another, of our owne Conſcience:
The former, will tell us what wee ſhould have
done; for the Lord hath revealed it to the World,
to be the rule of our faith, and of all our actions:
The other, will tell us what wee have done; for
Conſcience is a Regiſter,<note place="margin">Conſcience; what it is.</note> Light, and Power in our
Vnderſtanding, which treaſures up all our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
actions againſt the Day of Triall; diſcovers
unto us the equitie, or iniquitie of them; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
of them, either with us, or againſt us.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7160:25"/>
Now we muſt not take any exception againſt the
firſt; that is, the Law of God: <hi>For the Law of God</hi>
(ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7.) <hi>is perfect, converting the
ſoule: The teſtimonie of the Lord is ſure, and giveth
wiſedome unto the ſimple.</hi> Wee cannot againſt the
ſecond; that is, the Booke of our Conſcience:
for it was ever in our cuſtodie and keeping; no
man could corrupt it; there is nothing writ in it,
but with our owne hands. Now, in what a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fearefull caſe will a man be at that Day, when
he ſhall ſee the Booke of God layd open before
him; in the Light whereof hee ſhould have led
all his life, and by which he is now to be judged;
and yet know himſelfe to have had no knowledge,
but to have beene a meere ſtranger in it? Though
<hi>the great things of the Law</hi> were many times pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
and preached unto him,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 12. 8.</note> yet hee counted
them but as a <hi>ſtrange thing.</hi> Every mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is naturally corrupt, defiled, and uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
and can endure and digeſt reaſonable qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
the rage of diſordered affections, many vile
corruptions, and ſinfull actions: and therefore, at
the laſt Day, when it ſhall be awakened, opened,
examined, it will bring forth nothing, but the
Worme that never dyes, ſtrange confuſion, and
condemnation; except it hath beene formerly in
this World enlightened, purged, and ſanctified
by the Word of Grace, and the Bloud of the
Lambe. Moſt accurſed then, and forlorne, will be
the ſtate of every ignorant man, when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before the Iudge of all the World: When
he lookes upon his Conſcience, he ſhall finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7160:25"/>
but guilt, and horror: when upon the Law,
and upon the Word of God, after which he ſhould
have lived, and by which he muſt now be judged;
it will be to him but as a <hi>ſealed Booke;</hi> hee will ſee
nothing but his owne ignorance, blindneſſe, and
ſtrangeneſſe in it: And therefore, all the Plagues
and Curſes denounced in it againſt ignorant, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and unrepentant ſinners, ſhall be his portion,
in the Lake that burnes with fire and Brimſtone
for evermore. This ought then to ſtirre up every
man, with all care and Conſcience, to ſtore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
while he hath time, with ſaving knowledge
and holy obedience unto that Word, which muſt
be his Iudge in the laſt Day: Nay, and let him
take heed unto his feet,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 1.</note> and looke unto his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
when hee enters into the Houſe of God:
For in that Day he muſt anſwer and be countable
for every Sermon that he hath heard, and for every
Leſſon he hath beene taught out of the Booke of
God: If they have not enlightened his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
they have hardened his heart; if they
doe not now reforme him, they will hereafter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
him; if he doe not profit by them, he ſhall
be ſure to be plagued for the neglect of them:
For Gods Word is unto every man that heares it,
either <hi>the ſavour of life unto life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> or <hi>the ſavour of death
unto death:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> It is <hi>a two-edged Sword;</hi> it either kills
the ſinne, or the ſoule, it muſt and <hi>ſhall proſper in
the worke for which it is ſent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 11.</note> God will rayſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
hee will winne honour unto himſelfe, from
every man. If hee cannot be glorified, by his
converſion, and ſalvation; hee will glorifie his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7160:26"/>
owne Name, in his deſerved overthrow, and juſt
confuſion.</p>
            <p>A fourth Motive may be;<note place="margin">4 A fearefull judgement ſhall befall the not hearers and practiſers of the Word.</note> That horrible and
fearefull puniſhment and deſtruction, which at
length will certainely befall all negligent and
contemptuous hearers, and thoſe that practiſe
not the power thereof in their lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſaith our bleſſed Saviour) <hi>ſhall
not receive you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 10. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>or heare your words; when yee depart out
of that houſe, or that Citie, ſhake off the duſt of your
feet: Truly I ſay unto you, it ſhall be eaſier for them of
the Land of Sodome and Gomorrah, in the Day of
Iudgement, than for that Citie.</hi> The infamous abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
the damnable and crying ſinnes of the
Sodomites are knowne unto all: Who hath not
heard of thoſe flouds of fire and Brimſtone,
which ſwept them away, as the hatefulleſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that ever lived upon the Earth? How rufull
then, and how lamentable will be their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who are lyable and ſubject to more horrible
plagues than theſe? Wee ſhould therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that the negligent, irreverent, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
hearing of the Word of God, is a ſinne of
a farre greater weight, and more fearefull conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
than we ordinarily imagine. When wee
heare the Miniſters, and Embaſſadours of God,
delivering his mind, and revealing his Will unto
us, out of ſuch places as theſe, we are to conceive,
that in a neerer and more ſpeciall manner, wee
ſtand in the preſence of the great God of Heaven
and Earth, who is clothed with infinite terrour,
power, and majeſtie; and thereafter, we ought to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7160:26"/>
proportion our behaviour and carriage, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
humility, and obedience to ſo great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
Earthly Princes will not endure contempt
and diſgrace at their ſubjects hands:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide to have their Majeſtie and authority
lightly ſet by, their lawes and commands to bee
neglected and troden under foot: Why then
ſhould the Lord of glory, of juſtice and power,
beare ſuch indignities at the hands of ſinfull men,
which are his moſt abject vaſſals, and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creatures? Certaine it is, if wee weight aright
the greatneſſe of that God, before whom wee
ſtand, and our owne vileneſſe, wee ſhould hold it
moſt juſt, if he ſhould preſently in the place where
we ſtand, puniſh and plague our ſleepineſſe, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
wandring thoughts, and irreverent carriage
at hearing his Word, with ſome ſudden and
markable vengeance, to be a ſpectacle &amp; example
unto others, for neglecting ſo great ſalvation. It
is Gods great mercy that ſuch plagues and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are reſpited, ſuſpended, and deferred; for
even all the curſes in the booke of God doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
deſervedly, and in the courſe of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
belong unto the negligent hearer, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
unto the Word of God. <hi>All theſe curſes</hi>

            <p>I come now in the ſecond place to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

poſſeſſeth the hearts of very many; whereby they
are perſwaded, That Lawes divine are but like hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

none, but chiefe Malefactors; ſo theſe Decrees
of God will at laſt condemne none, but infamous
and notorious ſinners. And therefore, if they be

ſweet ſinne in themſelves; if they be not of the

of Sermons, ſo Scripture-wiſe, or hold ſuch a

careleſſe, in eſteeming of hearing, and conforming

continuance, hath taken deepeſt root and ſureſt
hold in his heart: upon which, all his affections
and deſires are carried with ſharpeſt edge, heat,

occaſions and circumſtances, friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Religion and Conſcience, all the powers

of Gods Houſe, the Congregation of the Saints,

And therefore, howſoever they may ordinarily
come to Sermons, (though it be rather for faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

to turne their backes upon the Houſe of
God, and the Miniſterie of the Word, even upon

or worldly contentment, wretchedly abandoning

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7160:30"/>
By all this,<note place="margin">What is meant by it.</note> is meant the Miniſtery of the Word,

faithfull man is feaſted, made Gods ſonne, and
married to Chriſt himſelfe for ever,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 19.</note>

This Feaſt being in full readineſſe, Servants are
ſent out, to invite Gueſts: But for all the glory,
comfort, and magnificence prepared for them, in
this Wedding, and Royall Feaſt; many refuſe to

thus: Have I thus long and ſo fearefully lived

emptie vaunts would build Houſes, fill Barnes, or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7160:35"/>
ſave Soules. There is farre more required to theſe
buſineſſes, than ſo: There is to be undergone much
toile and labour, much care &amp; trouble, expence and
exerciſe, before any of theſe workes can be rightly
accompliſhed. It is even ſo in the great worke of
ſalvation, and the attainment of Heaven. The ſtate
of grace, and trade of Chriſtianitie, is not ſo eaſily
purchaſed &amp; practiſed. There goes more to ſaving
of a ſoule, than bold &amp; ignorant brags: than to ſay;
If that be all, I hope I can quickly and eaſily learne
to love God above all, &amp; my neighbor as my ſelfe:
For before theſe,<note place="margin">Things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, before a man can love God or man.</note> there goes many things; as, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods will, and Word; a thorow view of
our owne miſery &amp; corruptions, in the glaſſe of the
Law; ſtrange agonies, and ſore pangs in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth,
and ſorrow for ſinne, refreſhings and coolings
by the mercies of God, and merits of Chriſt; faith,
repentance, ſanctification, a bleſſed &amp; holy change
in the whole man, both body, ſoule, and ſpirit. And
then follows new obedience; which conſiſts in the
uprightneſſe and ſinceritie of our owne hearts; a
conſcionable and charitable carriage towards our
neighbors, and a zealous conſtancy in all religious
duties and right ſervice of God:<note place="margin">How our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God muſt be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> which muſt be
univerſall, in reſpect of the object; that is, we muſt
walk in all his Commandements: totall, in reſpect
of the ſubject; that is, we muſt ſerve him in all the
powers of our ſoule, and parts of our body; in our
thoughts, words, and actions: In all which things,
and holy courſes, if a man be not particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
experienced, &amp; practiſed, his love of God
and his neighbour is but in word and tongue, not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7160:36"/>
in deed and truth. A man, if he be diſpoſed, may
quickly perceive and diſcerne the truth or hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his heart in this point. God hath ſtraitly
commanded an entire ſanctification and keeping
holy of the Sabbath.<note place="margin">A triall of our love to God.</note> Let a man then conſider, if

Exerciſe on that day, by pleaſures, profit, paſtime,

why, then he preferres meere vanities, and the
deſires of his owne heart, before the glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God; and ſo doth not love God above all.
The true love of a mans ſelfe, doth chiefly &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
conſiſt in furniſhing himſelfe with ſaving
knowledge, ſinceritie of heart, godlineſſe of life, a
good Conſcience, and ſpirituall comfort, againſt
hee come to Iudgement. Now, if hee love his
neighbour as himſelfe,<note place="margin">A triall of our love to our neighbour.</note> he is not ſtill talking with
him of worldly matters; but eſpecially labours
with him for his converſion, entertainment of
grace, and encreaſe in godlineſſe. If theſe be not
his cares, both for himſelfe and his neighbour, he
truly loves neither. Thus may a man examine
himſelfe through all the Commandements in
particular; and ſee, whether it be ſo eaſie to love
his neighbour as himſelfe, and God above all.</p>

You may aſſure your ſelfe, where the Light
of Gods Truth begins once to peepe out, and the
power of grace to worke, for the driving away

be ſure ever there to have three fierce and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

but procures them all temporall happineſſe, and
carnall contentments, that can be; (for he knowes
full well, if they ſo continue, they are ſure his owne,
and children of endleſſe perdition:) But if once, by
the power of the Word, they be enlarged out of
the ſlaverie of ſinne and death, and lay hold upon

is to be heard, received, and followed, ſo farre as he
followes and delivers to the Church the Truth of

is an <hi>Angel of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi>

himſelfe ſhould be heard from Heaven; as if the

ſoft and ſweet to the beleeving ſoule, as if the
Angels ſhould comfort him,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 43.</note> as they did Chriſt
in his Agonie; or, as if Chriſt himſelfe ſhould
mercifully reach out his glorious hand, through
the Clouds, and binde up his broken heart and
bruiſed Conſcience with a Plaiſter of his owne
precious Bloud. If hee inſtruct, admoniſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,

            </p>
            <p>Let men therefore pretend what they will; if
they will not heare, beleeve, and obey the Lord,
ſpeaking in the Miniſterie of the Word, though
the meanes and Meſſengers be never ſo baſe and
vile, fraile, weake, and ſinfull. Let an Angel come
from Heaven, a Devill from Hell, or a man from
the dead; yet would they not beleeve. For, if a
man were truly humbled, hee would tremble at
Gods Word, of whomſoever hee heard it. If hee
had a ſpirituall taſte, hee would reliſh the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
food, whoſoever miniſtred it. If hee had
Gods holy Spirit, hee would know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his Sword, which is the Word of God, in
whoſe hand ſoever he ſaw it. And untill he have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7160:39"/>
this ſpirit, a ſpirituall taſte, and an humble heart,
hee will not beleeve; eſpecially with effect, fruit,
and practice, let him pretend whatſoever he will;
neither Angels, nor men; dead, nor living; <hi>Moſes,</hi>
nor the Prophets; <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Paul;</hi> not Chriſt, nor
God himſelfe; if the one were living againe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

poſſible, to ſpeake immediately to him.</p>
            <p>For concluſion of this Point, let us know, That
the Miniſterie of the Word is Gods Ordinance;
which dependeth not upon the worthineſſe of him
who delivereth it; neither is it made void and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall,

God forbid. In whom ſoever the true love of God
and Chriſt hath taken up the heart, there their
Goſpel, and Word, and ſervices are ſweeter and
more taſtfull than all outward delights. Little
touch of Religion, or ſenſe of Salvation hath hee,
that comes unto with unchearefulneſſe, and ſtayes

            <p>I,<note place="margin">Object. 9.</note> but (will ſome ſay) it was never good World

and therefore, it ſeemes, there is little good in it.
Since this new Religion was on foot, (for ſo ſome
ignorantly and maliciouſly call it, though it be
as old as God himſelfe, whoſe eternall Truth it
is; as old as the Patriarks and Prophets, as Chriſt
and his Apoſtles) there hath beene (ſay they)

ſtrange apparitions, extremitie of ſeaſons,
and other Iudgements, than ever our fore-fathers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7160:41"/>
ſaw, or heard of. Hoſpitalitie, Charitie, Paſtimes,

for ſo they call the bloudie and idolatrous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie

to poure out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, both
we and our fathers, our Kings and our Princes, in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Iudah, and in the ſtreetes of Ieruſalem; for then
had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and felt no evill.
But ſince we left off to burne incenſe to the Queene of
Heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, we
have had ſcarceneſſe of all things, and have bin conſumed
by the ſword, and by the famine.</hi> The very ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint

in his 122. Epiſtle, that there were wicked

            <p>1 Becauſe that the Light of the Goſpel is come
amongst us;<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 19, 20.</note> and many love Darkneſſe rather than <hi>that</hi>

            <p>2 Becauſe the Goſpel is not ſo thankefully

            <p>3 Many that heare it, live not after it: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
onely make a ſhew of godlineſſe; but deny
the power thereof, in their lives and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So, that negligence and diſobedience to the

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7160:42"/>
and miſeries, which are wickedly &amp; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
pretended to bee a cauſe why they have ſo

            <p>As for Hoſpitality in the time of Popery,<note place="margin">Popiſh Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, upon what grounds.</note> it
did not ſo much ſpring from the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

their ſinnes, and purchaſing Heaven by

            <p>2. From an exceſſive cheapneſſe of all things,
by reaſon of the ſcarcity of money.</p>
            <p>3. From the ſuperfluitie of the wealth, riches,
lands and impropriations, the price of the bloud
of ſoules, which Monaſteries, and other religious,
or rather ſuperſtitious houſes, had immeaſurably
and unconſcionably ingroſſed and got into their

to themſelves,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> (as one ſayes) they ſeemed liberall

            <p>
               <hi>As for works of Charity: Certaine it is, and a

That the charitable benevolence,<note place="margin">Our times may compare with any for works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> bountifull libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie,

Who doth not underſtand of the infinite ſummes
of Gold and Silver which are gathered from the

of all things, even in other Kingdomes alſo,
where Popery is profeſſed.<note place="margin">De Rep. lib. 6, cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>One</hi> Bodin, <hi>a great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititian

much deceived, who thinke that the price of Corne, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,

did of old. They doe not underſtand and conſider, that
the price of things is more by ten parts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>than
it was anciently, by reaſon of the plenty and abundance of
Gold and Silver, which is brought out of the Weſt Indies
into Europe, whereby it comes to paſſe that money is leſſe

            </p>
            <p>Beſides, for our owne Countrey, wiſe men have
obſerved another particular reaſon. For (ſay
they) immediately after our coine, in the time of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, the prices of all things
generally among all ſorts of people roſe; for that
they thinke, that the alteration of the Coine was
the chiefe and principall cauſe of an univerſall

being reſtored by our late Queene, that bleſſed
Saint of glorious memory, to its former purity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7160:43"/>
and perfection, the prices of all things fall not

            <p>As for paſtimes, Playes, and other fearefull

They are fit pleaſures for Papiſts, which have no

            <p>This laſt objection then of Papiſts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
men; That the world is worſe ſince there
was ſo much preaching, is idle, vaine, and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous.</p>
            <p>Many ſuch like conceits, perſwaſions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
as theſe, which I have now reckoned up
unto you, there are abroad in the world, and in
the hearts of prophane men, by which they are
hindred from hearing the Word of God, with
that heart, zeale and diligence as they ought.</p>
            <p>Now I come to acquaint you with ſome ſlights
and temptations of Satan,<note place="margin">Satans ſleights to hinder the effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Word.</note> whereby he labours to
bereave us of the bleſſings and benefits of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
hearers, and to hinder the effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Word in our conſciences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</p>
            <p>A firſt plot and practice of Satan,<note place="margin">He would keep them from the Word.</note> is to keepe
men from diligent hearing the Word; If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
that way prevaile, in a ſecond place he labours
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7160:44"/>
to make the Word in vaine,<note place="margin">Or elſe hinder the power of it</note> fruitleſſe, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
unto them. And that hee doth, by ſuch
meanes as theſe:</p>
            <p>I If by the grace of God we breake thorow all
lets and ſnares which might withhold us from
holy aſſemblies,<note place="margin">Hee keepes them from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.</note> and hearing of the Word; then
Satan, that he might make it uneffectuall for our
converſion and ſalvation; firſt, labours to worke
in us a negligent careleſneſſe and heedleſneſſe, in
liſtning to thoſe things which are delivered, and
that by a kinde of heartleſneſſe in holy things,
by dulneſſe of ſpirit, drowſineſſe, ſleepineſſe,
gazing about, talking, or ſuch like. And ſuch
hearers as theſe, are never a whit moved or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with the Word preached, but remaine in the
ſame ſtate as they were before. There is neither
paſſion or impreſſion wrought upon them for the
preſent, nor any thought of it, profit or practice
afterward.</p>
            <p>2<note n="*" place="margin">In this depth he uſes to fill our minds with barren melancholy, or to make men poſt off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes, and apply them Phariſoically all the while to others. He fills our minds either with worldly, or elſe with impertinent unſeaſonable thoughts.</note> But if he cannot ſpeed this way, but that we
rouze up and addreſſe our ſelves to heare the
Word of God, as deſiring with care and good

place, hee ſeekes by all meanes to fill our
heads and hearts with idle muſings, and wandring
thoughts, which may diſtract and ſteale away
our minds from attending to the Word. And
that he doth, either by offering and ſuggeſting
to our conſideration and memory, the world, and

our profits and preferments; thoſe pleaſures and

holy Exerciſe; which ought for the time, onely
and wholly to take up our mindes.</p>
            <p>If this yet will doe no good;<note place="margin">3</note> but that wee
marke diligently and attentively, all the while,
what the Miniſter delivers unto us from God, for
our good: why then, in a third place;</p>
            <p>1 In ſome,<note place="margin">Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what they heare.</note> he makes it uneffectuall, by nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
in them a neglect of reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and ignorance in the Principles of Religion:
ſo that though they attend never ſo well, and ſtare
the Miniſter in the face; yet they underſtand not
the Sermons they heare. Let the younger ſort
therefore, to prevent this miſchiefe, acquaint
themſelves with the Scriptures from their youth;
by the example of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Salomon,
Prov.</hi> 31. 1, <hi>&amp;c. Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 24. See alſo
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1. And let the miſerie upon
<hi>Elies</hi> Houſe, terrifie negligent and indulgent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this depth, the
Word is either buried as it is brought forth, or
dies at the Church doore.</p>
            <p>2 In others,<note place="margin">In others, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſteales it away immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</note> he earneſtly endeavours utterly to
extinguiſh and aboliſh all thought of it; quite
to drive and baniſh it out of their heads, ſo ſoone
as they have heard it. And that thus: If mens
hearts be hardned through unbeleefe, or cuſtome
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7160:45"/>
in ſinning, and like the High-way in the Parable
of the Sower; then the Evill one comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and catcheth the Seed of the Word ſo
ſoone as it is ſowen, and ſtealeth it out of the
heart.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As we may ſee many times Birds hovering
greedily after the Sower, to ſnatch away the
Corne, before it be covered with Earth, or take
root in the ground: even ſo Sathan, the ravenous
Crow of Hell, waites all opportunities to pecke
up the Seed of the Word out of the hearts of
men, before it ſinke into their affections, or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
in their converſations. Or otherwiſe, if the
World hath ſtolne mens hearts out of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<note place="margin">Or the World ſteales away their hearts.</note>
ſo that they have no hearts left within them,
for matters of Holineſſe, and Heaven; but are
wholly ſet upon Gaine, and exerciſed in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe:
then needes not Sathan much to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre
himſelfe; he knowes full well, that worldly
Cares will preſently choake the Seed of the
Word.<note place="margin">Mar. 4. 19.</note> As ſoone as the Sermon is heard, and
ended, and they turned their backes upon the
Church, there comes immediately into their
heads whole ſwarmes of earthly thoughts, and
they are preſently plunged over head and eares
into the cares and plottings of earthly buſineſſes.
So that theſe men, whom Sathan conquers by this
temptation, never meddle with meditation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
or talke about the points handled by the
Preacher, by which the Word of God ſhould be
better, as it were, digeſted, and prepared for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.
Nay, they have no delight at all to heare
others repeat the Sermon; but are very wearie of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7160:45"/>
the place and companie, and never pleaſed, untill
they bring them back againe unto talke of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matters and prophane diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>If this yet will not ſerve the turne,<note place="margin">4 He labours to keepe them from practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what they know.</note> but that the
Word gets within a man, and workes upon his
underſtanding; ſo that by his diligent hearing of
it, meditation, and conference, he furniſhes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with competent knowledge in the Booke of
God, and Divine Truth: why then, Sathan caſts
about another way; which is, to make him to
content himſelfe with a bare fruitleſſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
without practiſing the power of it in his
life and actions; to reſt contented with an abilitie
to talke and diſcourſe onely upon points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and places of Scripture, without inward
ſanctification, and ſubduing the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to new obedience, and ſincere exerciſe of
Chriſtianitie. So that, for all his knowledge, he
neither meddles with Converſion, nor mends in

to draw his knowledge into practiſe, and
fettles himſelfe with care and conſcience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his former wayes and courſes of iniquitie:
why then Sathan plots and practiſeth, with all the
cunning and policie he hath, to make him reſt in
a ſlight, ſuperficiall, and partiall reformation; to
content himſelfe with an unſound, or unſaving
converſion. For, by the way, I muſt tell you; there
may be many converſions,<note place="margin">Severall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> changes, and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in a man, from worſe to better; and yet he not
truly ſanctified, not become a new creature, nor
poſſeſſed of the ſtate of grace, and glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of true Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>1 He may be changed,<note place="margin">In theſe caſes, Truth is the trueſt Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a true convert from all ſtates of unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. See <hi>Gonge, p.</hi> 130.</note> from a notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to a civill honeſt man: whereas he hath beene
before furious, and deſperate in lewd courſes, hee
may grow more ſober and moderate in his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
And yet, for all this, continue in his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
and a meere ſtranger to the wayes of
godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>2 From civill honeſtie, he may paſſe on to a
formall Chriſtianitie, and become an outward
Profeſſor; and outwardly doe, and performe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

the power of inward ſanctification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:7160:46"/>
3 Yet further, by a generall power of the Word,
and inferior working of the Spirit, he may in ſome
ſort be outwardly reformed, and in ſome meaſure
inwardly enlightened; hee may have underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and joy by the Miniſterie of the Word, and
may doe many things after it, and for ſake many
ſinnes.<note place="margin">Mark. 6. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Herod</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. to have reverenced
<hi>Iohn,</hi> to have heard him gladly, and to have done
many things: And yet for all this, hee may come
ſhort of a ſound converſion; if hee ſuffer ſome
maine corruption, ſome one ſweet ſinne, or other,
to reigne in him, which hee ſtill feedes upon with
delight, and ſenſuall ſweetneſſe; if hee doe not
wholly and entirely reſigne and give up himſelfe,
his ſpirit, ſoule and body to the Lords ſervice, and
to pleaſe him in all things; and with repentance,
and reſolution, forſake all his knowne ſinnes. For
this is a certaine Rule and Principle with<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Hieron. p.</hi> 158. <hi>Marbury</hi> in his Sermon at P. C. <hi>Dod</hi> upon the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Theſe changes a man may have, and thus many
paſſages, from worſe to better; and yet the great
and glorious worke of regeneration not wrought
upon him. For where there is a ſound converſion,
and through-reformation, there a man is wholly
ſanctified,<note place="margin">Fruits of a true converſion.</note> and ſet apart unto God, from the ſinfull
corruption of his naturall birth, and the evill fruits
thereof, to ſerve God in his whole man, both body,
foule, and ſpirit. He ſhakes hands with all ſinnes,
he ſells all for the precious Iewell of the Goſpel;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7160:47"/>
he regards not ſinne in his heart, but hath a regard
to all Gods Commandements.</p>
            <p>Now ſith Sathan, that old Serpent, knowes full
well, that it will never ſerve the turne for a man to
part but with part of his ſinnes; that his caſe is
fearefull enough, whatſoever good, or good deeds
ſeeme to be in him, if he yeeld not to the worke of
the Holy-Ghoſt, for the leaving but of any one
knowne ſinne, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ighteth againſt the peace of
his Conſcience; he knowes, that he hath haunt
and hold enough in a mans Conſcience, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
that hee hath ſufficient intereſt and
claime to his damnation, if he can but keepe his
ſweet ſinne in heart, and alive in him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when any by the Miniſterie of the Word is
moved to ſettle and addreſſe himſelfe to a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his wayes, and to redreſſe his former
wicked life; he puts in, might and maine, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in his vigour, and ſoveraigntie, one ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
ſinne, or other, at leaſt, in the heart and
affection of him, that goes about to reforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
He ſingles out one corruption, or other, to
which hee findes a man moſt addicted; and this
he conceales, and fenceth with all the policie that
he hath, that if by any meanes it may eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented
of, unmortified, and unmedled with.</p>
            <p>Thus he dealt with <hi>Herod:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Herod,</hi> by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> reformed himſelfe in many things;
but Sathan made ſure to keepe him his owne, by
that one ſinne of Inceſt. <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, no
doubt, beleeved, and followed the Prophet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things;<note place="margin">2 King. 5. 18.</note> but he deſired onely, <hi>that the Lord would
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7160:47"/>
be mercifull unto him, when he went into the houſe of
Rimmon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 19. 22.</note> The young man in the Goſpel, in his
outward carriage was unreprovable; but that one
ſecret ſinne of worldlineſſe, baniſhed him out of
the preſence and Kingdome of Chriſt. In this
point,<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> Sathan labours to perſwade men to deale
with God in the forſaking of their ſinnes, as <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
dealt with the Apoſtle, in parting with his
Money. It was a cuſtome, you know, in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, becauſe of the neceſſitie of the
Times; that many, out of a zealous and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
love unto the Goſpel, ſold their Lands, and
brought the price, and laid it downe at the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
feet. <hi>Ananias</hi> amongſt the reſt, would needes
ſeeme as forward &amp; zealous in this glorious worke
of Charitie, as any other: He ſold his Lands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and brought in the Money, and tender'd it at
the Apoſtles fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t; but yet ſecretly, ſuſpecting
Gods providence, and doubting leſt himſelfe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
at length ſhould be brought into want, hee
kept backe one part of the price of his Poſſeſſion;
making ſhew notwithſtanding, to have brought in
all. So it is in many, by the malice of Sathan, and
bewitching enticements of naturall corruption,
in the forſaking of their ſinnes. In a true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
indeed, when a man is about to buy the Pearle
of great price &amp; unvaluable worth in the Goſpel,
the Doctrine of Salvation, the Way to Life, and
Graces of Gods Spirit; he makes an univerſall
ſale of all his ſinnes;<note place="margin">Math. 13. 44.</note> 
               <hi>he ſelleth</hi> (as the Text ſaith)
<hi>all that he hath:</hi> not ſome piece of his ſinfull Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but even the very whole Lordſhip, the entire
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7160:48"/>
Inheritance. But it is otherwiſe with thoſe whom
Sathan inveagleth, and enſnareth in this point.
Hee is well enough pleaſed, that they ſhall ſeeme
to be as forward in the reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their lives, as any other; and indeed, that
they ſhall be reformed in good part, and carry
ſome love and affection toward the Word, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;
ſo that he may keepe hold and poſſeſſion
but in one corner of the heart: For he knowes, that
that is enough to keepe the whole man, body and
ſoule, his owne. If he can ſtay but one ſinne unſold,
he knowes the man continues ſtill, by the courſe of
divine Law,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> a bondſlave of Hell. By one little hole
a ſhip will ſinke into the bottome of the Sea. The
ſtab of a Pen-knife to the heart, will as well ſpeed
a man, as all the Daggers that killed <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the
Senat-houſe. The ſoule will be ſtrangled with one
Cord of vanitie, as well as with all the Cart-ropes
of iniquitie: only, the more ſins, the more plagues,
and fiercer flame in Hell: but he that lives and dies
impenitent in one, it will be his deſtruction. One
dramme of poyſon will diſpatch a man; and one
reigning ſinne will bring him to endleſſe woe and
miſerie. Let us take heed therefore, when we goe
about reformation of our ſelves, leſt we be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
&amp; overtaken by this malicious craft of Sathan.
Let us reſolve upon a through-reformation; which
is only and ever undertaken, with a purpoſe not to
hold on in the willing practice of any one knowne
iniquitie, or ſinfull courſe. Which, when we ſhall
carefully &amp; earneſtly go about, Sathan will be ſure
to ſet upon us, as <hi>Pharoah</hi> did upon <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:7160:48"/>
When the Lord had commanded them to goe

            <p>2. Sith this would not then ſerve, but that

               <hi>I will let you goe</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) <hi>that you may ſacrifice to the Lord your
God in the Wilderneſſe; but goe not farre away.</hi> But

<hi>Nay</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) we will goe with our young and with

            <p>Nay (<hi>ſaith</hi> Moſes) our Cattell alſo ſhall goe with us.
There ſhall not an hoofe be left.</p>
            <p>Now when all this would not doe, when <hi>Moſes</hi>
would not accept of any capitulations, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

he would not leave ſo much as an hoofe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7160:49"/>
Now, I ſay, when all the enticements and

<hi>Moſes</hi> from ſerving and ſacrificing unto God, and
that preciſely and ſtrictly, according to his owne

all meanes and policies to keepe and detaine

of the Regions of death. If they will needs
bee medling with reformation of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>infull

muſt be done, he is content to yeeld unto them
upon ſome termes or conditions,<note place="margin">Satan would condition with men in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that they caſt
him not quite out of their conſciences, but ſuffer
him to ſway and raigne in their hearts, by ſome
one gainfull or delightfull ſinne or other.</p>
            <p>1. If they will needs feare God, he ſtands not
much upon it, but that they may doe it outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in profeſſion, ſo that they will continue
in Aegypt, within the Kingdome of darkneſſe,
and lie ſtill in their ſinnes, and under the ſhadow
of death.</p>
            <p>2. If this will not content them, if they will
not reſt here, but will needs out of the Kingdome
of darkneſſe, and dominion of death, why he is
not much againſt it, but that they may goe the
halfe way; that is, he will ſuffer them to forgoe
and forbeare the outward practice and perpetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many ſinnes, ſo that inwardly their heart and
affections harbour, nouriſh &amp; embrace them ſtill,
and feed upon with a ſenſuall and delightfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,

committed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:7160:50"/>
3. If they deſire and endevour to become new
men, both inwardly and outwardly, to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in actions and affections, to ſerve God both
in ſoule and body, he will yet yeeld ſo farre, that
they may be rid of ſome ſinnes both in heart and
practice, as perhaps of ſinnes of cuſtome; but
then he will be a ſuitor and ſolicitor unto them,
to retaine other ſinnes, as perhaps ſinnes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For example: It may be they may both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
the outward practice, and alſo inwardly
loath ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, and other ſuch like
ſinnes of cuſtome; but they will nuzzle in the
boſome of their affections, pride, luſt, anger, and
ſuch other ſinnes, the naturall birth as it were of
originall corruption.</p>

            <p>I have ſtayed very long upon the fifth plot
and practice of Sathan, whereby he labours to
make the Word heard, unpowerfull and unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
for the ſalvation of our ſoules: For, I
know, it is much and often exerciſed, and with
great ſucceſſe; and by it, he prevailes with very
many. When by diligent hearing of Gods
Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faithfully urged upon them, they are
driven, and doe addreſſe themſelves to a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and amendment of their ſinfull lives;
he mightily endeavours to hinder, diſquiet, and
interrupt them in it; to make it a reformation
unto them but in part, and by halfes; unſound,
and unſaving: So that, it may be, they may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
ſinnes of Cuſtome, as Lying, Swearing,
Drunkenneſſe, and ſuch like; but keepe ſinnes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7160:51"/>
of Nature, as Pride, Luſt, Anger, and the like:
Or, it may be, they may forſake both theſe two
kindes of ſinnes, and yet keepe ſinnes of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
as Oppreſſion, unlawfull Gaining, grinding
the faces of the Poore, ſerving the Time, and
ſuch like: Or, they may leave all theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet
keepe ſinnes of Companie; as, idle and vaine
Talking, filthie Ieaſting, rayling againſt and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
their Neighbours, uncharitable judging
and cenſuring their Brethren, and the like. It
may be, they may be carefull in their generall
calling of Chriſtianitie; but careleſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
in thoſe particular places and callings,
wherein God in his providence hath ſet them:
Or contrarily; they may be of Chriſtian beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
abroad, and in publike; as at Sermons,
and in the Church: but unconſcionable at
home, and in their private families; never tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
or praying with them: They may ſeeme
zealous in the Commandements of the firſt
Table, and about the ſervice of God; but in
the ſecond, and towards their Neighbour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull,
unconſcionable, and uncharitable:
Or, they may deale juſtly and honeſtly with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but be utterly voide and deſtitute of the
knowledge and feare of God: They may bee
outwardly reformed, but inwardly full of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-heartedneſſe,
and hypocriſie: They may
leave all other ſinnes, onely keepe one behinde;
which is called a mans ſweet, delightfull, and
boſome-ſinne.</p>
            <p>If Sathan can prevaile with a man any of theſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7160:52"/>
wayes, hee keepes him his owne: for hee that is
ſoundly converted, juſtified, and ſanctified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
muſt needs be out of love with every ſinne,
with the whole courſe of iniquitie; and with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and chearefulneſſe embrace the entire body
of Chriſtianitie, and have a regard to all Gods
Commandements.</p>
            <p>6 Now I come to a ſixt ſleight and deviſe of
Sathan,<note place="margin">Sathan would hinder perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</note> whereby hee labours to make the Word
fruitleſſe and unprofitable unto us. If he cannot
ſtay us in our reformation, but that we will needs
through, and caſt away all ſinnes; why then, hee
ſeekes by all meanes to hinder our continuance,
and conſtancie.<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> If the Seed of the Word be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with joy, and ſpring up for a time; that is,

blaſted, withers, and comes to nothing.
The uncleane ſpirit may for a time goe out of a
man,<note place="margin">Math. 12. 43.</note> and walke throughout drie places; but if it
be poſſible, he will returne with ſeven other ſpirits
worſe than himſelfe: and the end of that man, is
worſe than the beginning. A man may flye from
the pollution and filthineſſe of the World, as it
is,<note place="margin">2 Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be endued with an inferior ſanctification of the
Spirit,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. and yet after, by the malice

may have a generall participation of the Holy-Ghoſt,

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note> and yet after a time fall away,
to the <hi>very deſpiting of the Spirit of Grace.</hi> I ſpeake
not this, as though that any once effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
truly ſanctified, poſſeſſed of the ſtate of grace,
and enrolled among the Saints, can poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a caſt-away; it cannot bee: for if once by
the power of ſpeciall grace, a man be built upon
the Rocke;<note place="margin">Math. 16. 18.</note> not the Gates of Hell, not all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Darkeneſſ, nor ſtrongeſt aſſaaults of Satan,
ſhall ever prevaile againſt him. Heaven and Earth
ſhall ſooner be removed, than any of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
For if Gods eternall Decree of Election
be unchangeable; if his Covenant be everlaſting,
and inviolable; if his Truth cannot change, nor
his Mercie faile, nor his Power be weakened; if
the ſacred Seale of the bleſſed Spirit ſhall ſtand;
if the precious blood and fervent prayers of <hi>Chriſt
Ieſus</hi> can prevaile; if his Scriptures doe not lye,
and deceive; if his ſanctifying Grace cannot die,
and periſh; if Himſelfe cannot ceaſe to be: then
undoubtedly, if a man be once his, he is his for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
if he be once truely his ſervant upon Earth,
he ſhall for ever hereafter be a glorious Saint in
Heaven. My meaning therefore in this point, is
onely this: There is a glimmering Light of the
Spirit, ſome manner of taſte of the ſweetneſſe of
Chriſt, a kind of change, which may be wrought
in a man by the preaching of the Word, and yet
he not truely and conſtantly converted, but may
by the malice and policie of Satan be repoſſeſſed
by uncleane ſpirits, and repolluted with the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:7160:53"/>
Thus we may diſcerne this changeable change
(that I may ſo ſpeake) and the ſaving change of
Gods ſervants:<note place="margin">Difference betweene a falſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving change.</note> If, after we have given our Names
to Chriſt, and begun to profeſſe and practiſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,
we paſſe on, and continually grow in grace,
and ſtand for Gods honour and ſervice, againſt all
commers; friends or foes, loſſe or diſgrace, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or ſlanders, men or devils; why then, undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly,
we have the ſanctifying Spirit of God, and
ſaving grace; which makes his Children like
Trees betwixt the Rivers of Waters, fruitfull in
goodneſſe, and as bold as Lyons, in good cauſes.
But, if after wee have begun well, wee looke backe
with <hi>Lots</hi> Wife;<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 26.</note> if we fall in love againe with
thoſe ſinnes which wee have forſaken; if Rubbes
and Croſſes in the World, will turne us out of the
way to Heaven; and our righteouſneſſe be but as
the Morning Deaw, which a little heat of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will drie up: why then, our change was
changeable, and not that of Gods children. The
Seed of the Word, which wee received with joy,
was never deepely rooted in good and honeſt
hearts; wee were onely temporarie Converts, not
new creatures; temporizing Profeſſors, not true
Chriſtians; and our End is like to be worſe than
our Beginning; and our Plagues more, than if we
had never begun.</p>
            <p>Let every man take heed then, in the Name of
God, leſt by the traines and temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
he be turn'd backe againe from any good
courſe; leſt after he be waſhed, he wallow againe
in the myre of worldlineſſe, and worldly vanities;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7160:53"/>
and after hee hath eſcaped the filthineſſe of the
World, leſt he be againe entangled therein. Let
us beware of longing after thoſe ſinnes, which we
begun in ſome meaſure to reforme; let us not luſt
againe after the fleſh-pots of Aegypt, like the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
after we be in ſome good ſort enlarged
from the bondage of ſinne, and tyrannie of the
helliſh <hi>Pharoah. Lots</hi> Wife being delivered out
of Sodome, was ſurpriſed with a ſenſuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the pleaſures and vanities of the place
which ſhee had left, of the eaſe and proſperitie
which ſhee there enjoyed; and ſo look'd backe
upon it: But ſhee was therefore preſently turned
into a Pillar of Salt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 26. there for ever to
be a monument and fearefull ſpectacle of Gods
terrible judgements againſt all back-ſliders. If
the uncleane ſpirit be caſt out of a man by ſome
degrees of reformation, and good beginnings of
amendment of life, and have after leave and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to returne; he brings with him ſeven Devils
worſe than himſelfe, and makes a man farre worſe
than he was before.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 21.</note> Much better were it for any
man never to have knowne or ſtept into the way
of righteouſneſſe, than afterward to turne from
the holy Commandement of God, and out of a
courſe of Chriſtianitie. It is a fearefull Curſe,
to continue in hardneſſe of heart, prophaneneſſe
of life, and ſinfull courſes: But to leave them for
a little, and to ſinke backe againe, is to have <hi>Gods
Curſe</hi> bitter againſt them, if they repent not, and
the fire of Hell made more hot for them. Firſt,
ſickneſſes are curable; but relapſes are very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7160:54"/>
if not irrecoverable. <hi>If a man</hi> (as it is
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.) <hi>hath once beene enlightened,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 6.</note> 
               <hi>and then fall
away, it is impoſſible to be renewed by repentance.</hi> I
know that place principally to be underſtood of
the higheſt degree of Apoſtacie, and falling away;
but hee that falls away from any good courſe, and
good beginnings, falls towards that irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fall, and makes himſelfe more uncapable of
repentance, than if he never had been enlightened,
or ſtept into the way of Truth: And it is juſt
with God, to puniſh ſuch with a reprobate ſenſe,
and hearts <hi>that cannot repent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It then deepely and neerely concernes us; for
once wee have felt the ſweetneſſe of Grace, and
<hi>tasted of the Powers of the World to come;</hi> to drinke
deeper of the Waters of Life, and to <hi>follow hard
towards the marke, for the price of the high calling of
God in Christ Ieſus.</hi> When wee feele any good
motions and purpoſes ariſe in our hearts, let us
labour to follow them, to nouriſh them, to blow
them up, to make a fire of them; leſt they onely
but make a flaſh, and paſſe away as the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Let us put them in practiſe with zeale,
and conſtancie, that we be not as the unfaithfull
Waters, which in the Summer are dryed up; or
as the dead Trees, which periſh in Winter: but
that we remaine whole and ſound, pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as the living Waters and Olives of the Lord,
that ever ſhed forth their ſweetneſſe and fatneſſe.
Let us make a Covenant,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 5.</note> even <hi>a Covenant</hi> (as
the Scripture ſpeaketh) <hi>of Salt,</hi> durable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall,

in our way, to bring us upon our

omitted, and unaſſayed, to hale us back
into one or other ſpeciall ſinne, of our unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
If this will not ſtop, hee will follow all
occaſions, enticements, and temptations, the tide

if by any meanes hee can caſt us into ſome groſſe

            <p>6 To become watchfull, and wiſe; by taking
ſpeciall notice of all the motives, temptations,

            <p>7 To thinke charitably of other men, that fall,
and are ſuddenly overtaken in any offence; not to
be too eager, hot, and cenſorious againſt them;
but out of his owne experience, to give them
comfort, inſtructions, and directions, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to reſtore them with the ſpirit of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Now, I ſay, if a man be either fore-armed
and fenced (as I ſaid) from falls; or elſe, after his
fall, weepe bitterly, repent ſincerely, watch after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
more carefully, walke more zealouſly; and
out of his ſpirituall wiſedome, make that uſe and
benefit of his fall, as I have told you: then hee
may have comfort, that Sathan gets no great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
this way.</p>
            <p>8 Like a fierce cruell Dragon,<note place="margin">He ſends forth flouds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and affliction after them.</note> ſith he cannot
devoure the Womans Child ſo ſoone as ever it is

out of his mouth, after him, flouds of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
croſſes and vexations. If he cannot wound
him in his ſoule, yet he will vexe him in his body,
goods, and good name: if he cannot hinder him
of Heaven, he will give him little reſt or quiet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7160:57"/>
upon Earth: if hee cannot bring him into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace

and loade him with all outward diſcomforts and

have theſe worthy effects and workings.</p>
            <p>1 They ſtart us out of our ſecuritie,<note place="margin">They make us watchfull, &amp;c.</note> careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

and venome; but give ſtrength to the new
man, with all his godly and gracious motions, holy
and heavenly actions.</p>
            <p>3 They make us with indignation to ſpit in the
very face of this vaine,<note place="margin">To contemne the World.</note> deceitfull, and flattering
World; the temporall love of which, is the eternall

They happily weane us from the love of it, and
make us willing to part with her paps; to bid all
her enticements adiew, and to trample under feet

us to teare our groveling hearts, and rent our dull

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7160:58"/>
and are glued ſo faſt, and to lift up both our heads

to be revealed, longingly to deſire the comming

            <p>4 Laſtly,<note place="margin">To ſee further into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</note> they are as ſharpe and precious eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalves,
to cleare and enlarge the ſpirituall ſight of

ſee further into the great myſterie of godlineſſe,
deeper into the maſſe and dunghill of our owne

of the World, and higher into the happineſſe of
Heaven, and that great Beautie, Glory, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie

            <p>Thus Sathan is diſappointed in his plots, and
policie; his malice makes a medicine for our
ſoules: hee purpoſeth and hopes, by croſſes and
afflictions to turne us backe, or make us wearie in

they become as ſpurres, to pricke us forward in
our Chriſtian Race; and as hedges to keepe us in,
from wandering out of the way.</p>

Now,<note place="margin">3 Though Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be the inſtrument to afflict, yet God is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Agent, who will order all for their good.</note> in a third place; That Gods child may

            <p>Let us then, in all our ſufferings and afflictions,

the mightie Lord of Heaven and Earth: who, by

hath us under his correction; and holds in his

power and particular ſtings of all creatures, as
Rods and Scourges, to reforme and amend us; to
keepe us in a courſe of holineſſe, and in the right

face of any mortall man, ſlinkes back from a bold
profeſſion of ſinceritie, and from the true ſervice
of the living God.</p>
            <p>In ſufferings and afflictions for Gods cauſe,
there is not onely matter of patience, but even oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of glory. They are like ſtarres in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
honourable maimes, conformities to Ieſus
Chriſt, Liveries of a Chriſtian ſouldier.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</note> let him conſider, that his momentanie
croſſes and afflictions cauſe an exceeding and
everlaſting weight of glory.<note place="margin">Afflictions are but ſhort, and they worke a weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> Let his vexation be
never ſo grievous, his perſecutors never ſo great,
and mightie; neither they, nor that, can laſt long.
For the life of man, and all the glory thereof, doth
paſſe away like a Ship in the Water, whoſe tract
cannot be ſeene againe; like an Arrow through
the aire, or a Weavers Shuttle through his worke;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7160:62"/>
like a fading Flower, ſuddenly plucked up and
withered; like Graſſe, like Smoake, like a Dreame,
like a Bubble of the Water. Though a Chriſtian
therefore be never ſo deepely plunged into<note n="*" place="margin">As many times they are. See <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 69. 1, 2.</note> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
he ſhall abide but a while under the waters
of affliction; the day of redemption cannot be
farre off. Though he ſhould paſſe through the
teeth of wilde Beaſts, upon the ſword of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
through the flames of fire; though his braines
ſhould be daſht againſt the walls, his limbes lye
ſcattered in the ſtreets, and his bloud runne downe
every channell: yet ſhall he, ere it be long, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
riſe againe, in deſpight of all the powers of
Darkeneſſe, and bloudineſſe of cruell men. Hee
ſhall entirely be reſtored, by the mightie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
hand of God; hee ſhall be clothed with
Light, and immortalitie; his bloud ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged,
and <hi>all teares wiped from his eyes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 17.</note> and there
ſhall be ſet upon his head a Crowne of everlaſting
joy, peace, and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">6 Chriſt doth ſuffer and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with his children in affliction.</note> comfort unſpeakable, and glorious,
may ſpring up in the heart of Gods child, amidſt
his ſufferings for the cauſe of God, out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
That in all afflictions, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Chriſt ſuffereth with him.<note place="margin">See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> was the
mirrour and miracle of all Chriſtians, for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
and gloriouſneſſe of his ſufferings; you
may ſee a ſtrange and unmatchable Catalogue of
them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 23, &amp;c.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was in ſtripes above
meaſure, plenteouſly in priſon, in death oft. Of
the Iewes, five times received hee fortie ſtripes,
ſave one; he was thrice beaten with Rods, he was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7160:63"/>
once ſtoned, he ſuffered thrice ſhipwracke; night
and day was he in the deepe Sea: In journeying,
he was often; in perils of Waters, in perils of
Robbers, in perils of his owne Nation, in perils
among the Gentiles, in perils in the Citie, in
perils in the Wilderneſſe, in perils in the Sea, in
perils among falſe Brethren; in wearineſſe, and
painefulneſſe; in watching often; in hunger, and
thirſt; in faſtings often; in cold, and in naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Yet all theſe, and what other croſſes and
afflictions befell him, he calls and accounts them
the ſufferings and afflictions of Chriſt. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24.) <hi>now rejoyce I in my ſufferings for
you, and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ in
my fleſh, for his Bodies ſake, which is the Church.</hi> And
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>As the ſufferings of Christ abound in us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 5.</note>
ſo our conſolation aboundeth through Christ. Lazarus,</hi>
in all his povertie, contempt, ſickneſſe, ſores, or
what other miſeries, ſuffered nothing wherein
Chriſt was not partaker of his griefe and ſorrow.
So ſweet and bleſſed a conſent and ſympathie is
there betwixt Chriſt, the Head, and all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
his members; that ſo long as the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
of that myſticall Vnion ſtands true and
ſure, (which is for ever) all holy men, and ſervants
of God, in all their ſufferings for the Name of
Chriſt, profeſſion of his Truth, and practice of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,
ſhall have Chriſt himſelfe partner and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of their miſeries; which is able to refreſh
the heavieſt heart, in the greateſt extremities.</p>
            <p>I have ſtayed long upon this point; to wit,
how Sathan labours might and maine, by croſſes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7160:63"/>
and ſlanders, to diſcourage Gods child, and to
ſtop his courſe in the wayes of righteouſneſſe;
and in laying downe ſome comforts againſt them:
becauſe thouſands, at the very firſt entrance, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome ſmall continuance, are wofully turned
backe from grace, and ſinceritie, by temptations,
reproaches, and troubles rayſed againſt them; by
their owne rebellious fleſh, Sathan, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
men.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">9 Satan hinders the working of the Word; by ſpiritual Pride.</note> in a ninth place, if all this will doe no
good; if the heat of perſecution inflame the
zeale of the true Chriſtian; if reproaches and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
be ſo farre from daunting and dulling
his forwardneſſe, that they ſet an edge upon his
affections, and adde ſtrength to his reſolution, in
proceeding in the glorious ſtate of Chriſtianitie:
Why then, the laſt ſleight and temptation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
to hinder the ſanctifying power and ſucceſſe
of the Word, and to make it fruitleſſe and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
is ſpirituall Pride; which, by his malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cunning, and helliſh Alchymie, hee extracts
even out of his graces and vertues; out of ſuch
ſweet flowers, he rayſes poyſon: and ſith he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keepe goodneſſe utterly out of the ſoule, he
uſes it ſelfe as an inſtrument, to weaken &amp; wound
it ſelfe. For when a man is moſt endued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with extraordinarie gifts, holy graces, and
ſpirituall ſtrength; Sathan ſeekes moſt buſily to
make him proud of them, and to puffe him up
with an over-weening conceit of his owne worth;
that ſo himſelfe may loſe the comfort of them,
his brethren the fruit of them, and God the glory
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7160:64"/>
of them. This ſpirituall Pride, is the ſame in our
corruptions and ſinfull affections, that the Shirt
is in our Clothing; that is to ſay, it ſits the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
unto us, and is laſt put off: <hi>it is the white Devill</hi>
(as a worthy Divine calls it.) That ſinne doth
lye, and inſenſibly inſinuate it ſelfe; and lurkes
amid our graces, and good actions, as a dead Fly
in the Apothecaries Ointment. It is, as it were,
Sathans laſt intrenchment, which hee holds the
longeſt, and with moſt reſolute and deſperate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacie,
and is hardlyeſt driven out; much ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
wiſedome, a great meaſure of humilitie, and
the whole Armour of God is required to this
combate. For he is ſo endleſſe, and exerciſed in
the point; that, if we be ſo humble, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make us proud of any thing elſe, he will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to make us proud even of our humilitie; and
proud, that we are not proud of our gifts.</p>
            <p>Except a Chriſtian continually and carefully
watch over his heart,<note place="margin">Spirituall Pride may ariſe in Gods children.</note> and guard it with humilitie,
and a lowly conceit of himſelfe; this privie Pride
may ſteale upon him, before he be aware.</p>
            <p>And firſt,<note place="margin">1 From a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> it may ſpring out of a conſideration
of the excellencie of his eſtate, and the varietie of
his peculiar bleſſings, and ſpeciall priviledges,
which the ungodly men neither can, nor doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
For when he is once tranſlated from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to Light,<note place="margin">Priviledges of the godly.</note> from prophaneneſſe to ſinceritie,
from Nature to Grace; out of the Dominion of
Sathan, into the Kingdome of Chriſt, by the
great worke of regeneration: hee is preſently
<hi>made partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. hee
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7160:64"/>
is entitled, by the right of the Sonne of God, <hi>to
an inheritance immortall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and undefiled, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not away, reſerved in the Heavens for him.</hi>
While hee is thus looking upon himſelfe, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of this happineſſe, and planted in this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Paradiſe; Sathan is ſecretly blowing the
coales of his hidden corruption, to enkindle and
rayſe there-out an over-weening conceit of his
owne worth, and to puffe him up with pride of
his owne gifts and graces; whence may enſue
two foule and hatefull inconveniences: For ſo
hee may grow by little and little to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
too much, whereby Gods glory may be
leſſened and darkened; and to deſpiſe his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
whereby his exerciſe of charitie may be
hindered.</p>
            <p>This ſpirituall Pride may occaſionally,<note place="margin">2 From their care, to keepe themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled.</note> and
by accident, ſpring out of a godly and gracious
care, to keepe and preſerve himſelfe unſpotted
and undefiled in his happy and glorious ſtate of
grace, and regeneration. For while he is caſting
with himſelfe, and concluding upon ſome ſound
and ſubſtantiall courſe of holineſſe and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the wayes of godlineſſe; Sathan labours
might and maine, to draw him to a ſingularitie of
unwarrantable conceits and opinions; that by a
tedious and unneceſſarie purſuit and poſſeſſion
thereof, he may keepe him cold and uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the practice of the chiefe and moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
duties of Chriſtianitie; and to make him
place the height of Religion, and heat of zeale,
in continuall conference and moſt peremptorie
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7160:65"/>
defence of ſome groundleſſe fancies; from whence
Sathan buſily ſtrives to toll him out, to ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which courſe of ſeparating from, and
condemning our Church,<note place="margin">Againſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from our Church.</note> in the judgement of
our ſincereſt Divines, is full of pride, contention,
and confuſion.</p>
            <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> certaine it is, our Church, in that moſt
exquiſite and worthy confeſſion of Faith contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Articles of Religion, doth hold and
profeſſe all ſubſtantiall points of Divinitie as
ſoundly, as any Church in the World, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
neither in this Age, nor in the primitive
times of the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it hath communion with, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of all other true Churches.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> in it are to be had the meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
in a powerfull and plentifull manner: and
in the bowels thereof, even they that goe out of
our Church, if they be truly converted, received
that precious and bleſſed vigour, which is able to
quicken them to eternall life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> a Church may be a true Church,
though it ſhould have ſpots, and blemiſhes;
though there be ſome Swine and Dogges in it.
In S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, the Corinthians were called the
Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1, 2. And yet, at that
very time, were ſome in an Hereſie, ſome in Inceſt,
ſome that had not repented of their filthineſſe,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20, 21. The like may be ſaid of the
Churches of Aſia, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> though outward proſperitie, worldly
honour, and plentie, be rather the lot of falſe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7160:65"/>
hereticall, and Apoſtaticall Churches, than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall
and neceſſary mark of the true Church;
yet, if unto our unparallel'd Peace, both for dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and entireneſſe, we adde our many and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
deliverances, ſtrange defeatments, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of Popiſh Plots; of their Bulls, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies,
and hoſtile Invaſions; of their Powder,
Poyſons, Daggers, Dags, and all manner of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
attempts, machinations, and underminings,
which either Hell could deviſe, or that deſperate
and bloudy Faction adventure upon, and manage:
I ſay, if all theſe be put together, and well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
it is impoſſible, but that wee ſhould therein
ſee, acknowledge, and adore the ſpeciall finger of
Gods holy providence, upholding his owne Arke
amongſt his owne people; and pointing out to
all the World, the truth of that Church, upon
whoſe ſide, and for whoſe ſafetie and glory hee ſo
mightily ſtands. This moſt extraordinarie grace
and favour of Divine aſſiſtance, having not in one
thing, or two, ſhewed it ſelfe, nor for ſome few
dayes or yeeres appeared; but in ſuch ſort, ſo
long continued, our manifold ſinnes and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
ſtriving to the contrary: What doth it
elſe import, or what can wee leſſe thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
than that God would thereby tell and
teach the World, That the thing which hee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
defendeth, and keepeth ſo ſtrangely, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be of him, and his ſaving and ſacred
Truth?</p>
            <p>Ill doe they then, who tranſported with a pang
of ſpirituall Pride, abandon, forſake, and ſeparate
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7160:66"/>
from our Church, as though Gods true worſhip
and ſalvation were not there to be found. You
ſee how Sathan by ſpirituall Pride may carry and
caſt a man, from a ſetled and ſound courſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and ſinceritie, upon the dangerous Rockes
of ſingularitie and ſeparation. But underſtand
me aright, what I meane by ſingularitie. I meane
that onely which ariſeth out of privie Pride, is
upholden by ſelfe-will, and obſtinateneſſe, and
many times ends in ſeparation; and hath neither
ground nor defence from ſound judgement, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
wiſedome, or true tenderneſſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
joyned with humilitie, and willingneſſe to
be rightly informed. I meane not ſingularitie, in
reſpect of holineſſe and unſpottedneſſe of life, in
reſpect of difference and diſtance from the ſinfull
faſhions of the times: For in this ſenſe, every
man that will ſave his ſoule, muſt be ſingular.
Hence it is, that our Saviour asketh his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in <hi>Math.</hi> 5. <hi>what ſingular thing they doe,</hi> if they
doe but as the Publicans doe? As if hee ſhould
have ſaid: You that will be Chriſtians, muſt be
of a more heavenly temper, and higher ſtraine,
than the moſt men, and the greater part of the
World: You muſt be ſingular, and ſhine as Lights
amid a naughtie and crooked generation. Hence
is it, that Gods children ever were, and ever will
be, <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Wonders, Miracles</hi> and <hi>Monsters,</hi> in
the opinion and cenſure of moſt, amongſt whom
they live; gazing ſtockes, both by reproaches
and afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah,
Chap.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 18.</note> 8. 18.) <hi>I and the children whom the Lord hath
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7160:66"/>
given me, are as ſignes and as wonders in Iſrael, by the
Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth in Mount Sion. I am
become</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) as it were a monſter unto many,</hi>
(or,<note place="margin">Pſal. 71. 7. &amp; 79. 4.</note> to the great men of the World, as ſome ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 7. And in another Pſalme, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
79. 4. <hi>Wee are a reproach to our neighbours, even a
ſcorne and a deriſion unto them that are round about us.</hi>
But eſpecially you may ſee in <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 2. (though
the Booke be Apocryphall) what is the counſell
and conceit of the wicked about the oddeneſſe
and ſingularitie of the Saints: <hi>Let us defraud the
righteous</hi> (ſay the wicked) <hi>for hee is not for our profit,
and hee is, contrarie to our doings; hee checketh us for
offending against the Law, and blameth us as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors
of Diſcipline; hee maketh his boast to have
the knowledge of God, and hee calleth himſelfe the ſonne
of the Lord: Hee is made to reprove our thoughts. It
grieveth us alſo to looke upon him: for his life is not
like other mens, his wayes are of another faſhion; hee
counteth us as bastards, and hee withdraweth himſelfe
from our wayes, as from filthineſſe; hee commendeth
greatly the latter end of the just, and boasteth that
God is his father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, as Gods children and godly men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
more excellent than their neighbours; and
ſingular, in reſpect of their ſanctification and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie:
ſo they are ſcorned and reviled by the
World, and the greater part of men, as odde
fellowes, and ſuch as muſt have wayes by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and a tricke above others. They are poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at, as matter of ſcorne and contempt; they
are ſet up, as markes of ſlander and oppreſſion;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7160:67"/>
and gazed upon, as ſtrange creatures. <hi>Wee are
made</hi> (ſayth <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 9.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. meaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and other of Gods faithfull ſervants) <hi>a
gazing-ſtocke unto the World, and to the Angels,
and to men.</hi> And no marvell though it be ſo:
For, beſides that all prophane and unregenerate
men are naturally ineagered, and inraged with
implacable malice and hatred againſt Gods
Children; they are, in all places, but few in
number; which makes them more noted, and
pointed at.</p>
            <p>That they are but few;<note place="margin">Gods children are but few.</note> beſides many cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
demonſtrative Reaſons out of Scripture;
it may thus plainely appeare: as a good Divine
tells us.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> let there be taken from amongſt us,
all Papiſts, Atheiſts, and ſcorners of godlineſſe,
and Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> let there be removed all notorious
and infamous evill livers; as Swearers, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
Whoremongers, Vſurers, Worldlings, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
proud perſons, prophaners of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
Gameſters, and all the prophane and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
multitude.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> let all thoſe be paſſed over, that are
but onely civill honeſt men, and meddle not with
any profeſſion, or practiſe of holineſſe; without
which, no man muſt ſee God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> ſet aſide all groſſe Hypocrites; who
for advantage, or by-reſpects, are outwardly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
but inwardly corrupt, hollow-hearted, and
abominable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:7160:67"/>
Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> let there be ſorted out and rejected
all carnall Proteſtants, formall Profeſſors, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders,
cold and unzealous Chriſtians; who
falſely thinke, that they may both enjoy the
World, and a good Conſcience too; live plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
on Earth, and yet ſave their ſoules at laſt;
and, that it is not neceſſarie to hold any ſuch
ſtrict courſe of holineſſe, to come to Heaven.
Let all theſe kinde of men, I ſay, (all which in
one meaſure, or other, are in the ſtate of death,
and under the power of Sathan) be ſeparated
and ſhoaled out; and how many doe you thinke
will remaine amongſt us, ſound, ſincere, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and zealous profeſſors, and practiſers of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Truth, the power of Grace, and holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all Gods Commandements? For ſuch
onely are Gods ſervants, and in the ſtate of Grace.
Let a man come into any Towne, Village, Citie,
or Corporation, and let all ſuch men as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, be removed; and how many
ſhould he finde of theſe laſt? They would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
be thinne ſcattered, and like the Grapes
after the gathering of the Vintage, two or three
in the top of the upmoſt boughes, and foure or
five in the high branches. Singularitie then of
ſanctification, is no fruit of Pride, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
marke and neceſſarie ſtate of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie.</p>
            <p>I come now to a third ground,<note place="margin">3 Sathan tempts to Pride, by a diſtaſting of a mans particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling.</note> whence Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
may rayſe a temptation to privie Pride:
When a man is faithfull, and diligent, in the
diſcharge and executions of his civill calling;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7160:68"/>
hee may caſt a conceit into his head, that ſuch
baſe, earthly, and worldly imployment, and ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his time, is diſgracefull and derogatorie to
the providence of God, and his Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
and, that it hinders him in his calling of
Chriſtianitie, and duties of Religion. Whence
may ſollow dangerous effects of ſpirituall Pride;
quite leaving, or neglect, diſcontent or diſtaſte
of his civill calling. And ſo his heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
may bee put quite out of order, and
deceive themſelves, in the very maine point of
making towards Heaven.</p>
            <p>Sathan,<note place="margin">4 From Gods providence.</note> by his ſubtill malice, may worke
out matter and occaſion of ſpirituall Pride,
from the ſpeciall providence of God, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the Chriſtian the beſt and the neereſt way
to Heaven.<note place="margin">Examples in particular.</note> To give example, in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1 When God,<note place="margin">1</note> out of his great wiſedome
and mercie, humbles him with afflictions and
prickes, the ſwelling of his Pride; when hee
cuts and loppes away his vanities, exceſſes, and
ſuperfluities, with ſome viſitation, or other;
and fills him with bitterneſſe in this life, to the
end hee might long for the life to come: Why

corrupt nature a flaſh of ſpirituall Pride, that

of the wicked, he farre more, and rather, deſerves
the fruition and enjoyment of the creatures, and

himſelfe being a true owner, by the right of

which many times come thicke and three-fold

upon him, as faſt and boiſterouſly, as one wave
overtakes another; ſo that he findes one vexation
to be ſtill a ſtep unto another: Sathan then hee
puts in, and ſeeing the ſeaſon advantageous for
his feats, and inſinuations, workes what he can to
make him take on; and out of a proud conceit
of better deſervings, to be wearie of waiting the
Lords leiſure; and out of the anguiſhes and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of his heart, to wiſh and deſire death; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be rid and freed from thoſe croſſes and
calamities, which unworthily haunt and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his innocencie. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> was ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled
with this temptation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. when hee
cryed and ſaid:<note place="margin">Iob 3. 3.</note>

            <p>6 Sometimes,<note place="margin">6</note> when the Chriſtian is croſſed
and diſappointed in his expectation, God wiſely

of his children (though they doe not preſently
ſee, and acknowledge it;) Sathan ſteps in, and by
the ſecret and inſenſible poyſon of privie Pride,
labours to ſuggeſt unto him, that he is prejudiced
and diſgraced; that ſo by his inward fretting, hee
may make it plainely appeare, that hee preferres
his owne particular credit, before the glory of
God. Thus was <hi>Ionas</hi> tempted, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. Feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
deſtruction was denounced by him from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7160:70"/>
God, againſt the Ninivites: They put on ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,

ſtayes his hand, forbeares his Iudgements, which

            </p>
            <p>When hee begins to obſerve,<note place="margin">5 Sathan makes men to pride themſelves in their abilities and gifts.</note> and admire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for ſome ſpeciall acceptation in Chriſtian
companie; for his abilities to pray, conferre, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
temptations, and the Devils depths; to
preſſe an holy preciſeneſſe, and mortifying points,
&amp;c. Oh then, too often a wide gap is opened in
his deceitfull heart, for the Devils wild-fire of
ſpirituall Pride. So that many times, an humble
ſilent ſoule doth quickly out-ſtrip ſuch an one,
doting dangerouſly upon his preſent perfections,
in the ſubſtantialls of Chriſtianitie.</p>
            <p>Thus, and many moe wayes, doth Sathan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by privie Pride, to weaken the power of
Grace, and efficacie of the Word; to ſtaine and
diſgrace the beſt Graces and godlieſt actions; to
grieve the good Spirit, and coole their firſt Love,
even in Gods children; after that, by the helpe of
God, they have ſtruggled through other tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and obtained much ſpirituall peace and

and to preſerve it in the ſweet and peacefull ſtate

than be lifted up with a conceit of his graces, and
ſpirituall endowments.</p>
            <p>When hee begins once proudly and ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedly

In all times, the beſt Chriſtians have ever
beene moſt ſenſible of the weight of their ſinnes,
and corruption of their nature; and from thence,
entertained a lowly conceit of themſelves. Where
there is the greateſt meaſure of ſanctification,
there is ever the greateſt humilitie. If thoſe then

of thoſe graces; which, if we looke for Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

            <p>Let him compare,<note place="margin">4 Compare thy ſelfe with Gods holy Law.</note> and examine, and meaſure

humiliation, repentance, feare, and trembling,
with continuall ſupply in abundance miniſtred
unto him: ſo that there ſhall be no roome left
for any proud and over-weening conceit of any
good thing in him. That elect Veſſell, and great
Apoſtle, after he was regenerate, (for the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
feele no ſuch ſtrife) found ſuch a vaſt and

Church of Rome hath inveſted them; yet to the

his undefiled Law, they appeare to be foule, and
ſpotted; impure, and like a menſtruous clout.
The meaſuring then of our ſelves by the Law and

depth of his infinite goodneſſe and
mercie, ſingled him out to be his ſervant upon
Earth, and a Saint in Heaven. It was onely Gods
free mercie, that before all eternitie, by the great
Decree of his eternall election, marked him out
for Heaven and endleſſe joyes, from amidſt the
huge maſſe of all mankind. It was the ſame, that
after cauſed him to ſend his owne and onely
Sonne, out of his owne Boſome, and height of

hee might redeeme his Soule from the ſnares of
Hell, into which hee was fallen, by <hi>Adams</hi> fall:
which in due time, by the inward, ſpeciall, and
effectuall power of his unſpotted Spirit, called

all cauſe or motive from man, or any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

beene unſpeakably wofull: For he ſhould have
lived in this Vale of Teares, without God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Grace, without Comfort, without Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
in Sinne, in Darkeneſſe, in Prophaneneſſe,
in all Spirituall Miſeries: And after the cloſure
and period of theſe <hi>few and evill dayes,</hi> he ſhould
have beene endleſſely divided and abandoned
from the joyes and comforts of Gods preſence,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7160:73"/>
inchained without all redemption, to deſpaire and
horror, and the hatefull fellowſhip of the Devill
and his Angels: and (that which is the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and upſhot of all helliſh miſerie) hee ſhould
have had the fierce and horrible wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God poured in full meaſure upon his
body and ſoule; which would have fed upon
them, as fire doth upon Pitch and Brimſtone, for
ever and ever. Out of theſe conſiderations, mee
thinkes a man ſhould rather with humilitie and
thankefulneſſe admire and magnifie the mercies
of God, that hee is not alreadie a Fire-brand in
Hell; than any wayes be puffed up with any
worthineſſe in himſelfe, or dote upon his owne
nothingneſſe.</p>
            <p>When a Chriſtian is tempted to ſpirituall
Pride;<note place="margin">6 Conſider the fearfull effects of Pride.</note> let him deepely and thorowly weigh with
himſelfe, what fearefull inconveniences and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts
will enſue, if hee give way to ſuch
temptations: For ſo, many follow, in the courſe
of Gods juſt judgement, upon ſpirituall Vanitie,
and Pride; dullneſſe, and deadneſſe of heart; a
reſtraint of the influence of the Spirit; a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
and leſſening, or a ſlumber and ceſſation
of the operations of grace, a cooling of zeale, and
falling from the firſt Love. Or, when hee ſees us
ſo preſumptuouſly to truſt to our ſtrength, and
ſtay our ſelves with our owne ſtaffe; he may quite
give us over, in ſome great temptation, to ſome
groſſe ſinne; ſo that we may take the foile in the
Conflict. And then, if wee once be over-taken
with the old ſweet ſinne of our unregeneration,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7160:73"/>
or be enſnared with ſome new notorious tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;
wee muſt of neceſſitie, to our great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort,
enter againe the agonies of Soule, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of Conſcience, and horror of Hell; wee
muſt enter combate againe with all the powers of
Darkeneſſe; wee muſt have our regeneration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated;
our new-birth, new-borne; and the
precious bloud of the Sonne of God, as it were,
ſhed for us againe. Wee turne thereby Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
countenance from us, and the hearts
and affections of true Chriſtians: wee put againe
a ſting into our owne Conſciences, and weapons
into the hands of Sathan, to vexe, wound, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
us: wee barre and bereave our ſelves of
Gods gracious protection, of the guard of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
of peace of Conſcience, of joy in the Holy-Ghoſt,
of boldneſſe in our wayes, of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the creatures, and of all the comforts of
godlineſſe. As a man tenders the preſervation
of his Soule, from all theſe ſpirituall miſeries;
let him take heed of entertaining a proud and
over-weening conceit of his owne graces, gifts, or
good actions.</p>
            <p>Let him conſider,<note place="margin">7 The more a man hath, the more he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for.</note> that the more ſpirituall gifts
and graces he hath received from the free mercie
of God, the more will be required at his hands.
Me thinkes, this ſhould coole and allay any ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
conceit, or proud perſwaſion, that may ariſe
in the heart; and not ſuffer a man to play with
them, and dote upon them, or give him any leiſure,
with an over-weening and ſelfe-conceited flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
to gaze upon them, or to applaud and admire
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7160:74"/>
them in himſelfe, as though they were his owne;
but rather, with all vigilancie and ſolicitouſneſſe,
with all care and good Conſcience, to occupie
and imploy them for his Maſters greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>There is no gift or good thing in any man,
either of Nature or Grace, of body or minde, of
wealth or honour, of reputation or authoritie in
the World; but he muſt give ſhortly a ſtrict and
exact account of the uſage and imployment of
it, before the impartiall and uncorrupted Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of Heaven: And the more excellent his gifts
and endowments have beene in any kind, he ſhall
in proportion be anſwerable, and countable for
the more. If the Lord hath enlightened, heated,
and inſpired any one with much ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
with a great meaſure of zeale, with a high
Chriſtian courage, and reſolution; he lookes and
expects for great gaine of glory unto himſelfe,
many ſpoyles and conqueſts over his enemies, a
blazing and exemplarie brightneſſe, in holineſſe
of life; much beautie and luſtre to the Church,
much good and comfort unto Chriſtians: For
much is required of them,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 48.</note> to whom much is

            <p>Let a man then not labour to make himſelfe

            <p>That the holy Word of God may be unto you
the Word of Grace, the ſavour of Life unto Life,
of power unto ſanctification and ſalvation; you
muſt looke carefully and conſcionably unto your

            <p>I am perſwaded, the want and neglect of a due
and profitable preparation, is the cauſe that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
receive no benefit or bleſſing by the Word
of Life; but that the Sermons they heare, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred,
as in a Table of Remembrance, before
God,<note place="margin">For want of preparation, the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes to men,</note> as ſo many witneſſes againſt them, for their

            <p>1 For hence it is,<note place="margin">1 The ſavour of death unto death.</note> that to many it is the ſavour
of death unto death; becauſe, before they come,
they doe not addreſſe and prepare themſelves for
ſo glorious a Preſence, and royall Embaſſage
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7160:75"/>
from the King of Heaven: though they heare it
with their outward eares, yet it hardens their
hearts, makes them inwardly more peeviſh, grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
ſtubborne, rebellious, and refractarie to the
power thereof, and prepares and ripens them for
more heavie vengeance. It is of it ſelfe the Word
of Grace, Salvation, and Life; a bleſſed preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
againſt Sinne and Death, Damnation and
Hell: but by accident, if men doe not reverence
it, tremble at it, and ſubmit themſelves to the
power of it, it is a ſtrong Hammer, and Iron Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to harden their hearts more and more, like an
Anvile, or Adamant; and at length, to breake
them in pieces like a Potters Veſſell. Though in
it ſelfe, it be a ſaving and wholeſome Medicine;
yet men of a rebellious and ſtubborne humour
and temper, turne it into Poyſon.</p>
            <p>2 To ſome,<note place="margin">2 As Seed in the high way ground.</note> this holy Word, by reaſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſſe,
is but as the water ſpilt upon the

Sermon, how they have profited; they are as
wordleſſe, and witleſſe, and indeed as graceleſſe in
repetition, as if they had beene deafe, aſleepe, in a

reverence, or regard of that holy buſineſſe
they goe about; become hearers onely, of forme

be, they may heare, attend, and underſtand what

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7160:75"/>
impreſſion, or ſpirituall reformation, than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie

onely to entertaine the Time, and buſie mens
eares for an Houre; and, not as Chriſt tells
<hi>Paul, To open their eyes, that they might turne from

unto God.</hi>

that they become ſcorners and raylers againſt
the Miniſter, or his Doctrine, or both; at every
Sermon they catch ſomething, that they may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
at, deprave, and calumniate: And ſo, wickedly
and wretchedly oppoſe their diſcourſe, wit, and
ſpirit of contradiction againſt the face of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

and repine (in deed and truth, whatſoever their

zeale, and fervencie, which ſhould be quickened
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7160:76"/>
and inflamed at every Sermon, is dulled and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
with ſenſeleſneſſe and ſatietie: They
doe not ſo tremble, or are caſt downe with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Comminations and denouncements of Gods
Iudgements againſt ſinne, or ſo refreſhed with
the gracious promiſes of Life, and Salvation,
as they ought to be: They doe not enjoy and
reape the thouſandth part of that delight, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and benefit as they well might, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
of the Word, becauſe their hearts are
not purged and prepared: They doe not with
that chearefulneſſe receive, with that ſweetneſſe
taſte and relliſh, with that life and vigour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
the Food of Life: The eye of their minde,
for want of premeditation, doth not ſo clearely
ſee and diſcerne the infinite beautie of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majeſtie repreſented unto them, or that
glorious grace ſhining unto them, in the face
of CHRIST IESVS: Their hand of Faith
doth not with that feeling, and faſtneſſe, lay
hold upon and claſpe about, the rich Treaſures
revealed in the Goſpell. In a word, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
themſelves of much good, bleſſing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and growth in grace, which they might
and ought to have, by hearing of the Word,
for want of due preparing, and diſpoſing the
heart thereto.</p>
            <p>This dutie of Preparation then, though that it
be not much thought upon, or ordinarily practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
yet it is of great neceſſitie and ſpeciall uſe
for all thoſe, which looke for benefit or bleſſing
by the preaching of the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:7160:76"/>
There is no great Affaire,<note place="margin">Preparation requiſite in civill affaires, much more to the hearing of the Word.</note> or of weight and
conſequence, eyther in Nature or Art, in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
buſineſſes and civill Negotiations, or in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

but there is required ſome bethinking preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and prae-diſpoſitions, for the more happie and
ſucceſſefull accompliſhment, execution, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance:
how much more in the affaires of God,
matters of Heaven, buſineſſes of eternitie, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of mens ſoules?</p>
            <p>The Ground muſt be manured and prepared
for the Seed, if wee looke it ſhould fructifie and
proſper: how much more ſhould our dull and

that by the grace of God, and the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying

            <p>The Body muſt be fitted with a Preparative,
and the humours, as it were, gathered unto a head,
if wee deſire the Phyſicke ſhould worke forcibly

Water of Life, and ſpirituall Manna; that ſo
they may more ſeaſonably and ſoundly be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>The Ground muſt be layd, and ſome imperfect

Draughts, Shadowes, and reſemblances premiſed,
before a Picture can be done to the Life, or a full
proportion and lively repreſentation pourtrayed
or preſented to the eye; how much more ought
the ground of our hearts to be fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that by the preaching of the Word, the
Image of Chriſt Ieſus may with a lively and freſh

            <p>Were a man the next day to goe about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that mainely concerned eyther his life, or
livelyhood; the ſtate of his Lands, or danger of
his life: Would not his minde be troubled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand?
Would it not breake his ſleepe the
night before? Would he not be muſing, and
plotting, by what meanes he might worke out
his deliverance, and ſafetie? what behaviour and
carriage might be fitteſt, to winne favour and
grace in ſo weightie an affaire? How much more
ought wee, before wee intrude into the Houſe of
God, where matters of our greateſt and higheſt

everlaſting eſtate in another World? I ſay, how

make our ſoules fitteſt to underſtand and accept
the Covenant of Grace, to receive the Seale of the

royall Inheritance in the Heavens?</p>
            <p>Nay, yet further, even in matters of complement

fit to entertaine the Word of life, and ſalvation;

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Humilitie.</note> wee muſt bring with us an humble

with the winde of vanitie and vaine-glory, of

ſinfull pleaſures, or wicked vanities; which hath
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7160:78"/>
no manner of purpoſe to live and continue in any
one ſinne whatſoever; but is readie and reſolved,
though it be much cumbred with it owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Worlds enticements, and Sathans craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe;
yet to ſerve and pleaſe God, in all the
wayes of his Commandements, and that ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

reſembled by the good ground,<note place="margin">Luke 8. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. But
that is a wicked and ſinfull heart, and not fit to be

            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 Faith.</note> our hearts muſt be ſeaſoned with

heard the Word,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> but <hi>it profited them not, becauſe
it was not mingled with faith in thoſe that heard it,
Heb.</hi> 4. 2. The fearefull threatnings and thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts
of the Law, by Faith receive an edge to
wound, and pierce and ſtrike through our ſoules,
with amazements and trembling. And Faith it
is, that animates and inſpires the promiſes of the
Goſpel with ſuch a ſoveraigne ſweetneſſe, and
powerfull comfort; that they are able, not onely
to rayſe and revive us from the depth and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of remorſe, and feare; but alſo to put us
into a Paradiſe of ſpiituall pleaſures, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Heaven, as it were alreadie. But if the
Word light upon a faithleſſe heart, it dyes, it
does no good.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5 Teachable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> wee muſt bring with us into the Lords
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7160:79"/>
Sanctuarie, teachable and hearing hearts, that will
willingly and readily open themſelves, to receive
the Lord of glory, with whatſoever hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
unto us out of his holy Word.<note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Sacrifice and

            <p>With ſuch hearts as theſe, muſt wee come to
the hearing of the Word, if wee looke that it
ſhould be unto us a Word of power, ſalvation,
and life; and not to be of the number of thoſe,
that offer the ſacrifice of fooles, and yet know not
that they doe evill.</p>
            <p>Many there are certainely, which offer theſe
fooliſh ſacrifices; I meane, hearers, without care
and conſcience: Who, if they come into the
Houſe of God, and vouchſafe their preſence in
the place, and lend their eares to the Preacher for
the time; they thinke themſelves preſently jolly
fellowes, for matters of Religion; and that they
are ſanctified, as it were, by the Worke wrought,
and their onely preſence in that holy place: when
as yet the Word hath had no more power, nor
wrought more alteration upon them, than upon
the Seats where they ſate.</p>
            <p>And that which makes theſe fooles much more
miſerable, and fooliſh, is this; <hi>They know not that
they doe evill:</hi> as it is in the Text. They thinke
their caſe good enough, that they are in the right
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7160:79"/>
courſe of Chriſtianitie; and that no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,

emptied of worldly thoughts, and ſanctified by
heavenly meditation, are fit ſubjects for workes
of Heaven, and divine impreſſions. How much
more ought we to prepare our ſoules, before wee
come into the Sanctuary of the Lord; ſith there,
they are either to be hardned for the Scepter of
deſtruction, and made ready for the flames of
Hell, if wee doe not prepare our ſelves, hearken,

with ſaving grace, and fitted for a Crowne of
Glory; if with reverence, humility, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

them, or to be informed by them, and yet ſeparates
himſelfe from the Lord, and ſets up any Idoll in
his heart, and ſtumbling-blocke of his iniquitie,
before his face; that the Lord will ſet his face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and make him a ſigne and a Proverbe,
and cut him off from the midſt of his people.
Whence wee may well inferre, that it will be very
dangerous for any to come to the hearing of the
Word, without examination of his heart, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any ſuch ſtumbling-blocke of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
in it, or no.</p>
            <p>2 Becauſe that examination of the heart,<note place="margin">The ſecond dutie beſides hearing, is purging of our hearts.</note> to
finde out our corruptions, tends eſpecially to the
cleanſing of it; therefore the ſecond dutie before
the hearing of the Word, is the purgation or
cleanſing of the heart, firſt, from ſinne; which the
Scripture beats much upon, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Lay apart all

                  </gap> of naughtineſſe, and receive
with meekeneſſe the ingrafted Word, &amp;c.</hi> It is not
meerely lay apart, but put away quite and cleane
all filthineſſe: and this is a fit preparative for the
hearing of the Word, as appeares alſo by that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7160:86"/>
place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Wherefore putting away all
malice, all guile and hypocriſie, and envie, and evill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
as new-borne babes deſire the ſincere Milke of the
Word.</hi> And there is the ſame reaſon for any other
ſinne to be put away, that there is for theſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
As it is with the body, when the ſtomack is
foule, and clogged with bad humours, wee ſhould
firſt purge it, before wee feede it; for otherwiſe,
whatſoever we eate, doth but nouriſh and encreaſe
the corrupt humours of the body: So it is with
the ſoule, when it is ſtuffed or clogged with ſinne;
whatſoever is heard in the Miniſtery of the Word,
ſhall be perverted and abuſed by it, and wreſted to
the deſtruction of it.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder therefore, that thoſe that live in
diſſolute or ſcandalous courſes, thoſe that are drunk
on the evening before the Lords day, or ſpend it in
gaming, or company keeping, or have bin acting of
ſome ſoule ſinne, and then repaire unto the Word;
it is no wonder, I ſay, that ſuch goe away never a
whit the better, but rather worſe than they came.
Did you ever know any Salve ſo ſoveraigne, that
would cure a wound that had a ſplint or an arrow-head
remaining in it? Surely, every knowne ſinne
unrepented of, hinders the ſaving operation of the
Word in any mans heart; yea, it will make the
Word the ſavour of death unto a man. See to
this purpoſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the heart muſt alſo be purged from
all worldly cares and thoughts, which may divide
or draw away the heart: <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 22. The cares
of the World doe choake the Seed of the Word:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7160:87"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. The cares of this life doe ſurfet the
heart. Now, as it is with a man in a ſurfet, hee is
not fit to eat, neither can he digeſt any wholeſome
food: ſo, when as the heart is ſurfetted with
worldly cares, it is unfit for any ſpirituall food.
You know how it was with <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> 10. 41.
Ieſus ſaid unto <hi>Martha; Thou art troubled about
many things, but one thing is neceſſarie: Martha</hi> had
a clutter of many worldly matters, that made a
great noiſe in her head, and hindered better mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that ſhe cared not for hearing.</p>
            <p>How then ſhall they profit by the Word, that
doe jumpe out of their worldly buſineſſe, and
from buſying their heads about their callings,
into the Houſe of God, to heare and to performe
the Exerciſes of Religion? Truly, though they
be never ſo diligent in hearing, yet their hearts
will goe after their covetouſneſſe, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 31.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>A third dutie before the hearing of the
Word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thirdly, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, another dutie.</note> 
               <hi>is Prayer; no good thing can be expected
from God, as a bleſſing, if it be not ſought by
prayer,</hi> Deut. 4. 7. <hi>and wee finde it layd downe as
a condition required,</hi> Prov. 2. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. My ſonne,
if thou wilt receive my words, and encline thine eare
to wiſedome, and apply thy heart to understanding;
yea, if thou cryest after knowledge, and liftest up thy
voice for understanding, then ſhalt thou understand the
feare of the Lord, and finde out the knowledge of God.
<hi>The reaſon is,</hi> Verſ. 6. For the Lord giveth wiſedome,
<hi>and</hi> out of his mouth commeth knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
<hi>Becauſe the Lord gives knowledge,
therefore you muſt crie for it unto him. What
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7160:87"/>
is the reaſon that you do pray for your</hi> daily Bread,
<hi>and a bleſſing upon it? Why,</hi> Deut. 8. 3. Man lives
not by Bread onely, &amp;c? <hi>If this be ſo, much more
ought you to pray for a bleſſing upon your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
food.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the particulars: Firſt, you ought to
pray for the Teachers, That they may ſo ſpeake, as
they ought to ſpeake, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3, 4. ſo they are to
pray for the power and peace of the Miniſterie,
2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Secondly, you muſt pray for your
ſelves, that through Gods aſſiſtance you may
heare profitably, and be bleſſed in the hearing:
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 27. No man can receive any thing, except
that it be given him from above. Therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
prayed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that
I may ſee the wonderfull things contained in thy Word.
Iſay</hi> 48. 17. God ſayth, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,
which teacheth thee to profit:</hi> Therefore no profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by the Word, without ſeeking unto the Lord
for it.</p>
            <p>Now the prophaneneſſe of people in this caſe,
is the generall cauſe that our Miniſterie doth no
more good: Few pray at all before they come to
Church, either for the Miniſter, or for themſelves;
nay, few, even when they are in the Church, have
any heart to joyne with the Preacher in the prayer
that he makes before the Sermon: But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the Prophet may be taken up in this caſe,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. <hi>There is none that calleth on thy Name, that
ſtirreth up himſelfe to take hold of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 You muſt be ſure to goe with an open heart,<note place="margin">The fourth dutie, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart.</note>
readie to receive every truth that God ſhall teach
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7160:88"/>
you in this Ordinance. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. it is ſaid of
thoſe noble Beraeans, that they received the Word
with all readineſſe of minde, <hi>i.</hi> readineſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
every truth. And <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 33.
<hi>Wee are all here preſent before God, to heare all things
that are commanded thee of God.</hi> It is well added
(<hi>that are commanded thee of God:</hi>) not what any
Miniſter ſhall teach, be he never ſo good, or ſo
learned; nay, were he an Angell from Heaven,
yet his Doctrine muſt be examined, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. But
when there is ſuch a diſpoſition in us, as to receive
both in judgement and practiſe whatſoever God
ſhall reveale unto us out of his Word; this is a
precious diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>But, alas, the moſt come to heare with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
and fore-ſtalled hearts, they beare a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
grudge, and quarrell, againſt ſome ſtrict
Truth, or other; as, againſt the ſanctification
of the Lords Day, or Family-duties, or ſecret
communion with the Lord, by prayer dayly,
&amp;c. And theſe imaginations ſeeme as ſtrong
Holds, to keepe Chriſt and his Truth out of
their hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. And thus men,
that in their hearing doe limit the Spirit of
God, would (if it lay in their power) <hi>ſay</hi> as
thoſe wicked men, <hi>Iſay</hi> 30. 10. <hi>to the Seers, ſee
not; and to the Prophets, propheſie not right things
unto us; ſpeake unto us ſmooth things:</hi> And thoſe
that ſaid ſo, the Lord calls them deſpiſers of
his Word.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the maine and principall duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the hearing of the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:7160:88"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word.</note> let me proceed briefely to thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are required in the hearing of the Word:
Which wee muſt the rather ſtirre up our ſelves
unto, becauſe wee have naturally uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hearts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 10. and are dull of hearing,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>Now the principall duties in hearing, are five;
which I will briefely ſet downe as may be.</p>
            <p>1 You muſt ſet your ſelves in Gods preſence,<note place="margin">1 To ſet our ſelves in Gods preſence.</note>
whileſt you are hearing of his Word: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
with your ſelves, that it is God that you
have to deale withall in this buſineſſe, and not
man; and that it is Gods Word, and not mans.
It is the great commendation of the Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. that they received the Word
as the Word of God. This was that whereby the
Lord would prepare his people to receive the
Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>God ſpake all theſe words.</hi> And hee
not onely gave the Law, but the whole ſumme of
the Goſpel with his owne voice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Loe
a voice from Heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Sonne,
in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Yea, it is the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that ſpeakes unto you in our Miniſtery, <hi>Luke</hi>
10. 16. So the Lord is preſent in a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
where his Word is preached, to obſerve and
marke how it is received, or delivered; and either
to bleſſe or curſe the hearers, or ſpeakers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
So that of this and ſuch like places, it
may be ſaid as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid of Bethel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 16, 17.
<hi>Surely, the Lord is in this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and, <hi>How dreadfull is
this place? This is no other than the Houſe of God, this
is the Gate of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:7160:89"/>
And truly, this apprehenſion of Gods preſence
in the Aſſemblies of his people, will worke three
things in us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, keepe us in that awfull and reverent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of body and minde that is meet.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it will preſerve our hearts from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and wandering thoughts, which are great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
of hearing; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 113. <hi>I hate vaine
thoughts, but thy Law doe I love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it will make us to receive and obey
that that ſhall be taught us; for ſo God hath
beene wont to prepare his people, to receive his
Word: yea, he ſaid of his people, when they were
thus affected, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 29. <hi>Oh that there were ſuch
an heart in them, to feare me and keepe my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
alwayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the want of this, is that which hinders
abundance of benefit that the Miniſterie of the
Word would otherwiſe doe us: This is the root
of all the miſchiefe the Devill doth to poore
ſoules, in the hearing of the Word; the practice
thereof, is the fountaine of all our good. Many
graceleſſe wretches there are in our Aſſemblies,
like him, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 2. that neither feared God, nor
regarded man; that deſpiſe the Church of God,
yea, contemne the preſence of the holy Angels,
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10.) and of God himſelfe in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
who hath layd ſuch a ſpeciall charge
upon us, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 2. to keepe his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and to
reverence his <hi>Sanctuarie;</hi> and he addes this reaſon,
<hi>I am Iehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The ſecond dutie in hearing,<note place="margin">2 Attention.</note> is diligent
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7160:89"/>
attention to that we heare: as it is ſaid of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 48. <hi>The people were very
attentive to heare him;</hi> or, as it is in the Originall,
they <hi>hanged on him:</hi> as if their eares and mindes
had beene tyed to his tongue; there was ſuch a
dependencie upon him. And that is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
place, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 40. 4. <hi>Sonne of man, behold with
thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and ſet thine
heart upon all that I ſhall ſhew thee.</hi> See what at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is required: Hee bids him ſet his eyes
and his eares, and his heart and all, upon that hee
ſpeakes; and not upon ſome things onely, but
upon all that hee ſhould declare unto him. So
<hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22. <hi>My ſonne attend unto my words,
incline thine eare unto my ſayings, keepe them in the
midst of thine heart, for they are life to thoſe that finde
them: i.</hi> looke as a condemned man will hearken
to the Sentence of the Prince; every word hee
ſpeakes, being life or death: As the ſervants of
<hi>Benhadad,</hi> when they were in their enemies power,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 33. they obſerved diligently whether
any word of comfort would come from him, and
they did haſtily catch it. Thus, with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and attention, ſuch poore condemned
creatures (as wee are) are to heare the Word of
God.</p>
            <p>Now to quicken attention, theſe meanes are
profitable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is good to doe as they did, <hi>Luke</hi>
4. 20. They faſtened their eyes upon Chriſt;
ſo doe ye upon the Miniſter, and ſuffer them
not to wander up and downe: A wandering
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7160:90"/>
eye is alwayes a ſure evidence of a wandering
heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if ye doe not thus, it will be a good
helpe for thoſe that can write, to note the Word,
as <hi>Baruch</hi> wrote from the mouth of <hi>Ieremiah,
Ier.</hi> 36. 4. This holds the minde cloſe to all that
is ſaid. Some object indeed, that it hinders af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in hearing: but though it may doe ſo in
ſome, for the preſent; yet afterwards it will worke
more laſting affections upon the Word.<note place="margin">A Cavea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Onely
they that uſe this helpe-meanes, muſt be carefull
that they doe not preſume upon their Notes ſo,
as to neglect the recalling of what they have
heard, (as many uſe to doe) and ſo loſe all holy
affections, and that impreſſion that the Word
would make upon their hearts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, entreat the Lord to open thy heart,
as he opened <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. Our hearts
are ſhut up quite, and cannot attend unto any
thing that is good, except that the Lord opens
them.</p>
            <p>Obſerve then another cauſe, why the Word is
ſo unfruitfull unto many. Some are like the <hi>deafe
Adders,</hi> that ſtop their eares againſt the voice of
the <hi>Charmer, Pſal.</hi> 58. 4, 5. And ſome ſleepers
there are, that faile in their attention, that the
Devill uſually rocks aſleepe, when they come to
heare; but they that are ſuch, ſhould know, that
their damnation ſleepes not, the Devill ſleepes
not: he comes to the Aſſemblies, to picke up the
good Seed that is ſowne; nay, he comes to picke
up their ſoules indeed: for he cares not ſo much
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7160:90"/>
for the Seed, but he will take your ſelves napping
and your ſoules eſpecially, and carry them to
Hell. Beſides, let them remember what befell
<hi>Eutychus, Act.</hi> 20. 9, 10. he ſlept at a long Sermon,
that laſted till midnight; but he was taken up
dead, falling from the third Loft to the ground:
What ſhall become of ſuch then, that ſleepe in
the day time, at a Sermon of an houre long? And
let them alſo take heed of that <hi>ſpirit of ſlumber,</hi> that
the Lord hath threatned to poure upon the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of the Word, <hi>Iſay</hi> 29. 9, 10. The like might
be ſaid of our gazers and gapers about, and thoſe
that by their talking diſturbe others, and hinder
themſelves: they ſhut their eares, and turne them
away from God; and may juſtly expect, that he
ſhall turne away his eares from them: as it is
threatened, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 13.</p>
            <p>3 You muſt heare the Word with underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and judgement;<note place="margin">3 Heare with underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> 
               <hi>i.</hi> labour to underſtand
what wee heare: And to this end, the Miniſter
muſt have a ſpeciall care to teach plainely, ſo
as he may be underſtood, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8. And Chriſt
calls upon his hearers for this, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 10.
<hi>Heare, and understand:</hi> How ſhould we elſe profit
by that we heare? <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>Vnderstandest thou
what thou readest</hi> (ſaith <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch:)
ſo ſay thou to thine owne heart; Vnderſtandeſt
thou what thou heareſt?</p>
            <p>Now the meanes to underſtand the Word,
are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, come to the Word, with a willing minde
to learne: you know the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. though
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7160:91"/>
he underſtood not what he read, yet becauſe he
had a minde to learne, how the Lord provided for
him, and what a comfortable ſucceſſe <hi>Philips</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
had with him. Men love to teach willing
ſchollers; ſo doth God, when we come with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and readie mindes to be taught.</p>
            <p>Secondly, exerciſe your ſelves in the truth of
God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. laſt; you muſt by continuall uſe, get
your ſences exerciſed to diſcerne both good and
evill: but eſpecially, be well acquainted with the
principles and grounds of Catechiſme; it is the
want of this, that makes men that they underſtand
not what is preached: They that are not firſt well
nouriſhed with Milke, will not be fit to receive and
digeſt ſtronger meat: if the foundation be not
well layd, it is in vaine to build.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, walke according to Light; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.
10. <hi>A good underſtanding have all they, that doe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements:</hi>
Then, if thou wouldeſt get a good
underſtanding, and know the myſterie of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
walke according to knowledge, imploy that
little knowledge thou haſt well, and then there is
a promiſe to give thee more.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, be diligent in inſtructing and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
thy family: If thou art ſet over others, a
little knowledge will encreaſe greatly, by this
meanes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 17, 19. the Lord ſaid; <hi>Shall I
hide any thing from Abraham? No:</hi> And hee gives
this reaſon; <hi>I know him, that he will command his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and his houſehold after him, and they ſhall keepe the
way of the Lord.</hi> If you teach your families, God
will teach you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:7160:91"/>
Well; there are a ſort of doltiſh hearers, that
will heare, and ſeeme to be very attentive, from
yeeres end to yeeres end, and be never a whit the
wiſer, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 7. The heavie judgement of God
is upon many of them, that is mentioned, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.
14. And in them is fulfilled the Propheſie of <hi>Iſay;
By hearing ye ſhall heare, and ſhall not understand;</hi>
and that, <hi>I-ſay</hi> 27. 11. <hi>It is a people of no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
therefore he that made them, ſhall not ſave
them; and he that formed them, ſhall ſhew them no
favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 You muſt heare the Word with affection,<note place="margin">4 Heare with affection.</note>
and delight. It is ſaid of Gods people in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, that they heard the Word gladly;
and of Chriſts hearers, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 37. <hi>they heard
him gladly:</hi> And it is noted for a great ſigne of
grace, to heare the Word gladly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 162.
<hi>I rejoyce at thy Word, as one that findeth great ſpoyles.
David</hi> had beene a ſouldier; and ye know, that
they that have lyen at the ſiege of a Citie a long
time, and at the laſt take it, will rejoyce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
in the ſpoyle of it: therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces
in the Word, as they that doe divide the
ſpoyles. And truly, whereas common people
complaine of the badneſſe of their memories;
this would be a marvellous helpe to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
if they would heare with delight: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>David</hi> ſayth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 16. <hi>I will delight
my ſelfe in thy Statutes, I will not forget thy Word.</hi>
This delight he meanes will ſtrengthen our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories.</p>
            <p>Now contrarie to this, are a great number,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7160:92"/>
that heare without all delight, and account it
a great wearineſſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. and thoſe the
dulleſt houres, that they ſpend in hearing. Well,
the Lord hath threatned, that the Word ſhall
never doe us good, unleſſe that wee attend to it
with love and delight, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they received not the love of the Truth, that
they might be ſaved; therefore God ſhall ſend them
ſtrong deluſions, to beleeve Lyes.</hi> A fearefull threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
much to be conſidered in theſe dayes:
For this is the reaſon, that Popiſh trumperies
and helliſh deluſions have ſuch entertainment,
becauſe God in his juſt judgement, gives up thoſe
to ſuch ſtrong deluſions, that love not the ſtrict
Truth of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>5 You muſt heare the Word,<note place="margin">5 Heare with application.</note> with applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it to your owne hearts, and lives; apply
every truth to your ſelves, for your owne uſe and
comfort, and terror and inſtruction: as it is <hi>Iob</hi> 5.
laſt; <hi>Heare this, and know it for thy ſelfe;</hi> carry this
truth home to thine owne heart: And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is no truth of God taught out
of his Word, but it concernes every one of
Gods people, and was intended for our uſe;
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Whatſoever is written, is written for our
learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is no truth can be taught, to
doe us good, unleſſe that wee apply it: as no
Plaiſter can doe the Patient good, unleſſe it be
applyed; no meat is able to doe us any good,
be it dreſſed never ſo curiouſly, unleſſe it be eaten
and digeſted. This compariſon is applyed by the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7160:92"/>
Prophet to this purpoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. <hi>Hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
unto me, and eate ye that which is good:</hi> unleſſe
we eate it, it will doe us no good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the faithfull have been wont to apply
all to themſelves; as every member of the body
drawes nouriſhment from the ſtomacke, to make
it his owne: to which the Apoſtle alludes, <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 16. So the Diſciples of our Saviour did,
<hi>Math.</hi> 26. 21, 22. When our Saviour had ſaid,
that one of them ſhould betray him, they were
exceeding ſorrowfull, and began every one of
them to ſay unto him; <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely, the want of this application, is one
great cauſe that the Word profits not, becauſe
they beleeve it not, nor apply the Word unto
themſelves: <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>The Word preached did not
profit them, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in them
that heard it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now one principall worke of faith, is to apply
thoſe things that are delivered in the Word: But
this, the moſt hearers doe exceedingly faile in;
either not applying, or miſ-applying of the truth;
ſhifting off all upon others, and taking little or
nothing to themſelves. As wee have a notable
example of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> compared with <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 1. In the former place, the Apoſtle ſpeakes of
ſome, that knowing the judgement of God, That
thoſe that doe ſuch things, are worthy of death;
yet not onely doe ſuch things, but take pleaſure
in thoſe that doe them: yet in the beginning of
the next Chapter, you find the ſame men judging
and condemning of others; yet thinking and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7160:93"/>
perſwading themſelves, that they (being guiltie
of the ſame ſinnes) ſhall eſcape the judgement
of God. Why? but becauſe they apply not to
themſelves, but miſ-apply to others the things
they heare.</p>
            <p>Many ſuch hearers there are in theſe dayes,
which are very cunning in ſhifting off the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of God againſt their owne Drunkenneſſe,
and Whoredome, and Swearing, &amp;c. yet very apt
to pinne the ſame Word upon others. Well,
theſe are not wiſe for themſelves, and all their
hearing ſhall doe them no good. Thus much of
the duties required in hearing.</p>
            <p>Now follow thoſe duties that are required after
hearing.<note place="margin">3 The duties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing.</note> And theſe are chiefely thus.</p>
            <p>1 Wee muſt be very carefull to remember
and keepe that which wee have heard,<note place="margin">1 We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 4.
<hi>My ſonne, let thine heart retaine my words:</hi> and,
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Keepe them in the midst of thine heart.</hi>
As a man that hath a Iewell, will be carefull to
locke it up in the ſafeſt Cheſt hee hath, leſt it
ſhould be ſtolne away: Which is the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the Wiſe-man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 20, 21. So
<hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 2. 51. <hi>kept all the ſayings in her heart:</hi>
and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 11. hid the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in his heart; and hee gives the reaſon,
That hee <hi>might not ſinne against the Lord.</hi> And
the truth is, that as meat that is eaten, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
not in the ſtomacke, it will never doe
us good: ſo the beſt ſpirituall food that can
be, except it be retained by us, will not profit
us: <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. <hi>The good Ground are they, which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7160:93"/>
with an honest and good heart having heard the Word,
keepe it, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many there are, that are very careleſſe of this
dutie: They thinke they have diſcharged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
abundantly, if they heare the whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
attentively; as though there were nothing
more required at their hands: Like our Saviours
hearers, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 22. <hi>When they heard him, they
marvelled, and left him, and went their way:</hi> but wee
never heare more of them. So many heare deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
and with open and greedie eares: but, as
wee ſay, it goes in at one eare, and out at another;
it ſtayes not for any after-uſe, but a little preſent
admiration. Others heare, and the Word ſmites
them a little on their Conſciences, and wounds;
and one would thinke, ſome good thing would
be wrought upon them: but they goe away, and
the motion dyes. They are as men that are Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
whileſt the Word humbles them, and
makes their Conſciences to wamble within
them; but they are as whole as a Fiſh, when
as they are once landed at the Church doore:
Or like unto Mettals, which are ſoft and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
whileſt they are in the fire; ſo theſe are
in the hearing: but ſhortly they looſe all the
efficacie of the Word, and become harder than
before.</p>
            <p>Well, let us in the feare of God, hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to the words of the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1.
That <hi>wee ought to give the more earnest heed to the
things that wee have heard, lest at any time wee ſhould
let them ſlip,</hi> or runne out (like riven Veſſels:)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7160:94"/>
Why; what is the danger? <hi>How ſhall wee eſcape, if
wee neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Wee muſt meditate and ſeriouſly thinke
of that that wee have heard;<note place="margin">2 The ſecond dutie, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that is more than
remembring. There is a great deale of difference
betwixt the poſſeſſing of goods, and the uſing
and imploying of them for our benefit; betwixt
the laying up of garments in our Wardrobes, and
the wearing of them upon our backes, to keepe us
warme: this latter is done by meditation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.
22, 23. <hi>My ſonne, binde the Commandements conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
upon thy heart, and tie them about thy necke:</hi>
It is a phraſe of ſpeech borrowed from garments
that are bound about the body; for meditation
bindes the Word cloſe to the heart. It is ſaid of
<hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 2. 19. that <hi>ſhee pondered</hi> the words of
the Angel <hi>in her heart:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was frequent
in this dutie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 15. <hi>I will meditate in thy
Precepts</hi> (ſaith he:) And it was <hi>Pauls</hi> advice to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Meditate upon theſe things,
give thy ſelfe wholly to them, that thy profiting may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, this is the way to make men profit by the
Word of God; and that ſo evidently, that all
may take notice of it, this is one great benefit of
the Word meditated upon, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Thou ſhalt
meditate in the Booke of the Law day and night:</hi> To
what end? <hi>That thou mayest obſerve to doe according
to all that is written therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this courſe will argue unfained love
unto the Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>Oh how I love thy Law,
it is my meditation all the day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:7160:94"/>
Thirdly, this will greatly encreaſe our comfort
in the Word, and cauſe us to feele much more
ſweetneſſe in it; even as the chewing of our meat
makes us to taſte much more ſweetneſſe in it.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 15, 16. he ſaith; <hi>I will meditate on thy
Precepts, and have reſpect unto thy wayes, I will delight
my ſelfe in thy Statutes:</hi> Meditation ever brings
with it delight.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this will greatly encreaſe our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 99. <hi>I have more understanding
than my teachers:</hi> Why? becauſe <hi>thy testimonies
are my meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this be required after hearing; how is
it poſſible that they ſhould profit by the Word,
that never ſcarcely thinke of it afterwards? It is
noted of the Diſciples, that though they had
ſeene Chriſts mightie power in the miracle of the
<hi>Loaves;</hi> yet becauſe they conſidered not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
their hearts were hardened: <hi>i.</hi> becauſe they
did not meditate upon it, they were never the
better for it. And thus it uſually ſpeedes with
thoſe that are careleſſe in the performing of this
dutie.</p>
            <p>3 Wee muſt conferre of that wee have heard,<note place="margin">3 The third duty after hearing, Conference and Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
and repeat it amongſt our ſelves, and examine the
Scriptures about the truth of that that is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
I joyne them all together; for ſo they may
well be, in the practice of them. For conference,
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 172. <hi>My tongue ſhall ſpeake
of thy Word, for all thy Commandements are righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
This was ordinarily practiſed by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of our Saviour Chriſt, when he had taught
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7160:95"/>
how hardly rich men ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 26.
<hi>They were astoniſhed out of meaſure, and ſaid amongst
themſelves, Who then can be ſaved?</hi> So they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
about another Sermon of our Saviour,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Now repetition of Sermons is eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them that have families, to repeat the
Word unto them: <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 18, 19. <hi>You ſhall lay
up theſe my words in your hearts, and you ſhall teach
them your children; ſpeaking of them when thou ſitteſt
in thy houſe:</hi> yea, it is ſaid to be the chiefeſt thing
that the Lord had reſpect unto, in giving us his
Word, and the knowledge thereof, that we might
inſtruct our families in it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Gather ye
my people together, and I will make them heare my words,
that they may learne to feare me, and may teach their
children.</hi> And this, if it were practiſed carefully,
would both make children and ſervants more
carefull to heare and to attend unto the publike
Miniſtery; and better our memories, that wee
may be much better able to retaine that which
we heare: and it will alſo worke an inward fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in us and our children, of that which we have
heard. Therefore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. it is called the
whetting of them upon our children; repetition
doth ſet an edge upon their dulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Yea further, for the ſearching and examining
of the Scriptures, we are commanded, 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5.
21. to <hi>try all things,</hi> and <hi>to hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
And the example of thoſe noble Beraeans is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto us, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11, 12. that ſearched
the Scriptures dayly, concerning thoſe things
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7160:95"/>
that were delivered by <hi>Paul; Therefore many of them
beleeved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is a grievous neglect, that people
in theſe dayes are guilty of; that neither conferre
concerning the Word, they are aſhamed of it,
and (which is a fearefull reproach unto them) <hi>the
Word of God is a reproach unto them, Ier.</hi> 6. 10. nor
yet repeat Sermons in their families; they are
like <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> 10. 41. troubled about ſo many
worldly occaſions: nor yet examine and ſearch
the Scriptures: And therefore are eaſily carried
about with every winde of Doctrine, and never
eſtabliſhed and ſetled in the Truth.</p>
            <p>4 Wee are to put in practiſe whatſoever wee
heare,<note place="margin">4 A fourth duty, Obedience.</note> till that our hearts and lives are quite chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by it: <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and
not hearers onely, deceiving your owne ſoules: i.</hi> they
cozen themſelves by falſe reaſonings and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
or by ſophiſticall Syllogiſmes, reaſoning
after this or the like manner.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>He that heares the Word, is a good Christian.</l>
               <l>But I heare the Word, &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Or thus:</l>
               <l>He that heares not, ſhall be damned.</l>
               <l>But I heare the Word:</l>
               <l>Therefore I ſhall be ſaved.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But how doth this follow? For though the
neglect or contempt of the Word is ſufficient to
condemne a man, yet the hearing of the Word is
not ſufficient to ſave a man.</p>
            <p>Well, obedience is the end of hearing, <hi>Deut.</hi>
5. 1. <hi>Heare, O Iſrael, the Statutes which I ſpeake in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7160:96"/>
your eares this day, that ye may learne them, and keepe
them, and doe them.</hi> The like ye finde, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 25.
Yea, obedience to the Word muſt be ſpeedie,
without any delayes, or procraſtinations; as it is
ſaid of the Coloſſians, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. that the Goſpel
brought forth fruit in them, from the very day
they heard it, and knew the grace of God in truth.
And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> reſolved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 60.
<hi>I made hast, and prolonged not the time to keepe thy
Commandements.</hi> And this is a ſingular frame of
heart; becauſe the putting of the Word in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
immediately, is a great advantage to the
hearer: ſeeing then, the affections of the heart are
quicke, and lively; which with delayes dye, and
decay very ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>Now, alas, for the wonderfull paucitie of ſuch
obedient hearers; for very few doe practiſe any
thing they heare, leave any ſinne, or doe any dutie:
and therefore they muſt needs prove like the <hi>Houſe
built on the Sand;</hi> when the time of tryall ſhall
come, they muſt needs fall, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 27. Againe,
there are many that in hearing have good motions
and purpoſes; but they are like the ſluggard, that
ſaid,<note place="margin">Prov. 24. 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>Yet a little ſlumber, yet a little ſleepe;</hi> ſo, becauſe
they delay, they vaniſh and come to nothing: of
whom, in reſpect of their ſpirituall povertie,
it may be ſaid which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes;
<hi>His povertie ſhall come as one that
travelleth,</hi> and <hi>his want as
an armed man.</hi>

<hi>And the viſion of all</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>is become
unto you as the words of a Booke that is ſealed, &amp;c.</hi> So
may I juſtly ſay: All the viſions, revelations, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries

of all the right diſcoverie of their ſinnes, and the
ſound denunciation of Gods Iudgement, calling
it by the name of a Burthen; the Lord chargeth
them moſt ſeverely, that they ſhould not uſe that

how that they had perverted and abuſed the holy
Word of the ever-living God, the Lord of Hoaſts:
and withall directs them, what phraſe of ſpeech

            </p>
            <p>Here is a notable place, to affright all thoſe
that are unworthie partakers of the Miniſterie.
For the underſtanding whereof, take notice of
theſe five points.</p>
            <p>1 It is as if they ſhould ſay; Here I have
gone a long journey, and have contracted duſt
and ſand by my travell, and taken a great deale
of paines; and loe, here I ſhake off this duſt, in
witneſſe, that you had Chriſt offered you, and you
would not accept him.</p>
            <p>2 To intimate unto them; I care not for
any of you, or yours, but onely I ſeeke the good
of your ſoules, I reſpect not ſo much as the
duſt; I prize more the converſion of any of
your ſoules, than all yours: and this duſt ſhall
witneſſe it.</p>
            <p>3 They ſhooke off the duſt, as a witneſſe:
I will have nothing to doe with this Citie; for
I know, the Plagues and Iudgements of God will
ſeize on this place, as it was with Sodome and
Gomorrah; I will have no communion and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
with theſe wicked people.</p>
            <p>4 They did ſhake off the duſt, to intimate
that deſtruction ſhould come upon them. For
it is ſaid, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 1. That they ſhould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
away as the duſt: As that is ſhaken with
the winde, ſo ſhall they be with the wrath of
God.</p>

5 In teſtimonie and witneſſe againſt them:
This very duſt ſhall be witneſſe againſt them.
Doe you thinke then, that their Sermons and
Catechiſing ſhall not? If the duſt that they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by their paines, will be witneſſe; what will
all their Sermons, and praying, and ſuch paines
be? Now this ſinne of deſpiſing the Word, is a
ſinne above that of Sodome, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Verily, it
ſhall be more eaſie for Sodome and Gomorrah, in the Day
of Iudgement, than for that Citie.</hi>

and to trouble them more. Iuſt ſo it is with
many prophane wretches, which lye drowned
in ſinne, and chained in Sathans fetters: If a

Word, to ſave them from ſinking into Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to free them from the Snares of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Thus you have ſeene the ſixe Curſes, and the

            <p>3 It is called the <hi>Word of Life, Phil.</hi> 2. 16. All

you with ornaments and parts, it leaves your

19. Let the Sea runne nothing but Gold, and let
Heaven and Earth be turned into Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

and habit, and ſo enriched themſelves with
heavenly ſtore, that they were able, as occaſion was
offered, to <hi>bring forth out of their Treaſure things new
and old;</hi> whereupon they were enabled to preach
ſometimes upon ſhort warning: So <hi>Baſil</hi> preached
his two Sermons upon the ſixe dayes worke, when
he had but that morning for meditation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7160:107"/>
without any premeditation; ſo it ſeemes
he preached his ſecond Sermon.<note place="margin">De Baptiſmo reſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente D. D. Donne.</note> And ſo did <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
his Sermon, upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. It ſeemes there, his
Brother <hi>Severus</hi> failing to come, he preached him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
And I have told you heretofore of a Sermon
which he made upon a ſudden,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> ad fratres in Eremo, Serm. 33.</note> occaſioned by an
heavie accident. And theſe Sermons were ſuch,
that they have bin thought worthy by the Church
from time to time, to be conveyed and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to poſterity. For in all my diſcourſe, I am ſo
farre from giving any allowance to idle, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
or any way unſubſtantiall Preaching; that I
hold it a very irkſome, and loathſome, and wicked
thing, lyable to that heavie Curſe; <hi>Curſed is he that
doth the worke of the Lord negligently.</hi> But let a man
be well grounded before he begin, be godly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ply faithfully and painefully his Miniſteriall
charge, <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon;</hi> and it is incredible
to what he may attaine in the Point I purſue, by
his much exerciſe, and Gods bleſſing upon it.</p>
            <p>But yet ſome ſay,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That a man cannot preach well, under a
quarter of a yeeres proviſion. See the truth hereof,
in the fore-going Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That often Preaching will make it
too cheape, and contemptible; which to affirme,
is a baſe and carnall wrangling, and confuted by
the practice of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That Reading is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Preaching.</p>
            <p>Wee doe not denie, but that the Word read, is
the rule of holineſſe, may convert, the Spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7160:108"/>
companying his Ordinance; and therefore is to
have place, and due reſpect in the Congregation:
but wee will not equall it to Preaching. If Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
were more excellent, and of greater force to
convert, than Preaching; why are not the people
converted, that have a Reader? To what end then
ſerve Schooles of the Prophets? Wherefore
ſhould men ſtudie the knowledge of Tongues,
and Arts, to divide the Word aright, and to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to every mans preſent neceſſities? And why
ſhould Sathan rage more againſt Preachers, than
Readers; except the Word powerfully delivered
did not the more batter and beat downe his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
Beſides, why did not Chriſt ſend out his
Apoſtles with this charge, <hi>Goe, readè;</hi> but, <hi>Goe,
preach to all Nations?</hi> Wherefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a <hi>Woe</hi> to them that <hi>preach</hi> not the Goſpel?
And why did hee not charge his ſonne <hi>Timothy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, to <hi>reade in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but may ſome ſay, The ancient Fathers
were extraordinarie men, and therefore no Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes
for our Preaching, &amp;c. They were glorious
Lights, and wee but Glow-wormes; they were
Cedars, wee but Shrubs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let them be what they were,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I as much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and reſpect them, as any man alive, if wee
take truth and diſcretion with us. And therefore
at this time, I will ſuppoſe (I ſay ſo, becauſe I
doubt not, but our Age hath brought forth as
worthy Divines, if not worthier, as any of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers;) I ſay, I will ſuppoſe them to be
as it were Gyants, and wee Dwarfes: Yet ſet a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7160:108"/>
Dwarfe upon a Gyants ſhoulders, and hee will ſee
further, and ſo might certainely wee, but for
Slouth, Idleneſſe, Worldlineſſe, Ambition, and
other ſuch baſe and vile degenerations of theſe
later Times.</p>
            <p>It may be further objected,<note place="margin">Object.</note> That there was
more neceſſity of the Fathers frequent Preaching,
eſpecially in thoſe Primitive Times, for more
plentifull publiſhing and propagation of the
Goſpel, &amp;c. and ſuppreſſing Hereſies, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Paſſingly weake,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and untrue. There is farre
more need of much Preaching now, than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times. For wee live in the <hi>last dayes,</hi> wherein
thoſe <hi>perillous times</hi> are come upon us, which <hi>Paul</hi>
fore-tells 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and wherein <hi>iniquitie
abounds, and the love of many waxeth cold, &amp;c. Math.</hi>
24. 12. And at this day wee oppoſe the <hi>Hydra</hi> of
all Hereſies, Poperie; which oppoſeth even the
whole Body of Chriſtianitie. Againe, their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
are againſt Drunkenneſſe, Pride, Swearing,
Luxury, Covetouſneſſe, love of the World, Vſury,
painted Faces, falſe Haire, Anger, Envie, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. All which ſinnes, and many more, reigne
and rage at this day with more hainouſneſſe, and
an higher hand, than heretofore.</p>
            <p>2 A ſecond meanes whereby the Word may
dwell plentifully in us,<note place="margin">2</note> is, by a conſtant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable

Chriſt bids the Iewes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Search the

thoſe things were ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 7,

motives, to make him ſuſpect himſelfe of former
halting and hollow-heartedneſſe in the wayes of

               <hi>he will never take away his innocencie

Husband? <hi>Abigail,</hi> a Wife, and precious woman,

labours for a reſolution, and perſwaſion in his

before which hee ſhall hereafter be arraigned;
no Treaſurie of Plagues, and Woes in Hell, with
which he ſhall hereafter be everlaſtingly fettered
and enchained.</p>

and apprehenſions of a ſacred and infinite

of the moſt deſperate and damned miſcreant;
but that the terrors of the laſt Iudgement, and
plagues of Hell, doe eftſoones vexe and bite
his Conſcience with reſtleſſe remorſe and ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
Why then, in a ſecond place, that hee
may procure ſome eaſe and quiet to his wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſenſuall pleaſures, hee labours might and

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7160:119"/>
to make his heart like the nether-Milſtone, with
his owne Soule-murthering hand to put a hot

impreſſions of a God-head, yet at the leaſt hee
may extinguiſh and baniſh out of his heart all
feare of that God, of his Iudgement-Seat, and

from the terrors of the Iudgement to come. In

reare up Towers of Treaſon and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

<hi>Let him make ſpeed, let him hasten his worke,
that wee may ſee it; and let the counſell of the holy
One of Iſrael draw neere, and come, that wee may

but that hee is cruſhed and confounded with
the majeſtie and terror thereof: Why then, in
a third place, hee faſtens the fangs of his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and wrangling wit, and the furie of his
prophane Atheiſme, upon his true and holy
Word: And that,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:7160:119"/>
Firſt, Either by entertaining or harbouring a
reprobate and blaſphemous conceit, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Word of God is but a politike invention,
and device of State, to keepe men in order, and
moderation; to maintaine Order and peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in Cities and Societies; and to preſerve
the World, and mankinde, from wildneſſe and
Barbariſme.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">See my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of true happineſſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 58.</note> Or by proportioning his carnall
conceit of Gods pure and undefiled Law, to that
which hee holds of the Decrees and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men.</p>
            <p>And if it be either ſo, or ſo, it is well enough;
hee can, in the meane time, therewith ſtill the
cryes of his Conſcience, and ſtop the mouth of
that Worme that never dies, that it gnaw not too
eagerly, and fiercely, to the diſ-ſweetning of his
carnall contentments, and the making of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
pleaſures more unpleaſant.</p>
            <p>Now, would it not vexe a man, to have the
meat pulled out of his mouth, his chayne from
his necke, his clothes from his backe, his limbes
from his body, his right arme from his ſhoulder,
his eyes out of his head? So it is with every
unregenerate man, and ſuch is his torture, when
that two-edged Sword, the Word of God, ſtrikes
at his ſweet ſinne, and ſenſuall pleaſures: And
therefore no marvell, though hee ſtrive and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
ſhift and ſhield himſelfe, by any meanes.
Nay, the Luſts of the unregenerate man, are his
very life. For, as every godly man liveth a double
life; one of Grace, by the ſanctifying power of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7160:120"/>
the Spirit; another, of Nature: So every wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man hath a double life; one, of Nature;
and another, of corruption, by the curſed influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Hell.</p>
            <p>Nay, the ſenſuall delights of the ſinfull man
are dearer unto him than his life. Hence it is,
(as wee may obſerve by experience) that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

makes an end of himſelfe. That the Wanton,
becauſe hee is rejected, and diſcarded from the
object of his luſtfull pleaſures, findes no pleaſure
in life; but cuts off himſelfe, by a violent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
death. That <hi>Ahitophel</hi> being diſgraced,
and over-topt in a point of Policie, (the crowne
and pride of his worldly happineſſe) put his
houſehold in order, and hanged himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Nay, and yet further, the prophane man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
the ſenſuall pleaſures of his heart, before
the loſſe of his immortall Soule. For, how oft
may wee ſee the honour of God, and everlaſting
bleſſedneſſe, put as it were in the one Scale of
the Ballance, and a little tranſitorie Pleaſure in
the other? And in this caſe, the unſanctified
man ſuffering one ſweet ſinne or other to weigh
downe the exceeding weight of heavenly bliſſe,
the unvaluable treaſure of a good Conſcience,
the infinite glory of God, and the ſalvation of his
owne deare Soule, in that great Day.</p>
            <p>This groweth out of our corrupt nature: For
wee have all, even in the beſt of us, the ſource and
ſeeds of all ſinne. If the Lord ſhould leave and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7160:120"/>
abandon us, to the full ſwing and ſway of our
owne corruption, and not either bridle us by his

Spirit; wee might every one of us become
as bad as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata, who did maliciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
abjure Chriſt; and as <hi>Iudas,</hi> who did perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
betray him. Naturally wee would wallow
in ſinne, without checke of Conſcience, or
controlment by the terror of the Iudgement to
come.</p>
            <p>4 But if hee cannot arme himſelfe againſt
the terrors of God,<note place="margin">4</note> and truth of his Word; but
that he muſt needs acknowledge the one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the other: Why then, in a fourth place,
with much ſpight and malice, he flyes in the face
of Gods Miniſters, Embaſſadours, which are his
tormentors before his time: And that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Either againſt his Preaching, or againſt
his Perſon: as, too obſcure, or too plaine; too
cold, or too boiſterous; too particular, too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall,
too preciſe, too imperious; too tart, and
terrible; too full of Iudgement; tending to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
againſt the State, or the like. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he labours, not onely with his owne heart, to
breed within himſelfe a diſtaſte and diſconceit
of it; but alſo puts to his helping hand, to ſtay
and ſtop the free courſe and current of it from
others. He cannot abide to have his ſweet ſinne
ſtrucke at ſtill, and ſtill to have his Conſcience
grated upon, by the Miniſterie of the Word;
and therefore he does what he can, to abandon
and aboliſh it. When <hi>Ieremies</hi> Sermon, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7160:121"/>
               <hi>Gods Iudgement againſt Iudah and Iſrael,
were brought unto the King,</hi> Ier. 36. 23. Iehudi
had not read past three or foure ſides before him, but
the King ſtamped and raged, hee preſently tooke the
Roule, and cut it with a Pen-knife, and cast it into the
fire that was on the Hearth, untill all the Roule was
conſumed in the fire, that was on the Hearth. <hi>In the</hi>
38. <hi>of</hi> Ieremie, <hi>when the Princes and Courtiers
were nettled and ſtung with the downe-right dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and holy ſeveritie of</hi> Ieremies <hi>Preaching;
they preſently ranne unto the King, and traduced
the bleſſed Prophet, to be a tranſgreſſor of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and an enemie to the State.</hi> Therefore the
Princes ſaid unto the King: Wee beſeech you, let this
man be put to death; for thus he weakeneth the hands
of the men of Warre that remaine in this Citie, and
the hands of all the people, in ſpeaking ſuch words unto
them: For this man ſeeketh not the wealth of this
people, but the hurt. <hi>And there you ſee what was
the iſſue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Prophaneneſſe and Policie doth ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete
the Doctrine of Life, and powerfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the word, to be the Source and
Seeds of Faction and Sedition; to be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with the civill State, and the very cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat
of Kingdomes and States imperiall. <hi>Paul,</hi>
as wee may ſee in the 24. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
dealing, was nick-named a <hi>Seditioner,</hi> and a
<hi>troubler of the State. Certainely</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullus) wee
have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover
of Sedition among all the Iewes throughout the World,
and a chiefe maintainer of the Sect of the Nazarites.</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:7160:121"/>
Thus the Word of Life, and newes of ſalvation
from Heaven, is many times charged with Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
Sedition, and Hereſie. But that which by the
conſtruction of carnall conceits, may be tearmed
Hereſie, Factious, and Preciſe, is the very right
way to Heaven. <hi>I confeſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that after
the way (which they call Hereſie) ſo worſhip I the God
of my Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> So may many good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and godly Miniſters, ſay in theſe Times to
the men of this World; After the way, which
you call Preciſeneſſe, Singularitie, and Faction,
doe wee truly ſerve the living God, and ſave our
ſoules.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Or if the authoritie and power of
his Preaching doth ſo aſtoniſh and confound
him, that hee hath no heart to meddle that way,
or oppoſe againſt it; yet at leaſt, rather than not
be malicious, hee will diſcharge his furie againſt
his perſon.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that a faithfull and conſcionable
Miniſter commonly, whereſoever hee lives, is an
eminent marke whereat Prophaneneſſe and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
Malice and Crueltie, Hell and the World,
diſcharge the utmoſt of their rage and poyſon.
Hee above all others, is ſure to be wrongfully
loaden with ſlanders, diſgraces, lying imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all manner of foule indignities; and
many times by the baſer ſort, which is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.
If hee be but halfe ſo honeſtly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
in providing for his family, as the carnall
worldling is curſedly carking, hee is covetous:
If powerfull in his Preaching, hee is imperious:
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7160:122"/>
If hee oppoſe againſt the ſinnes of the Time, hee
is factious: If hee be faithfull in his Miniſterie,
hee is too preciſe, and plaine: If hee comes home
to mens Conſciences, hee is too particular, and
undiſcreet. In a word, if hee were <hi>Paul,</hi> hee
ſhould be <hi>a pestilent fellow;</hi> if CHRIST IESVS,
bleſſed for ever (a horrible thing!) hee ſhould
be <hi>Belzebub:</hi> For ſo that glorious Lord, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Servant, was nick-named and branded by the
prophane World.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the generation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and wicked Crue doe ever furiouſly band
themſelves together, to tranſplant and root out
a conſcionable Miniſter, whenſoever God brings
him amongſt them. Like an unquiet and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Sea, they continually foame out ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſpeeches, filthie and ſhamefull ſlanders, and
<hi>lay things unto his charge, hee never knew:</hi> That
ſo, by diſcouraging him in his Miniſterie,
weakening his hands, and breaking his heart,
they may any wayes be rid of him: Or elſe,
by picking unneceſſarie Quarrels againſt him,
they labour by Authoritie, and ſtrong hand, to
throw him out of his place. For their malice
againſt a powerfull Miniſter, is endleſſe, and
implacable.</p>
            <p>It is ever the propertie of un-ingenuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe,
to hate and feare a faithfull and
conſcionable Preacher as ill as the Plague, and
ſo to eſteeme of him. This appeares, by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi>
cenſure of <hi>Paul; Certainely</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>wee
have found this man a pestilent fellow:</hi> When in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7160:122"/>
himſelfe was a pernicious Orator,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his curſed Eloquence, to the confuſion of
Goodneſſe. In the Originall, the word ſignifies,
<hi>the Plague.</hi> The <hi>Plague,</hi> that great affrighter, and
terror of the ſonnes of men, is not halfe ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and vexing, as is that man to a carnall heart,
which preaches <hi>with power and authoritie, and not
as the Scribes</hi> and formall Doctors; and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.
The Plague threatens but onely the feares
and pangs of a temporall death, and takes but
away the naturall Life; but the powerfull Word,
from the mouth of a conſcionable Miniſter, doth
ſtrike to the very heart of a carnall man, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Hell-fire and everlaſting Vengeance, and
doth labour to bereave him of his Life of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and Pleaſures; which, as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is more ſweet and deare unto him, than his
Life of Nature.</p>
            <p>And hereupon it is, that as you ſee Townes
and Cities buſily beſtirre themſelves, watch and
ward, diligently enquire, and examine paſſengers,
to keepe out the Plague; ſo it is the policie and
practice of thoſe places, where Drunkards, Swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers,
Worldlings, and prophane men ſwarme,
joyntly to conſpire and band together, for the
baniſhing of godly Miniſters, and driving them
out of their Coaſt. CHRIST IESVS himſelfe,
<hi>who ſpake as never any man ſpake,</hi> was ſo uſed by the
Swiniſh Gadarens; as you may reade in the fifth
of <hi>Luke. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that glorious paire
of worthy Paſtors, were ſo uſed by the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ſtiffe-necked Iewes, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. whereupon
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7160:123"/>
they told them to their faces, That thereby they
judged themſelves unworthie of everlaſting life.
<hi>Then Paul and Barnabas</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ſpake
boldly, and ſaid; It was neceſſarie, that the Word of
God ſhould have first beene ſpoken unto you: But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy
of everlaſting life, loe wee turne unto the Gentiles.</hi>
The Booke of God, Eccleſiaſticall Stories, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of our Times, doe plentifully verifie and
confirme this Point.</p>
            <p>5 But if ſo be,<note place="margin">5</note> this Spirituall Foole, whom
wee have carried along through ſo many ſteps of
impietie, cannot have his will againſt the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and the Perſon of the Miniſter; but that
he ſees the Power of the Word, which he cannot
decline, is like continually to vexe him, to ſtrike
through his loynes, with feare and trembling ſtill
to grate upon his Conſcience for his ſweet ſinne,
to diſcerne and diſcover the very thoughts and
imaginations of his heart; or that hee is more
ingenuous and faire-conditioned than other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
men (for ſometimes ſweetneſſe and
lovingneſſe of naturall diſpoſition doth bridle
men from raging againſt the power of holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and ſinceritie of an honeſt man:) Why
then, in a fifth place, hee</p>
            <p>Firſt, Either reſolves (as many doe) to give
the Preacher hearing indeed, and perhaps reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
attention too; but with this ſecret reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That hee ſhall not ſtirre and move him with
all his Preaching; That ſay what hee will, hee
ſhall never perſwade him, that this or that ſinne
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7160:123"/>
is ſo hainous as hee makes it; hee ſhall never
drive him from the Faſhions of the Times, and
Cuſtomes of his Fore-fathers; hee ſhall never
bring him out of conceit with good-fellowſhip.
So, that as the deafe Adder ſtoppeth his eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Enchanter, charme hee never ſo wiſely;
ſo ſhuts hee the eares of his heart againſt the
Word of Life: and though it ſounds dayly lowd
and ſtrongly in his eares, yet will he by no meanes
ſuffer it to ſinke feelingly and powerfully into
his ſoule. Thoſe men which reſt upon this ſtep
of impietie, and in this degree of prophaneneſſe,
though they heare Sermon upon Sermon, yet
are they ſtill the ſame men: They are Lyers ſtill,
they are Drunkards ſtill, they are Vſurers ſtill,
they are Swearers ſtill, they are luke-warme Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
ſtill, &amp;c. they are ſtill as they were.
Though theſe ſinnes have againe and againe been
cryed againſt, and many times reproved, and their
Conſciences convinced; yet the Word which is
preached amongſt them, hath no more power,
nor wrought more alteration upon them, than
upon the Seats where they ſit: Though the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Light of the Goſpel ſhine faire and bright
upon them, yet they lye ſtill hard frozen in their
dregs, and ſtarke blinde in matters of Heaven:
Though the Hammer of the Word beat often
upon their hearts, yet it doth not breake and
bruiſe them, but more and more harden and
emmarble them, like an Anvill and Adamant:
Though they be waſhed with many plentifull
Showers from Heaven, yet they ſtill continue
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7160:124"/>
blacke Moores, and Leopards; ſtill full of the
blackneſſe of Hell, and ſpots and pollution of
Sathan.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe that are ſuch among you, in the
Name of God beware in time: for aſſuredly, the
Damnation ſleepeth not, the Day of Reckoning
and every mans particular Iudgement is very
neere; and then we muſt be anſwerable and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for every Sermon wee have heard: Every
Sermon will then ſtand up, either to witneſſe
for us, or againſt us; for every one wee heare,
either advanceth us a ſtep neerer towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or throwes us a ſtayre lower downe towards
Hell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Or if hee cannot ſo fence himſelfe
againſt the keene edge of the Word, that two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged
Sword, which day after day is layd to the
root of his corruption; nor ſo hide his head from
the heat of that glorious and ſacred Sunne of
Truth, which every Sabbath ſhines on his face;
but that the ſharpe Arrowes of the Word of
Truth and Righteouſneſſe doe pierce his heart,
and Sword of Spirit gets ſo farre within him,
that it ſtrikes and aſtoniſheth his Conſcience:
Why then hee,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Either ſtrives and ſtruggles againſt it, by
ſhifting and ſhielding himſelfe with Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Exceptions, Excuſes, carnall Reaſons, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions,
Limitations, falſe Gloſſes, private and
partiall Interpretations, and oppoſing one place
of Scripture, in his owne falſe and enforced Senſe,
againſt the true meaning and naturall power of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7160:124"/>
the Word in another place, as I have told you
largely before. So wretchedly and unhappily is
hee wedded to the ſinfull pleaſures of this vaine
World, that hee will wreſt his wit, the Word of
God, or any thing, to wreſt out of his heart thoſe
piercing Arrowes of the Word of Truth, ſhot by
the hand of a skilfull Archer; which if he would
ſuffer to ſearch and ſinke, would fetch out the
poyſon of his naturall corruption, mortifie his
luſt, and ſave his ſoule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Or if hee have not wit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to furniſh himſelfe fitly with probable
Interpretations, formall Diſtinctions, and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Exceptions, (for this abilitie onely befalls
prophane men of better parts, and more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:)
Why then, being reſolved not to
ſubmit to the power of the Word, nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his carnall contentments, hee takes this
courſe; hee ſurfets ſo immoderately, and drinkes
ſo deepe of ſenſuall pleaſures of that boſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinne
to which hee is ſo much wedded, that hee
caſts his Conſcience aſleepe, drownes his heart
in earthly delights, and ſo goes on at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and throwes himſelfe upon Gods mercies,
without all ground or warrant, with ſuch conceits
as theſe: That hee hopes hee ſhall doe as well as
others, who are farre worſe and more wicked than
himſelfe: That God, no doubt, will be mercifull
to one ſinne: That all his other good parts and
good deedes will countervaile and make amends
for one infirmitie, (for ſo hee will call it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of it, though it be a groſſe and grievous
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7160:125"/>
ſinne:) That one ſinne will not require ſo great
repentance, but that it may be well enough done
on his death-bed, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Thus I have acquainted you by the way, with
the ſteps of impietie, and degrees of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
wherein unregenerate men, which hate to
be reformed, and refuſe to yeeld up themſelves
to bee maſtered and guided by the Power and
Light of the holy and heavenly Word of the true
and ever-living God, doe unhappily reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves, to the eternall confuſion both
of their ſoules and of their bodies: Which you
muſt take heed of, if you would profit by the
Word.</p>

Holds of Sathan; firſt,<note place="margin">7</note> Carnall Reaſon; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Corrupt Affection; which I thus define:
It is the actuated ſtrength and rage of originall
pollution, which furiouſly executes the ſenſuall
and unreaſonable determinations of corrupted
Carnall Reaſon; ſtands at open defiance, and
profeſſes open hoſtilitie againſt Grace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and good men, and courſes of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
feedes upon ſo long, and fills it ſelfe ſo
full with worldly vanities and pleaſures, that
growing by little and little incorrigible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable,
it breedes and brings forth, as it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
iſſue, Deſpaire, Horror, and the Worme
which never dies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:7160:125"/>
By Carnall Reaſon, I underſtand the whole
ſpeculative power of the higher and nobler part
of the Soule, which wee call the Vnderſtanding,
as it is naturally and originally corrupted, and
utterly deſtitute of all Divine Light; and doth
afterward, through it owne ſinfull working and
ſenſuall diſcourſe, grow wiſe in the World and
earthie affaires, but diſconceitfull and oppoſite
to the wayes of God, and heavenly wiſedome,
by concluding and commending to it ſelfe falſe

            <p>By Corrupt Affection, I meane and compriſe
all the active inferior powers of the Soule, Will,

            <p>Now for continuall growing and profiting by
the Miniſterie, in that new and bleſſed courſe;
and for thriving by the food of the Word which
thou enjoyeſt, take theſe directions, looke unto
theſe things.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Chryſoſt. Tom. 2. p. 682.</note> Looke to the dreſſing of it; that thy
ſpirituall Cooke be cunning, and conſcionable.
Otherwiſe, it may ſometimes turne into ranke
poyſon unto thy Soule, fill thee with winde, and
puffe thee up with a cauſeleſſe good conceit of
thy ſelfe; impaire thy ſpirituall health, keepe
thee ſtinted, as it were, and at a ſtay, &amp;c. Nay,
an ill ſpirituall Cooke, by his jugling Trickes,
may make thee beleeve all thy life long, that thou
groweſt in Grace, and ſhalt goe to Heaven; and
thou art ſtarke dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and
ſhalt be damned.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Rollocke <hi>in</hi> Johan. p. 377.</note> The emptying and disburthening
of the Stomacke of thy Soule, of all Humours,
Paſſions, Prejudice, Croſſes, Troubles, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
&amp;c. or any thing that will hinder the
puritie and power of the Word from taking
poſſeſſion of thy Soule: even the Honey-combe,
the ſweeteſt thing in the World, is loathſome,
as the Wiſe-man ſayth, to a full ſtomacke.
Thou muſt bring an Heart and Head, like two
emptie Buckets, to draw with greedineſſe and
joy the Water of Life out of the Wells of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To procure and rayſe an Appetite
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7160:127"/>
before thou come: from conſideration; firſt,
of its Neceſſitie: Where the Word of God
is not preached, the people periſh; as you had
it in the former Treatiſe. Secondly, Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
It is farre more precious than pureſt Gold,
dearer than thouſands of Gold and Silver. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Sweetneſſe: It paſſes the Honey, and Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe.
<hi>David,</hi> in his abſence from the meanes,
holds the Swallow and Sparrow happle Birds.
Fourthly, Profit: It builds up the inner man,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Reception of it; That it ever
be entertained with farre more attention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
than if wee were hearing the mightieſt
Monarch in the World ſpeaking immediately
unto us, by perſonall compellation, about the
weightieſt affaire, and neerelieſt concerning us:
That it be ever heard as the Word of the mightie
and ever-living God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Retention. The moſt wholeſome and
ſoveraigne meat, if preſently voided, nouriſheth
not at all; many fall into a Conſumption of
Grace, by reaſon of weakeneſſe this way. They
are hot and fierce to get unto a good Sermon,
and they doe well, to be carefull thereabout;
but their forwardneſſe and fervencie cooles and
expires, when the Sermon is done. They after,
have little more to doe with it, ſave onely to ſay
it was a good Sermon: As, many have an unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
appetite in devouring meat, who cannot
keepe it for any ſpace of time.<note place="margin">

and exerciſed, or elſe the attentive and attractive
addes but more deadneſſe to a ſpirituall Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</p>
            <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">

               </note> or in way of examination,
without Wives, Children, Servants, Schollers,
or other inferiours. But principally, by that,
firſt, excellent Exerciſe of Meditation, which
is the very life of profitable Hearing; and the
want of it, the death of all good Leſſons: It
inflames the heart with a kindly heat, to practiſe;
as in brooding, the Hen inſpires heat, and begets
life: ſecondly, and by the heat of Prayer; that
both warmes the heart, fits the food, and brings a
bleſſing upon both.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">

that Dutie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Practice. Walking in the ſtrength
of it afterward; which makes it our owne, and
keepes the Soule in health, and growth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
temper.</p>
            <p>And thus wee may conſtantly grow by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
of the Word; which is the principall
publike Banquet, which the Lord hath provided
for feeding his Childrens Soules.</p>
            <p>The Sacraments are a ſecond Service.</p>
            <p>Even by the firſt, that is, Baptiſme, wee may
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7160:128"/>
grow, not onely when wee feele it in our owne
bodies; but alſo, when wee ſee it adminiſtred
unto others. And therefore, the cuſtome which
hath prevailed in moſt places, of neglecting
and contemning this part of the Food of our
Soules, is to be ſeverely cenſured, and ſharpely
reproved.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond, that is, the Lords Supper,
