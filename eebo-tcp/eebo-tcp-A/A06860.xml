            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mouing) may well bee deuided and sorted into these foure kinds: Earthes Liquors or Iuices, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Mettalles. Earthes, saith Diascorides in his fift booke (as also the same Author abouesaide) haue their difference eyther in colour, in smell, in sauour, or else otherwise in other their vse &amp; purposes. Proper or pertinent to earths are many &amp; sundrie kindes and sorts, as those which either are in house with them, and fare as they fare, as Sande, which Isidore nameth the lightest carth, as others: or those which are neuer absent from the earth but are intermedled with the water, as Alume, which of some is called the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arth his salt, as salt it selfe and such like. In earthes are diuers dispositions and farre diuers effects (which thing Diascorides pursueth aboundantly) there are also reckned diuers names of diuers kindes: as that of Eretria a famous Citie in the Ile of Eubea, hath his sett and disposition of colour and shew ashie like, and is in his kinde in operation a sore binder, besides this marueilously colde. And that that is plentifull in Chium in Eubea also (for there is of this name besides this, two more, one a Citie of Caria, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Rhodes by Triopia) in effect and working
<pb facs="tcp:10331:7"/>
is farre otherwise, which being aplied or vsed in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, drieth vp and burneth. The like dissent is in porcions of ground with diuers Inhabitants of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite quarters &amp; Climates, which by commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> name they cal earthes, as in Samia is a most tough earth like to that natural Lime which is called Bitumen. But let vs come to Brimstone which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of Mettals: as Mercurie or Quicksiluer their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Brimstone saith Harmolaus in Greeke is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Theion. Isidore will haue it called Sulphur, for that it soone renneth on fire. It groweth (as they both agree) in the y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of Aeolia betweene Sicilie &amp; Italie: that is best that groweth in Melus a towne of Thessalie which Nicius the Althenien captaine, wanne by famishing the inhabitaunts: Further, it groweth within the Hilles of Neopolitane, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of those which be called Leucogei. Harmolous saith, that there be foure kindes heareof. The first which is called Apuron liue Alume, &amp; this is solide and most massey: almost on clottes, which kind one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phisicions vse. The second which is called Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus a lumpe like mettall. The third is called Egula vsed commonly of Fullers to make their wull and yarne whight. The fourth which is called Cauton which they vse in the wicke of Lampes of Oyle &amp; Candels. Thus much of this.</p>
            <p>Quicksiluer in Greeke is called ydrargyros, it is as Cardane saith, a certaine water made thick not by heate, bycause it is not hardened, neither by colde, for then should it be eyther in the stone his kinde or else in the mettals: but with most thinne and pure yearthy parte. Whereby it commeth to passe, that it is so heauie, so cold, so bright and cleare, so liquide or renning. It is rather mingled or tempered after a certaine sorte, &amp; that his owne, then congeled or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, for as much as it is both liquide and fluxible. The reason he sheweth why this kinde, (as is also the water) are in figure round: for that they refuse
<pb facs="tcp:10331:7"/>
in their felowship drought or any mixture of yearth. It sercheth &amp; seketh to the very bottom of ech thing. It is for his rawe mixture, of some called metal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concret. And as it is with yse which dissolueth, then when it vanisheth away, and doth not vanish till it be dissolued: in like sorte doth this (but more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, all metalles) which doe endure well till that they be molten. Dioscorides saith, that this Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer is most found in siluer quarries or mines: &amp; is then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, or of Tin and Siluer. All other matter of whatsoeuer kinde it is of, it eateth through &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth. It is a deadly drincke ouerlading &amp; brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in sunder the inwarde partes with his waight, in remedie wherof many haue taken forthwith Wine and Wormewood, and haue bene holpen.</p>
            <p>But nowe to the second part of our first &amp; former deuision. Liquores or Iuices be Oyles, Wines, and whatsoeuer else is watrie or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water &amp; aire. They be called Liquores, for eyther being actually moiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or else by powre &amp; possibilitie. ¶ But now let vs speake somewhat ingenerallye (as we haue of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two) of stones, which supplied in our first deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the third rometh. Of Stones some be more base and common: other some more Precious and rare: but the common Stone hath his name and vocable (if I may so say) hurtfoote, for that it is in mouing from place to place &amp; iourneying the footes pain and griefe. The common stone hath almost infinit kinds which offer themselues euerie where, and therefore to speake of them particularly, or in seuerall sort, it were both tedious and without delight: We mought therefore so haue sorted Stones that wee mought haue made some of them both base, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: other some base, but not yet common: lastly of all some neither base nor common but altogither rare
<pb facs="tcp:10331:8"/>
and precious.

Of the last and chiefest sorte are all such as are of greatest price, &amp; for mens estimation spent on them, called Gems or Iewels: as is that which they call Dionysius stone in spots ruddie: and be speckled round about, as that of Phrygia, in colour wanne: in waight heauie: in vertue hid and secret: as that of Arabie, as white as Iuorie: without spot or specke: as likewise the Sanguinarie which in Greeke is called Amatites which being well chafed and rubbed, bleedeth. After this sort it hath pleased Dame Nature thus to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in eche kinde, thereby to shewe hir cunning. But now let vs go to the last part of our deuision.

Those other two, that is yearthes and Liquores, we purposedly omit: onely couetouse to bestowe and employ in this first Booke (but as briefly as we can, and in order as chaunceth) our trauaile and diligence in inquisition after Stones and Mettals: not that which I would, but that which I may for my poore skill &amp; knowledge: not to teach or shew the learned, howe in this point Nature hath wrought (for that were as the prouerb is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sow to Minerua:) But to record &amp; repeate in maner of Storie, with the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of men simple &amp; plaine: And I cannot tell how it may somewhat helpe those that be learned also, If they shall espie and consider but the effect and proofe of these. I therefore desire a Reader not learned, but vnskilfull: yet rather learned then immoderate. For the one wilbe an impudent rayler: the other although hee findeth fault, yet shal a man haue him reasonable able herein to stay himselfe.

This kinde according to the manifolde difference of earthes and quarters of the earth. is diuersly called. It is engendred (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth) of Quicksiluer verie grosse, nothing pure, vncleane and earthie: and of Brimstone also as grosse, as vnpure, as earthie. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position whereof there is more of the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone: so that through the temperature of cold which is in the Quicksiluer, of the drought and earth, which is in the other, it is so wrought &amp; compact on that wise.

This <hi>Duarde</hi> perceyuing I should be wet or I got home (as he is verie ciuile and curteous) lent me certaine of the best Horse he had, and of his men as many, to accompanie me.

As we should go by a certaine way hard by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fornace, we saw in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie walles therof a fierie colour, as it were of quick and burning

Coales, which thing the Horse hauing espied, would no furder, but drew backward, &amp; wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with vs to haue gone back, so that we could not rule them. We at the length fearing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure such as might befall to vs, for feare of more daunger alighted, &amp; hauing some there to stay them, went our selues nighe &amp; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the Fornace, whither when we came, we might espie a fierie colour, but nothing burning or on fire, which also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering what this should be, at the last perceiued wel inough that it was this <hi>Taraxippe,</hi> that had so fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs and our Horse, and so departing, being thus deceyued, we rid another way.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N value more, and in degrée of Nature higher: In Nobilitie aboue Stones and Mettals, are Plants, if thei had their iust repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; were valued as they should be. But herein is corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued iudgement (I might call it abuse, but that this worde is not so fit and agreable in all poynts as that other:) and therfore it is true that the Poet Gualter saith: Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest that we being fastned and set vpon pleasures, do stray from the right rule of Reason, to satisfie oure mindes &amp; to nourish corrupt iudgement, we set most by that that is lesse worth: we most esteeme where lesse estimation should be, and haue a preposterous maner in iudging, and an awke wit in many things, their preferment. But this he spake (as it semeth) most of all moued with the Uulgar and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort. For the other kinde of men (whome Tullie calleth polished and wel addighted in all things) which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and stay themselues by wise &amp; prudent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he sawe (vnlesse they were I can not tell, howe by some euill meanes bewitched) to reckon and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme of all things as they were: And therefore he may seeme with al intent of mind fully bent to check and vpbraide the Multitude, and their basenesse in iudgement, whome the aforesaide Tullie trippeth eftsones, but especially in his Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had for Cnei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Plancie, wheras he reckneth vp a heape of imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilities and wayes of halting in all office and duties, and first after this sort. In the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort (saith he) is no perfect knowledge or skill, to select or choose
<pb facs="tcp:10331:35"/>
forth amongst many things what is heade and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall: there is no sound reason, there is no desart of hauing well, there is no industrie or diligence. And in his Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Quintus Roscius after this sort. Thus standeth it with the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons. They esteeme many things by figure &amp; fantacie, but few veritably and vprightly. Further, the selfe same Author in his Offices holdeth him not Heroicall or Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, which leaneth or hangeth vpon them. Wherfore let vs go on, and giue them their naturall, pristmate, and iust place and order in degree: forasmuch as in the other abouesaide, in Mettals &amp; Stones, all is in their hid &amp; secret vertue, there making abode &amp; stay hereat: vnlesse peraduenture thou be moued wyth the goodly shew. Which with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunnes reflexions and light, moreouer the shimmering aire &amp; the Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall his purifying more or lesse, meeting all togither, one helpeth, coloureth &amp; setteth out another: &amp; thou being in loue with so goodly a shew, and brought to it by euill accustoming, giuest consent and so wonne dost becken at it, and wilt say that it is onely proper to the Mettall it selfe: but from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue I brought thee, &amp; set thee in another beliefe: whereas I spake particularly of Golde, Siluer, and such like, if thou wilt but onely waye of what stock or houshold they be of. But to returne to our purpose. In Plantes there is not onelye occult and hid vertue: further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, fresh &amp; flourishing colours, wherewith I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thou wouldst be delighted: but there is in them that nature that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth somwhat more neare (than those other doe) to the principall Creature man. For in them is the life vegetatiue or that life which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, augmenteth &amp; bringeth forth his like, more apparant also, and in sight more than those other be, which lie shut vp in the earth as dead bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, and haue their maner of encrease or decrease therein, as all other things incensible haue, and are said to quicken or die but vnproperly: In the Plant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10331:35"/>
it is spoken on that wise properly &amp; after such sort, as mankind first next after his conception is saide to quicken and continue withall in reaching by meane of naturall order to his last kinde, vnperfect at the first, by this meane of vnperfection, in the which he lyeth and stayeth in after, his conception. 70. dayes, and so long is he plantlike: then the rest of time hath he in part and parcell like, so disposed and ordred of Nature to lay holde on, and to apprehende the other life aboue this, called sensitiue, in the which time so bespent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he seemeth of no greater accoumpt or force than other bruite beastes be, whose propertie is (as brute beastes is also the like) to feele griefe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to moue, to haue sense, and that newly, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne by Orgaine or Instrument diuersly framed. And then euen then it becommeth to haue an appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to that which it holdeth good and pleasant, and a recesse or lothsomnesse to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which maketh against it. All this at that time, (euen as bruite beasts haue) hath man in that not yet finished, &amp; vnperfect shape or forme. But the other greater and that which is his owne, being once perfect, as to perceyue &amp; iudge by sense both inward and outward, to stande in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, and to marke and obserue all ill deserts (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at also brute beastes stay at:) but to leaue these, and to proceede further, to be mindfull of, &amp; to haue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance or recorde things past, to conferre and applie them with the present time, or adiudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by what is in the time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: to vnderstand, to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thought in way easie to be vnderstoode: this diuine power (that I may so say) hath man onely, &amp; that man principally &amp; aboue others that is a man in deede, and not by appellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or name, withal those other powers that be in the other two kinds aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide: but so proportionably wrought; &amp; in such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sorted and placed, as the thirde number is ouer the first &amp; second, holding and contayning them both in his number and accoumpt, but of neyther of them

                     </gap>ures, that hath life: for in them as Aristotle sayth, is a portion of life, euen as in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage and brute beastes, sauing that in these last their maner of life by way of mouing from place to place, by gredie desire to feede and repast themselues, it is more manifest: in those other by reason of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode and continuance all in one place (as setled hard to the earth, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oote and moysture) and by their more hid receit of necessaries such as maintain them being also close and occult, haue giuen great causes of doubting. Anaxagoras being moued (I know not wherewith) affirmed that there was not onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in them to tarie and continue in their state, but also that they had and felt both sorrow and pleasure: and his reason he gathered of the distillation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in the Plant his Leaues, and of the Leaues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. Plato saith that they be moued and led by appetite for the necessitie of their prouision in nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing. But both of these Aristotle in his first booke de Plantis, refelleth and reproueth by argument: wherevpon we entende not to stande. Yet may it be doubted for asmuch as with Theophrast and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rather yea, than nay is aunswered. And they bid vs looke in eche their appearance. Doth not the Cucumber hate the Oliue, and where the one is, the other through a certaine malice prospereth not? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewise, doth not the Uine loue and embrace the Elme, &amp; prospereth the better, the nigher one is set by another? And as of these question is had, so may there also doubtes be made of the other. But let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man iudge of these as they list. I had rather be still then haue a doe herein. Nowe to their partes and maner of diuision.</p>
                  <p>Plants be sorted and deuided into three parts: the first is the Herbe: the seconde the Shrub: the third the Tres: there are which haue added hither
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10331:36"/>
a fourth kind which they cal Suffutrex a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Herbe and the shrub: but it may better ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the one or of the other of these two be called as they are called being greater or lesse, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so farre for so small aduantage in them by way of amplifying diuision.</p>
                  <p>The Herbe is that sayth Theophrast in his first boke De Plantis and fift Chapter which springeth out of his roote well leaued without any body, and beareth seede vpon his stalke or stemme as al herbs do, which are vsed to the Pot. The Shrub is that saieth he, which out of the roote commeth vp in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold stocke or bodie and shouteth out armes in his meane kinde of growth, as the Brome and Brier. The tree is that saieth he, that from out of the roote ariseth in one onely stock or bodie, and groweth vp in manie kinds to great height: beside this it is full of boughes, it is full of knots: besides this it is full of slips and shootes as the Oliue, the Figge tree, the Uine. That other which they call Suffutrex and make it the fourth parte hath a certaine thinne and small stock: but such a one as excedeth not the thinne and small stalk of the herbe: as the Rose and such like. Therevpon we may easily perceiue that all these kindes aboue saide in that, that they liue through the life Uegetatiue and haue their place of growth in the earth, and in that, that they all liue by heate and humor whereof the first (as that which is not much spoken of) seemeth of some to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in them: further in their leafe and braunches: and other outward dispositions herein they all agree and are alike. But herein they are saide to differ (as all things of sundrie sortes do) in these foure points: Whereof the chiefe and principall is their strength or vertue. The second their smell, which to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned teacheth their contemperature: for the odor and smell of ech thing doth much bewraie the thing. The thirde difference is fetched from their tast or sauor:
<pb facs="tcp:10331:37"/>
as the one sweete, the other sower, the one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt, the other of sharpe tast &amp; vnpleasaunt. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer as they haue those qualities which be proper and peculiar to the tast or want them. The fourth is (and that which is most infinite) of their figure and forme in leafe, of their owne figure, of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, of their flower, of their fruite, of their stock, which is as it were the prop or staie of the Plant: of the bark, which is the defence (and as I mought so say) their house to lodge in: and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from storme and tempest: further in the roote, difference is found, and to haue one worde for all, in all their whole composition and mixture. It is to be maruelled how Dame Nature hath vpon the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth (as it were in hir Garden or Orchard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light) for varietie sake so manifoldly varied &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kindes of colours either simply died, &amp; stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: or else chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gably almost in euery plant or thing growing. But the greatest meruaile that outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth (and that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most cunning work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Painter may follow, but not attaine to) is in the excellent shew and infinite their kinde of flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. Whereof some be Milke white, as the Lilie: some purple coloured as the Uiolet and Saffron flower: Some Scarlet red as the Aramanth: some Oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing. So that a man maye see howe Nature worketh in many, as in these and sixe hundred more like, after simple sort without any intermedling: In as many and rather mo as chaungablie. Wherein if I trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and did so largely run at roia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10331:37"/>
wrought in them: I had neede of long time &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter studie herein to followe such exact discourse, but that I meane not, neither doe I purpose it.</p>
                  <p>Plants may moreouer (to stay and continue yet a little in their deuision) so be deuided, that some shal be saide to be of the Garden: some of the Field: some that like well by the Sea and flouds: some by the Sea bancks: other some there be that onely growe in Fennes: some vpon rockes and stonie walles: some in the sands, and there are which are seene to grow in Wels as Liuerwort. Againe some be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, other some barren: some bearing braunches and leaues: some w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out al these: some of great growth: other of as small: some thicke and grosly set, as the Cyprusse: some as rarely and thinly disposed as the Beach: some full of knots as it were ioynted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided as the Reede: some without any such partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but all ouer plaine: as Hemp. Some which spring vp and increase by seede sowing: othersome which arise vp of their own accord not known how: some most holesome: othersome most hurtfull. And to twine vp this threde of deuision vpon some bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome (for it were to long to vndoe the whole skaine) some seeme to haue both sexes and kindes: as the Oke, the Lawrell and such others: some without any such apperaunce but onely one in kinde, as the Palme and the like.</p>
                  <p>The Plant therefore (for of that name we shall haue great vse) maye by Etimologie of worde so deriued, be so called, for that it is planted &amp; graft in the earth, fostered vp by his roote and by that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment that the roote taketh and feedeth on mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred and put to it by his Nourse the earth, and of such daily foode getteth euerie day greater increase.

            <p>AS <hi>Vatinius Seruilius</hi> in his life time was hated &amp; approchfully spoken of for that he like a Snaile spent all his life time in ease and ydlenesse, without any fruite that he gathered either to better himselfe or others: so contrariwise could Cleanthes the Philosopher well away with labour and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in writing after his sort: &amp; was glad to vtter abrode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that was in him best to doe. And as Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes is yet spoken of, not for any great workes of his, or for that he in stile and inditing excelled other: but for that he employed all his endeuour to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of others: so haue I (gentle Reader) one as farre behinde Cleanthes, as he was the sect and Geneologie of the Peripaticians, somewhat vnlaced or vnripped, some of the Seames of the thirde quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Philosophies attire or aray: (for hir whole coate as we reade, hath but three quarters: the one called Dialectike: the other Morall or Ciuill: the thirde naturall or wonderfull.) Although I haue not shewed thee hir altogither naked which thing Aristotle &amp; others of his sect, as also Albert &amp; Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie haue done: the sight or shew whereof if thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerest, I would wish thee to resort to these: For theirs is the Fountaine: and mine a small Arme thereof. Yet had I rather be an arme eyther of these or of some other as Cleanthes was, then to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all as was Uatinius. And yet for all this when I had enterprised this, I was not ignorant that Sicconius that ment so wel, had his Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

should haue a do with Glaucus or haue his loue: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that she hath infected that Fountaine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Scylla was woont to wash hir selfe. But let the Queane take heede least she at the request of Scylla be not turned into a Sea monster. And let muttring Mutius take heede least he be serued with the same sawce. Uirgil requited Bauius and Meuius. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let these vnderstande that euerie man is not at Corinth. Neither can euerie man carrie a Palme or Lawrel Cheeke by Cheeke with Orpheus or Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus: neyther yet hath euerye man Harmog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sing after Tellens sort: that is to say, sing sweetly, or let vs heare a heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly noise. No. Let not euery man looke to play and striue with Tellen or with Agathon. It shall suffice vs to haue Philomelus his cunning. And ye Hellyconians, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Babys come in in place amongst you: as he did when as Minerua played so sweetely, yet if he shall disquiet you (as Babys did Minerua) shame him not with ieasting or iarring (no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Minerua did) but thinke that his shame is great y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (whatsoeuer he be) if that he playeth &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth ylfauouredly. If God giue him life he may haue better perfection and ripenesse. And thus much I had to the learned sort. The other I doe not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust: for whom principally I was couetous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe this such my trauaile, and will (if I shall see them thankefull hereafter) more aboundantlye to their delectation and profite. So that if they haue any consideration at all, they may be moued at this the working of God in these such his inferiour Creatures: who is to be praysed for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
