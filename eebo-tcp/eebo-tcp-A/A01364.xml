            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, after J had (for my priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) tranſlated ſome few notes out of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Historie, J was requested by ſome of my good friends to take further paines in the whole: which J was the rather deſirous to performe, as well to ſatisfie their friendly requests, as alſo for diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects. The first whereof was, for that my ſelfe had been a trauailer in this Countrie of Hungarie, and had (in regarde my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade there was not long) but ſuperficially noted the manners and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoſition of the people there, and ſpecially in their martiall affaires, wherein (during my reſidence there) J ſpent my time with ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of thoſe parts, where then J had been: which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did now with delight draw me on to begin and proceede in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of this Historie. The ſecond reaſon that induced me hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, was, in regard that it ſeemed no fiction or fabulous toy, but a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of grauitie and credence, as witneſſeth the memorials of <hi>Stephen Broderic</hi> Chaunceler of Hungarie, and of <hi>Caſtalde</hi> Lieutenant for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (who was King of Hungarie) in that countrie, and diuers others: which being ſo, J rested with aſsurance that it would greatly benefit thee for thy experience in many pollitike affaires. And the third reaſon that perſwaded me to vndertake this worke, was, that J did, and alſo doe ſtill, hartely deſire that it might be, in things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to vs, as a preſident and caueat to theſe parts of Christendome that now thinke themſelues as ſecure, as once the Hungars did, and they then as ſafe from the deluge of Infidels, as we doe now. But alas, ſuch was their pride and diſſention (vnhappie people) that (through their owne miſgouernment) God inflicted this puniſhment vpon them, which now as remedileſſe, and altogether in dispaire, they with wofull laments too late bewaile: for though that ſome neighboring Princes
<pb facs="tcp:21983:4"/>
(whom the cauſe doth alſo neerely concerne) may affoorde them their best ayde, ſomewhat to withstand and bridle the Turkes mightie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions; yet ſurely farre vnlikely, and more vnable they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer that which they haue lost: the reaſon is too apparant, for both in regard of multitudes of men and militarie diſcipline, they farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the Christians, and it may be that thoſe who may, will not, and thoſe who would, cannot affoorde them that ſuccour which is needfull; ſo that, what betweene the one and the other, this miſerable Hungarie (which is one of the fertilest and goodliest Countries in Christendome) is more ſhaken and torne by the Turkes violence and inſolencie, then is a young Lambe betweene the VVolues iawes. Herein I must craue your patience to rest in ſilent melancholy (for mirth it affoords none) vntill the end, and lend your patient eare vnto detestable complots, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſeditions; vnto ignominious conſpiracies, immanities and cruelties; vnto horrible maſſacres of men, women and children that be Chriſtians; vnto pitiful laments and mournings of huſbands for loſſe and forcing away of their wiues, and wiues for their huſbands; vnto violation and rapines of maydes; and to be briefe, vnto ſacriledges, burnings, and deuastations of all manner of creatures: which when all theſe things ſhall liuely be diſcifered vnto you in this Historie, then iudge of the ſtate of this poore Countrie into what an abiſme of miſerie it is fallen. J omit to write of many particulars concerning the Turkes politike proceedings, for the incroching vpon Christendome: touching all which (becauſe J would not be tedious) I refer you to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it ſelfe, wherein more at large you may diſcerne their entercourſe and temporiſing with Christians, which indeede is nothing elſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their owne commoditie to make vſe of them, vntill they finde fit oportunitie to aduance their intended practiſes against them: and then adue league and all ſocietie of friendſhip: onely this J ſay, and humbly deſire God of his mercifull goodnes, to inspire Christians with that humilitie and faithfull repentance, that it may aſſure our harts of turning this iudgement from vs, which our Lord of his mercie graunt for Ieſus Christs ſake, and extirpe theſe Mahometaines, who (as our owne eyes may witnes) daily (with teares and griefe we may ſpeake it) infringe the confines of Europe with their heatheniſh and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings; as more at large this Historie will amplifie.</p>

            <p>To theſe doe I preſent this mirrour, that looking into it, they may the better know what is their preſent eſtate; and if they could ſee (as they may if they will) their groſſe deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and great defects, they ought without doubt to beleeue that they are the ſame perſons, which haue made themſelues ſuch by the corruption and groſſenes of their humors, giuing themſelues ouer to their deſires, through a contempt of the Deitie, by a priuate ambition and auarice.</p>
            <p>When as therefore you ſhall ſee in this Hiſtorie the diuiſion of a people fleſhed one againſt another, for ſoueraigne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dignitie: when for this effect, you ſhall reade herein of Townes and Caſtles forced, the inhabitants ſpoyled of their

goods and liues, the wiues at the mercie of the ſouldiour, the maydes violated, many fayre buildings burnt, the ſubiects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt their Lords, Peaſants againſt Peaſants; you would aſluredly thinke they are acts committed in a Countrie farre remote.</p>
            <p>But it is you, who amongſt your ſelues, and vpon your ſelues, haue committed the like enormities: when for the like effect you ſhall finde it ſtrange that theſe miſerable and infortunate people, hauing called in amongſt them their old and auncient enemies, vnder colour for them to be reuenged one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and (which is yet more beſtiall) ſubmitted themſelues both of the one part and on the other, to a ſtranger. I know not then what ſound iudgement or good opinion you can conceiue of your ſelues, being attainted and notoriouſly conuinced of the ſelfe ſame fault, when you ſhall note the great ruines and deſolations of ſo goodly &amp; rich a Countrie, you may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euen at this preſent, yours reduced into the like eſtate, and if the calamitie be not in all poynts anſwerable: yet thinke that you touch it with the very tip of your finger, except the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledement which you may haue of your ſelues, preſerue you not, and diuertit from you. In examination of your ſelues, you ſhall finde your ſelues all kinſmen, there being neither race or linage amongſt you, which is not allyed one to another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be ſome ſtranger newly come in: you ſhall finde your ſelues all of one nation: you ſhall finde your ſelues all ſubiects of one Lord and Prince: and you ſeeing your ſelues to be all of kindred, allied of the ſame nation, and vnder one gouernment: and being able to obſerue theſe conditions in your ſelues, you ſhall certainly iudge, that you are culpable of all the diſorder which at this preſent is ſeene amongſt you, and that the fault happened not but from your ſelues, without impoſing it vpon a ſtranger, who by your loſſe, ſeeketh his owne aduauncement, maintaining his triumphs with heaps of your ruines, which ſerue him for many ſolemnities. This fault once acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, you ſhall imbrace your ſelues, euen one another as kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: you ſhall frequent one another louingly, as true countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: and you ſhall make your ſelues wholy obedient to your

For ſith ſo it is, that the loweſt part of a circle is that, which is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thereof: and that the lower parts or bodies are gouerned by the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> (which thing alſo is found true by naturall reaſons knowne, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerued in all handie workes and engines:) it is not without reaſon, that ſome haue inferred of this, that this world is ſubiect to the motion of the Heauens, and that we perceiue amongſt vs, the things paſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, and repreſent themſelues to our viewes. For Heauen being round, his period or full point is no other, but a continuall begininng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, euen as preſt and readie as his ende: which the Aegyptians by their Hierogyphicall figures meant to repreſent vnto vs, and namely by a ſerpent holding the end of his tayle with his teeth. Now this world being heauie and ponderous of his owne proper nature, and yet (in the middeſt of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> great, ſoft, and light ayre) firme, ſtable, and immoueable by diuine diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is incomprehenſible to vs: this world, I ſay, receiueth by certaine reuolutions, in the ſame place and quarters, the ſame and like paſſions, which it hath once receiued from the influence of Heauen; euen as, by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie circumuolution of it, it commeth more neere vnto vs with his beames.

And if they were both alike in ſoliditie and firmenes, or of the ſame motion, their qualities would be without any effect. And for this cauſe God meaning that the world ſhould be gouerned, according to the nature of it, by Heauen, he hath created the world ſtable for the patient, and the Heauen moueable for the agent; and all this, to the end the world ſhould receiue this benefit of God by the meanes of Heauen, through certaine reuolutions of it, in as much as this great circumuolution might ſtill remaine and returne againe.

            <p>And this is that which oftentimes vpholdeth many good ſpirits, which otherwiſe would be terrified through the innumerable euils, wherewith men are often times enuironed. For, wreſtling againſt ſuch torments, they are ſupported by a certaine hope againſt ſuch terrors, namely this, that one day good ſhall come in ſteed of euill: like as when it raineth, we ſtill hope for faire weather. Theſe reuolutions, neuertheleſſe, are not alwaies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,

or of like perfection, by reaſon of the multiplicitie of meteores and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> heauenly ſtarres, which in their ſphericall courſes haue euery one their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion, more ſoone or later one then the other, and that in ſuch wiſe, that thorough many ages we doe not finde two equall ſituations or aſpects of the ſame ſtarres ſtreaming vpon vs. For this cauſe the effects of ſuch reuolutions doe not manifeſt themſelues agreeable in euery circumſtance to the firſt. There be alſo ſome of theſe reuolutions, which haue not their neereſt cauſes from theſe heauenly influences, but they ſucceede onely by a <note place="margin">2</note> 
               <note place="margin">The diuerſitie of reuolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> certaine combining togither, or be as a conſequence of things fore-hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; as for example, in time of warre many euils doe infallibly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie it, and are ingendred thereby. Other reuolutions there be which are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not natural, but proceed from the only and free will of God; &amp; theſe we may <note place="margin">3</note> name ſupernaturall, although we ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to happen by the ſequell of certaine precedent cauſes, and to haue bin practiſed before in certaine worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Theſe reuolutions ſometimes fall out ſooner then the naturall courſe of the ſtarres: becauſe that Gods iuſtice (whereof they do depend) doth haſten and addreſſe it ſelfe to puniſhment, euen as the waight of the miſdeedes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. The two firſt kindes of theſe reuolutions may be noted to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen many times naturally in thoſe who are altogether abandoned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God, and are by him left to the courſe of their owne luſt, as we ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Barbarians, and in the perſon of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> The third kind was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon the children of Iſraell, who haue often felt one ſelfe ſame iuſtice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and diuine puniſhment, for that their fault was the ſame &amp; equall to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſuch being the will &amp; pleaſure of God, to chaſten thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loueth.</p>
            <p>The calamitie happening to the kingdome of Hungarie, (whereof I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to write the hiſtorie) may well bee referred to one of theſe three pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. For when this countrie at an inſtant was ouerthrowne, there was not in Europe (yea it may be not in all the world) any place, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was more proude, effeminate, &amp; cold of courage then in this; they giuing themſelues ouer to ſuch infamous vices, through the great riches and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous abundance and wealth of the countrie, (which is the cauſe of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes) and becauſe they did (to ſay the trueth) often make head againſt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Turks, and many times repulſed them: from whence proceeded their pride, and from the ſame, the deſpiſing and contemning of their enemie. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God was not then obſerued but in pompe and ſumptuous riches. The Paſtors &amp; Prelates of the Church behaued themſelues like ſouldiours, vnder colour that it was for defence of it, againſt their enemies. Iuſtice was made an ordinarie ſale. The Nobilitie peremptorie and vntolerable. And the ſimple people, no more ſimple, but hollow, perfidious, and wicked. For theſe and ſuch like enormous vices, it is likely (conſidering that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued) that God (to commence and begin his chaſticement) ſent to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a yong King, according to that wiſe ſaying of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who aſſureth vs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

But diſcourſing thus freely vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil of another, it may be obiected, that I haue matter enough at home, without borrowing from elſewhere, to make the like diſcourſe. There is (truly) enough, and more then we ſhould deſire: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> but I willingly anſwer as the wiſeman, who ſaith, <hi>That it is unſeemely for a man</hi>

At <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the falling out of ſuch Coniunctions, wee reade that the Romane common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale hath changed the eſtate vnder <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Augustus:</hi> as afterward this French Monarchie did vnder <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charlemaigne:</hi> and as, before that, Italie did vnder <hi>Romulus:</hi> and Aſſyria vnder <hi>Merodach:</hi> and before them, the like mutations happened vnder <hi>Ianus,</hi> and vnder <hi>Moſes.</hi> The miſeries that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the alteration of the Romane ſtate are ſufficiently knowne.

When we ſee Religion, Iuſtice, or Policie to be in his full force of vertue, we may aſſure our ſelues to reſt in good eſtate and great content. But of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> when ſuperſtition and Atheiſme, when oppreſſion and denying of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, when tyrannie and diſorder are come to their full points, wee ought to expect for no other but great ruine and miſerie, and yet the ſame decaying and declining by little and little. I will not in particular here recite, deuotion turned to hypocriſie; the ſacred Miniſterie and the goods therof committed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21983:8"/>
to Captaines and men of warre, and conuerted to the dowries of women; vnlawfull bargaines, and fowle enormities couered with the vaile of Iuſtice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the execution thereof committed to the ignorant, in that the ſame is valued rather at the price of money, then of knowledge; the gouernments of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces and Captainſhips of fiftie men of armes brought to a ſet price: in fine, that the royall ſeate is the onely ſhop of all ruinous inuentions, and the charges and exactions of the ſimple people without limite or reaſon. The euill, which infallibly followeth ſuch like infortunate operations, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not but by diuine prouidence; who minding afterward to introduce good, muſt firſt caſt out and purge the euill by puniſhment and chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which bringeth with it ſuch miſerie. Notwithſtanding, all theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall violences and iuſt chaſticements may bee mitigated and aſſwaged by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſome other gentle and diſcreete meanes. The firſt ſort of reuolutions, being naturall, are ſubiect to ſupernaturall effects, which proceede from our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall <note place="margin">The immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirits not ſubiect to the ſtarres.</note> ſpirits, which by reaſon doe ſtay or chaunge them; it falling out that a wiſeman commaundeth euen the ſtarres, not cauſing them to chaunge their naturall courſe, as ſome heretofore haue thought of Sorcerers, but in making their naturall power fruſtrate and without effect, through a good and aduiſed foreſight. Concerning ſuch chaſticements, as ordinarily fall vpon vs by diuine iuſtice for like faults, euen thoſe neuertheleſſe may bee ſomewhat ſtayed by good and true repentance, contrition, and daily praiers, ſeeing that God is altogether good and full of mercie. Alſo when ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> faile vs, we may well be aſſured, that like faults preuailing, or ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vpon vs as draw neere to them, we muſt look for the like effects, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we ſhould ſee the like celeſtiall courſes in our time, which were in our predeceſſors daies, ſince the firſt great Coniunction happened after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. This power, which is thus in man by the permiſſion of the diuine bountie, is cauſe of the diuerſitie which wee ſee as well in diuine chaſticements as heauenly influences, although the cauſes and courſes thereof be alike: otherwiſe, wee muſt conclude that, ſuch heauenly courſes happening, theſe mutations would be vniuerſall and alike vnto euery one: and that for one and the ſame fault the like puniſhment would alwaies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> follow. But now, the miſerie, which wee ſee in France, redoubleth it <note place="margin">The miſerie of France.</note> ſelfe and daily increaſeth: becauſe that together with celeſtiall influence, rancour, malice, and all manner of wickednes hath in ſuch ſort ſeazed and poſſeſſed the ſpirits of men, that all manner of foreſight, of wiſedome, of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of humilitie and patience doth abandon it ſelfe from thence, euen as it happened at the time of the deluge: in ſo much that it truly ſeemeth that this vnhappie countrie (at the leaſt for his owne particular) is readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euen as great a fall, as then did the whole world: except ſome (in whom wee ſee ſome ſparke of wiſedome yet to ſhine) doe take the bridle in their hands to ſtay the violent courſe of this heauenly chariot, and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their good meanes this poore ſhip (willingly expoſed to the windes and waues of a manifeſt ſhipwracke) bee harboured in ſome ſafe roade, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the euill fortune of another diuulged in this hiſtorie; we ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring our ſelues by their examples, as on our own behalfe to take courage, and to inforce our ſelues, as the good ſhipmen doe in a tempeſt, who then

At that time and thither repaired all the States of euery Prouince, and determined of all things which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined to the defence of the kingdome: and, among other things, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that all the Princes, as well eccleſiaſticall as ſecular, and all the nobles with good ſtore of able peaſants, ſhould be at Tholne, at the feaſt of the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lady the bleſſed Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> which is the ſecond of Iune, and to march all with the King himſelfe, againſt their enemies.

            <p>In this aforeſaid aſſemblie, it was graunted to the King, to take a portion of the Churches treaſure (if want did vrge him to it) to ſupplie the want of <note place="margin">The Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall treaſure leuied for the warre.</note> his owne treaſure, which was but little, his cofers being waſted by thoſe who had very careleſlie gouerned the common wealth.

And thus much for the generall ſcituation of Hungarie.</p>
            <p>Now wee muſt a little diſcourſe more particularly of the places, wherein happened all the force and vigour of the warre. Beneath Buda, a long the riuer ſide (beſides other villages) is the towne of Rakos, and neere vnto that, <note place="margin">Rakos. Tholne. Batha. Mohacz.</note> is Tholne, which is threeſcore Hungriſh miles from Buda: after that, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Batha, and conſequently Mohacz, otherwiſe called Mugach, ſcituate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtroude of Danubius. Mohacz towards the right hand regardeth the towne of 5. Churches, which before the loſſe of Hungary was of great fame; it is foure miles from Danubius, and three from Drauus. Towards Drauus is the towne Socloſia; and beyond Drauus is built the Fortreſſe of Valpo. <note place="margin">Socloſia. Valpo.</note> Beyond Mugach vnto Drauus is counted foure miles, and a little more. On the other ſide the mouth of Drauus, vpon the ſhoare, is ſeated the towne of Ezeck, and in the ſame quarter, in times paſt, was to be ſeene, the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Ezeck.</note> or remembrances of a certaine towne, built in the time when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes enioyed the Pannoniaes, which (it may be) was a Romane Colonie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Theſe ruines are ſeene two miles of, from the entring of Drauus into Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius. At the place where this towne of Ezeck is, the riuer Drauus doth cloſe himſelfe narrow, giuing commodity to the Hungars to erect a bridge, where their armie paſſed ouer, when Belgrade was taken by the Turkes. After the towne of Ezeck, followeth the Caſtle of Erdunde, belonging to the Prouoſt <note place="margin">Erdunde.</note>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21983:13"/>
of Thitetie. This place is enuironed with a Forreſt, and in reſpect of the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation thereof, with a little labour, it may bee made very ſtrong. Beneath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this Caſtle is Baroth, Walko, Zatha, and next Bachia, which is one of the <note place="margin">Baroth. Walko. Zatha. Bachia an Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. Wilak.

Along Danubius, beneath Zatha, is ſeene Wilak, with his excellent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, and there beginneth this fortunate and firtile countrie of Sirmia, not onely abounding in wine, the moſt commended of all the Northerne parts, but alſo in all neceſſarie things for the vſe of man: and hath been renowmed by ſo many Emperours, and from whence is ſprong a man who hath greatly adorned the Romane and Apoſtolike ſea. The countries of the ſame, yeeld <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> pleaſant and delightfull places; the land is fat, and fruitfull, as may bee; the ayre is ſo temperate, that it is not eaſily to bee credited: the which falleth out, by reaſon this Region is but three or foure daies iourney at the moſt from the Adriatique ſea. It had in former time a towne which carried his name, of the which, at this preſent is ſeene no more, but the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or reliques thereof. When you are paſt Wilake, you enter into this Prouince, and the firſt towne you come into is Bannomoſtra, where is the Biſhops <note place="margin">Bannomoſtra. Varadin Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> ſeate of Sirmia: and before you arriue at Varadin Peter we finde by the way Kamanche, a towne of good account. This towne of Varadin Peter, with <note place="margin">Kamanche. Zalonkemen.</note> the Caſtle, is ſubiect to the Church of Coloſence, and for the loſſe of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> it was afterward called the place of Belgrade. After Varadin is the towne of Zalonkemen, and certaine others which haue bin ruinated by the late loſſe happened to Belgrade. On this ſide the riuer Sauus, is the Caſtle of Zemlen, and betweene that and the towne of Belgrade, is the mouth of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus, <note place="margin">Zemlen. Belgrade.</note> which in that place, by reaſon of the entrance thereof into Danubius, maketh it a large and deepe current, which is enioyed by the towne of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, ſo much renowmed for famous battailes, being fought in that place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turke, which being once almoſt ſurpriſed by the enemie, <hi>Iohn Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niades,</hi> then gouernour of Hungarie, father to King <hi>Mathias,</hi> with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iohn Capistrum,</hi> chaſed out of Hungarie <hi>Amurath</hi> the Turkiſh Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <note place="margin">Iohn Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> leauing, by that valorous meanes, an immortall glorie to the name of Hungarie. The Hungars call this Fortreſſe Nandor-Albe, and ſome Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grecque: <note place="margin">Nandor-Albe. Albe-grecque.

It is placed vpon a ſteepe Rock, which on that ſide Hungarie is ſeene, and at the foote thereof is the towne, hauing on the one ſide Sauus, and on the other Danubius.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the ſituation of Hungarie, and the places wherein the Hungars haue receiued an incurable and deſperate wound. As for the riches of this countrie, to ſay the trueth, it exceedeth all the Prouinces in Europe. But we will ſay no more hereof at this time, for that it would require a large <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> volume: but let vs content our ſelues with the ſituation which wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie deſcribed, to the end the reader of this hiſtorie may the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the diſcourſe following.</p>
            <p>And now to come to the ſubiect of our diſcourſe. The King vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that certaine troupes of Turkes had alreadie paſſed Sauus, fearing that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21983:13"/>
they marched to Drauus, and that (before his comming) they ſhould ſeaze <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vpon the towne of Ezeck, aduiſed with himſelfe to defend that place with a ſtrong garriſon. And this charge was giuen to the Counte Palatine, who at that time was remaining in a Caſtle not farre from Drauus, which belonged to his brother. He willingly receiued this commaundement, although hee was much troubled with the gowte, which a long time had moleſted him. But thoſe that ſhould haue been put into that place, or ſent their people thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were not ſo diligent as the neceſſitie required: in regard whereof Counte Palatine could not execute that which hee deſired to performe: whereupon hee went to the King at Buda, who made recitall of the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſlouthfulnes of thoſe who had no will to aſſiſt and aide him, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> effect the charge which was committed to his cuſtodie. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that he went not from the Court, but ſtaied there to accompanie the King in his iourney. In this time, and euen at the ſame inſtant, the King by letters was aduertiſed from a certaine perſon (who had ample and ſufficient knowledge of the counſell and affayres of the enemie) that there was no better policie for him, then to cauſe the Vayuode of Tranſiluania to march forward with Tranſalpina (the fidelitie and alleadgance of whom towards the King was moſt aſſured) either to aſſaile the enemie behinde (of which they nothing miſtruſted) or elſe they leauing them, to iourney into Thrace (which was naked of ſouldiours) whileſt the Turkes aduanced themſelues againſt the King. For by this meanes the enemie ſhould either bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and defeated, (being incloſed betweene two armies) or elſe forced to forſake his enterpriſe, and returne to defend his owne. This counſell at the beginning was ſuſpected for certaine cauſes, which would be too long to rehearſe: but afterward imparted to the Biſhop of Strigonium, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him, the Vayuode of Tranſiluania was commanded by <hi>Vrbine Batian</hi> (who then was diſpatched to go into Moldauia) to aduiſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this what was moſt expedient and behoofull to be done for the ſafegard of the kingdome. And if he eſteemed the counſell good, he was commanded to turne his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe of Tranſiluania, with Tranſalpina alſo towards that quarter: and this in part was a ſpeciall cauſe that the Vayuode could not be preſent at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the day of battaile. During theſe counſels, the time of the aſſemblie, and the <hi>rende vous</hi> appointed to be at Tholne, was already expired: yet neuertheleſſe they were not yet in readines, and it ſeemed that all were not plyable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, but only the King: neither (ſaid they) ought they to come to Tholne, before they vnderſtood of the Kings being there.</p>
            <p>In the meane while the bruite of the Turkes approaching, and of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Sauus daily increaſed, in ſuch ſort, that in the end certaine newes came, that after, hee paſſing the riuer, and hauing throwne downe certaine Caſtles, hee held on his courſe towards Varadin Peter, and did beſiege it both by land and water, though it were a towne of no great force. In the end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the King, although not any were come neither from Bohemia, nor from any other place, and though he had with him but few companies of ſouldiours, <note place="margin">Lewis goeth into the field.</note> yet not willing to be reproued as tardie or negligent concerning this matter of import, he departed from Buda (called at this day Ofen) the 24. of Iuly, <note place="margin">Ofen.</note> marching along the ſhoare of Danubius, comming by little and little to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21983:14"/>
Tholne, hoping that the other would ſhortly come to him.</p>
            <p>A little before the King went from Buda, <hi>Stephen Battor</hi> of Somlie was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſent to the Vayuode of Tranſiluania, by whom hee was commaunded, that leauing the firſt aſſignements, he ſhould haſte himſelfe towards his Maieſtie with all his Tranſiluanian forces, ſeeing the ſudden ariuall of the enemie did require it.</p>
            <p>When the King departed from Buda he had but 3000. men as well foote as horſe, counting thoſe that did belong to Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Strigonium. The firſt day that they departed from Buda, they made their nights reſt at the village of Ambroiſe Sarkan, named Erd, diſtant from Buda two miles. In that place the Kings beſt horſe, and that which he loued moſt, ſuddenly dyed, whereupon he was much diſquieted, and many diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> it to preſage euill hap. The King hauing made his aboade there certaine daies, and no aide comming to him, proceeded on, with thoſe ſmall troupes which he had, to the next village named Erchij. There hauing ſpent many daies, without effecting any good, in the meane time there arriued <hi>Andrew Battor,</hi> one of the principall of that kingdome, with a good number of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, and they marched along Danubius vnto Pantelee (which is a place, as we haue ſaid, of Ezeck) where is to be ſeene the remaindes of an auncient Romane Colonie. There <hi>George Baſi</hi> (comming from the Vayuode of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania) found the King, who imparted vnto his Maieſtie that the Vayuode was in great care what he ſhould doe, in reſpect of the diuerſitie of meſſages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which hee had ſent him, hauing firſt receiued letters from his Maieſtie, and afterwards by many Curreers, and namely by <hi>Iaſpar Horuuath</hi> of Wimgard, one of his chiefe gentlemen, by which he was commaunded to come to the King; and that afterwards there arriued <hi>Vrbain Batian,</hi> who brought him certaine ſpecialties, that according to the former, he might aſſaile the enemie behinde with the Tranſalpinians: after him there arriued <hi>Stephen Battor</hi> of Somlie, who brought him the ſame and firſt commaund, but did not make it openly knowne to him, that the King did meane, that the aduertiſements ſent by <hi>Batian</hi> ſhould come to effect; and for that occaſion he was vncertaine what to doe in ſo many alterations, not knowing which to follow, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> readie and willing to doe what his Maieſtie would commaund him. And that neuertheleſſe he found not any thing of more importance, then with all ſpeede to come to the King, that it was now too late to aſſaile the Turkes behinde: and in as much as that enterpriſe was daungerous, ſo was it alſo more hard now to execute it, then at the firſt, for that the Tranſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinian (with whom he was commaunded to ioyne himſelfe) was alreadie forced to ſend his only ſonne in hoſtage to the Turkes Campe. The King vnderſtanding the charge of <hi>George Baſi,</hi> diſlodged, and arriued the ſame morning at the towne of Felduar, ſituated by Danubius: and there confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his Councell of that which <hi>Baſi</hi> had reported to him. At the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> inſtant he alſo commanded <hi>Baſi</hi> to iourney day and night with as great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as he could to the Vayuode, and to tell him that the King allowed wel of his counſell, and that it was ſound and good, conſidering that the enemie had alreadie entered into the kingdome, and marched towards him: and that therefore he leauing all other determinations, he ſhould as well with all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21983:14"/>
all the Tranſiluanians, as thoſe which he met in the way comming towards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him, make haſte, and with all expedition come to the Campe, bringing with him not onely the Nobilitie and priuate ſouldiours, but alſo euen the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants themſelues.</p>
            <p>To this effect letters were diſpatched vnto the Tranſiluanians, to <hi>Iohn Gozthan,</hi> Chauncellor to the Queene, and Biſhop of that Prouince, and to the Vayuode, by the perſwaſion of <hi>George,</hi> who deſired the ſame, according to the aduice that he had receiued of the King his maſter. Theſe letters were of purpoſe framed ſharpe and ſeuere, and ſent, to the end that the Vayuode ſhould ſhew them to all, whereby to excite and animate euery one. He was ſpecially commanded by them, vpon paine of diſloialtie and treaſon, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſhould day and night march to the King. To incourage euery one the more, there was ſent with <hi>George Baſi, Iohn Statile,</hi> a man of readie and quicke wit, and well ſeene in learning. He was, by meanes of their ſiſter, nephew to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Berizlas</hi> Biſhop of Veſprimie, and to <hi>Martin Ban,</hi> a man greatly eſteemed both in the affayres of peace and warre.</p>
            <p>Theſe meſſengers were not yet departed, when euen then euill tidings <note place="margin">Varadin Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken by the Turkes.</note> came of the taking of Varadin Peter, which the Hungars otherwiſe call Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouar, after it had been valiantly defended for many daies, and all thoſe who were within it, for the defence thereof, were cruelly put to the ſword; the Caſtle being old and decayed, was the more ruinated by the force of the Cannon; and further, that the enemies did aduance themſelues by water <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and land againſt other neighbour places, and were determined, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to beſiege the Caſtle of Wylatz. The King greatly perplexed at theſe newes, gaue expreſſe commandement to thoſe who were to goe to the Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uode, that they ſhould poſte in the greateſt haſte they could. Letters were alſo ſent to all places; Curriers were diſpatched towards <hi>George</hi> Counte of Sepuſa, who was ſaid not to be farre from Alberegalis with 5000. men. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto <hi>Francis Bathian</hi> Ban of Croatia. Vnto Counte <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> who was thought to be departed from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and to bee alreadie in Croatia with his father, vnto whom hee was firſt of all retired, with an intent to haue drawne from thence armour, horſes, and ſouldiours, that ſo he might with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> better abilitie preſent himſelfe in brauer equipage before the King. <hi>Ladiſlas</hi> the Macedonian, was commanded to go with ſpeed towards the Queene, who then was at Buda. She was willed to importune her brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and in his abſence the gouernours of Auſtria, to the end that it would pleaſe him preſently to ſend him aide, and eſpecially Artillerie, for which hee had been before required, and whereof the Hungars ſtood greatly in neede, and the Turkes to the contrarie were plentifully furniſhed. Moreouèr, ſhe was intreated to haſten the Bohemians with their troupes, for the leauying of whom the Queene had disburſed of her owne charges great ſummes of money to <hi>Mezericie. Thomas Nadaſdy</hi> was written vnto, that he ſhould ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> vnto whom he was ſent, and to declare to him the double li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and affinitie which was betweene them two, and the common perill like to happen; in conſideration whereof, he importuned that he would not leaue his maſter in ſuch and ſo great neceſſitie, giuing him ſufficient notice of the danger of his perſon, of the kingdome, and the loſſe of Varadin Peter.</p>

In the meane while <hi>Paul Tomoree</hi> (who before the taking of Varadin, hauing with him 3000. men, left within the Caſtle of that towne 1000. foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and certaine horſe, who were (as wee haue ſaid) all put to the ſword) eſteeming it now a great raſhnes, if he ſhould aduenture to oppoſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front himſelfe with 2000. horſe againſt ſo great a multitude, he paſſed to the other ſide of Danubius, and there, as much as was poſſible for him, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the enemie both by land and water: for he had vpon Danubius cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine numbers of ſea ſouldiours in veſſels, which are called Nazadies; but they were nothing to bee compared to the infinite multitude of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>The King, after he had vnderſtoode of the loſſe of Varadin Peter, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> along Danubius, to that place which before we haue named Rakos, where he remained two dayes, and vpon the transfiguration of our Lord, he arriued at Tholne, hauing now a little encreaſed his armie, ſo that then he could make 4000. horſe, or ſomewhat more. As his Maieſtie was neere to Tholne, Counte Palatine, with thoſe few men which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie come and arriued with the firſt at that towne, went before. During the Kings abode there, from all the Prouinces (which are called Counties) <note place="margin">Prouinces cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Counties.</note> in Hungarie, as well on this ſide Danubius, as on the other, repaired great ſtore of Souldiours to this towne. Counte <hi>George</hi> of Sepuſa was alſo there with 300. horſe good and bad, and 1200. foote, or there abouts. Thither <note place="margin">Succours from the Pope.</note> alſo came <hi>Hanibal Carthaginois</hi> of Cyprus, with 1300. Souldiours, leauied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> at the Pope charges, beſides other companies that were there payed by his Holines. They altogether made 4000. men well appointed. Of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there was 1500. Polanders or Pollacques, who in all that, for which <note place="margin">Pollanders came to the ſuccour.</note> they are helde commendable people, ſurpaſſe all the reſt, they were vnder the conduct of <hi>Leonard Gnomsky,</hi> who was ſayd to be a man very expert and ingenious to lodge and ſeate a Campe, for which experience he was choſen and allowed. At the ſame inſtant came to that towne <hi>Paul Vardagy</hi> Biſhop of Agria: <hi>Francis Peren</hi> Biſhop of Varadin, and many other, as well Biſhops as Seculars. During their abode, almoſt euery day they ſate in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Councell, to whom were aſſiſting the moſt renowned perſons then in the Campe. In this ſaid aſſemblie, the affayres of the Realme were conſulted vpon, namely, of the aduauncing and marching of the Armie, of the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and defence of the paſſage of Drauus, ſeeing it was now no queſtion of that of Sauus, and alſo by reaſon of the loſſe of Varadin Peter, and for that at the ſame time, it was ſayd the Turkes marched to Ezek, hauing alreadie vnder his gouernment the Fortreſſe of Wylak, and ruinated all the other <note place="margin">Wylak taken by the Turks.</note> Caſtles which were along Danubius. The ſayd Counte Palatine was then preſently diſpatched to ſeize vpon the paſſage of Drauus, before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie approaced. Many of the principall men were commaunded to follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
               <note place="margin">The priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Barons of Hungarie.</note> with their troupes; but many notwithſtanding repugned the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, vnder the colour of their priueledges and cuſtome of the Barons, which is, not to goe to the warre, but vnder the Royall enſigne: in regarde whereof this enterpriſe was omitted, although that the Palatine, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his griefe, did endeauour himſelfe, and gaue ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to refuſe any trauaile or labour. He being on his iourney to goe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21983:15"/>
before to Mugach or Mohacz, and not being followed by any of thoſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> who were commaunded to accompanie him, alleadging their priueledges, as we haue ſayd: <q>the King euen in open Councell, where the affayres were treated of, being moued by their vndutifull allegeance, ſayd; I ſee, quoth he, (being willing to put his words in writing) that euery one would aſſure his owne head, by the danger of mine. But as for my part, I am marched, as you ſee, euen vnto this place, and doe willingly thruſt my ſelfe into this danger, and to expoſe my perſon againſt all hazards of fortune, for the ſafetie of you and the kingdome. For feare then leaſt any ſhould excuſe his owne cowardlines vpon the ſafetie of my life, and that nothing ſhould be imputed to my proceedings in time to come, I will (by Gods grace) march to morrow with you in perſon, into that place which you would not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> goe vnto without me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe vehement words being ſpoken, and this ſuddaine reſolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended by the applauding of many, but with the admiration of all thoſe preſent; proclamation was preſently made of his departure the next day. Certaine of the wiſer and grauer heads, who were not ignorant of the great inconuenience which might happen of this vnconſiderate voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, importuned to diſſwade the contrarie, but it was in vaine. The Armie being then diſlodged from Tholne, vpon the euen of the aſſumption of our Ladie, they arriued at the towne of Zeckzard, and the day following at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha. Vpon this bruite and certaine knowledge which was had of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Armie, which daily approached, commaund was giuen to gather the Hungars together (who were diſperſed in the Villages) and to repaire all to Batha. <hi>George Pauline</hi> Biſhop of Boznia, a man of good and commendable life, and well ſeene in the ciuill Law, was ſent vnto <hi>Paul Tomoree</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe him of what he knew, and that he ſhould finde the King in that place.</p>
            <p>They being all arriued in this towne, and the time requiring to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſome one to commaunde the Armie (which was deferred vntill that day, not without great ill hap of ouerſight:) the King hauing heard the particular aduiſe of euery one, and ſeeing the greateſt part eſteemed the <note place="margin">Paul Tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree a graie Fryer chiefe commaunder of the Armie.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Frier to be ſufficient for this charge, proclaymed him chiefe commaunder of the Armie, ioyning with him for his colleague, Counte <hi>George</hi> of Sepuſa, brother to the Vayuode. Yet all of them notwithſtanding approued not this election, and chiefly they diſliked that election which was made of the Fryer: neuertheleſſe all willingly obeyed theſe Chiefetaines commaund.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tomoree</hi> knowing the pleaſure of the King to be ſuch, for his owne parte refuſed of a long time this charge, ſometime alleadging his profeſſion and ignorance, then the corporall imbecilitie which was in him, not being able to endure ſo great trauaile; ſaying further, that the King had excellent ſecular Lords, to whom this charge did better appertaine. He named the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Counte Palatine there preſent, and the Vayuode abſent, both well experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the conduct of Armies, and that they were the moſt practiſed and experienced in all Hungarie, to employ their commaund in ſuch actions. He alſo named Counte <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Peren,</hi> who although they were young, yet neuertheleſſe had no defect of vnderſtanding, and men who were more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21983:16"/>
worthie to manage and conduct this armie then he. Further, he declared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the diſabilitie which was in himſelfe, to performe the due of ſuch a charge, hauing neuer ſeene the manner of ſuch warre, as now preſented it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maieſtie: and in the end he concluded he was not able, neither would he vſe that authoritie, although the King commaunded it, no, if his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie would cut off his head.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus as well in publike, as in priuate, vſed theſe or the like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with like proteſtations in vaine: the King notwithſtanding proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him Lieutenant of the Armie, giuing him (as we haue ſayd) Counte <hi>George,</hi> brother of the Vayuode, for his companion and colleague. He alſo would not haue accepted of this charge, and inſtantly deſired that his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> would not doe him that honour. But in the end he ſubmitted himſelfe to doe therein his endeauour, with this condition, that he might haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther companion but his brother <hi>Paul</hi> (for ſo he called him) and that ſo ſoone as his owne brother the Vayuode ſhould arriue, it ſhould be permitted him to be diſmiſſed of his charge. This was eaſily graunted him, for that alreadie it was determined at the beginning to make the Vayuode, with <hi>Paul Tomoree</hi> and Counte <hi>Christopher,</hi> commaunders of the Armie.</p>
            <p>After the election of theſe Chieftaines, they went together to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, concerning a place conuenient and commodious to incampe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues neere the towne of Mohacz. This towne apperteyned to the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of fiue Churches, and is ſcituated vpon the ſide of Danubius, betweene <note place="margin">The diſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mohacz and the place of the battaile.</note> Batha and the mouth of Drauus. A little aboue Batha, Danubius doth begin to open, and make two currants, of which the largeſt ſtreame runneth a long the further Hungrie, and paſſeth with a gentle calme ſource, ſtretching it ſelfe in thoſe great and large plaines. The other part watereth the townes of Batha and Mohacz. Theſe two armes of one riuer, ioyning together againe in one, and ſhutting vp beneath Mohacz, make an Iland. This borrowgh or towne of Mohacz, is ſufficiently knowen: it is enuironed on all ſides with a great plaine, which is not any thing couered either with woods or hills. Towards the Weſt, it looketh to the towne of fiue Churches, a towne of good fame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> before the loſſe thereof. On the North ſide there is the towne of Batha; and towards the Leauant, it is bathed with that arme of Danubius, which we haue ſayd to be the leſſe of the two. Towards the South, it doth behold the waters of Drauus, which is foure miles from it. Betweene that and this towne, are certaine little hilles, planted with Vines and Mariſhes there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. In this compaſſe there is not farre from the towne a water, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather to be a Mariſh, then a water or riuer that did runne: and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants doe call it Kraſſo. Beneath that ſtange, <hi>Tomoree</hi> was incamped with fiue or 6000. horſe, who were part of thoſe which at the firſt were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and part of others, who with <hi>Peter Peren,</hi> and other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he cauſed to come from beyond Danubius by the Kings commaund, to ioyne together with the bodie of the Armie.</p>
            <p>The place then being choſen commodious, to lodge the Armie by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hacz, and the ſame being directed and appointed by <hi>Leonard Gnomsky,</hi> and the quarters thereof for euery companie: <hi>Tomoree</hi> went with <hi>Peter Peren</hi> to his Souldiours, who were yet incamped beyond the Mariſhes (as hath been
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21983:16"/>
ſaid) to leade them, if they could, to the Kings Campe. They being now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> at that place, and giuing notice to the Captaines, that it was the Kings pleaſure, and his alſo, to commaund them to retire, and ioyne themſelues to the bodie of the armie, wherein the King was in perſon. Hereupon the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours began to murmure, and be angrie, ſaying, that they would make them abandon the enemie, againſt whom it was more needfull to march, and with whom it was expedient forthwith to ioyne their hands, if they would ſhew themſelues men: and in doing the contrarie, it were an imagination of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not to fight: that thoſe Princes who counſelled his Maieſtie to ſuch effeminate things, were giuen much to ſlouth: that the King (ſaid they) ſhould come preſently and affront the enemie with them: the victorie is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> within our hands: we ſufficiently know that they are infinite in number, and that they haue as many Cannons with them as is poſſible, but they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out armour, and not any thing exerciſed to the warre: there is not the tenth, no not the twentith of them, which hath a weapon wherewith to offend or harme vs: they further alleadged, that they were aſſured that thoſe braue and valiant ſouldiours, which the Turke had, were all dead and ſlaine at the ſiege of Belgrade, and after that at Rhodes: that the valiant and couragious Commaunders of the armie ſhould doe (ſaid they) with their companions, that which beſeemed wiſe and vertuous Captaines, and we aſſure our ſelues that all things ſhall frame to our deſires: that he would bring the King, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> withdraw him, &amp; all the other hardy combattants out of the throng of thoſe idle Prieſts, &amp; others who refuſeth the fight, who go about by their faſhions and counſels, which is cowardly and effeminate, to corrupt and diſcourage our King, who is indued with corporall beautie, and marueilous courage, and by this their idle meanes, of a fayre and well accompliſhed yong Prince, they ſhould make him anſwerable vnto themſelues.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe ſouldiours did thus vaunt themſelues, all the armie was lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged almoſt intirely together, euery man in his quarter. The King did not yet depart from the towne of Ville-neufue of the Macedonians, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Batha and Mohacz, hauing with him but a ſmall troupe, being there in great danger, if the enemie, who was not farre of, might haue diſcouered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him. But fortune reſerued the death of the King vntill ſome other time, wherein he ſhould dye more gloriouſly for the good of his countrie. In the meane while, in the night whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King was aſleep, there arriued at the ſame time <hi>Michael Podnamisky,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from the Campe, and ſent on the behalfe of the Commanders, who came to giue aduertiſement, that the Turk had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie paſſed the riuer of Drauus, with the greateſt part of his armie, and that the reſt followed with all expedition; that the fight could not be deferred; that all the Captaines vrgently importuned his Maieſtie to come with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the Campe, and aduiſe with them concerning the battaile. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>The King vnderſtanding this newes by <hi>Podnamisky,</hi> called to councell that ſmall companie that was with him, acquainting them with this buſines, demaunding of them what was to be done in ſo doubtfull and vrgent a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His Maieſtie then did call to minde the counſell and opinion which the Vayuode and Counte <hi>Christopher</hi> had ſent him, by thoſe who were diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards them, who certaine daies before were returned, by which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21983:17"/>
from them both, they greatly blamed the counſell of thoſe who had brought the King into that place ſo neere the enemy, before it was time, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and that it had been better for him to remaine at Buda, or to encampe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemie, vntill all the forces of the kingdome were vnited together. They had alſo, by the ſame meſſengers, exhorted the King not to fight with the enemie, at leaſt not before their comming. The Vayuode par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſent him word by <hi>Iohn Statile,</hi> that hee would bring with him from Tranſiluania great troupes of ſouldiours, who for force and number ſhould be ſo ſecure, that the King, vpon their fidelitie and valour, might haue a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hope of victorie. This came into the Kings minde, and he well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of this counſell; and of the other part he well weighed that which the Chiefes of the armie did importune him, to whom if he condiſcended not, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the enemie being ſo nigh, and his ſouldiours hauing ſo great a deſire to fight, he well ſaw that the blame and euill of all that might happen, would bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, and that he ſhould bee found culpable in omitting ſo good an occaſion. His minde being diſturbed with theſe difficulties, he determined (before hee reſolued of any thing) to proue his Leaders and Chieftaines of the armie, if they thought it good to attend the Vayuode of Tranſiluania, and Counte <hi>Christopher,</hi> and that if in the meane time the enemie approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neerer, or preſſed, them, whither they ſhould remoue the Campe into ſome other place of better ſafetie. For this cauſe he ſent to the Campe (euen at the ſame inſtant that <hi>Podnamisky</hi> was come) the Chauncellor (who was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> then with the King) to perſwade the principall of the armie, yea the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders themſelues, namely, the Archbiſhop of Strigonium, and Counte Palatine (vpon whoſe opinion all the others depended) that they ſhould find out ſome good meane to retire and deferre the fight. He was commaunded further to let them vnderſtand, all which was reported to the King, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Vayuode and Counte <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and to explaine vnto them how cleere and apparant the ruine of the kingdome was, if the King, with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes, and the flower of all the Nobilitie of the realme, ſhould expoſe themſelues to ſo eminent a daunger. For if it happened (which we ought to be mindfull of, conſidering the multitude of ſouldiours, and the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for warre of the enemies, in compariſon of the ſmall number of his Maieſties forces which he now hath) that the King ſhould bee ouercome, who ſhould afterwards hold backe or hinder the enemie, but that with little difficultie he might enioy all Hungarie? He declared vnto them, that it was moſt expedient the Campe ſhould bee remoued into ſome other place of better ſecuritie, or to retire backe a little, if the enemie ſhould inforce them thereto, vntill the Vayuode with the Tranſiluanians, the Ban with the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonians, Counte <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> with the Croatians, Bohemians, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians, Sleſians, and other ſuccours ſhould come: that Hungarie ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> receiue leſſe loſſe, though the enemies ſhould ouerharrie from Mohacz vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Poſon, putting all whatſoeuer they did incounter to fire and ſword, then that ſuch an armie ſhould miſcarrie and bee ouerthrowne by one battaile, in which the King himſelfe, and ſo many great Princes, and chiefe perſons of the realme ſhould be. For they being ſlaine, what hope of reenforcing new ſuccours, could reſt to the kingdome? But the King, with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21983:17"/>
ſo many Lords, and ſuch braue ſouldiours remaining ſafe, and preſeruing all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> things in good eſtate, they may finde ſingular content and ſecuritie vnder the gouernment of ſuch a King, who both for his parentage and alliance, is reſpected throughout all Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>The Chauncellor hauing the ſame night made this ſpeech, firſt of all to the chiefeſt, viſiting and talking with them apart, and after in generall to all the Councell: his reaſons neuertheleſſe were of ſo ſmall efficacie, as if he had ſaid nothing to them: ſuch was the haughtie courage of euery one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eager to fight vnder a vaine hope of victorie, being notwithſtanding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe by a certaine feare withheld, which did hinder them from diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the fight, although the contrarie was ſo earneſtly deſired by the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>The King then came by breake of day to his Campe, and for that the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which did bring by water his Maieſties Tents and Pauilions, were not yet come from Buda, he retired himſelf for the preſent into a Biſhops houſe, which was adioyning to the towne, there to proue that, which as yet he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not by the Chauncellor. They commaunded the Councellors of all eſtates and nations, to aſſemble before the King, which failed not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to viſit him with many expert Captaines and hardie ſouldiours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were certaine Bohemians and Morauians, who were alreadie arriued there. In this aſſemblie it was propounded to the Councellors and ſouldiours what was needfull to be done, not any being yet come from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Tranſiluania, Slauonia, Croatia, Bohemia, nor Germanie, whereof the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part were preſently to arriue, as was aſſuredly expected: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the enemie was very nigh, being no more then two miles from the Kings Campe, who vpon this occaſion, as it was thought, could not, nor would not, deferre the battaile vntill another time. Vpon this, their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was asked which of theſe two ſeemed moſt expedient, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the Campe elſewhere, and for the preſent to delay the fight, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe which daily were expected; or elſe to make triall of fortune in giuing the enemie battaile. At this councell was preſent <hi>Paul Tomoree,</hi> who <note place="margin">Paul Tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree aduiſeth to fight.</note> the night before, was commaunded to come from the other Campe for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſame purpoſe. Hee thought it not amiſſe to fight. The King marueiling vpon what hope he had ſuch courage, would willingly haue diſſwaded him from ſuch a purpoſe, and demanded of him, in the preſence of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, of what ſtrength his forces were, and the ſtrength of the enemie. For there was no doubt but that he very well knew it, yea better then any other, by meanes of his diſcouerers and ſpials, which alwaies he ſent and had in the enemies Campe, and by reaſon alſo of many enemies which daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him. <hi>Tomoree</hi> anſwered; touching the firſt point, in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he thought that there were no more but 20000. fighting men, as well in the Kings Campe, as in his (thoſe two being diuided, as wee haue ſayd): <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but that for certaine he knew the enemie was 300000. The ſtanders by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly aſtoniſhed to heare their number ſo ſmall, in reſpect of the great multitude of the enemies: <hi>Tomoree</hi> preſently adioyned vnto his former ſpeeches, that for al their multitude they were not to feare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in regard that their great number was for the moſt part without armour, and not any thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21983:18"/>
acquainted with the warre. The King further demaunded, how many he thought the enemies were, armed, and in ſtate to fight. <hi>Tomoree</hi> anſwered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that they were 70000. This number ſeemed yet to all, ouer great, in reſpect of the Kings armie, euery one affirming, that <hi>Tomoree</hi> ſaid, the Turkes had 300. great Cannons.</p>
            <p>In the meane time whileſt that theſe affaires were conſidered of, as well by the couſell and inſtigation of the Fryer, as by the deſire, and courage of all the ſouldiours, greatly importuning to fight (except ſuch, whowere, I know not how, poſſeſt by a fooliſh feare, that durſt not proffer themſelues, nor openly declare their opinions:) there came at that time certaine meſſengers from the other Campe, who being admitted before the Councell, ſayd, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> they were charged to impart ſome matter in the behalfe of thoſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Campe, as well to the King, as to the Councell, and then being in place apart, acquainted the King with the effect of their meſſage, and after went in againe with the King to the Councell, who in the name of all the reſt which had ſent them, aduertiſed them not to diſſwade the King from fight: that they were well aſſured of the enemies force, although they were of farre greater number: that the victorie was alreadie in their hands, ſo that they would preſently ayde them with that good fortune, which God did preſent vnto them. Beſides, they encouraged all the Lords who were of the Councell, to march forward with the King, and ioyne his Campe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to theirs, which was neerer the enemie, and lodged in a place more commodious to aſſaile them. In the end, inſteed of gentle perſwations, they vſed threatning tearmes againſt thoſe, who diſſwaded the King to the contrarie, denouncing to them death, and aſſuring them, that if they would not preſently ioyne the Kings Campe with theirs, they would without delay march againſt them, and force the enemies to acquite themſelues from thence.</p>
            <p>Vpon ſuch ſpeeches ſo vehemently vrged in the Counell, the Kings preſence, and of all the other Lords; there being alſo thoſe among them, who were of a founder and deeper iudgement, for the good of the common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> weale, and yet being greatly terrified by ſuch vnciuill threatning: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to giue them battaile, without expecting that the Vayuode, Counte <hi>Christopher,</hi> or the Bohemians, could in time arriue at the day of battaile. <hi>Francis Bathian,</hi> Ban of Croatia, (who was at that time not farre from the fiue Churches with his troupes of Slauonians) gaue ſome hope to be at the Campe within two daies, as it afterward fell out. There were ſome among them (after all things being determined, and the Councell riſen) that did greatly blame the reſolution, which was determined, ſo ſuddainely to fight. <hi>Francis Peren</hi> Biſhop of Varadin was one of them, a man young, quicke, and of a braue ſpirite, who wrote and indited his letters ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> well, that not any Hungar whoſoeuer, did ſurpaſſe him in that art, except it were <hi>Thomas Zalahazy</hi> Biſhop of Veſprimia. But yet he had been farre more commended, if he had as well imployed his wit to vertue, as he otherwaies ſpent his time in ſlourh, and other friuolous matters, in the which young men of good parentage, doe too often take pleaſure in, to their owne ruine, and ouerthrow of their Countrie. He then, as it were,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21983:18"/>
diuining of that which preſently happened; ſaid to the King, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great admiration of all the ſtanders by: that that day which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <note place="margin">Spoken meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> to fight (ſith their reſolution was ſuch) ſhould be dedicated vnto 20000. <q>Hungarian Martyrs (the number of the Armie being no more) ſlaine for the religion of Ieſus Chriſt, vnder the conduct of <hi>Paul Tomoree,</hi> and that they ſhould ſend the Chauncelor to Rome, to haue them canoniſed (as men ſay) if ſo be he then eſcaped the battaile, for that he was well knowne to the Pope, and Cardinals, by reaſon of an ambaſſage which he had been vſed in, to his Holines.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I would to God that this Biſhop had been a falſe Prophet. There may <note place="margin">Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading vnto fight.</note> be ſome that would accuſe the Hungarians of ouer much temeritie, for that they ſo feruently deſired the Battaile, and they ſay this hardnes ought rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to be named raſhnes and fooliſhnes, then by the name of vertue. And ſurely I ſee not, but that they haue reaſon to maintaine at this preſent, ſuch their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But yet they may be ignorant of many things which incited the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereunto, whereby they might eaſily haue drawne vnto ſuch a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea euen the wiſeſt and greateſt Captaines among them: and amongſt other things this marueilous and incredible ardencie (as fatall to all ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours) and the hope of victorie, which euery one in his own conceite, thought himſelfe certaine and ſure of. Beſides it was thought, that <hi>Tomoree,</hi> had ſome ſecret notice, and ſpeciall practiſes with many of the Turkiſh armie, namely with thoſe who were Chriſtians, or with ſuch as were borne of Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and alſo with thoſe who had the conduct and gouernment of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, part of whom were Almaignes, and part Italians. It was alſo further conſidered, that the retraict (the enemie being ſo nigh) could not be done, without putting themſelues in great daunger, ſpecially the Turke hauing ſuch nimble and ſwift horſe to charge vpon the backe of thoſe who ſhould be in the rerewarde, in which kinde of fight they are more ſtrong and fierce, then in an incountering charge. The battaile then being thus determined and appointed, order was giuen for all things neceſſarie thereunto. Firſt of all <hi>Tomoree</hi> went to his Campe, which, as we haue ſaid, was not farre from thence, and with much a doe perſwaded his men to retyre a little backe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he would ioyne with the armie of the Kings. The day following, their Campe was ioyned with the bodie of the armie, halfe a mile beneath Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hacz, neuertheleſſe there was ſome little ſpace betweene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At the ſame inſtant came from Buda the Veſſels fraughted with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, powder, and other munition for the warre. With thoſe alſo were ſent downe nine peeces of Artillerie, which came from Vienna. A little after came alſo 200. ſouldiours of <hi>Alexis Turzon</hi> with certaine Cannons: himſelfe with the Biſhop of Veſprimia were remayning at Buda with the Queene. Theſe two were appoynted for the guarde and ſecuritie of her Maieſtie, and did ſerue her at the retraict and flight, which afterward ſhe was conſtrayned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to take, and continued a long time in her ſeruice. The Ban of Croatia arriued the Sonday before the Battaile with three gallant troupes. There was of them 3000. horſe, and not ſo many of foote. He was accompanied with <hi>Iohn Tahy, Iohn Banfy,</hi> and certaine other of the principall Lords of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Slauonia. The day following, there came alſo in the morning to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21983:19"/>
Campe (the King being there and ranged his men in Battaile, for that it was thought the ſame day the enemie would fight) <hi>Simon Erdeund</hi> Biſhop of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Zagrabia, with his brother <hi>Peter Erdeund,</hi> bringing with them in good order and well armed, more then 700. horſe. At the ſame time came thither <hi>Stephen Azel</hi> with 300. horſe, which <hi>Iohn Bornemiſſe</hi> had ſent to the ayde of the King, with many thouſands of crownes, which was the laſt preſent, made by the father to his nurſling. About the euening of the ſame day <hi>Iohn Zerechen</hi> came with 2000. foote, which he had gathered along the riuer Drauus, aſwell in his owne territories, as in the Chapter of the Church of the fiue Churches, they being reported to be very good archers. During theſe three daies, many other came to the Campe, eſpecially thoſe who were nigh, among whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> was <hi>Philip More</hi> Biſhop of the fiue Churches, and his brother <hi>Vladiſlas More.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The forces of Lewis and of Solyman.</note> This Armie being thus aſſembled together to the number of 24. or 25000. men, not counting the companies which were on the water, who ſerued not at the day of Battaile, the enemie being with his puiſſant Armie of 300000. men, no further from them then two miles: three dayes were expyred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Battaile was begun, during which time, daylie skirmiſhes, and fine ſtratagems interchangeably paſt betweene them, wherein ſtill the Turks receiued more damage then the Hungars. In the time of their aboade, it was alſo conſulted how and in what place they ſhould fight with the enemie, and in what ſort they ſhould ordaine and range the Battaile, and in what place thereof they ſhould appoint the King to be: where and how they ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> range the Caualarie and Infantrie, and where they ſhould plant the artillerie, whereof the Hungars had but 24. pieces, which were little to be compared to thoſe of the enemies. Before, they determined and aduiſed, for the ſafegard <note place="margin">The meanes to preſerue the Kings perſon in the Battaile.</note> of his Maieſtie, ſome were of opinion, that it was conuenient for him to be a good diſtance from the Battaile, with ſome thouſands of his beſt troupes, but ſeeing the Armie could not ſpare them, and for that the ſouldiours would haue him preſent therein, (following their auncient cuſtome) it was aduiſed that ſome one ſhould repreſent his perſon in his coate-armour: but preſently they thought that the ſame could not be done without being diſcouered, and without great tumult of the Armie; the which by this deede would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> greatly diſcouraged. But in the ende it was concluded, that ſeeing the fight did ſeeme doubtfull, ſome purpoſely appointed ſhould haue the charge to preſerue the King, if euill did betide, and that then they ſhould conduct him out of the throng, as ſoone as they ſaw the Battalions ſo broken that there could be noe more hope to reaſſure and encourage them, being ſo terrified. This charge was committed to <hi>Iaſper Raskay,</hi> to <hi>Valentine Toronke,</hi> and to <hi>Iohn Kalay,</hi> moſt excellent men, and doubtleſſe very faithfull to the King. There was alſo appointed certaine ſwift and light horſes, by meanes of which the King might eſcape, if neede required. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
            </p>
            <p>But now to come to the order of the battaile: there were many, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <note place="margin">The order of the Bataile.</note> others, <hi>Leonard Gnomsky</hi> was of opinion, that it ſhould be very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to inskonſe the armie with the wagons (whereof the Campe was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furniſhed) like the fight at Barriers and vpon a Bulwarke, alleadging, that by that meanes they ſhould fruſtrate and annoy the enemie from their hemming them in, which was the onely and materiall thing they moſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21983:19"/>
               <hi>Radich Boſich</hi> did well allow of this deuiſe, as alſo <hi>Paul Bacchie,</hi> who was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſaid to haue been in three ſeuerall battailes giuen by <hi>Soliman</hi> againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This counſell then was accepted of, and thought good by all; the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution whereof was committed to <hi>Gnomsky,</hi> and certaine other, but it was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected more ſlowly then was needfull, for it was but thought vpon the night before the battaile: and ſo this policie, among many other, was quite negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The 29. of Auguſt (which is dedicated to the beheadding of S. <hi>Iohn)</hi> being the day of battaile, the armie of the Hungars was ranged and lead by thoſe (which wee haue ſpoken of) in ſuch ſort, that they aduanced the front of their armie as farre as was poſſible, to the end, they might bee the leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by the enemie, and after they diuided it into two battalions. In the firſt, the Commanders thereof had no certaine place of aboade, but thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it more needful to be vigilant ouer thoſe places, wherin their preſence might ſtrengthen and incourage their ſouldiours. On the right wing of it, was the Ban of Croatia, with <hi>Iohn Tahy;</hi> and the left wing was gouerned by <hi>Peter Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> in the abſence of the Vayuode of Tranſiluania. In the firſt battalion there was many of the principalleſt of the armie, and among them there was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Poloczy, Francis Hommonay, Gabriel Peren, Thomas Zechy, Andrew Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Emeric Cibak,</hi> and many others. The artillerie was planted next after the firſt rankes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Battalion, which we commonly name the maine battaile, and in which was placed the King, was more furniſhed with horſemen then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> footmen, who for the ſmall number they had, were placed in the flankes of the horſemen. Betweene this Battalion and the other (which we will name the Vauntgard) there was no more diſtance then one might throw a ſtone. In the battaile before the rankes (wherein the King was) there was three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rankes, who all of them, for the moſt part, were gentlemen of the Kings chamber, and many Barons of the countrie, who were vnder the charge of <hi>Nicholas Tharczay,</hi> a man of good courage, and very faithfull to his Prince. There were alſo the two Controlers of the Kings houſe, <hi>Peter Korlatkey,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Trepka,</hi> Polanders. <hi>Stephen Slijk,</hi> a Bohemian, was with the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians and Morauians hard by the Kings perſon, and before him. After the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> three rankes followed that of the Kings, in the midſt of which was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Of ſpirit, beautie, and vertue all one</l>
               <l>With that which is celestiall,</l>
               <l>Bearing a minde to his countries boone,</l>
               <l>But Destinies made deniall.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Vpon the right hand of the King was the Archbiſhop of Strigonium, and the Biſhop of Zagrabia; and the Biſhop of Agria was ſent from Batha to Buda. Next vnto him of Zagrabia, were the Biſhops of Varadine, the fiue Churches, and of Sirmia. Thoſe of Iauarin and Vacchia, were vpon the left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hand. Behinde the Chauncellor were placed the Biſhops of Nitria, and Boſnia, and the Prouoſt of Albe; after whom were the Secretaries, and the Groomes of the chamber. On the left ſide of the King, and neere vnto his perſon, there was a place voyde for the Counte Palatine, who although he had the gowte, and not without great paine could ſit vpon his horſe, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21983:20"/>
he did valiantly his dutie, ſometimes being in the Vauntgard, and by and by in the battaile. Whileſt the Palatine continued not in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> place, there were certaine Barons kept themſelues about the King, and thoſe two Biſhops which we haue before named; behind the King were <hi>Czetricz, Malliart,</hi> and <hi>Horuuath,</hi> Maſter of his horſe. All theſe Lords had behind them the beſt and moſt reſolute men they could chuſe for their gard and defence. In the midſt of this battaile was ſeene the Enſigne royall, which was borne by <hi>Iohn Dragfy,</hi> Marſhall of the Kings houſe, which among the Seculars is the third dignitie next to the King. This battaile was enuironed with light horſe, and certaine footmen vpon the flankes. Vpon the right wing, after the Biſhops &amp; Secretaries, were ranged theſe three rankes, in which (as we haue ſet downe) was placed the Kings perſon. The place wherein this armie was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> thus ſeated and ranged in battaile, was diſtant from Mohacz one mile, and <note place="margin">The place of the battaile.</note> from Danubius halfe a mile, hauing neere vnto it a long and large plaine, which was not any thing annoyed with wood, buſhes, hils, or water; but only vpon the left hand towards Danubius, there was a muddie mariſh, and ouergrowne with ruſhes, within the which afterward many men loſt their liues. Before the armie, a farre off, was a little hill, which was of great length, and in forme of a Theater, behinde the which <hi>Soliman</hi> was incamped. At the foote of this hill there was a little village with a Church, it was named Feulduuar, and in that village was planted the artillerie of the enemie, with many ſouldiours, ſpecially of Ianiſaries, who on this ſide the houſes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> village, tooke vp a large place of ground, by reaſon of their long and thicke troupes: among thoſe was <hi>Soliman,</hi> as after was knowne. This artillerie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus planted, was as in a valley, and for that cauſe was leſſe offenſiue to the Hungars, then if it had been vpon the plaine, in ſo much that the feare thereof was more offenſiue, then the hurt. The armie being thus ranged in good order, in the morning preſently after the Sunne was vp, the day being cleere and calme, Counte Palatine lead the King out of his place, and did <note place="margin">Counte Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſheweth the perſon of the King, to encourage the Hungars.</note> ſhew him to all the ſouldiours, riding along the rankes of the armie, as he had done the ſame three daies before, to the end, to fruſtrate the diſtruſt which ſome had, that his Maieſtie was not preſent in the battaile, openly ſhewing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> him to all with his hand, and publiſhing aloude, that the King was reſolute, and readie to endure all extremities, and euen death it ſelfe, for his countries weale, for the vnſpotted religion of Ieſus Chriſt, and for their wiues and children: declaring to them, on his part, that they muſt ſhew themſelues men, and bee mindfull that they were Hungars: and to be ſuch, who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as hardie and valiant defenders of the Chriſtian publike weale, had heretofore brought away ſo many and ſo excellent Trophees, from ſuch and the like enemies, as theſe were, who they ſaw before their eyes: that they ſhould not be aſtoniſhed at the multitude of their enemies, for that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> conſiſted not in the pluralitie, but in the dexteritie and courge of the ſouldiours: that God on high would aſſiſt them, they fighting for his holy religion; that the ſafetie, not onely of their owne countrie (which the Turks would vſurpe and tyrannize) but alſo of all Chriſtendome, was now in their vnconquerable hands.</p>
            <p>After that the King and Counte Palatine had thus reuiſited all the rankes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21983:20"/>
of his men of armes and footmen, and vſed to all of them the like orations, the King retired to his former place. A great part of the day was ſpent in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the enemie, who hauing onely ſent a ſmall troupe of his people to skirmiſh, he himſelfe kept behinde the hils, imagining (as it appeared) either <note place="margin">1</note> to draw the Hungars within the ſtraights of theſe hils; or faining to deferre <note place="margin">2</note> the fight vntill the next day; he might in the meane time aſſaile them, and in the night following (they being vnprouided) to ſet vpon them in their Campe, which he might eaſily doe, as well for the infinit number of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as alſo for the great ſtore of Cannon which he had: or elſe that he might <note place="margin">3</note> rather moleſt them by a protracting fight. They knew not which of theſe three deuiſes the enemie would execute, but all the day the Hungars were in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> great doubt of the Turkes reſolution, vntill, towards euening, they perceiued the troupes of the enemie to approach by a valley, which was on the right hand vnder thoſe hils, being onely diſcouered by the tops of their laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The Frier thinking that they which now came in ſight were of the Vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, to force and breake his Campe, or to enuiron his people, commaunded <hi>Iaſper Raskay,</hi> with two others, who were appointed for the gard of the Kings perſon (as is ſaid before) to diſcouer what the enemie would attempt, and force them take ſome other way. <hi>Iaſper</hi> knowing what charge was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, to haue a ſpeciall eye and care of the Kings perſon, moſt honeſtly refuſed (as much as he could) that commiſſion: but in the end perceiuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Frier did greatly preſſe him thereto, and that the King did not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his commaund, diſdaining leaſt the refuſing he made vpon ſo good and iuſt a cauſe, ſhould be imputed to him as fearfull and cowardly, ſuddenly he ſet ſpurres to his horſe, and with his two companions, being followed of all the companies of ſouldiours which he commaunded, aduanced themſelues, with this hope neuertheleſſe (wherof they held themſelues aſſured) that they ſhould be able to returne in time, before the King ſhould haue need of them. They being ſet forward, although they were vncertaine whether the enemie would giue battaile that day or no, for it was alreadie three houres paſt noone: beſides, there were certaine of the principall of the armie, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> tired with ſo long an expectation of fight, were of opinion to ſound a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict, and retire themſelues to the Campe. The Frier hearing this ſudden <note place="margin">Paul doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune the fight.</note> motion, came with his companion towards the King, and did aduiſe him in any caſe not to delay the fight, alleadging, that there was leſſe daunger to fight now with part of the enemies armie, then to ſtay vntill the next day, at which time he was to fight againſt all their armie, and as for the reſt, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to doubt of victorie. At this his ſpeeches, the King incontinently commanded to ſound the alarme, and preſently all the Trumpets, Clarions, and Drummes made a marueilous and terrifying noiſe, and al the ſouldiours (following their accuſtomed manner) inuocating the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> made a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> confuſed noiſe of crying, and at the ſame inſtant one might perceiue the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to deſcend the hill, which was oppoſite againſt the Hungars, ſeeming by their rankes an infinite number, among whom was <hi>Soliman</hi> himſelfe. Then they gaue the King his head-peece, who vpon the receipt thereof, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked very pale, as a preſaging of euill fortune at hand. And then the ſignall to <note place="margin">A ſigne of euill hap to the King.</note>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:21983:21"/>
fight was giuen to thoſe who were in front, who very couragiouſly charged <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the battaile.</note> the enemie, and all their artillerie was alſo made readie and diſcharged. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this firſt incounter was not greatly offenſiue to the enemies: neuertheleſſe there was more ſlaine of them, then of the Hungars, in ſo much that they were forced to retire, being ſo hardly preſſed by the Chriſtians: whether it was by the force and courage of the Hungars, or the ſubtiltie of the enemie, endeuouring by that meanes to draw them on to the mouth of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that I know not. Then preſently <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> haſted to the King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to him that the Turkes had turned their backes, that the victorie was now in him, that he ſhould not doubt but ſet forward, and that it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preſently to ſecond his men, who were in chaſe of the enemie that fled. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Whereupon the King aduaunced forward in hap hazard: but when they came to the place where the firſt charge was giuen, there might you haue ſeene many bodies of the Hungars diſperſed ouer all the field, ſome mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, others halfe aliue, yet breathing. In the meane while, thoſe of the Vandgard purſuing the enemie, and valiantly fighting, the battaile of the Hungars approached to them with as much ſpeede as armed men could make, the left wing began to bend, and many quitted themſelues and fled, being feared (which I well beleeue) with the enemies Cannon, which then began to play among them. This did not a little aſtoniſh the battaile, whileſt thoſe who were in it, did heare the continuall and horrible whiſtling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of the bullets which paſſed through their rankes, and ouer their heads: and then the King was ſeene no more in the ranke where he was; whether it was <note place="margin">The loſſe of the King.</note> for that he paſſed beyond the firſt rankes, which were before him, (as wee haue noted, and as was before determined vpon, to the end that he ſhould not bee too much knowne, remaining in the ſame place) or whether that he was forced from the daunger by thoſe who were behinde him, for both the one and the other might well bee. Some ſaid, that hauing gone beyond the rankes which were neere him, he thruſt himſelfe into the front of the battaile, where hee valiantly fought with the enemie: but neither dare I affirme it, nor altogether denie it. For my part I know this for trueth, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
               <note place="margin">Theſe are the words of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, who was preſent at the battaile.</note> he was not found in that place, neither in the ranke wherein he was at the beginning, after the Cannon of the enemie began to play, and when thoſe of the left wing of the Vandgard were ſeene to flye. At the ſame inſtant was miſſing the Archbiſhop of Strigonium, who was ſide by ſide by the King, and alſo certaine others who were by his Maieſtie. I will not impoſe this fault of the loſſe of our King vpon thoſe, to whom he was committed in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie, nor to thoſe (which may be) carried him by force, or ill hap out of the battile; but euen to the hard fortune of the Hungars, to the end that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the loſſe of their King, they might not onely ſuffer that which they endured of a ſtranger, but alſo endure the infinite euill which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> felt, by their factious and domeſticall diſſentions, for the election of a new King, in place of him whom they had loſt; their ſinnes, no doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more worthie of a greater ſcourge and puniſhment. For wee know that both the one and the other, who had the charge to reſpect the Kings ſafetie, were moſt faithfull vnto his Maieſtie, and very deſirous to preſerue his life. And concerning thoſe three, who ought to haue had a watchfull eye vpon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21983:21"/>
him, it is moſt certaine they could not returne from the enemie, againſt whom they had been ſent, before our armie was put to flight: yea one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them was taken and ſuddenly deliuered. That which cauſeth mee to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more particularly of this action, is, through the vehemencie of griefe which I haue, by reaſon of a certaine man, who in a praier which he ſet forth, was not afeard falſely to call the Hungars, the forſakers of their King. But ſhould one eſteeme thoſe to haue forſaken and abandoned their King, who ſhewed vnto him all the duties that good and faithfull ſubiects owe vnto their Prince, and who alſo were well neere all ſlaine in that field, wherein his Maieſtie was found dead, &amp; who alſo by their death declared, how true and faithfull they were to their King, &amp; what great loue they beare to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie? But this goodly Oratour, who hath couched this in writing, and who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſo greatly iniurieth this nation, doth beſides ſo largely write ſuch a diſcourſe of this ouerthrow, that I am aſhamed of him: ſo impudently dareth he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulge to the worlds view, the hiſtorie of a thing which was altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to him. But to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The battaile of the Hungars being greatly troubled by this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as wee haue ſaid, and ſhaken in ſuch manner, that it altogether ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a flight; neuertheleſſe they fought a long time, not in that large plaine, but euen before the Cannons mouth of the enemie, which was but ten pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them: ſo that the Hungars, as well for the feare which they had thereof, as for the ſmoake which darkened them, were forced, for the moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> part, to deſcend into a valley adioyning to thoſe aforeſaid mariſhes, the reſt (notwithſtanding) continued ſtill fighting before the Cannon. In the end, thoſe who were retired into this valley, being returned againe to the fight, and ſeeing there was no meanes to ſupport the violence of the artillerie, and the ſmoake which ſtill thickened; one part of the armie being alreadie put <note place="margin">The diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiture of the Hungars.</note> to flight, they alſo were forced to turne their backes. Euery man then, as his commoditie would ſerue, began to flye, drawing for the moſt part towards that place, wherein an houre before they had paſſed in great mirth and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, and full of hope to obtaine the victorie, trauerſing their Camp, which was now alreadie ſacked and raſed by the enemies, wherein there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> remaining, but onely their footſteps and dead bodies.</p>
            <p>The Turkes ſeeing the flight of the Hungars, thinking it to bee but ſome ſtratagem, or elſe feeling themſelues wearie of the fight, continued a long time at a ſtay, in ſo much that they did not purſue them, in reſpect of the night, which had alreadie couered all the earth. This partly was the cauſe, and alſo the vehement raine that fell that night, for the ſafegard and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of many. The violence of the fight endured at the moſt but an houre and a halfe, and many were ſwallowed vp and ſmothered within that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. The bodie of the King (who was ſaid to haue ended his daies in that <note place="margin">The bodie of the King found dead.</note> place) was afterward found in a great whirle, or rift of earth, aboue Mohacz, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> halfe a mile on this ſide a little village which is called Czelie, the which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was then ouerflowed, more then it was wont to be, with Danubius: in that place he was ſtifled with his horſe vnder the water, being armed as he was at the battaile. And ſeeing wee ſhall ſpeake no more of this King, I will adde to, in this hiſtorie, one thing of him worthie the noting: and that is,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21983:22"/>
when he was newly borne, he had no skinne that couered his bodie, which he neuertheleſſe recouered by the helpe of Phiſitions, who by their art ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and helped the want and defect of nature. We haue heretofore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a certaine preſage of the pittifull end which ſhould happen to him, but the ſame might well haue been told him before as a deſtenie of that which afterward happened to him, during the time he gaue order for his affaires to reſiſt the enemies, according to the firſt newes which he had receiued. For he being at Buda, when he was at dinner, the gates of his Caſtle being ſhut, <note place="margin">A ſtrange apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> (as the cuſtome was) a certaine Ghoſt in forme and ſhape of a man, euill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured, with crookedlegs, came haulting and knocked at the gate, and with a loude ſhrill voyce, deſired to ſpeake with the King, to acquainte him with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> things which neerely concerned both the good of himſelfe and of the kingdome. His ſpeeches being not at the firſt heard by the guard, who were at the gate, (as it is the vſe in Princes courts) hee cried lowder, and with a horrible voyce demaunded againe whether they gaue the King notice thereof. In the end certaine of the companie being moued by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of this deformed Ghoſt: they demaunded of him what he would haue; but he replying, ſayd, that he would not reueale his ſecrets to any but to the King. This meſſage was preſently carried to his Maieſtie; who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thereof, ſent vnto him one of his ſeruants, in the beſt and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt apparell, and one who was next himſelfe, faining that he was the King, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> commaunding him to enquire what this fellow would ſay. This meſſenger comming before this Ghoſt, and asking of him in priuate what ſecret he would impart vnto him: the other denying that he was King (whereby he thought to abuſe him) with a high and loude voyce, he ſayd, that ſince the King would not heare him, he ſhould ſhortly periſh. Theſe words being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, he vaniſhed away, to the great aſtoniſhment of all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It is a diſcourſe ſomewhat neere vnto that of <hi>Saule;</hi> but yet different, for that which the one required was not offered to him; but this of it ſelfe, was preſented without ſeeking for it, which one may enterpret diuers waies.</p>
            <p>But let vs returne againe to the ſubiect of our hiſtorie. In this place where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the Kings bodie was founde, many others alſo loſt their liues. A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, was alſo found the bodies of <hi>Andrew Trepka,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Azel.</hi> It is ſaid that the Frier ended his life valliantly fighting in the Vauntgard; the day following his head being cut off, was carryed vpon the top of a launce round about the enemies Campe, in token of ioy, and ſome ſaid, that it was for a time placed before the Pauilion of <hi>Soliman.</hi> The day after the Battaile 1500. Hungers who were taken priſoners, among whom were the chiefeſt of the Nobilitie, being all commaunded to be ſet in a rounde forme, were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beheaded, their bloud, ſeruing in ſtead of a ſacrifice to the Gods of theſe Infidels. Very few priſoners had been ſaued, if it had not been to informe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and giue them notice of ſome ſpeciall matters which <hi>Soliman,</hi> and <hi>Abraham Baſcha</hi> were deſirous to knowe. Among thoſe was <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek,</hi> which in the Hungariſh language ſignifieth Duke, as he was indeede, and the Kings Treaſorer. <hi>Iohn Pileczky,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Maczieouusky</hi> Polanders were alſo of that number. They were gentelmen of the Kings chamber, and being returned vnto the Queene, they diſcouered many matters, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21983:22"/>
for the breuitie of this hiſtorie we will omit to write of. <hi>Michael Fekete,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Bartholmew Martine</hi> were alſo ſaued from death, and within a while after were redeemed, paying a great ranſome. Among thoſe which dyed in the fight and flight, beſides the King, were theſe: <hi>Ladiſlas Salcane</hi> Archbiſhop <note place="margin">Theſe ſlaine in the Battaile.</note> of Strigonium; <hi>Paul Tomoree</hi> Biſhop of Colocenſe and Lieutenaunt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Armie: <hi>Francis Peren</hi> Biſhop of Varadine: <hi>Philip More</hi> Biſhop of the fiue Churches: <hi>Blaiſe Paxy</hi> Biſhop of Iauerin: <hi>Francis Gzacholy</hi> Biſhop of Chenat: <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Pauline</hi> Biſhop of Boſnia: <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Zapolia</hi> Count of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſa the other commaunder of the Armie: <hi>Iohn Dragfy</hi> Prouoſt of the Kings houſe: <hi>Francis Orzag</hi> chiefe gentelmen of the Kings chamber: <hi>Peter Corlathy,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Trepka</hi> Captaines of the watch at the gate: <hi>Simon Horuuath</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> chiefe taſter: <hi>Thomas Zechy: Gabriel Peren: Ambrioſe Zarchan: Anthonie Poloczy: Mathias Czethingny,</hi> Counte of Francapin: <hi>Sigiſmonde Branſy: Francis Hampo: Iohn Bathian: Stephen Slÿk</hi> a Bohemian, with certaine other Bohemians and Morauians. And theſe were the principall Barons of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie. Among the Nobles and other Lords of the Countrie, there are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of note <hi>Francis Balaſſe: Nicholas Tharza: Iohn Paxy: Iohn Iſtuuanfy: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meric Warday: Michael Podnamisky: George Orlouuchicz</hi> Captaine of Segin: <hi>Stephen Azel</hi> Caſtelane of Poſon: <hi>Sigiſmonde Pogan: Iohn Torualy: Iohn</hi> and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Kalnay: Nicholas Forgach,</hi> and beſides theſe about 500. other. As for the foote men, there eſcaped three or foure thouſand, and they were in all 12. or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 13000. There was remayning of their Captaines no more then <hi>Hanibal Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryan.</hi> All the peeces of Artillerie as well thoſe which were planted before the Battaile, as thoſe which were remayning within the Campe, and in the boates, were all taken by the enemie; the charge thereof was giuen too late, being but the night before the fight, to <hi>Iohn Hadek,</hi> a man of good courage, and well managed in ſuch affaires, &amp; who had alwaies frequented the Kings court, of whom he was ſo loued, that few had the like fauour of his Maieſtie. The night and day after this vnfortunate Battaile, the enemies running all ouer, made wonderfull waſte and ruine of all the neighbour countries, ſet fire on all, not ſparing any perſon, hauing no regarde to ſexe nor age, nor to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> any religion, executing vpon the poore people all cruell and inhumaine acts. My wit cannot ſufficiently write and bewayle the calamitie of this whole night, and the dayes following, being ſo great and intollerable for all this part of Hungarie, which we haue named to be on this ſide the riuer: that I cannot be perſwaded, that euer any barberous enemie, hath elſewhere vſed the like crueltie. Amongſt ſuch miſeries, there happened one extreame and vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallaccident, the like whereof was neuer heard before, and this it was; that the poore and wretched mothers buried aliue their ſucking Infants, for feare themſelues ſhould be diſcouered by their crying, and they poore babes dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whilſt their mothers being in no better ſaftie, diſperſed themſelues heare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and there, to auoyde the tyrannie of the Infidels. The enemie proceeded euen vnto the lake of Balator, and in paſſing by, they fired the citie of the fiue Churches, which was all burnt, onely the Caſtell and the faire Temple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Whileſt the execution of this vnfortunate Battaile (and of all thoſe which we haue recited) was in doing: the Vayuode was almoſt at Segedin with all the forces of Tranſiluania, who not being able with all his troupes to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21983:23"/>
march with that expedition as he would, and deſiring notwithſtanding to be at this battaile, which, as he vnderſtood, could not in any ſort be deferred, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he being in a ſwift and light Coach, and followed with few men in the like wagons, went in the greateſt haſte he could to ſeeke the King. Counte <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher</hi> was alſo arriued at Zagrabia. One part of the Bohemians which came to ſuccour the King, were about Iauerine, and the reſt were not farre from Alberegalis. <hi>George</hi> Marqueſe of Brandenburg, and the Chauncellor of Bohemia named <hi>Adam Newhuis,</hi> were about the ſame quarter.</p>
            <p>The Queene vnderſtanding this vntimely newes, of ſuch an vnfortunate <note place="margin">The retraict of Queene Marie.</note> ouerthrow, ſuddenly retired her ſelfe, with the Biſhop of Veſprimia, <hi>Alexis Thurſon,</hi> and the Popes Nuntio, to Poſon, which the Hungars name Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, and tranſported the beſt and richeſt of her mouables by Danubius, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> not yet knowing any thing of the death of the King her husband. Theſe moueables, and other goods which appertained to the citizens of Buda, were rifled, and ſome of them ſtaied by <hi>Andrew Orbancz,</hi> who commaunded the Caſtle of Strigonium, which at this day is called Gran. Neuertheleſſe, he that writeth this hiſtorie, and reciteth this vile and infamous outrage, doth greatly erre, when he added to it, that certaine of his light horſemen (who are commonly called Vſſarons) behaued themſelues towards the Queenes maides, otherwiſe then their honours required, for that in a meriment they put off their ſhooes to daunce with them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Soliman</hi> ſoiourning there a certaine time where the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile was fought, and after hauing reunited together all his companies, the which he had ſent here and there to ruinate and ſpoyle the countrie, ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards Buda, and there within ſixe or ſeuen nights hee arriued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, marching along the ſhore of Danubius, fiering all the townes, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughes, <note place="margin">Buda taken by the Turkes.</note> and villages by the which he paſſed. He found this towne forſaken of all the garriſon, and cauſed it to bee fired, not any thing being exempted from the violence therof, but the Caſtle, and the Kings ſtables, and the houſe of wilde beaſts.</p>
            <p>From thence the Turke ſent many horſemen to ſpoyle and rob the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie on this ſide the riuer. They put all to fire and ſword whom they met be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">Waſte made through all Hungarie by the Turkes.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Danubius and the Lake of Balator, euen vnto Iauarine. The Caſtle (notwithſtanding) of Strigonium was cowardly left by <hi>Andrew Orbancz,</hi> of whom wee haue ſpoken before, neuertheleſſe it was valiantly defended and <note place="margin">Places forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Captaines, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by men of meane condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> preſerued by a man of baſe and ſeruile condition, and who a little before lead to the warre the footmen of the Chapter of the great Church of the towne called Mathieu Nagh, he being retired thither with a few men. The Fortreſſe of Viſſegrade, wherein the royall Crowne was alwaies kept, was alſo ſaued by the Peaſants, and Friers, it being forſaken of the ſouldiours: ſo greatly was euery man amazed at the Turkes comming vnto Buda. Theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſtrong places which we haue noted, together with thoſe of Thata, Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, and Alberegalis, were not forced of the enemie, for that he, I know not by what counſell, did content himſelfe onely to ſpoyle the countrie, and little reſpected to aſſaile the Caſtles and ſtrong holds.</p>
            <p>As theſe Barbarians did exerciſe their enormious cruelties in euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo there was no place in Hungarie where they had more reſiſtance, then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21983:23"/>

Into the ſaid place certaine thouſands of Hungars retired themſelues, with their wiues and children, truſting vpon the ſtraight and narrow paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which were ſtrongly ſhut vp. With thoſe the enemie often came to handy ſtrokes, and alwaies they receiued the worſt, and were put to the foile. In the end, the Turks ſeeing by no meanes they could force the barracado, which the Hungars had made with their wagons, they were conſtrained to bring thither their artillerie, by meanes wherof al thoſe wagons &amp; other ſuch defences were broken &amp; ouerthwrone to the ground, and almoſt all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> put to the ſword.

they ſaw himſelfe deeply plunged: and thus in great haſte they flying, paſſed the riuer of Thyſſa, anciently called Tibiſcus, and lodged in a Caſtle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> named Thoccay, ſituate almoſt vpon the riuers ſide, in a large and ſpacious plaine. The newes of this retraict being poſted to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> incontinently he cauſed his armie to enter and poſſeſſe the towne of Buda, who without the loſſe of any one man, was maſter thereof.

Among the diuerſitie of opinions, it was thought beſt that at all aduentures they ſhould purſue him, before he migth bee able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his forces, and to admit him no time to repoſe himſelfe in any one place, nor to expect for any ayde out of any place, and to performe that euen now, while he was disfurniſhed of men and counſell, and in a manner put to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> flight. According to which reſolution, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> gaue leaue to his people to follow King <hi>Iohn,</hi> as farre as they thought it conuenient: whereupon they preſently ſet forward on their iourney, and with great trauaile, without any delay, arriued at the riuer of Thyſſa, which they paſſed with boates that they brought with them vpon wagons, and they in camped by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> before he was aware, who, for the little or no inckling he had of them, neuer dreamt of ſo ſudden a thing. Being aſtoniſhed at ſo preſent an arriuall, he began now to conferre with his people, what courſe was beſt to be taken. They anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they would fight, and that he ſhould withdraw himſelfe from the danger thereof, that if it ſhould fall out ill, he might haue ſufficient time to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſaue himſelfe: and on the contrarie, if it ſhould alter and fall out well, hee might with his preſence, ayde and ſuccour them the better; and ſo by that meanes he ſhould in euery caſe finde himſelfe ſafe and in good ſecuritie. At that time among all his Commanders, he had one whoſe name was <hi>Ference Bode,</hi> a man of great reputation and well eſteemed, to whom (for his vertue, <note place="margin">Ference Bode a valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> fidelitie, and experience) King <hi>Iohn</hi> had committed his Standard royall, and the Lieutenantſhip Generall ouer his armie. He foreſeeing the miſerable ſucceſſe which might happen of this warre, did deliberate and reſolue with himſelfe to dye, rather then to flye or forſake his King by a cowardly and diſhoneſt flight. <q>And among many opinions and aduiſes which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> before the King (and the ſame it may be more neceſſary, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable) this Captaine turning himſelfe towards the King, ſaid: Moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince, the vertue and force which may come by counſell, is not then neceſſarie, when the effect thereof muſt goe before mens opinions. For this cauſe (ſince our enemies are ſo readie to fight) it is in like ſort conuenient, and that for two cauſes, that we alſo prepare our ſelues to the combat. The one <note place="margin">1</note> is, that wee ought to preſerue your Maieſtie ſafe and ſound: and the other, <note place="margin">2</note> that wee may maintaine our honour and reputation; for it would bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as a baſe and ſeruile thing, for vs Hungars (who are borne and alwaies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> accuſtomed to manage armes) now to flye, or refuſe the battaile which the enemie offereth vs. And for this reſpect it behoueth vs both with bodie and courage to fight with our inuincible forces, and eſpecially now, ſince the commoditie of further aduiſe is taken from vs, (the which would greatly haue beſteaded vs in this affayre) conſidering that either a memorable vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie muſt happen to vs, or elſe a glorious death to all:</q>

alſo, as the neceſſitie of this war doth take away all benefit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the time, by the ſuddaine arriuall of our enemies: and yet more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that, conſidering that there is nothing leſſe thought of, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the intereſt which the one and the other pretendeth to the gouernment and rule of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which cannot acknowledge two Lords, and indeed demaundeth but one.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſpeeches being ended, preſently he began to forme and order his Battaile, committing the right &amp; left wings to the Tranſiluanian ſouldiours, <note place="margin">The appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Battaile.</note> and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caualary of the ſame Countrie, as repoſing greater affiance in them, then in the other, and he impaled himſelfe in the midſt of the Hungariſh and other ſouldiours, newly gathered together.

At this inſtant the ſouldiours, aſwell on the one part as on the other (without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> being requeſted thereunto by their Captaines) were inflamed to fight, and began now couragiouſly to march one againſt the other, and after the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie had interchaungeably played, not being greatly offenſiue to either part, they incountred in ſuch rude and fierce maner, that the Stirians could not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine the violence of the Tranſiluanians, but bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to turne their backes, and their Caualarie to diſperſe here &amp; there. But on the otherſide, the Carinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an men of armes bore the ſhocke &amp; force of <hi>Ference Bode</hi> his ſquadrons (who were but freſh-water ſouldiours lately leauied) and paſſed through them, and brake their arraies.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21983:27"/>
to reunite certaine companies which were diſperſed, and againe to make head againſt the enemie, and to purſue the battaile: in executing of which, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he was ſuddenly ſurpriſed and enuironed by the light horſemen of <hi>Paul Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> who, vntill then, held himſelfe in couert, and there <hi>Bode</hi> was the ſecond <note place="margin">The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of King Iohns armie.</note> time broken, and himſelfe taken priſoner, and all his armie defeated and cut in peeces, and the royall Enſigne of <hi>Iohns</hi> taken, with all the Artillerie and baggage.

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> obtaining this victorie, and publiſhing at the ſame time a Diet of the Hungars, to be held at Alberegalis, was in like ſort, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as <hi>Iohn</hi> was, with <hi>Anne</hi> his wife, crowned King of Hungarie, and that <note place="margin">Ferdinand crowned King of Hungarie.</note> by the hands of the ſame Archbiſhop of Strigonium, and of <hi>Peter Peren,</hi> who had forſaken King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who being brought into poore and meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, was retired into Polonia, he being entertained by <hi>Hieromic Lasky,</hi> a <note place="margin">Hieromic Lasky recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Iohn.</note> mightie man both in poſſeſſions, and alſo well followed in thoſe countries, who exceedingly reioyced at the arriuall of ſo great a perſonage, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> him very curteouſly, and did greatly comfort him for the paines and miſerie, whereinto hee was ſo deeply fallen, and entertained him in ſuch friendly ſort, that it well appeared he wanted nothing elſe, but onely the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and ſtate of a King, &amp; did ſo much honor him as was poſſible. But <hi>Lasky</hi> being of a haughtie ſpirit, and a man who with deepe iudgement had often managed affayres of great import, as well in the warres, as in the peaceable gouernment of a kingdome, and other publike Eſtates: perſwaded <hi>Iohn</hi> that he ſaw no other meanes more behoofull to redreſſe and reduce this preſent extremitie of his affayres into better order, nor none more proper nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the recouerie of his kingdome, then that which might befall him by the ayde and helpe of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Turkiſh Emperour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> inſtantly aduiſed him, not to forſake the meanes and oportunitie, but to vſe it in his neceſſitie: for that he aſſured him, in reſpect of the extreame am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, glorie, and couetouſnes, to increaſe the limits of his Empire, and in hope to make himſelfe a greater Monarke, he would by no meanes faile or omit to giue him ayde and ſuccour: ſo as himſelfe would offer and vow to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21983:27"/>
hold his kingdome of him by faith and homage, as depending vpon the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> houſe, and to pay him ſome reaſonable tribute, ſuch as <hi>Solyman</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would impoſe vpon him. Which being concluded and determined <note place="margin">I asky practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople to obtaine ſome ſuccour for Iohn his gueſt.</note> betweene them, <hi>Lasky</hi> deſiring greatly to fauour and ayde the cauſe of his friend, and receiuing of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſumme and charge of an Ambaſſage, he ſet forward to goe towards Conſtantinople with a good traine, where at the length being arriued, he preſently endeuoured himſelfe, by gifts, to win the fauour and grace of all the Baſhaes, and of the Captaines of the grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niours Port, and of all other principall perſons of his Court, who with his preſents he in ſuch ſort gained, that they ſerued him as a ladder to mount to the top of his deſires, who being at laſt admitted to the Turkes preſence, and after humble reuerence to him made, was by him (according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſent againe to the Baſhaes, among whom, <hi>Luflefy</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> had the moſt authoritie, commaund, and credit, the one being alied to the grand Seigniour, becauſe hee had maried his ſiſter, and the other being a Viſir, <note place="margin">Viſit.</note> which is the chiefe of all officers, and one that keepeth the Turkes ſeale, and ſigneth all expeditions, or diſpatches, <hi>Lasky</hi> gained, and that beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, theſe mens amitie, by meanes of their wiues, whom he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and corrupted with rich and coſtly preſents, with whom alſo hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed ſo familiarly in the Slauonian and Turkiſh languages, as if hee had been naturally bred and brought vp among them. His fayre and good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cauſed him to be gratious and amiable to all, and by ſuch pleaſing cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he began with all his endeuour to treate of the affayres of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially tending to this purpoſe, that hee might bee reſtored againe to his kingdome, being vniuſtly chaſed out of it by the forces of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and by the enuie and wickednes of certaine Hungars, being before by them iuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically choſen, and crowned King; for the recouering of which, he did offer (beſides a reaſonable tribute) to acknowledge and hold it of the grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour, and to be called the ſubiect of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> houſe; and in token of true fidelitie and alleageance, and for the perpetuall memorie of ſuch a benefit, he would yeeld himſelfe to bee his ſubiect. <hi>Lasky</hi> further declaring, that it was better for <hi>Solyman</hi> to haue King <hi>Iohn,</hi> with a weake force, for his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and friend, then <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who becauſe he was brother to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles,</hi> and King of Bohemia, and Archduke of Auſtria, and Lord of many other countries, would make ſhew rather to be feared and redoubted by his neighbours: and he further declared, that if he would not liſten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, it might poſſible be, that one day he would vex and diſturbe him more, then he now preſently thought of. And beſides that, he ſhould doe in this, as beſeemed a magnanimious and vertuous Emperour, in ayding thoſe, who by others are wrongfully oppreſſed and iniured, and to fauour the iuſt cauſe of him, who for euer ſhould remaine his bounden and loyall ſubiect. Theſe reaſons being heard by the Baſhaes, and reported to <hi>Solyman</hi> (who by a ſecret <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> window had alreadie vnderſtood all that paſſed). did ſo ſet him on fire with the glorie which hee hoped for by ſuch an expedition, that incontinent he <note place="margin">Solyman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh the defence of Iohn.</note> reſolued to vndertake it; with ſuch conditions notwithſtanding, that King <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould obſerue from point to point, all that which he had cauſed to be promiſed him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:21983:28"/>
In the meane time, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> not without cauſe miſtruſting (the which indeede happened) that <hi>Iohn</hi> might ſeeke ayde of the Turke againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> him, did deliberate (thinking to preuent the deſeignes of his enemie) to ſend to the grand Seigneor, to demaund of him truce, and to confirme the amitie <note place="margin">Ferdinand ſendeth to Solyman.</note> and friendſhip that <hi>Ladiſlas</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> Kings of Hungarie, had in former time ſworne with the houſe of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and the which truce the King of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia then enioyed, not doubting but he would willingly condiſcend to his demaund, if he would ſufficiently apprehend his reaſons. For this cauſe he ſent his Embaſſador <hi>Iohn Oberdanſch</hi> to <hi>Solyman,</hi> to practiſe and negotiate this confederacie. He being diſpatched, with good expedition arriued at Conſtantinople, and was honorably entertayned as was fitting for an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> But publiſhing the occaſion of his comming, he well perceiued the rigour of <hi>Solyman,</hi> and the little credit he had amongſt his people, and hee manifeſtly knew that King <hi>Iohn</hi> had alreadie preuented his purpoſe. And receiuing his aunſwere, that the grand Seigniour would not by any meanes accept into friendſhip, them who in former time had been ſuch and ſo great enemies to his houſe, and by whom his people had receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite outrages; and eſpecially conſidering his Maſter had ſo vniuſtly vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that kingdome, which he poſſeſſed not, but onely by force expulſing the true King; the iuſt titles and allegations of whom, being before from him concealed by the late victorie which his Maſter obtayned againſt him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and being afterwardes better acquainted with the cauſe, by the information of credible people, he was forced by pittie and Iuſtice of his ſworde, to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſte the ſayd <hi>Iohn</hi> in his true and lawfull poſſeſſion. For theſe cauſes <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>

The councellours giuing no credit to his words, but iudging his reporte to bee falſe, ſent vnto <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> who then was at the diet at Spire, and when he heard it, he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> aſtoniſhed thereat.</p>
            <p>The Spring time approaching, <hi>Solyman</hi> cauſed to be proclaimed, that al his <note place="margin">The Armie of Solymans in Hungarie.</note> forces of Europe and of Aſia ſhould reſort to Andrionoplis, where he would make a generall muſter, and preſently after with great diligence to march to Belgarde (which is in Hungarie) with all his forces where he ſo iourned not long, but incontinently King <hi>Iohn</hi> with a great companie of the Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Nobilitie, which he brought with him, came to kiſſe his hands, and to <note place="margin">Iohn kiſſeth the hands of Solyman.</note> acknowledge himſelfe to him, as his ſubiect and tributarie. He found him ſitting vnder a Canapie where hee made no great countenance to moue himſelfe at the reuerences which he made, but ſhowing a great Maieſtie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he gaue him his right hand in ſigne of amitie, the which he kiſſed, and after ſome courteſies, <hi>Solyman</hi> ſaid to him; that he doubted not but with eaſe to reconquer all that which vniuſtly had been taken from him, and that by the iuſtice of his forces, which being done, he would liberally render it to him againe. King <hi>Iohn</hi> departing from <hi>Solyman,</hi> went to viſit <hi>Abraham Baſha,</hi> whoſe friendſhip he had alreadie obtayned, (as is ſayd before) by meanes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21983:28"/>
of <hi>Lasky,</hi> who alſo was the onely cauſe to procure him ſuch fauour with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Solyman,</hi> and drew to him <hi>Lewis Gritty,</hi> who was the ſonne of <hi>Andrew Gritty,</hi>

Alſo <hi>Lasky,</hi> as hauing intelligence of the Baſhaes affayres, and with the Lords of <hi>Solymans</hi> Court, had ſpecially practiſed the friendſhip of the ſaid <hi>Gritty,</hi> for by the induſtrie of him (by meanes of <hi>Abraham Baſha)</hi> he obtained of the grand Seigniour that which he deſired. And King <hi>Iohn</hi> had in this ſo good ſucceſſe, that he found in this armie the aforeſaid <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that <hi>Solyman</hi> had repoſed himſelfe with his armie certaine daies at Belgrade, he marched directly to Buda, which was forſaken by the citizens, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as ſoone as euer they heard of the report of his comming; and ſo it came <note place="margin">Buda taken by the Turks.</note> vnder the gouernment of the enemie, without any reſiſtance: only the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe was kept by 700. Germanes, who very couragiouſly for a time did their endeuour to defend it. The Turkes ſeeing they could not ſo ſoone be maſters thereof as they thought, began to myne and ſap it, whereby they might make the defences and wals ſaultable, and hauing throughly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, the fire and the thicke ſmoake which darkened the element, aſcended euen to the noſes of the aſſieged, who greatly feared to be deſtroyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſeeing their companions alreadie begin to flye in the ayre, cauſed them (maugre <hi>Nadasky</hi> their Captaine, who commaunded that place) to ſound a parley and treatie of a compoſition with the Turkes, conditionally, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that in deliuering that hold, they might in ſafetie depart with their baggage, and retire themſelues into ſome place of ſafetie. Which being accorded and concluded, they rendred vp the Caſtle and departed. In the meane time it being reported to <hi>Solyman,</hi> that this compoſition was onely made by the ſouldiours, without the agreement of <hi>Nadasky</hi> their Captaine, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent after them, in the way towards Poſon (to which place they would make their retraict) his Ianiſaries to put them to the ſword, as vnworthie to liue, hauing alreadie ſuffered them too long to breathe.</p>
            <p>This towne and Fortreſſe being thus taken, the armie marched directly towards Vienna, all the Campe reſting in the way before Alteburg, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was a towne defended by the Bohemians, who at the firſt manfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood certaine aſſaults; but ſeeing that in one of thoſe aſſaults their Captaine had loſt his life, they began then to loſe their courage, and waxe faint, and feeling themſelues wearie, for that they were continually at the fight, and finding themſelues more ſtraightned then before, and aſſailed with greater furie, they forſooke the Rampiers and gaue place to the enemie, who with <note place="margin">Alteburg ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Turks.</note> ſuch a furie entred the towne, that they put all to the ſword. This towne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonne, the grand Seigniour was aduertiſed, that he ſhould not now find any hinderance neither in townes nor field: whereupon he ſent before the Accanges to the quarters of Vienna (which are, as in former times, like the <note place="margin">Accanges.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> aduenturers of France, and not much vnlike our Scottiſh borderers) to fire and ſpoyle all the countrie. Theſe people ſerue not for wages, but in time of warre are leauied among the peaſants (as the Ayduches in Hungarie are): they are not paid any wages, neither are they taxed, but of the bootie which they get, they giue the tenth part thereof to the grand Seigniour, as they do
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21983:29"/>
of all their goods beſides. They now following the commaund which was preſcribed them, executed incredible cruelties, bearing away with them all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> kinde of bootie. After that, they made towards the fiue Churches, where they committed no leſſe outrage to the inhabitants of the countrie, then they did to the other, who fearing ſuch and the like deuaſtations, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious cruelties, forſooke their houſes, ſeeking by diuers meanes to ſaue themſelues. In this ſort the Accanges continuing their pilling, robbing, and maſſacring, at laſt arriued before Vienna, by the riuer of Lints, where they were no more mercifull, then in other places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> along time foreſeeing theſe euents, had put into Vienna all that little ayde which then he had, cauſing new Rampiers and fortifications to be built, and fearing worſe would afterward enſue, he trauailed to al the townes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of Germanie, not as a King, but as a Poſt or meſſenger to demaund ſpeedie ayde. At the requeſt of whom, and vpon the bruite which was diſperſed of the taking of Buda, all the Germanes with one accord ſent the Counte Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine <note place="margin">Counte Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of Rhene entereth into Vienna.</note> with 20000. Launſquenets, and 2000. horſe, to the end himſelfe, with many other Captaines of marke, might enter into Vienna, to take poſſeſſion and defend it, and hinder the Turkes further proceedings, as it was an eaſie matter for him to doe. Among other voluntaries, there went <hi>William Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candolph,</hi> Comptroler of King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> houſe, <hi>Iohn Gazianer</hi> a Slauonian, <hi>Hector Ranſach, Nicholas Salm,</hi> who was at the taking of the King of France at Pauia, <hi>Leonard Velſch,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Turian,</hi> and many other renowned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> through Germanie for their vertue and proweſſe: they put into the citie 100. peeces of great Artillerie, and about 200. leſſer, all which were in good order planted about the towne.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, the enemie not being able to march ſo faſt as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for them, in reſpect of the great ſtore of raine that fell in the moneth of September, and eſpecially by reaſon of the paſſage of Danubius, which was then ouerflowed; in the end they arriued before Vienna, vpon the 13. day of the ſame moneth, who with al their army enuironed it, diuiding their <note place="margin">The Turke before Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</note> Campe into foure quarters, the circuite of which was ſo great, that one could not ſee nothing but the ground couered with Tents and Pauilions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for foure miles compaſſe. <hi>Abraham Baſha</hi> was incamped vnder a hill right ouer againſt the citie, that he might the more commodiouſly obſerue <note place="margin">1</note> and take view therof, himſelfe being lodged in a little ruinated Caſtle which was thereby, where alſo was lodged all his people, as well foote as horſe. On the otherſide, towards the Port of Purgatorie, right ouer againſt S. <hi>Vlderios</hi> Church, was the Beglerby of <hi>Natolia,</hi> with the choiſeſt ſouldiours of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. <note place="margin">2</note> The third ſiege was towards Saint <hi>Vit,</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Micalogly,</hi> within the village of Smireng, aboue the which, vpon the deſcent of the hils, <note place="margin">3</note> was lodged a ſtrong ſquadron of ſouldiours. The fourth was towards the Scottiſh Port, where were many Aſapes, (who are Archers very expert) and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
               <note place="margin">4</note> amongſt them were alſo ſome Ianiſaries, along the riuers ſide of Danubius. Thoſe of this ſide ſuffered not any within the towne to appeare vpon the wals, but ſtraight they were brought to the ground, and ſometime they ſent ſuch an hayle of arrowes into the citie, that thoſe who walked in the ſtreetes, were grieuouſly annoyed &amp; wounded, except they had on ſome head-piece
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21983:29"/>
for their heads, or armour for their bodies. The laſt ſquadron, which was the moſt warlike, and valianteſt of all the armie, and wherein was <hi>Solyman</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> himſelfe, was lodged right ouer againſt S. <hi>Markes</hi> Church, within a great cloaſe, walled with bricke, where was fixed the Turkes chiefe Standard. On that ſide, the Aſapes began to remoue the earth, that ſo they might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the wals into the ditch, by meanes of their mynes and other inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but hauing no Artillerie to batter, their trauell and labour did not greatly profit them.</p>
            <p>During theſe approaches, as another part of <hi>Solymans</hi> armie came in boates rowing vp Danubius, <hi>Wolfang Oder</hi> (who was then Gouernour of Poſon) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Wolfang O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der defeated the Turkiſh veſſels vpon Danubius.</note> aduertiſed thereof, cauſed a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of Launſquenets, with certaine peeces of Artillerie, and ſome few horſemen, to lie in Ambuſcado vnder the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> banke of Danubius, in a place ſecret and commodious for that purpoſe, where ſuddenly he aſſailed the Turkiſh armie, who were vnprouided, and ſo throughly did he effect it, that he ſunke many veſſels fraught with Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Munition, ſtaining the water with the blood of a great number of ſouldiours and Turkiſh Captaines, who were there ſlaine, cauſing alſo ſuch diſorder and confuſion in that army, that euen through the feare of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie they were ouerthrowne and broken: which victorie was a ſpeciall cauſe of ſauing Vienna. In this ſurpriſe and canuiſado, the enemie loſt the gallanteſt and moſt eſteemed men among them, and <hi>Wolfang</hi> in this victorie not loſing any one of his owne people, retired himſelfe with his companie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſafe and ſound to Poſon. The remnant of thoſe that eſcaped, proceeded on their iourney to Vienna, and at their arriuall, they brake all the bridges of the Iles, which was made ouer Danubius before the towne, to go &amp; come more commodiouſly in and out of the citie: which being done, they placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before the Caſtle, to the end none by this place ſhould neither go nor come without great daunger, either to be killed, or taken priſoners: euen as it happened to the companie of <hi>Iohn Ardech,</hi> who ſallying out on that ſide to skirmiſh with the Turkes, had ſuch ill ſucceſſe, that it little wanted that they were not wholly ouerthrowne by the thick ſhot of the Accanges &amp; Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries; he who bore the Cornet was taken, and after ſent backe (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſome ſuttle deuiſe) clothed in a gowne of gold &amp; ſilke, after the Turkiſh habit, with an intent, that by ſuch outward ſhewes &amp; diſſembling fauours, he might the better perſwade the Viennians to yeeld themſelues. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie <note place="margin">The conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</note> and courage of euery one was ſuch, that they had all rather dye, then heare of any ſuch diſloyall matter: hauing this firme hope, not onely to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the towne, but alſo to effect incredible damage (as they after did) to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman.</hi> The citizens ſeeing that the greateſt violence of the enemies (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depriued of Artillerie) did conſiſt in mynes, began to looke well to that, and with diuers inſtruments to diſcouer the places where they were made, and to this end they vſed baſons full of water, dice vpon a Drumme, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and many other inuentions, by which they might know where the enemie myned, and by that meanes they might preſently remedie any inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">The meanes to diſcouer a myne.</note> which might happen, by making countermynes, which would fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the other, and make the enemies labour friuolous and to no effect; and fortifying behinde the wals with counter wals of rootes and trees, in ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21983:30"/>
forcible manner, that the aſſaylants ſhould receiue more loſſe and damage then the aſſayled; and with ſuch dexteritie they rampired behinde, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thereby preuented the determination of the enemie, as it afterward happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For they ſetting fire to the mynes, and a great part of the wall falling, they thought by that ruine, without any great daunger or loſſe to giue the aſſault. And vpon this imagination, they ran preſently with great fiercenes and courage to aſſaile the breach. But the Viennians being well fortified and retrenched within, contrarie to the opinion and expectation of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they receiued thereby an incredible loſſe, tumbling them downe from the top to the ground, and inforced them with a great ſlaughter and ſhame to recoyle backe, and acknowledge the valour and courage which was in the hearts of the aſſieged.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Church, did alſo fall a great canton of the wall, ſo large and wide, that the enemie did eaſily ſee the Germanes well ranged in Battaile to maintaine the aſſault, which incontinent was giuen by the Turkes, with a merueilous deſire to make themſelues maſters of the towne, contemning all the ſiniſter accidents which were preſented to them, forcing themſelues by all violent meanes to enter, and to incounter thoſe ſouldiours whom they ſaw ſo well martialled. But their courage was quickly abated, for they were valiantly repulſed by thoſe who defended that breach, giuing them iuſt cauſe to buie their bolde attempt at a deare rate. And although this multitude of aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants were as it were almoſt without armour, yet were they ſo audacious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and bolde, that ſcornfully diſdayning our people, and fooliſhly fighting, they did in the ende force them ſometimes to retyre, although that they were ſlaine ſo thicke, that bodie couered bodie, and in place of thoſe who fell to the ground and were ſlaine, others ran to poſſeſſe their roomes with incredible furie, and with ſuch dexteritie, that their rankes neuer ſeemed naked nor emptie.</p>
            <p>In this manner both the one part and the other, with great effuſion of blood did often fight, and amongſt others at the Port of Carinthia, where was alſo fallen downe a great part of the Courtian; at the fall whereof, the enemies preſently gaue the aſſault, onely with ſword and target, hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the harquebuz and bow, they running to it in ſuch a multitude, as if they had been graſhoppers, and began an aſſault mort cruell and bloodie then the former, where on both parts they fought with ſuch hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of victorie, that both the one and the other encountring ſo rudely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, weare often repelled, this being one of the bloudieſt aſſaults that euer was heard of; but in the ende, the force and courage of the Germanes increaſed, the Turks being conſtrayned to yeeld, notwithſtanding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, prayers, exhortations, and threatnings of the Sangiacs, and other Captaines, who with blowes of their Semitaries, forced them to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to the aſſault, not being able otherwiſe to ſtay them from turning their backes. Thus while the ayre reſounded, and the earth ſhaked, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the wonderfull thunder the Artillerie made, and by the noyſe, and ſound of bels and drums, the enemie with greater obſtinacie then before, returned to the aſſault, which was long and couragiouſly maintayned, more then foure houers continually, not without great ſlaughter on both

ſides. During which aſſault, there was ſlaine (with <hi>Ambuſt Ottinge</hi> a valiant Colonell) many Captaines and men of ſpeciall marke: and of thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> many Captaines of the Ianiſaries, and of the Aſapes, and many Sangiacs, who for their vertue and renoune were greatly eſteemed among their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe being prouoked with furie and courage, put themſelues on foote with their ſword and target only, to animate and encourage others the more to the fight. In the ende the Turks not being able any longer to reſiſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe and valour of the aſſiedged, abandoning all ſhame of diſhonor, and diſpiſing all iniurious vpbrayding, not reſpecting the blowes which they receiued of their Captaines, they tumbled downe through and from the ruines and breach of the wall, flying directly to their lodgings. <hi>Solyman</hi> throughly vexed to ſee ſuch a bucherie of his people, vrged by a kinde of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> deepe reuenge, did purpoſe to put in execution his laſt endeauored violence, wholy to deſtroy the towne. And to that effect he cauſed all the Captaines and principals of his Armie to come before him, who ſeuerely and with ſharpe ſpeeches reprehending them in great choler, that they ſo villanouſly and infamouſly, and by a more then womaniſh cowardlynes, hauing almoſt the victorie in their hands, ſuffered now themſelues to be depriued thereof, and put to flight, commaunding them within a ſhort time, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues readie and renew the aſſault with greater courage; euery one either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing to die there, or elſe to regaine the victorie euen as it behooued them more then any other nation. At this cruell commaund, which was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the extreame feare of all, euery man furniſhed himſelfe with armes, and with all neceſſarie things for fight, and the prefixed time being come to begin this horrible aſſault, which was the 13. of October, Anno 1529. the <note place="margin">The generall and laſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault giuen to Vienna.

But the Germanes who held themſelues gallantly aloft, were aduaunced before the inſolencie and boldnes of the enemie, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their thicke ſquadrons againſt their force and multitude, and by ſuch valarous meanes, fruſtrated their violence, making with their Cannon and handy ſtrokes a great butcherie of them; which would cauſe great maruaile and amazement in thoſe, who could beholde the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that were ſlaine and wounded: notwithſtanding, the Turkes abated nothing of their courage, but to the contrarie, abandoning all feare of death, more hardie, raſh, and more inflamed with pride then before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled the aſſault, and ſo fiercely they perſiſted in their obſtinacie, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times our men were conſtrained to yeeld a little backe. But at laſt, by the vollies of the harquebuziers, and the violence of the Artillerie (which by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good diſcreſion was diſpoſed about the walles, eſpecially where they ſaw the greateſt force of the Turkes fighting) the enemies were forced to retire, miſerably falling in heapes by the ruines of the breach, making themſelues a pittifull ſpectacle; the ditch being filled with the dead bodies of theſe Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and the ſtones ſtained with their bloud. Thus hauing loſt all their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21983:31"/>
and hope of winning the towne, and no more dreading the threates and menaces, nor the blowes of their commanders, of two extreames, they choſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> rather to be killed of their Captaines, then by thoſe of the towne, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tumultuouſly they retired themſelues in great confuſion from that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible aſſault, flying in great hurly burly to their lodgings. By this confuſed retraict, behold how this bloodie fight that day tooke an end, which did very deere and infinitly coſt the Turkes, by the death of his braueſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianteſt Captaines. Wherefore <hi>Solyman</hi> ſeeing fortune contrarie to him, and conſidering the vallour of the aſſiedged; not willing to attempt any more ſo cruell a loſſe, determined to packe vp and depart. And before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he cauſed certaine priſoners to be apparaled in robes of Veluct and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> cloth of golde, who liberally were ſent home againe into the towne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might informe the Citizens, that his intent was not to take Vienna, but onely to be reuenged of the iniuries which he had receiued of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and ſpecially, becauſe hee meant to poſſeſſe thoſe kingdomes which were not his; and further, that he was ſo much the more diſpleaſed that his enemie was retired into the midſt of Germanie, and had not attended him in Hungarie, that there he might be reuenged the better of the iniuries of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Kind <hi>Iohn</hi> his friend: and that if they would yeeld to him, hee aſſured them, that he would not enter into their towne, but leaue them in full libertie, promiſing to the ſouldiours who were within, that they ſhould retire themſelues to any ſecure place where they would, and that afterward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> he would incontinently returne againe. Theſe ſpeeches being by the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners recited, in the aſſemblie of all the people and ſouldiours, gaue notice to them that the forces of the Turkes were greatly weakned, and by that they iudged the loſſe which he had receiued, and that he vſed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, but onely to win them to his lure, and ſo nothing but laughing at it, they made account of his words as they deſerued, knowing well by reaſon of the winter which was at hand, that the ſiege could not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. And ſo within two dayes after, which was the thirtieth day of the ſiege, the Turke rayſed his Campe from before Vienna, deuiding it into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>

Vpon this, a common opinion went, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that <hi>Emeric</hi> vſed this manner as beſeemed a good Chriſtian, being greatly diſpleaſed in his heart to ſee the Turkes in his countrie, where they neuer came before, and that he ſhould conſent to open to them a paſſage, whereby they might haue more ample knowledge of the ſtore of townes, boroughs, and villages; of the infinite number of horſes, of the fertilenes of the land, and the fat paſtures which are therein, by the which they might bee inticed in time to make themſelues maſters thereof.

But diſſembling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> griefe, which touched him at the hart, and which of a friend made him an enemy, made ſemblance as though he little cared therefore. <hi>Gritty</hi> turning himſelfe to him, ſaid: <q>Seigniour <hi>Lasky,</hi> doe you know this ſhauen head? beleeue me it was the head of a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> perſonage, but yet beſides ambitious and proud.</q> At theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Lasky</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed both with anger and griefe at one time, anſwered, <q>that it was then at no hand like to that which he had ſeene when it was aliue ſtanding on his ſhoulders.</q> Theſe words neerely touched <hi>Gritty,</hi> who preſently replied, as one repenting himſelfe of that deede, and that he could not containe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from ſhame, in reſpect he was ſo vniuſtly put to death, and that he gaue no ſuch commaund that he ſhould be ſlaine, but onely taken priſoner. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he cauſed certaine Hungariſh and Turkiſh horſemen to ſeaze vpon a Caſtle, which was reported to bee the place where his treaſure was. By this time the iſſue of this pitifull and lamentable death, was diuulged into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> eares of euery one, in reſpect whereof, all the nations of that prouince, as Saxons, Sicilians, Tranſalpinians, and Podolians (who are vpon the confines <note place="margin">The Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanians in armes for the death of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meric.</note> of Polonia) with all poſſible diſcontent felt themſelues greatly outraged with griefe, and aſſembled together againſt <hi>Gritty,</hi> to reuenge the death of ſo honourable and reuerend a man, and within few daies they were about 40000. men, they hauing for their Commaunders <hi>Gottart</hi> a Saxon, and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> vnderſtanding this tumult of the Tranſiluanians, and the great aſſemblie of ſouldiours, and preparations which were determined of againſt him, was greatly troubled therewith, and withall being vncertaine what to doe in his defence, with great expedition retired himſelfe to the towne of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.

him, and that his companie might amount vnto ſome 4000. men, they ſhut the gates againſt him: but in the end, by the intreaties and perſwaſions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Doce</hi> and <hi>Batian,</hi> they condiſcended to lodge them below in the towne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues the aduantage of a hill, where they had a large Church, walled about, and well furniſhed of houſes, into the which they all retired with their richeſt moueables, fortifying themſelues within as well as they could. And as afterward they vnderſtood when <hi>Gritty</hi> tooke the way to this towne, he had an intention to ſeize vpon that hill, and to fortifie it, as wel as the ſhortnes of the time would permit him, there to defend and keepe himſelf, vntill ſome little aide ſhould come to relieue him, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might for a time ſaue himſelfe, either by a little brooke which ran not farre from thence; or by the riuer of Alute, which doth paſſe vpon the left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hand, and from thence doth caſt it ſelfe vpon one ſide into Moldauia; or of another into Valachia, which countries he might eaſily winne, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feare of the Turkes power. Whileſt his braine was buſied vpon ſuch vrgent neceſſities, he ceaſſed not from fortifying himſelfe very ſtrongly, and incouraged thoſe who were with him, to labour and employ themſelues in all affayres, which ſhould bee thought fitting for ſo preſent a neceſſitie, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding letters and meſſages to all parts to ayde him, as neede ſhould require. But the Tranſiluanians, who deſired to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him, being ſtirred vp through a deepe reuenge, by a iuſt indignation, to ſee their Vayuode ſo cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and the Turkes (their capitall enemies) in their countrie, into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which they neuer yet before entered; came with ſuch great diligence, that he beheld himſelfe rather aſſailed, then enuironed: notwithſtanding ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den an attempt, he loſt no courage, but animating his people, he ſo coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly defended himſelfe, that he forced his enemies to retyre, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them being ſlaine, or wounded by the arrowes and harquebuziers of the Ianiſaries. <hi>Maillat</hi> and the Saxon ſeeing the aſſault to be too hard and ſharpe for them, gaue ouer, and would attempt it no more, and willing to proue better fortune, cauſed their people to retire from the towne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched themſelues ſo cloſely about it, that none could neither enter nor ſally forth. During this ſiege, <hi>Gritty</hi> daily expected that he ſhould haue ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſuccour ſent him, as he demaunded: but ſeeing his hope to bee fruſtrate and none came, and that victuals began to faile them, and the forces to defend the towne were weakened, and that the inhabitants declared themſelues to be his enemies, began to fall into extreame deſpayre, &amp; although he had not then his health very perfect, notwithſtanding he omitted no meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by gifts and promiſes, to appeaſe the mindes of thoſe who did beſiege him. But he laboured in vaine, for the furie and rage which fomed in their courages for the premiſed matters, was ſo great, that by no meanes they would hearken to any ſuch inticements. But ſeeing himſelfe forſaken of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymans</hi> officers, (who ſaid it was not in their power to ſend him any ayde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> without ſome commiſſion or authoritie from their Maſter) and being alſo abandoned of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> (who in his heart reioyced to ſee ſuch a tumult) of the Moldauian (of whom he more relied then of any other, for the aliance and peace which he had made with him) and withall being forſaken by <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bain Batian,</hi> (who fearing likewiſe that which happened, ſaued himſelfe by

And they were preſently, without any compaſſion, beheaded, and all thoſe who <note place="margin">The children of Gritty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headded.</note> accompanied them ſlaine.

            <p>
               <hi>Gritty</hi> being thus defeated, the Tranſiluanians determined not to admit into their kingdome any of thoſe two Kings; namely King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and King <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> but to maintaine themſelues Neuters, electing a Captaine, who ſhould rule and gouerne them, vntill it might be determined which of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thoſe two ſhould be their lawfull King; and thus they gouerned a certaine time.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> by Buda; in which place during the firſt yeares, he had no better office, then in diſtributing the almes to the poore at the Abbey gate: and as he himſelfe ſome time ſaid, he beſtowed the better part to his friends, rather then to others. But he being of a liuely ſpirit and haughtie courage, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this his preſent fortune not to be ſufficient to attaine to any honor, or to be ranged amongſt worthie men, imagined in himſelfe, that certainely he ſhould neuer be aduanced to any place of eſteeme, as long as he was in ſuch obſcure eſtate. For this cauſe deſirous to put in practiſe his deuiſes which were impreſſed in his thoughts, he ſtudied to write faire, and to learne as much latine as would ſerue him to ſing a Maſſe. Which hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> now ſufficiently obtained for his content, by meanes whereof attayning to the degree of a ſinging Prieſt, he endeuoured himſelfe ſo much, that he was entertained into the ſeruice of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> whileſt he was in Polonia chaſed from his kingdome; for whoſe affaires he trauailed into many places, and alwaies returned againe with quicke and faithfull expedition, ayding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe greatly with his habit, vnder the colour of which he freely paſſed through euery place, for none ſuſpected, that vnder that habite he could performe ſuch waightie affaires, and it helped him much to eſcape from many great daungers and trauailes. After <hi>Iohn</hi> was returned into Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania, and that he had recouered his kingdome, he was then mindefull of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the ſeruice which the Frier had done him, and conſidering he had been ſo faithfull to him in his aduerſities, and knowing that all the daungers which he was often ſubiect vnto, and all the troubles which he had endured for his ſake, proceeded not but of a great loue and good affection, began now ſpecially to fauour and to accept of him to be neere about his owne perſon. And although that at the beginning, King <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue him not ſo great meanes, as willingly he would haue done; yet neuertheleſſe by his diligent ſeruices (being a man who well could temper himſelfe, and who had a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſubtile wit, and who naturally in his minde aſpired to great things) gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fauour of the King in ſuch ſorte, who noting in him ſuch great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and excellent wiſedome, made him of his counſell, and gaue him the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Treaſurerſhip: and not long after he was choſen Biſhop of Varadin. By ſuch dignities he came to ſo high authoritie, that he was in generall, greatly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed and honored of all. And thus continuing his dutifull ſeruice, King <hi>Iohn</hi> drawing neere his end, not ſeeing any about him that was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident and circumſpect then Frier <hi>George,</hi> left him to be his ſonnes gardian,

and coadiutor in the adminiſtration and gouernment of his kingdome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with Queene <hi>Izabella</hi> his wife. But he (who was of a turbulent and ſubtile conceite; and one who would not be ſatisfied with a little) diſpoſed of the affaires in ſuch cunning manner, that within few daies he had them all in his gouernment, and nothing was diſpatched without his conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Thus the affaires of the common weale being directed by his onely Councell, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had now ſent to the Queene to demaund that part of the kingdome, which ſhe yet poſſeſſed in the name of her ſonne <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> the lawfull inheritour of <hi>Iohn,</hi> offering to giue him of his patrimonie, all that which in his fathers life time he promiſed him, and to performe all the couenants which was concluded betweene them. The Queene with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> good will receiued theſe offers; ſaying, ſhe was content to ſatisfie all that which had been agreed vpon betweene him, and the King her husband. But Frier <hi>George,</hi> as Protector, would by no meanes conſent thereto, for that <note place="margin">George hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the performance of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was betweene Ferdinand and Iohn.</note> he would not loſe his reputation wherein he now was, conſidering that he ſhould not ſo eaſily ſtrip his puple of ſuch a kingdome, and alſo ſeeing that by ſuch a ſurrender, he ſhould greatly abate his owne eſtate and dignitie. Wherefore he retired himſelfe with the Queene and her ſonne into Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, entertayning <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with delatorie words, and euery day alledging to his Ambaſſadours new excuſes, and in the meane time, gaue notice to the <note place="margin">George de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth aide of the Turke againſt Ferdinand.</note> Turke of all that which had paſſed, requeſting of him preſent ayde, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that the end of this buſines could no wayes be determined, but by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> warre. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſeeing how with vaine hopes he was delayed from day to day, in prolonging the time, and knowing all theſe things to be wrought by the ſubtiltie of the Friers inuention, would no longer temporize in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but aſſembled 40000. men, and 40. great peeces of Artillerie, vnder the conduct of a Germane Lord, called <hi>William Roccandolph,</hi> high ſteward of his houſe, (who, as is a foreſaid, was with Counte Palatine within Vienna, when <note place="margin">William Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candolph Lieutenant for Ferdinand in Hungarie.</note> it was beſieged by the Turkes) and ſent him as his Lieuetenant generall with this Armie, to aſſaile the towne of Buda, commaunding him to doe all that was poſſible to take the Frier who was within it, and to ſend him vnto him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be reuenged of the mockeries which he vſed towards him. <hi>Roccandolph</hi> being departed, marched with his Armie directly to Buda, where being <note place="margin">Buda beſieged by Roccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph.</note> come, he beſieged it on all ſides, making two batteries where the Artillerie did deſperatly batter, finding the towne well repaired, and otherwiſe then it was in former time. For <hi>Iohn</hi> by the arte and induſtrie of an ingenious Boullenois, had ſo ſtrongly fortefied it with Bulwarkes, inuironed it with walls, and incloſed it with deepe ditches, that it ſeemed verie hard for thoſe to win it, that did beholde the difficultie thereof. Towards one ſide of the towne there was a hill of ſome little height, as high as the walls, hauing a little valley which pleaſantly reached vnto the ſide of the ditch of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of the towne. Vpon the top of that hill was built a Church, named <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Saint <hi>Girrard,</hi> from whence one might ſee the roofes of the Kings Pallace, and the gilded porches. Vpon that hill, <hi>Roccandolph</hi> (the more to amaze and terrefie the Queene) cauſed there to be planted certaine peeces of Artillerie, wherewith he battered the Pallace, and eſpecially a towre, which he ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaked, that it was like to haue line on the ground (if the day following
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21983:36"/>
he had continued his batterie) by the fall whereof it had broken and greatly ruinated the Palace. But fearing the loſſe of ſuch a worke, he cauſed his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to ceaſe, reſpecting the infinite charges it would haue coſt in reedifying of it againe. And in the meane time he ſent to the Queene to incite her to keepe and performe the couenants, and to flie from the peſtilent aduiſes of Frier <hi>George,</hi> who vnder the colour of an ouerſeer and gardian of his Ward, aymed at no other thing but her ruine and vtter ouerthrow, aſſuring her (in the bountie of <hi>Ferdinand)</hi> that he had appointed a goodly principalitie for her &amp; her ſon, where they both ſhould liue in great pleaſure and friendſhip with their neighbours; declaring to her, that if ſhe was not determined to accept of theſe honourable conditions, he ſhould be forced preſently to plant greater batterie againſt the towne, and to ouerthrow and ruinate all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the fayreſt buildings which were within it. To theſe perſwaſions, Frier <hi>George</hi> made anſwere, that the Queene ſhould ſhew little iudgement, to change a kingdome for a Sepuſian principalitie, and from the royall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a Queene, to become an ordinarie Ladie. Thus the Frier deriding <hi>Roccandolph,</hi> did ſo ſpite and prouoke him, that he ſwore he would deſtroy and vtterly ruinate the towne, and cauſed all the force of his Artillerie to be brought to the place where the Iewes were buried, towards the Iewes Port, lying betweene the Eaſt and South, by the gate of Sabatia, where was the ſtrength of the Hungars, and good ſtore of Bohemians, vnder the conduct of <hi>Peren,</hi> and commaunded that without any intermiſſion the Cannon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſhould play; and he with his Germanes made another batterie at the Port of the Iewes towards the Caſtle wall, behinde the which were the Queenes gardens. This batterie was maintained with ſo great violence, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Curtaine fell within the ditch, which ſo amazed the beſieged, that they thought rather to yeeld, then defend themſelues. But the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, Frier <hi>George</hi> ſeeing the Germanes retired, and that they prepared <note place="margin">Frier George a diligent Captaine.</note> themſelues the next morning to giue aſſault; during the night, he cauſed certaine trenches and rampiers to bee caſt vp behinde the breach, ſufficient to hinder and annoy the victorie of <hi>Roccandolph,</hi> which fortune had preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their ſight. When the dawning of the day was come, the Germanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with their ladders ranne to the breach, and gaue the aſſault, the like being done on the other ſide at the Port of Sabatia by <hi>Peren,</hi> againſt whom thoſe of Buda gallantly oppoſing themſelues, they behaued themſelues ſo braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they conſtrained their enemies to retire, who loſt at that aſſault about 900. men, and 2000. were wounded. By this diſgrace, <hi>Roccandolph</hi> being greatly incenſed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that all violence ſhould be vſed to conquer the towne by art and cunning, ſeeing that by force he could not effect his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, wherefore he began to apply himſelfe to mynes. But the Budians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduertiſed of this practiſe, tooke ſuch diligent care thereof, that all their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> worke and labour turned to nothing.</p>
            <p>There was at that time within Buda a Hungar very wealthie, named <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemiſſe,</hi> who harboured a ſpeciall hate againſt Frier <hi>George,</hi> for ſome iniurie which he pretended he had done him.

               <hi>Roccandolph</hi> vnderſtanding of this complot by <hi>Ryuall,</hi> well allowed thereof, and hauing concluded betweene themſelues touching the manner that ſhould be obſerued therein: the ſame night, vpon which they had agreed of amongſt themſelues, <hi>Bornemiſſe</hi> failed not to open a poſterne which was in the wall, by which the enemie entered into the towne. But the watch wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the round, perceiuing this ſurpriſe, began to make an alarme, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man had ſpeedie notice thereof. At this bruite and tumult, <hi>Vrbain Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> and <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> (who for that night were Captaines of the watch) ran preſently to the place, where the one part and the other were fighting with great obſtinacie: but in the end the Germanes were forced to turne their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> backes, and ſaue themſelues by the ſame port wherein they entered. In the throng there was taken certaine priſoners, among whom were knowne ſome of familiar acquaintance with <hi>Bornemiſſe.</hi> Thoſe, after due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſcouered the treaſon of <hi>Bornemiſſe,</hi> who was preſently attached, and all his goods ſeazed and confiſcate, who after, by diuers torments, confeſſed all the fact, and was by the commaund of Frier <hi>George</hi> cruelly tormented and executed as a Traytor to his countrie. <hi>Roccandolph</hi> ſeeing all his purpoſes came to no effect, and that fortune hourely did chaunge from proſperitie to aduerſitie, determined with his Captaines to auoyde the occaſions of handy ſtrokes, and onely by a long ſiege to attempt that, which by force of armes he could not performe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time, <hi>Solyman</hi> vnderſtanding the euill entreatie which was vſed to the Queene, and how greatly <hi>Ferdinand</hi> forced himſelfe to take that kingdome from him, which he had giuen to her husband; after ſetting his affayres in order, which he had againſt the Perſians, leauing <hi>Archane</hi> an Eunuch in Meſopotamia, to make head againſt them, if they attempted any thing, ſent <hi>Mahomet Baſha</hi> to ayde the Queene with all his Europian ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, <note place="margin">Mahomet Baſha came to ſuccour Queene Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</note> who among the Turkes are commonly called Rumilar, or Rumiler, and vulgarly Vrumilar, of this word <hi>Romania,</hi> which they call all Greece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Izabella</hi> not being aſſured of any ſuch ſuccors, was brought into great feare and extremitie, not knowing well what might betide her in this behalfe: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> knowing alſo all their doings would but badly ſucceed, and neuer come to good iſſue, if they were intangled by armes: and eſpecially ſeeing that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> for former matters, was grieuouſly offended, and that he conceiued of this matter at the heart againſt her, which alſo did not a little trouble her, becauſe ſhe knew that ſhe maintained an vniuſt cauſe, in not obſeruing the conditions made with him, during her husbands life. Vpon theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhe was often incited to render the towne, and eſpecially knowing <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to be a Prince ſo meeke and curteous, that he would commit no act which ſhould be any thing derogating from her honour, ſhe determined <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to yeeld her ſelfe into his hands.

            <p>Thus during the ſiege, <hi>Solyman</hi> came to Andrionopolis, to be more neere

               <hi>Solyman</hi> came to Andrionopolis, and <hi>Mustafa</hi> drawing towards Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, haſting on his voyage with the greateſt expedition he could, got to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, in which place he ioyned with the Sangiac of that prouince, who alſo was called <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Among them hee found ſufficient men of warre of Boſnia, of whom <hi>Oliman</hi> a Perſian was Sangiac. This name of Sangiac, or <note place="margin">Oliman a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian.</note> Sanzac, doth properly ſignifie an Enſigne of warre, made of a round peece <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of copper guilt ouer, and fixed vpon the top of a ſtaffe, from which there hangeth downe in great treſſes of long haires, or horſe tailes, &amp; vpon the top of that round peece of copper, there is ſometimes faſtned a halfe Moone. <hi>Mahomet</hi> being together with all his troupes, made a good armie, &amp; marched in great iourneys towards Buda. Vpon his comming, the Germanes of <hi>Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candolph</hi> being therof certified, began amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues to take aduice what was beſt to do. Some counſelled to forſake the ſiege, and others to incounter and giue battaile to the Turks. After ſuch and like opinions, that of <hi>Roccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphs</hi> was followed, which was, that it was more expedient to preſerue the armie whole and ſafe, then ſo raſhly to aduenture it, and to doe an act which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> might afterward be found diſhonourable to them all. According to this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he remoued his Campe from the other ſide of the towne to the foote <note place="margin">Roccandolph remoueth his Campe.</note> of S. <hi>Gerrards</hi> hill, hauing the riuer Danubius on the one ſide, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide towards the Eaſt a great plaine, where he was well intrenched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt poſſeſt of the top of the ſaid hill, where he well furniſhed himſelfe with Artillerie. And in this manner he attended his enemies, with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, that if they ſhould aſſaile him, he would fight with them, and moleſt them with his Artillerie from the top of that hill, and if hee ſhould be the weaker, or in any perill, he would retire himſelfe to the riuer, where he had many boates for that purpoſe, to goe and come to Peſthe, from whence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with more men he might reenforce his Campe, and entertaine the Turkes with little skirmiſhes, and in the meane time by a long ſiege to annoy the towne. <hi>Roccandolph</hi> being thus buſied, the Turkes began to approach, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> had ſent to view the ſituation of his Campe, and what courage his people were of. <hi>Roccandolph</hi> performed the like by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who approched ſo neere him, that his Tents were no further from the Germanes then halfe <note place="margin">Mahomet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped by Roccandolph.</note> a mile, cauſing all his Campe to bee enuironed by the Aſapes with a trench, and certaine rampiers. The other <hi>Mahomet</hi> of Belgrade was lodged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next hils which compaſſed that plaine, where <hi>Roccandolph</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and lodged himſelfe right ouer againſt S. <hi>Gerrards</hi> hill, neere vnto the Hungars of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who were lodged in that quarter. After that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> enemies were thus ſeated, the two <hi>Mahomets</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadours to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Queene, and preſented her with a great quantitie of Sheepe and <note place="margin">Preſents ſent to Queene Izabella by Mahomet.</note> Lambes, which they had brought along with them out of the countrie.

thereof, greatly commending the force and conſtancie of the Budians, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that had ſo gallantly reſiſted the forces of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſaying vnto them, that they alwaies bore them ſpeciall good will, and that they came for no other intent, then to reuenge all the wrong and iniuries which was offered to them. And hauing conferred with the Queene of all that which was giuen them in charge, they returned againe, receiuing preſents double as rich as thoſe which they brought with them, being honourably and pleaſantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. The Turkes, by many aſſaults, ſuffered <hi>Roccandolph</hi> to take no reſt, whileſt on both ſides he was hindered by prouiding boates and barkes to keepe firme before one part of the Turkiſh armie which came vp Danubius, and was alreadie arriued at an Iland called Chep, nigh vnto the banke ſide, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which, if he had followed the aduice that the Hungars preſcribed, ſhould haue been fortified and well planted with Artillerie, before the enemies had been maſters thereof, for by that meanes they might haue endamaged their armie, and eaſily defended that they ſhould not haue incamped there, by reaſon they ſhould haue been conſtrained (maugre their wils) to forſake that plaine, and retire backe, conſidering that from that Ile, the Cannon might ſcoure the plaine in any part whereſoeuer. But wicked and aduerſe deſtinie, willing that Buda ſhould by any meanes whatſoeuer fall into the hands of <hi>Solyman,</hi> and that the armie of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by the careleſnes of the Commaunders, ſhould bee broken and ouerthrowne, blinded <hi>Roccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that he had no care to fortifie it, but onely with certaine ſouldiours, and a few field peeces. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was not in any thing negligent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing another hill, which was by the Iland where the Germanes had the guard (being very drowſie and ſluggiſh in their charge) did deliberate with himſelfe to aſſaile them on the ſudden, whileſt in another place he cauſed the alarme to be giuen to the whole bodie of <hi>Roccandolphs</hi> Campe. Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this determination, before the dawning of the day he commaunded his veſſels to ſaile before the Ile, and giue the aſſault vpon thoſe of <hi>Roccandolph,</hi> which were alſo by the Ile, and againſt the bridge, which he cauſed to bee built, that vpon any occaſion he might ſaue himſelfe and retire to Peſthe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The Ianiſaries entring ſuddenly within this Ile, began to cut the throates of <note place="margin">The Ile of Chep taken by the Turks.</note> the ſouldiours who had the guard thereof, and of whom before they were wakened from their dead ſleepe, and that they were ſomewhat ſafe from the feare that had before poſſeſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there remained ſlaine vpon the place well neere 600. The bruite of this alarme being ſpread abroad, our ſouldiours, who were on the other ſide, putting themſelues in order, began to diſcharge certaine peeces of Artillerie, which were vnder the couert of a wood, lately cut, by the riuers ſide, and ſo greatly annoyed the armie of the Turkes, that they were very rudely diſordered: and if thoſe of <hi>Roccandolphs</hi> armie had that day acquited themſelues of their vttermoſt deuoire, they had quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all their enemies, who in the end, by the diſorder that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt ours, and by the dexteritie of the Ianiſarie harquebuziers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained victorious, all the veſſels of <hi>Roccandolph</hi> being taken and broken, the greateſt part of the bridges cut off, and the Ile vnder the Turkes command. At the ſame inſtant <hi>Mahomet</hi> commaunded that the reſt of <hi>Roccandolphs</hi> Campe ſhould be aſſailed in two places, which then by the proweſſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21983:38"/>
of the Bohemians and Hungars, and certaine Germane Captaines, they held good, and for that time maintained firme and ſure footing. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the tediouſnes of the fight was an occaſion that the forces of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> waxed faint and wearie: and to the contrarie, thoſe of Buda, by reaſon of the Turkiſh ayde, increaſed their courage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solyman</hi> being aduertiſed of all that which paſſed vntill then, departed <note place="margin">Solyman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth into Hungarie.</note> from Andrionopolis in great iourneys with 200000. men to come to Buda, and marching with great diligence, gaue notice to <hi>Mahomet</hi> of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which being alſo knowne to <hi>Peren,</hi> who was one of the chiefeſt of <hi>Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candolphs</hi> armie, cauſed preſently the Councel to aſſemble, perſwading them inſtantly to retire to Peſthe, and not to attend the arriuall of all the Turkiſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> force. To this opinion <hi>Roccandolph</hi> anſwered, that he could not depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the commaund of <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> and vpon that reſolution, <hi>Salm</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to goe towards Vienna, and whileſt within a Brigantine he went a long Danubius, feare and neceſſitie in the end conſtrained <hi>Roccandolph</hi> to raiſe and retire himſelfe to Peſthe, beginning in this manner to march with <note place="margin">Roccandolph raiſeth his Campe.</note> his people. Firſt, he ſent before all the Hungars with the great Artillerie, waggons, and other baggage, which ſhould any thing annoy his armie vpon the way: after thoſe, all the Germane and Bohemian Caualarie marched, with a good troupe of infantrie: and in the rereward marched all the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with the reſt of the baggage. Euen now the Vauntgard and battaile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> were alreadie (by the obſcuritie of the night) arriued at Danubius, cauſing bridges of boates to be made. When the two <hi>Mahomets</hi> were aduertiſed thereof, by two Vſaron horſemen (who fled from <hi>Roccandolphs</hi> Campe) they preſently aſſembled together, and cauſed their people to march in two places, ſending the Ianiſaries of one ſide, with a good troupe of Caualarie: and on the other ſide, the remainder of al the horſe, with all the infantrie that <note place="margin">The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candolphs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> remained. The beginning of their aſſault was with cryes and horrible ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings directed vpon the Germane quarter, which they preſently fired. The Germanes and Bohemians, who alreadie were at the riuers ſide, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſtoniſhed at ſo ſudden a charge, endeuouring themſelues to diſſemble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> their flight, they began valiantly to make head. But all the reſt of the armie in the Tents was out of order, and eſpecially thoſe a long the ſide of Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, where euery one, without order or ſhame, endeuoured to ſaue himſelfe by preſſing into the boates, and neither by blowes, threates, nor intreaties, were any able to draw them back, much leſſe to make them ſtand and turne their faces: ſo great was the feare they were poſſeſt withall, and the more, in reſpect of the aſtoniſhment which the fearfull thundring of the Cannon made that night in euery place, and euery one was ſo degenerated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, that neither <hi>Roccandolph</hi> nor his commaunds were of any force or authoritie to ſtay them, who alſo, beſides the incomparable griefe which greatly oppreſſed him, was ſore wounded, and by his indiſpoſition, the reſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of the ſouldiours, who were appointed to fight, being aduertiſed of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall feare, retired themſelues by little and little, ſeeking by flight to ſaue themſelues as well as they could. Thus all in the end went to the ſpoyle and ruine of fortune. The ſouldiours of <hi>Peren</hi> were the firſt that were charged by thoſe of Belgrade; and the Germanes, who kept S. <hi>Gerrards</hi> hill, were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21983:38"/>
ouerthrowne by the Ianiſaries and Turkiſh Caualarie, and with great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſlaughter were throwne headlong downe. The Budians ſallying forth by the Port of the water towre (ſo called for that it was continually beaten vpon with the waues of Danubius) and taking a couert way, which was made before by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> charged vpon the flankes of the Bohemians, ouerthrowing all thoſe who were before them. The Turkes who were at the guard of the Ile of Chep, vnderſtanding of this tumult, cauſed their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to flote vp againſt thoſe of <hi>Roccandolphs,</hi> vnder the charge of <hi>Caſſon</hi> their Captaine, who after a long fight againſt their enemies, and ſeeing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of fortune (which vpon all ſides was poured out againſt our ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours) vnlooſing themſelues from the hands of the Turkes, and being more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> light and ſwift then they, began to cut the water with the force of their oares, and with a ſpeedie ſwiftnes ſaued themſelues in the Ile of Comar. Frier <hi>George</hi> in the meane time, in another part ſet fire on the Kings ſtables, which were poſſeſſed by <hi>Roccandolphs</hi> people, and which was full of hay, which burnt ſo cruelly, that the light thereof was ſeene in Peſthe, and by the vehemencie thereof, it ſeemed all Danubius had been on fire. By ſuch an vnlooked for alteration of fortune, all the reſt of <hi>Roccandolphs</hi> Armie hauing loſt both courage and men, they fled in great route, and 3000. ſouldiours of ſeuerall nations, (who flying the crueltie of the enemie, retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the Church of Saint <hi>Gerrard)</hi> were all cut in peeces, not ſparing the life of any, but thoſe which they could ſell or keepe for ſlaues. <hi>Caſſon</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Roccandolph</hi> now ſeeing his Armie to be wholly diſcomfited, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to take a Brygantine, and ſaue himſelfe in the Ile of Comar, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> within few dayes after, he ended his life in the towne of Samar, leauing to <note place="margin">The death of Roccandolph.</note> the Turkes, with great loſſe of his nation, victorie, in which defeature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the loſſe of 36. great peeces of Artillerie, and 150. leſſer, there was ſlaine 25000. men, not counting the infinit number of thoſe who were made ſlaues. <hi>Solyman</hi> (who greatly deſired to giue ſuch a checke) vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to aide the Queene and the Frier, marched with as great diligence as he could, and made verie great haſte; but firſt conceiued with himſelfe, to be ſecure of the ſuſpition which he had of <hi>Stephen Maillat,</hi> (who at that time gouerned Tranſiluania in the name of <hi>Ferdinand)</hi> againſt whom (as we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> haue ſayd before, not willing to leaue behinde him ſuch an enemie) he ſent <hi>Muſtafa.</hi> This man aſſiſted with 30000. horſe by <hi>Peter,</hi> Vayuode of Moldauia, with the Vayuodes of Tranſalpina and Valachia, and with the <note place="margin">Muſtafa war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania.</note> men of <hi>Achomet,</hi> who was Sangiac of Nicopolis, together with this Armie, which beſides the infantrie, amounted to 50000. horſe, ſet forward againſt Tranſiluania, whereinto he entered by Sicilia, notifying to the Tranſiluani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

The Queene ſeeing by this craft and deceit her towne taken, and thoſe great perſonages who accompanied her ſonne, to bee detained priſoners by thoſe, of whom ſhe thought to finde ayde and comfort, knew not for the preſent what to do, being as much as was poſſible, ſurpriſed with a feare of the worſt, &amp; with a certaine griefe which happened by ſuch an vnexpected aduerſitie: ſhe, duly conſidering of theſe premiſes, fearing leaſt the reſt ſhould alſo be taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, writ very humble and ſubmiſſiue letters to <hi>Solyman,</hi> inſtantly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting him not to violate or offer iniurie to the fidelitie, which ſhe had repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, &amp; which he confirmed vnto her by many his Letters patents, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that in like ſort he would be mindful of his accuſtomed clemencie and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie on the behalfe of his childe, who of his owne accord made himſelfe the friend and Vaſſall of his houſe: and that it would pleaſe him to releaſe thoſe Lords, which he detained as priſoners, who had ſo well ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and defended her, during the paſſed warres, conſidering that vpon his faith and royall promiſe ſhe had ſent them with her ſonne. This letter being ſent, was ſufficient to mollifie the outragious furie of the Turke, who, vpon the receipt thereof, held a Councell to conſult thereupon. And opinions <note place="margin">A Councell held vpon the deliuerie of the priſoners.</note> were different, and did not agree together. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Gouernour of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, with many other, would that all thoſe Lords that were priſoners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſhould be beheaded, and that they ſhould ſend the Queene and her ſonne to Conſtantinople; that hee ſhould place a Baſha in Buda, with a good and ſtrong garriſon to gouerne and defend it againſt the aſſaults of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. On the other ſide, <hi>Rostan Baſha</hi> (vnto whom the Queene had ſent rich preſents) refuted the opinion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and of his adherents: ſaying, that if <hi>Solyman</hi> followed their aduice, he would greatly blemiſh the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his renowne, and that his faith and promiſe would not bee any whit at all eſteemed among other nations, when they ſhould ſo apparantly ſee that it was not obſerued, eſpecially to thoſe, vnto whom at their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and intreaties, he had giuen it for ayde and ſuccour; and that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Buda conſidered, neuer any would afterwards call him to ſuccour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> them, fearing that the like ſurpiſe would happen to them: and therefore he thought it better to ſuffer the Queene to enioy her ſtate in peace, with ſome augmentation of tribute, and by that meanes he ſhould auoyde the infamie of infidelity, whereinto euery one of them ſhould fall with euerlaſting igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. By meanes of ſuch diuerſitie of opinions, the Baſhaes could not agree,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21983:41"/>
               <hi>Solyman</hi> not determined of any reſolution, diſſolued the Councel, ſeeing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> time was come wherein (according to his law) he ſhould offer ſacrifice to God, which was the 30. of Auguſt: and to that end he ſent into Buda his <note place="margin">Sacrifice made by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman in the great Church of Buda.</note> Prieſts, to conſecrate for him the great Church, according to the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner.

But taking a more milde and pleaſing courſe, hee gaue notice to the Queene, that ſhe <note place="margin">Solyman ſent Queene Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella and her ſonne Stephen to gouerne in Tranſiluania.</note> and her ſonne ſhould preſently depart the Caſtle, and that ſhe ſhould retyre to Lippa, which is beyond Tibiſcus, to gouerne the kingdome of Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> where ſhe might liue in better ſecuritie and content, then at Buda, and where ſhe ſhould be a neighbour to the kingdome of <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia her father, and there they ſhould remaine vntill her ſonne ſhould come to age, and be able to gouerne and rule that kingdome, of which he offered himſelfe to bee an ouerſeer and protector, promiſing to make reſtitution thereof vnto him at that time; alleadging for his excuſe, that it imported her ſonne no leſſe to haue ſufficient and carefull ouerſeers to gouerne Hungarie, then of other perſons able to defend and preſerue it for him. Whereupon he nominated <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> to be Gouernour of the County of Themeſuar, &amp; of <note place="margin">Peter Vicchy Gouernour of Tranſiluania.</note> the neighbour countries bordering thereon, and willed that <hi>Stephen Verbetz,</hi>

And to encourage her the more to depart, and beginne her iourney with beſt conuenience, hee offered her waggons and horſe, as many as ſhould bee ſufficient to carrie her baggage, and other moueables, and beſides, he appointed her a ſufficient conuoy of Caualarie, and Ianiſaries to accompanie her vnto Tibiſcus, he hauing (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe his fained promiſes) another ſecret intention in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that within a while he would make himſelfe abſolute Lord, not only of Tranſiluania, but alſo of all Hungarie, which was on the other ſide of Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius towards Vienna, not being able at that time to proſecute ſo difficult a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> matter, in reſpect of many occaſions &amp; impediments, which did then great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder him from it.

The Queene hauing vnderſtood this cruell and vnlooked for commaund, and bathing her face with teares, did extreamely blame and grieuouſly crie out againſt the naturall impietie of ſo damnable and faithles a Lord, who (againſt his vowed faith) depriued her both of her kingdome, and of all that which ſhe held moſt deere: but ſeeing no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhe patiently yeelded to fortune her enemie, and left the Fortreſſe (out <note place="margin">The Queene departeth from Buda.</note> of the which the Turkes would not ſuffer her to take any Artillerie nor mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, but onely her moueables) and tooke her iourney out of the towne of Buda, with ſuch prouiſion of waggons and horſe, as <hi>Solyman</hi> would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point her.</p>

Vpon her departure, the Turke preſently ſet at libertie all thoſe Lords <note place="margin">The Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Lords ſet at libertie.</note> which he kept priſoners, except <hi>Valantine Turky,</hi> who, as hath been ſaid, was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſent priſoner with <hi>Maillat</hi> to Conſtantinople, where within a while after they both dyed.

They being thus at libertie, they preſently went to the Queene, who, together with them and the Frier, and certaine other of her houſehold, tooke their way towards Tranſiluania, being often conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of horſes, to draw her Coach with oxen, which ſhe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding endured with an inuincible and noble courage: alreadie very well <note place="margin">The conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Queene.</note> perceiuing that her affayres were in a manner declining; and beſides, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> her ſelfe (according to womans nature) to bee a weake and tender woman, not able to reſiſt ſo ſad and heauie blowes, which fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan alreadie to torment her with.

            <p>In the meane time while the Queene with theſe complaintes and griefes drew neere Tranſiluania, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> hauing receiued vnder the conduct of <hi>Roccandolph</hi> this bloudie ouerthrow, and wonderfull loſſe of people, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Artillerie, Munition, and ſpeciall townes of importance, diſtruſting the Turk would amaſſe together all his Armie before Vienna, preſently diſpatched <hi>Leonard Velſh</hi> to the Ile of Comar, (after the death of <hi>Roccandolph)</hi> to reallie <note place="margin">Ferdinand ſent to Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund peace.</note> the remnant of his Armie, and with all ſpeed to conduct them to Vienna, and to fortifie the ſaid Ile with the beſt defence he could. And ſeeing on the other ſide his brother the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> ſo buſied in the affaires of Germanie, that he could not then ſend him any ſuccours, did deliberate with himſelfe by Ambaſſages to require peace, and to proue how <hi>Solyman</hi> was affected towards him.

And the rather to perſwade him vnto it, they declared to him, how <hi>Iohn</hi> acknowledging to poſſeſſe that kingdome vniuſtly, had in the time of his life, of his owne accord compacted with their Maſter, that after his death, it ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to him, allotting to his ſonne ſuch a reuenew as ſhould be conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintaine his eſtate, he knowing himſelfe to be choſen King, rather by the fauour of fortune, then by his owne demerits. Therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought <hi>Solyman</hi> to accept into that kingdome, rather their Maſter for his friend and Vaſſall, then for his neighbour and enemie, conſidering he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> alreadie created King of Bohemia, and elected by the Germanes King of the Romanes, and that he was by the Hungers themſelues, rather deſired to be their King then any other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solyman</hi> hauing well vnderſtood their demaunds, and greatly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their preſents, aunſwered them that within three dayes they ſhuld know further of his pleaſure. When two dayes were expired, he cauſed <hi>Roſtan</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha to impart vnto them his whole intention, who tolde them, that <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> ſhould render all the townes which had been in the poſſeſſion of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> which he did enioy, and that he ſhould vtterly renounce the kingdom of Hungarie; and that <hi>Solyman</hi> for the iniuries which he had receiued of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him (by reaſon whereof he was often forced to take armes) was content notwithſtanding to pardon him with a light penaltie; to wit, in paying tribute for the Countrie of Auſtria for the time to come. Vpon ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Roſtan</hi> ſaid that <hi>Solyman</hi> was content to entertaine peace and friendſhip with their Maſter, or elſe if he would not accept thereof, that then he would not ceaſe to make continuall warre vpon him, and would preſently ſend to deſtroy, and wholly to ruinate all the Countrie of Auſtria.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours ſeeing they could not obtaine any thing worthie their comming, and that all theſe their proceedings would diſſolue into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> winde, demaunded reſpite to anſwer this ſo vnworthie anſwer, ſo farre out of peaceable tearmes, and withall to ſend vnto <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> which was not granted to them.

But theſe Ambaſſadours made ſhew as though they vnderſtoode it not, and in ſtead of propounding other matters, they tooke occaſion to demaund <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

            <p>Whileſt thoſe were in their way to Vienna, <hi>Solyman</hi> after he had fortified all the frontiers, diſlodged from Buda with his armie, taking the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Solyman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Conſtandinople, leauing within the towne of Buda a ſtrong garriſon, vnder the commaund of a Hungar named <hi>Solyman,</hi> who was turned Turke, and who for martiall affayres ſhould defend and gouerne the towne; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing beſides for the executing of iuſtice (willing thereby to gratifie the Budians) <hi>Stephen Verbetz,</hi> whom they all knew to bee a man of ſincere life.</p>
            <p>As theſe affayres were diſpatched at Buda by <hi>Solyman,</hi> the Queene tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed continually vntill ſhe approached neere vnto Tranſiluania, when ſhe was aduertiſed by all the principall of the kingdome, that they would not ſuffer her to enter thereinto, leaſt by the like deceit it ſhould happen to them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> as it fortuned to thoſe of Buda: whereupon ſhe was conſtrained after ſo long a iourney, to repoſe her ſelfe at Lippa, where being arriued with her ſonne, ſhe preſently ſent to ſeeke Frier <hi>George,</hi> that by the friendſhip and fauour of <note place="margin">The Queene was receiued into Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania by the fauour of George.</note> certaine of the chiefeſt, who were ſpecially affected to his part, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his friends, ſhe might by their good liking enter peaceably into the kingdome. <hi>George,</hi> by the helpe of his friends, effected ſo much, that the Tranſiluanians were content to receiue her as their Queene, and vſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her ſonne, with no leſſe dutie, then if he had been <hi>Iohn</hi> his father, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him as their King, &amp; his mother as his gouerneſſe. Beſides, the Frier managed the affayres ſo well, that he was againe elected and confirmed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the countrie, great Treaſure, and generall gouernour of that prouince: and within a while he returned to the Queene, who preſently after his arriuall, ceaſed not to iourney vntill ſhe came to Tranſiluania, leauing to <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> the gouernment of the Countie of Lippa, and Themeſuar, in reſpect of the confidence ſhe repoſed in him, to the end that he receiuing ſo large a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of her, ſhe might haue more confidence that he would hold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it in her ſonnes name and to his vſe. But this gouernment did, together with the time, ſo puffe vp his heart with pride, that he durſt aduenture to poſſeſſe thoſe places as his owne inheritance, and not as things moueable, or depending vpon the Crowne of that kingdome; and yet notwithſtanding he did not this but by ſome ſecret conſent of the Queene. She being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> in this countrie, began now to take the rule and adminiſtration of the kingdome, in ſuch manner, that ſhe had onely but the name and title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all the puiſſance and authoritie being in the hands of the Frier, who, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of his eſtate of Treaſurerſhip, receiued into his cuſtodie all the reuenewes of the kingdome, and ſo little did he diſtribute and allow to the

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And hee determining to rule all things, ayded himſelfe by all the ſuttleſt meanes, which he thought could any way profit him, to commaund ouer the mightieſt of the kingdome, endeuouring himſelfe in the beginning, by infinit curteſies, to draw all the gentlemen to his part, and make his faction great, who, after hee had wonne and intiſed them to his diſpoſe, then vſed them like ſlaues: and if it happened that they at any time complained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, preſently he excuſed and cleered himſelfe, ſaying, that it was not needfull to vſe ſuch curteſies and ceremonies with thoſe who were his familiar and kinde friends, but rather to ſuch who were not in any ſort bound to him by ſo ſtrict and faithfull a league. And if he had notice of any one who would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not be allured and wonne to his faction, but rather was enclined to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Queene, he ſtraight purſued them with all violence euen vnto death. All this behauiour of the Friers was well knowne to the Queene, in regard whereof ſhe deeply maliced him: and although ſhe could hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the griefe and diſcontent of ſuch a burdenſome yoke, yet neuertheleſſe ſhe endured all his arrogancie and peremptorie behauiour with incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patience, ſtill hoping that time (according to cuſtome) would reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die all: all Empires, eſtates, riches, honours, pouerties, glories, triumphs, and all proſperous and aduerſe things, being ſubiect continually to incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant alteration, and there being nothing vnder the concauitie and cope of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> heauen, which continueth long in one and the ſame eſtate, but is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced within a ſhort time to chaunge the forme, habit, and colour, and which ſheweth not the inſtabilitie of humane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to bee conformable to the naturall chaunge of her courſe.</p>

            <p>Counte <hi>Salms</hi> made him anſwer, that he would very willingly vndertake to aduertiſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of all which had paſſed betweene them two.

            <p>This conference was not ſo priuate, but the Queene had preſent notice thereof: and well knowing that the Frier ſounded all the meanes to doe her the greateſt miſchiefe and ſpite he could, ſhe vnderſtood that he ſecretly practiſed to accompliſh fully his thoughts, and put her to all trauaile and paine, which hee thought good and meete to chaſe her out of her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: ſhe well knowing that for this end, and not to doe him ſeruice, nor for any other occaſion, then that which he falſely and wickedly pretended, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> practiſed to ioyne with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and take part with him: and knowing her ſelfe to be a Queene of weake force, and a woman without the ayde of any Chriſtian Prince, and euen of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelfe, by the friendſhip and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of whom ſhe hoped to preuaile in her neceſſities, being depriued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the ſubtilties and crafts of the Frier; ſhe was conſtrained that ſhe might not behold a man (to whom ſhe wiſhed ſo much ill) to triumph ouer her and her ſonne; rather to ſerue her preſent neede with the promiſe and offer of the Turke, eſteeming it better for her to endure all that which ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to her, by the violence of this great diſaſter, then the euill (although it would proue but little) which might betide her by the Friers wicked po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and practiſes. Vpon this reſolution, ſhe preſently diſpatched <hi>Iohn So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanze</hi> (a man of good eſteeme, and greatly renowned in thoſe countries, <note place="margin">The Queene ſent to Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him of the Friers practiſes.</note> and who was very much deuoted to her) to goe to Conſtantinople, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Solyman</hi> with the practiſes that Frier <hi>George</hi> wrought againſt her. He trauailing with good expedition, arriued in ſhort time before the Turke, to whom he imparted all the effect of his Ambaſſage. <hi>Solyman,</hi> who by his owne people had beene alreadie aduertiſed of all the affayres which were done in Tranſiluania, and namely of the Friers proceedings, was at this new information, prouoked and incenſed the more, and ſent preſently one of his Chiauſes to the Baſha of Buda, with expreſſe commaund that he ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> either take the Frier aliue or dead; he alſo writing to the Tranſiluanians, that they ſhould fauour and aſſiſt his Chiauſs in all things which he might neede from them: and charged him that if he did ſee that they could not execute that which he would, that then he ſhould ſhew them other Letters Patents, by which he depriued the Frier of all his degree, dignitie, and ſtate, and commanded them all no longer to obey him, but to oppoſe themſelues againſt him, and according to the manner of that countrie, that they ſhould endeuour to kill him as a traytor, and theefe, and if any refuſed to execute this commaund, he ſhould threaten them all with death, and ruinate and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> quite ſubuert the whole countrie.

            <p>The Chiauſs was ſcarcely departed from Conſtantinople, and theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds diſpatched by <hi>Solyman,</hi> but Frier <hi>George</hi> had preſently ſecret and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

Vpon which occaſion, being well aduiſed, he retired himſelfe from the Queenes Court, to a towne of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> good ſtrength called Saſſebeſſe, which he preſently cauſed to be well victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled <note place="margin">George reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebeſſe.</note> and fortified, putting therein a good ſtrong garriſon, clenſing and deepning the ditches, heightning the rampiers, repayring the wals where they were decayed, and furniſhing it with Artillerie, ſufficiently to ſuſtaine the brunt of a ſiege; &amp; in the meane while, he forgot not by the beſt meanes that he could deuiſe, and particularly by good words, to cleere himſelfe to the Turke. During this time, whileſt hee was carefull with expedition to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this matter, yet neuertheleſſe (as being very vigilant) he omitted not to practiſe on the other ſide what was fitting for him, that he might not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. Therefore he called together all his friends, and eſpecially the Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> (who are the warlikeſt people in that kingdome) and from amongſt them he tooke into his pay 4000. firſt cauſing them to ſweare that they ſhould bee faithfull to him.

            <p>The Queene vnderſtanding of all theſe preparations, and certainly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſuch intelligence as was brought her, that the Frier made full account to poſſeſſe all, and that then for the preſent ſhe had no other meanes but take him by force, and fearing withall that ſhe ſhould bee chaſed out of her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, before any ſuccours could come to her ayde; writ with all ſpeede to the Baſha of Buda, and to the two Vayuodes, that according vnto the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which they had receiued from the grand Seigniour, they ſhould ſend <note place="margin">The Queene gathereth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt George.</note> her preſent ayde, ſhe ſpeedily aduertiſing them in what eſtate the Friers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres were.

Vpon this reſolution, he ſent in the night certaine Spies, diligently to view and conſider the order and martialing of his enemies Campe, the guards, watch, and number, and in concluſion their qualitie and condition, whether they were hirelings, or of the number of thoſe who were to performe ſuch a dutie, and whether they were more of foote or horſe, and in what place, and how they were lodged, to the end, that as occaſion ſerued, he might more commodiouſly fight with them, without preiudice of his owne people. Theſe Spies in the night entering into the Campe of the Ratians, perceiued <note place="margin">Thomas Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocce defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the armie of Vicchy.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> nothing elſe amongſt them but diſorder, and that aboue all very great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes, in ſo much that they were of preſent opinion, that <hi>Varcocce</hi> might with great facilitie ouerthrow and defeate them. They hauing with good vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie ſuruaied this drowſie leager, returned againe to <hi>Varcocce,</hi> acquainting him with all that they had ſeene and knowne. This increaſed his courage, and redoubled his deſire to giue them battaile: and in the meane time giuing notice to thoſe of Senath, of that which he determined to doe, martialed his ſquadrons in three parts; placing in the firſt good ſtore of Caualarie, with many Infantrie; and in the other (which was towards a little hill) making a left wing thereof, he placed the reſt of his Infantrie, which were flanked with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a good troupe of horſe, to the end, that as the firſt ſquadron ſhould charge vpon the flankes of the enemie, this ſhould ſpread it ſelfe in forme of a Creſſant, and with one of the hornes thereof to beare in vpon the taile of the enemie, and with the other to force the left flanke; and as for himſelfe, with the beſt horſe and foote he had, was placed in the middeſt, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſaile the enemie before. Diſpoſing of his people in this manner, one morning two houres before day, he marched with ſo great ſilence, that his arriuall was ſooner felt, then they had any inckling of his comming, and arriued euen by day breake among the Ratians, who thought themſelues ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and charged them at one inſtant in three ſundrie places, with ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and furie, and with ſo great a noyſe of Trumpets, Drummes, Phifes, and cryes, that it ſeemed the world would haue turned topſie turuie. The Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſeeing themſelues (contrary to their expectation) to be aſſailed in three places, and furiouſly charged, they could not ſo ſoone, as neceſſitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, put themſelues in battaile for their defence, but began wholly to bee diſcomforted, and ſought their priuate ſafetie by an ignominious flight, which they bought deere at <hi>Varcocces</hi> hand, who thereupon made a great butcherie and ſlaughter of them, purſuing them euen to their homes, and ranging the countrie as victorious, and in his retraict led with him 4000. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, with great and rich ſpoyles of his enemies, of whom he put to the ſword <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 2500. Hauing by this ouerthrow reduced the countrie to his true and ancient obedience; and hauing aſſured it from the aſſaults of warre, and infranchiſed this Caſtle from ſuch an extremitie, he victoriouſly returned to Varadine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholas Serpietre,</hi> chiefe leader of theſe Ratians, eſcaping halfe naked

from this tempeſt, retired himſelfe ſafe and ſound into a Caſtle of his owne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> where his wife was remaining, to whom (almoſt with teares) he ſorrowfully recounted all the ſucceſſe of his diſgrace, vnfortunately happened to him, imputing to fortune the loſſe of his people, which indeede happened by his euill and negligent gouernment. His wife hearing this diſcourſe, in ſtead of condoling and comforting his hard diſaſter, began, not as a woman, but as a man of courage, reſolute to vpbraide and reprehend his womaniſh ſpirit: ſaying to him, that he ſhould for ſhame returne, and recouer the honour of <note place="margin">The maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous courage of a Ratian wife.</note> his blood and houſe, which chieſly he had loſt, otherwiſe, that ſhe would neuer conſent to bee called the wife of him, that was worſe then the baſeſt and cowardlieſt woman whoſoeuer, and that he deſerued not to haue an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> heire of his linage, ſince ſo baſely he ſhewed himſelfe in ſuch an act. The husband would willingly haue replied and alleadged ſome excuſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whereupon ſhe more inflamed with ire then before, added preſently: <q>I would to God (ſaid ſhe) that thou hadſt rather beene brought to me in a thouſand peeces, if thou hadſt dyed in glorie and renowne, rather then to liue in health, as I now behold thee, bringing with thee nought but diſhonor and ignomie: knowing well that thou neuer tookeſt this reproachfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thy forefathers, who neuer yet fell into ſuch vnſeemely cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whereinto thy ſelfe art now deeply plunged. And who of our time is he, that by ſo baſe &amp; vile a courage hath committed ſo foule and enormious a fault? and who hath euer left vnto his heires ſo great and infamous an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> without being reuenged, as they ſelfe? Doeſt thou not thinke that it would rather haue reioyced and contented me, if thou hadſt with thine owne hands ſlaine our enemies, and that my ſelfe, euen with my mouth might haue ſucked their blood, then to ſee them ſo cruelly murthering ours, and to ſucke the blood of mine? And neuertheleſſe, thou leauing all thine dead in the place, dareſt now preſume to come crying before me as a little girle, euen as ſound and whole as when thou didſt depart from thy houſe. Auoyde infamous man, and cauſe that mine eyes doe neuer behold thee, for they ſhall haue as great ſhame to ſee thee to bee my husband, as my ſelfe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> behold my ſelfe to bee thy wife, ſince the condition and noblenes of my blood abhorreth the indignitie of thy perſon, whom (if it had pleaſed God) I would in regard of ſo ſhameles a fact, I had neuer knowne thee, and ſo I would eſteeme my ſelfe more proud and ioyfull, then now I am, and in ſtead of life, I ſhould not bee ſo vrged, as now I am, to deſire death.</q> She hauing ended theſe words, inflamed with ire and great indignation, departed from him, being many daies and moneths before ſhe would once vouchſafe to ſee him againe.</p>
            <p>Whileſt fortune in this ſort fauoured the affayres of <hi>Varcocce,</hi> the Frier went to Megeſt, not in reſpect he miſdoubted the ſtrength of Saſſebeſſe, but onely to be more neere vnto the Sicilians, vpon whoſe forces he greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> himſelfe, there being the principall of the kingdome ranged on the <note place="margin">The Chiauſs of Solyman in fauour of the Queene threatneth the Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanians.</note> Queenes part, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were very fauourable, vntill the Chiauſs (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue before ſpoken) being without hope any longer to delude the Frier, or obtaine him by any ſtratagem, did diuulge to them the Turkes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, telling them, that if all of them did not preſently take armes againſt

the Frier, he would procure the Baſha of Buda, and the two Vayuodes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Moldauia and Tranſalpina, to chaſtice and handle them, as the deſerts of diſobedient perſons merited, deſtroying all their townes, and ruinating the whole countrie, as they were wont to doe. But theſe threatnings little profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Queene, but to the contrarie, ſo incenſed the hearts of thoſe who were adhearing to her part to ſuccour her, that ſeeing the Turke began to take vpon him to ayde her, they wholly diſmiſſed themſelues from her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, in reſpect of the naturall hate which they bore to the Turkes. Vpon this occaſion the Frier omitted no oportunitie, but thereby did the better <note place="margin">The Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Queene.</note> ſhadow his ambitious proceedings, imparting to thoſe Lords, that if they any longer fauoured the Queenes part, they might be well aſſured, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> would be the manifeſt ruine and vtter ſubuerſion of their countrie, ſeeing it was apparant, that vnder the colour of ayde, ſhe endeuoured to bring the Turkes in among them, who once knowing the Fortreſſes and difficult paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, the condition and fertilnes of the countrie, and prying by all deuiſes into their commodities, and their other actions, they might within ſhort time finde the meanes to patronize themſelues of all Tranſiluania, euen as by the like facts they tyrannouſly haue made themſelues maſters of all Greece.</p>
            <p>By theſe and ſuch like perſwaſions, the Lords were drawne vnto his fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, abſolutely leauing the Queene, and they amaſſed and vnited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with the Frier, that within few daies he aſſembled a good armie, and incamped before Albe-iula, where for the moſt part the Queene made her <note place="margin">George in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Albeiula.</note> abode, with ſuch few men as ſhe had of the countrie, the chiefe and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall of whom was <hi>Peter Vicchy.</hi> Both parties being thus certaine daies without performing any memorable act, the one againſt the other, the Sicilians began to mutinie; ſaying, they would returne home againe, and that they would no longer remaine in that place againſt the Queene. The Frier not knowing the cauſe of this mutinie, armed himſelfe with his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe, and being well mounted, went into the middeſt of the mutiners, who vnderſtanding the cauſe that did thus moue them to this tumult, anſwered them in this ſort; that they ſhould not bee aſtoniſhed at ſo great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a delay, the which was not done without ſpeciall aduice and benefit to the whole countrie, and that thereof, there ſhould proceede great good and quiet to euery one, for that now in the meane time an agreement was laboured betweene himſelfe and the Queene, which was almoſt well brought to paſſe. And for that cauſe he prayed them a while to haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, not doubting but this buſines would effect to good end, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they ſhould returne with great content and quiet. By ſuch and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſweete perſwaſions (which he well knew at pleaſure how to vſe both in time and place) he appeaſed all this tumult, yet not without great trauaile and labour. But ſeeing it was no eaſie matter for him to entertaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them with words, but that he muſt in the end conclude by deedes, for that theſe diſſentions were like to continue long, and end by warre and battaile, (which the Sicilians by no meanes would endure) he began (knowing it greatly imported him, in reſpect the Baſha of Buda, the Moldauian, and the Tranſalpinian were comming againſt him with three armies) diligently
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21983:48"/>
to ſeeke an agreement betweene himſelfe and the Queene, who alſo was <note place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Queene and George.</note> greatly inclined to peace, (for that ſhe doubted no ayde would come from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Turke) and ſhe preſently accepted of the conditions which the Frier of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her; and the rather, in regard ſhe was disfurniſhed of neceſſaries for the maintenance of warre, as of men, money, fauour, and forſaken (as ſhe thought) of the Turke, in whom ſhe repoſed but little truſt. And being a ſole woman, not hauing any whom ſhe might aſſure her ſelfe to relie vpon, ſhe thought that the continuance of this peace would be very momentarie; notwithſtanding of two euils ſhe determined to chuſe the leaſt, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepted of this agreement which was concluded betweene them; and both willingly diſmiſſed all their forces. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt Frier <hi>George</hi> and the Queene were in tearmes of reconciliation, the Baſha of Buda on the one part, and the two Vayuodes on the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carefully ſolicited by the Queene, were alreadie in their way, whileſt theſe broyles were in motion, and euery one of them brought a ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to relieue her: and although ſhe was aduertiſed thereof, yet in ſtead of comming forward, ſhe writ vnto them that they ſhould retire, becauſe the Frier and her ſelfe were now accorded and in tearmes of agreement, and that their comming would bee little profit or commoditie to her. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other would hearken thereunto, for that they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among themſelues, before their retraict, to enter into Tranſiluania. The Queene imagining nothing leſſe, then of the euill which might enſue of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> their proceeding forward, and fearing that it would happen to her, during the peace, which had not chanced to her during the time of warre, to wit, to bee abſolutely depriued of her kingdome; ſent with all expedition to the Frier, to informe him, that he ſhould vſe ſome preſent meanes to preuent this inconuenience, and to endeuour himſelfe with all expedition, that theſe forces might returne into their countries, and that ſhe might not neede to ſend them any preſents, whereby they would the willinger retire. The Frier little reſpecting her requeſt, did not greatly buſie himſelfe about it, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <note place="margin">The arrogan cie of the Frier</note> coldly, that they ſhould cauſe them to returne, who were the cauſe of their comming: and as for preſents, he was not accuſtomed to ſend any to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the Turkes, but onely to Chriſtians. And although he made ſo ſeuere and obſtinate an anſwere to the Queene to vexe her the more, (ſhewing his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe nature) yet neuertheleſſe did he not omit, although it was in vaine, to attempt that which the Queene had commaunded him. But neither the Baſha, nor the Vayuodes made no great account of his words nor gifts, but ſtill came marching on, deſirous with their armies to enuiron and ſubdue the kingdome. Vpon ſuch obſtinacie of theirs, Frier <hi>George</hi> ſeeing it was not <note place="margin">George ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth armes againſt the Turkes.</note> behoouefull for him to omit any time, preſently leauied his people at Torde and Egneth, which are two great townes of Tranſiluania, and inſtantly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> gaue commaund to all the prouinces of the countrie, that euery one ſhould betake himſelfe to armes, for the common good and defence of the countrie, for that the Baſha of Buda, the Moldauian, &amp; the Tranſalpinian, would euery one enter vpon that ſide next adioynant to him, and ſpoile and ruinate the countrie. He ſo diligently applied this buſines, that within few daies he had gathered together 50000. men, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went to Saſſebeſſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21983:48"/>
that from thence he might march againſt the Baſha of Buda, of whom (by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> reaſon he was a good ſouldiour, and experimented in the warre, although he had fewer men) he had more dread then of both the other, who were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be ſo expert ſouldiours. This Baſha arriued with his Campe almoſt at Deua, a Caſtle of good ſtrength, ſituated vpon the riuer of Maroſſe, which <note place="margin">Deua.</note> is one of the principalleſt riuers of that countrie. When the Frier diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Saſſebeſſe &amp; began to march againſt him, he diſpatched vpon the way <hi>Iohn Chendy</hi> (a man of good regarde, and of a noble houſe among the Hungars) with a good troupe of horſe and foote againſt the Tranſalpinian, <note place="margin">Chendy, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of George, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feareth the Tranſalpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> to defend and ſtop the paſſages, whereby he muſt of neceſſitie paſſe, if hee would enter into Tranſiluania, and alſo to hinder him that he ſhould not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ioyne with the Baſha. <hi>Chendy</hi> diligently proceeding on his iourney, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the next townes (beſides the number which he brought with him) almoſt 4000. men, arriued priuately with them, hard adioyning to the enemie, where they were (as they thought) ſecurely incamped without any feare: and being aſſured by certaine Spies, what forme and order they held, he appointed his companies to bee ſtretched forth at large, and ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant was the ſhew, that they appeared to bee infinit; and about day breaking, he began to aſſaile the Tranſalpinians with great noyſe of Trumpets and Drummes, that with the number of men, whereof they were greatly afeard, and the long troupes of their enemies which deſcended from certaine hils, ranging themſelues in battaile, they ſeemed thrice as great as they were, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> verely thinking the Frier had been there in perſon with his whole armie: whereupon their hearts preſently fainted, and they by no meanes would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the iſſue of the battaile, but disbanding themſelues they began to flye, and with ſuch diſorder, that <hi>Chendies</hi> ſouldiours taking courage and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the victorie, purſued them ſo nigh, that in this confuſion of ſlight, they killed more then 5000. and tooke as many priſoners, bringing with them from their chaſe 3000. horſe, and many Enſignes. By this victorie, <hi>Chendy</hi> ſo terrified the Tranſalpinian, that flying from this ouerthrow, through the cowardlines of his people, he druſt not in a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time after take armes againſt the Tranſiluanians. The enemie being thus chaſed on this ſide the countrie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he incontinently returned backe to Frier <hi>George,</hi> inriched with many priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſo great ſpoyle, as it was a woonder to ſee. The Frier after he had diſpatched <hi>Chendy</hi> againſt the Tranſalpinian, at the ſame inſtant commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sicilians, with all expedition they ſhould repayre to defend their moſt important townes, which they thought the Moldauian would aſſaile; that they ſhould fortifie the paſſages, which naturally by the fauour of the ſteepy mountaines, were very inacceſſible, and ſuch that they might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend with few men. The Sicilians, who naturally are ancient enemies to <note place="margin">The Sicilians and Saxons naturall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> the Saxons, being continually catching the one from the other, ſeeing they muſt paſſe by Saſſebeſſe, a principall towne of the ſaid Saxons, and from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thence with violence to proceede through their countrie, leauing that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt regard which they ought to haue had, for the defence of their countrie, they proceeded on to a reuenge, in ſuch ſort, that as ſoone as they arriued at Robet, they began to ranſacke all the houſes which belonged to the Saxons, burning and ruinating the townes they paſſed by, inſomuch that they did
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21983:49"/>
not a little waſte and endamage that people, carrying with them all the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which they got. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt they were thus occupied in ſuch enormious cruelties, they gaue leiſure to the Moldauian to enter into their countrie, and without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, to ruinate and pill their townes, and in deſtroying and burning all their villages, to turne all topſie turuie, which thing (to ſay trueth) was iuſtly permitted of God, to the end, that in reaſon they might endure from their enemies the ſame calamities and miſeries, which ſo vniuſtly they had cauſed thoſe to ſuffer, who in conſideration of common ſafetie, ought then at the leaſt to haue been reputed their friends. Whileſt the Sicilians and Moldauians practiſed theſe cruell exploites, Frier <hi>George</hi> with tedious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> iourneys aduanced his Campe againſt the Baſha of Buda, hauing ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Thomas Varcocce</hi> into the County of Varadine, to gather what force he could, as well Infantrie as horſe, with intent, that if the Baſha would perhaps attempt to paſſe the riuer of Maroſſe, being receiued at the halfe paſſage, he ſhould aſſaile and fight with him before and behinde, or elſe that hee ſhould bee forced to retire halfe broken and ouerthrowne. But the Baſha alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting <note place="margin">The retraict of the Baſha of Buda.</note> the ſame, and being aduertiſed that the Frier came in perſon to fight with him; and fearing that if he proceeded any further, he imagined he might be (as he well conſidered thereof) ſurpriſed in the middeſt, and charged in the rereward, by the companies that were vnder the conduct of <hi>Varcocce,</hi> aſſuring himſefe that he was deceiued by the Queene: whereupon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in the greateſt haſte he could, paſſing a little arme of Maroſſe, he retired, and iournied as farre in one day, as he marched before in ſixe, and went againe to Buda, not without the loſſe of 300. horſe, who were defeated by <hi>Turchy Iohn,</hi> the which before his Vauntgard diſlodged, he had ſent into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie <note place="margin">Turchy Iohn.</note> of Deue, to range as well for victuals, as alſo to diſcouer if there were no ambuſhments to hinder or annoy his retraict. This <hi>Turchy</hi> was ſent by the Frier to preuent him of the paſſage, and to annoy him in his rereward: but the quicknes of the Baſha cauſed that hee arriued too late, and tooke away from him all occaſion of being able to ioyne with <hi>Varcocce,</hi> much leſſe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> endamage his rereward, which might eaſily haue been broken and defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if theſe two had been vnited.</p>
            <p>The Frier being now aſſured by theſe two, that the Baſha was retired in the greateſt expedition he could, turned his Campe againſt the Moldauian, who (as we haue ſaid) ſpoyled and burned the countrie and townes of the Sicilians, and went forward with a vehement reſolution, cruelly to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of the iniurie, which he eſteemed more intolerable, then any that euer he receiued. But the Moldauian hauing notice of the Friers intent, and knowing beſides what had happened to the Tranſalpinian, found it good <note place="margin">The retraict of the Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian.</note> by the aduice of his Councell, not to attend his comming: whereupon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great ſpoyle made in the countrie, he ſpeedily retired himſelfe with his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> people, as well horſe as foote, who were about 30000. leading with them a great bootie of moueables, and beaſts, with more then a thouſand priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who were taken by a Chiauſs of the Turkes, that, in reſpect of the loue and kindnes he bore to him, came thither with certaine troupes of Turkiſh Caualarie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:21983:49"/>
After that Frier <hi>George</hi> had thus chaſed all the enemies out of Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, he retired towards the Queene, where with conſent of all, in reſpect of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his valour and proweſſe (which vndoubtedly was very great) the peace was <note place="margin">The peace confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Queene and George.</note> againe confirmed betweene them two, with ſuch conditions which ſhould like them both: among which he importuned, that the Queene would write to the Turke, and acquite and cleere him of all ſuch matters, whereof before he had been accuſed. Which requeſt, though it was contrarie to her diſpoſition (for women like not to countermaund their owne proceedings) yet notwithſtanding ſhe preſently did it. But the Turke being well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the veritie of the cauſe, and of all that which paſſed; and withall ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how mightie and puiſſant the Frier was, and that the greateſt part of the kingdome was fauourably addicted to his part; he ſmoothly diſſembling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the matter, reſerued the chaſticement thereof, vntill better oportunitie, and made ſhew to the Frier as though he held himſelfe ſatisfied with his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that he very well knew, he of his part was not faultie in any of the late broyles. Whereupon hee ſent another Chiauſs with Letters Patents <note place="margin">Solyman ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Tranſiluani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that they ſhould obey George.</note> directed to all the kingdome, by which he commaunded that euery one ſhould obey and reuerence him, as being againe confirmed in all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer honours and degrees. But yet the peace laſted not long, for the Queene in the end ſeeing the Frier reſpected not any thing which he had promiſed by the laſt agreement, omitted no time, but by the occaſion of his abſence, (being then in his Biſhopricke of Varadine to recreate and ſolace himſelfe) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhe began priuately and vnder hand to raiſe and incenſe the greateſt Lords of the kindome, with intent to aſſiſt her, to chaſe the Frier out of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, <note place="margin">The Queene incenſeth the Tranſiluani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt George.</note> and eſpecially thoſe whom ſhe reputed moſt faithfull and affectionate to her, and moſt oppoſite againſt the Friers proceedings, manifeſting to them how his naturall diſpoſition was inconſtant and cruell, and how he vſed her badly, not willing to keepe nor obſerue any lawes, couenants, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor faith, but aſpiring to the vniuerſall tyrannie of that countrie, he did thus wickedly demeane and behaue himſelfe towards her, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to chaſe both her and her ſonne out of the kingdome, and to remaine ſole and abſolute Lord himſelfe; aſſuring her ſelfe, that for the loue and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which they in former time vſed to King <hi>Iohn</hi> her husband, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies maintained the ſame (notwithſtanding all ſiniſter fortune) in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>Stephen</hi> her ſonne and her ſelfe; in regard whereof they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer endure this iniurie, nor tolerate ſuch a crueltie farre ſurmounting all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practiſed againſt her perſon, in falling from ſo high and eminent dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of a Queene, to become an ordinarie and poore Ladie, and their King of Tranſiluania to become a ſeruant: eſteeming it of greater moment, that they ſhould rather deſire to haue the ſonne of him and their naturall Prince, for their Lord and Patrone, then a Frier voyde of all faith and honeſtie, and onely gorged with ambition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

weakened of men, and depriued of ſuch forces, which were neceſſarie to reſiſt the ſcourges and aſſaults of ſuch vnlooked for fortune; after he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> long pondered vpon theſe affayres, determined vpon this reſolution, to <note place="margin">George a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited himſelfe with Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> accorde and linke himſelfe with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and to conclude with him the practiſes, which oftentimes without effecting, he before had acquainted him with, he being induced and in a manner conſtrained thereunto by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ambition and troubleſome minde (the enemie of quiet repoſe) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tolde him, that if by that meanes he could expell the Queene, he might eaſily compaſſe his intention; which was, to ſee himſelfe abſolute Lord of Tranſiluania, which he ſo much eſteemed, that he would often ſay, he cared neither to be Pope nor Emperour, and that he would neuer goe out of it.

            <p>Now, Counte <hi>Salm</hi> being dead (with whom hee had alreadie begun to treate of this affayre) and knowing not how to effect his determination, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf now neerely driuen, reſolued to negotiate this buſines by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, ſending ſecretly to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> one of his gentlemen, by whom he gaue him to vnderſtand, that he greatly deſired that either one way or other, they would put in practiſe that which he before time had giuen him notice of by Counte <hi>Salm,</hi> inſtantly praying him againe, that he would not faile to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſend ſpeedie ſuccours, and that it would pleaſe him to commit this charge to ſuch a one, that was ſufficient and able to withſtand the Queene, who had againe begun to bandie againſt him. And further he ſhewed him, that if he did not allow &amp; ratifie of his former motions, he ſhould in ſhort time ſee all Tranſiluania vnder the Turks gouernment: alſo willing him, that in the meane while he would ſend ſuch a man as might bee capable, and haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to manage ſuch affayres, becauſe it might ſo fall out, that that which he had often deſired might be effected; to wit, that Queene <hi>Izabella</hi> ſhould wholly and intirely yeeld to him the poſſeſſion of that kingdome: but with this condition, to obſerue ſuch couenants as he had before offered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with King <hi>Iohn:</hi> which if he did execute and performe, then he did not onely promiſe, but alſo liberally offer (giuing him quiet poſſeſſion of all the places and Fortreſſes which were in his gouernment) to vſe ſuch meanes, that he ſhould be thereof abſolute Lord and King: and ſwearing not to faile him in this, he greatly importuned him that he ſhould quickly reſolue.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (although he knew well the mutabilitie of the Friers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and that he might not repoſe any great credence in his words) well remembring how many times before he had cunningly deceiued him: and that he apparantly ſaw that he was not moued to doe him ſo good a deede for that purpoſe which he propounded vnto him, but only for his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate intereſt and commoditie, and that hee might mount to the top of that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which he alreadie had imprinted in his circumuenting braine, and execute his deſeignes: neuertheleſſe, ſeeing on the other ſide if he did not take hold and credit his words, hee ſhould let him ſlide out of his hands, in reſpect whereof he would by no meanes contradict him, eſpecially holding it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for a thing commendable in himſelfe, not to bee reproached nor bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

neceſſaries, which was behoouefull for a battaile. And he ſeeing this towne <note place="margin">Caſtalde cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Agria to be fortified.</note> to bee one of the moſt important of Hungarie, and that it was neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſtrong by ſituation nor rampier, and that there was no induſtrie nor art vſed for the remedie thereof, and that the walles (ſuch as they were) were not yet very well flanked, being rather built after the ancient manner of fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then ſuch as of our time: for the remedy of ſo many inconueniences, he committed the charge therof to <hi>Eraſmus Teufl</hi> to fortifie it, and (by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of <hi>Ferdinand)</hi> not to omit nor deferre the fortifying thereof, vntill he had fully finiſhed it.</p>
            <p>Hauing gathered together all his armie, and ſeeing that in expecting the Cannons (which by the negligence of thoſe who had the charge to ſend them, were not yet arriued, and which might bee the cauſe of ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> inconuenience) he determined neuertheleſſe to depart without them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notice to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that he ſhould cauſe them to bee ſent with as great expedition as could be. Reſting vpon this determination, he departed from Agria the 26. of May, appointing his armie to march in this manner. Hee placed in the Vauntgard ſeuen Enſignes of Spaniards, who were in number 1200. and 500.

This preſently was done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with ſuch dexteritie and iudgement, that thoſe Lords eſteemed the armie to be of farre greater number, then indeed it was, and ſeeing all the ſouldiours well ordered and marching with a graue and ſettled countenance, they highly commended their ordinance. The armie being certaine daies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in this towne, they all together continued on their iourney, vntill

            <p>During the march of this armie, and that they haſted to arriue at the place <note place="margin">The Queene cauſed a Diet to be held at Egneth.</note> where Frier <hi>George</hi> was, the Queene had publiſhed a Diet to bee held at Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, (which is one of the greateſt townes of Tranſiluania) there to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and aduiſe what meanes was beſt to chaſe and expell the Frier out of that Prouince. He at that time (as wee haue ſaid) was at his Biſhopricke of Varadine, and vnderſtanding the drift of the Queene, and to what purpoſe ſhe laboured, omitting all things, which then he was greatly buſied about, called for his Coach, and in the greateſt haſte he could, tooke the way that lead towards Chereſuania. Vpon the way, paſſing a little brooke which runneth by a valley, it happened that his Coach ouerturned in ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> manner, that if hee had not inſtantly been helped by his men, he had there been drowned. Certaine gentlemen of his traine, ill interpreting this accident, aduiſed him to returne from thence: but hee ſmiling, made them this anſwer: That ſuch diuinations as were grounded vpon Chariots, were exceeding miſerable; knowing that they had in heauen another Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, which by his influence would warrant him: minding by his pleaſant countenance to inferre, that the Chariot of <hi>Erictonius</hi> placed in heauen, ſhould among other ſignes ſtand him in ſtead of a guide: and ſo with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition continuing on his iourney, within ſhort time he approached neere to Torde, from whence hee wrote to all the Lords, who were with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Queene, and ſpecially to his friends, that if they would ſee the ſafegard and defence of their countrie, and that the whole kingdome ſhould not bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne and loſt, and fall into the puiſſant commaund of the Infidels, <note place="margin">George diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Diet at Egneth.</note> they would not faile, but preſently come to the place where hee was, and where hee daily expected them, that they might ſpeedily prouide for the common good of all. Within a while after, there came to him certaine bands of ſouldiours and companies of horſe, which hee cauſed to come from Varadine, which being come together, made a good number of men, with whom he determined to goe to this Diet, ſhadowing his intent, that they came with him for no other cauſe, but onely to bee a guard for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Thus againſt the opinion and liking of all, he came from thence to Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, where being arriued, he ſo throughly diſſolued and brake off the Diet, that not any (ſo great and mightie was hee) durſt ſtay there any longer, leaſt the Frier ſhould ſtomacke and malice them: and by this meanes he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew all the Queenes deſeignes, which vaniſhed into ſmoke.

            <p>Tranſiluania is a Prouince of the kingdome of Hungarie, making a part <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania.</note> thereof, enuironed on all ſides with high mountaines, reſembling a well wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led towne, hauing all his entries and paſſages very difficill and narrow, which maketh me thinke that it tooke his name thereof, being anciently named <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Dacia, of King <hi>Docus,</hi> who was Lord and King thereof. Towards the North it boundeth vpon Polonia, and of one part of Moldauia, hauing in the midſt the hils Carpates. Towards the Weſt it doth confine vpon Hungarie: and towards the Eaſt it ſtretcheth it ſelfe to the ſhores of Danubius, and taketh his ending againſt Walachia: the inhabitants whereof are called Walachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">Walachia.</note> anciently diſſended of ſome Romane Colonie, ſprung from the familie of the Flacchians, who were ſent to ſubdue that countrie, of whom that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince afterward tooke the name of Flaccia, which at this preſent is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the name of Walachia, which alſo containeth in it Moldauia, being <note place="margin">Moldauia.</note> two ſeuerall Prouinces, which now are ſeparated, compriſed in time paſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the name of Flacchia. Towards the South it neighboureth vpon the <note place="margin">Tranſalpinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> Tranſalpinians, and Seruians named Slauons, and the Raſcians, vulgarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Rhatians, who in a manner are as naturall Walachians, for that they all <note place="margin">Rhatians.</note> liue vnder one law and cuſtome: they are Chriſtians, and obſerue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and ceremonies of the Greeke Church, they obey the Patriarke of Conſtantinople; they vſe the Italian language, but ſo corrupted, that it is hardly vnderſtood to be the ſame; they vſe armes like to thoſe of the Turks; they haue been and are yet a warlike nation, cruell, and endureth trauaile and wearines of warre more then any other people, for that they are naturally very ſtrong. Within Tranſiluania there is a Prouince in a manner linked to a mountaine, which ſeparateth it from Moldauia, which is named Ceculia, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and the inhabitants thereof are called Ceculians, and at this day they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Ceculians.</note> Sicilians, who are of the Hungarian nation, and of the ſame qualitie and <note place="margin">Sicilians.</note> diſpoſition, liuing according to the lawes and cuſtomes of Hungarie. The other part of the kingdome, which is the greateſt, is inhabited by the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">Saxons.</note> who euer ſince the time that <hi>Charlemaine</hi> ouerthrew them, by meane of

that great battaile which hee obtained againſt them nigh the mountaine of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Ouege, haue alwaies remained there. For <hi>Charlemaine</hi> defeating them, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a good number of them to be led into Gaule, and forced the other who would not obſerue and obey the lawes (which he would haue eſtabliſhed) to goe ſeeke ſome other habitations. Of theſe a great part entered into Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania to conquer it, and making themſelues maſters thereof by force of armes, they there ſet vp their abode, and built ſeuen townes or Caſtles, whereof for a long time that Prouince tooke the name, which continueth vntil this day, and in reſpect whereof, it is called in their language Sibembur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. Theſe liue after the Germane manner, and obſerue their cuſtomes, ſpeaking the ancient Saxon language; they are affable people, and of great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> trueth and fidelitie. They are not alwaies in league with the Hungarians, neither will they ſuffer them to build in their townes. Their mountaines are inhabited by the Walachians, to whom the Saxons (who are of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt authoritie and rule in that kingdome) would not permit them to build any of their houſes with chalke and ſtones, nor haue nor poſſeſſe much about them. And therefore they dwelt in little houſes and cottages, which they made themſelues, without any Maſon or Carpenter, and are but thatched with ſtraw and ruſhes. They labour not nor till the fields in hope of any gaine, but onely to gather together ſo much as is neceſſarie to nouriſh and ſuſtaine their familie, and the Slaues which they get. This kingdome great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboundeth in corne, wine, fleſh, veniſon, and all manner of fruites, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> breedeth very many ſtrong and goodly horſes. There is found in many of thoſe mountaines, mynes of gold, ſiluer, iron, and ſalt is fetched from thence in ſo great abundance, that moſt part of Hungarie and Polonia are ſerued therewith, which is an exceeding rich commoditie, and bringeth great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the King. Theſe mynes are not farre from Iſembergh, Clauſemburgh, and Saltzburgh. Victuals are there ſold ordinarily at ſo cheape a rate, that it is a thing incredible. The Marchants of this Prouince, during the peace and truce, might trafficke with their marchandiſe through all the Turkes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and continually haue entercourſe with Germanie, Hungarie, Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia, and Italie. The ayre is many times intemperate, by the extreame cold, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and exceſſiue heate, which often is felt there: the cold though neuertheleſſe it bee terrible and ſharpe, yet it dureth not long, and happeneth not but at certaine times, which being paſt, the heate preuaileth more then the cold. All the countrie is vneuen or hillie, and the greateſt part is like to Tuſcane, or hillie Spayne, and is full of great forreſts, which yeelde ſtore of wood, as well to build, as for other priuate commodities. There be two great riuers which be nauigable; the one runneth through the middeſt of the kingdome and is called Maroſſe, which ſpringeth from the mountaines of Moldauia to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">The riuer of Maroſſe.</note> the North, and runneth from one ſide to another of that countrie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it entereth into Tibiſcus, neere the frontier townes of Lippa and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſuar, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which are two ſtrong holds, and ſo named, for that they are ſituated beyond the mountaines towards the Weſt. The other is named Alto, and <note place="margin">The riuer of Cheres.</note> at this day the inhabitants call it Cheres, which ſpringeth at the foote of Mount Carpatus, about the place where it ioyneth with the other hils of Moldauia. There is alſo other ſmall riuers, wherein are found amongſt the

               <note place="margin">Rhatians.</note> Raſcians, who remaine vntill this day, ſince the time they were chaſed foorth of their natiue countrie of Macedonia, by <hi>Lyſimachus.</hi> They are to bee hired of any who will giue moſt: one while they take part with <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and then againe they are in the Turkes pay. They are vnconſtant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and of little faith; they are Chriſtians, and liue after the Greeke Church; they are poore, hauing no townes peculiar to themſelues, and they are in great diſlike with all other nations for their inconſtancie and perfidiouſnes. They dwell among the Bulgarians and Seruians in two places of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and on the other ſide among the mountaines by the Tranſiluanians, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> which ſtretch themſelues towards Walachia.</p>
            <p>This kingdome of Tranſiluania, after it was reduced to the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, was ſubiect to the Crowne of Hungarie; for the gouernment and rule whereof, one of the principalleſt of the Court was deputed and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the title of Vayuode. The capitall towne is called Sibinium, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Sibinium cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Hermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat.

This towne is named by the Germanes Hermenſtat, others call it Preſſouia, alias Cronenſtat, and it is of great trafficke. Thither is brought great ſtore of marchandiſe from Greece, which from thence is diſperſed throughout Hungarie. There are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther townes, as Corone, Torde, Caſſouia, and Albe-iula, which was built by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>

               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> (as a little before hath been ſaid) being arriued in Tranſiluania, ſent <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> and <hi>Thomas Nadaſdy</hi> before, to foreſee and ſuruay the paſſages of the mountaines, by which hee muſt of neceſſitie paſſe, giuing them a good troupe of horſes, with other ſouldiours.

Whileſt the Marqueſſe kept the moſt frequent paſſages, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> by that new vnaccuſtomed way, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with all his armie into Tranſiluania, without any diſturbance, and the day following marched in battaile, and was forced to paſſe by a Caſtle of <note place="margin">Dalmas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by the people of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand.</note> the Queenes named Dalmas, ſeated in the way vpon the top of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21983:59"/>
from when he was ſaluted with the force of the Cannon: hee being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not willing to tolerate ſuch a brauado, went himſelfe to view the place, and to ſee if he could take it by aſſault, with intent to leaue nothing behinde that hereafter might annoy him. But he ſeeing it was more ſtrong then he tooke it to be, and that it was of no ſmall importance by reaſon of that paſſage, and being needfull to haue Cannons to batter it, whereof hee was altogether vnprouided, was forced, without doing any other thing, to depart, leauing there Counte <hi>Felix,</hi> and Counte <hi>Iohn Baptiſta</hi> of Arco (who then led the rereward) to continue the ſiege with their Germanes, and to batter it with foure field peeces, and two ſmall Culuerins which they brought with them, with intent to proue them, if through feare they would yeeld. Which thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Counte performed, by ſtraightning the beſieged, and battering it as he was commaunded. Whileſt Counte <hi>Felix</hi> was thus buſied about this place, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> proceeded on his iourney with the reſt of his armie, and lodged by a towne named Coloſuar, from whence he ſent to the Counte 300.

            <p>The Queene being perſwaded by the Frier to accord with him, refuſed <note place="margin">The Queene accordeth with George.</note> not any agreement, ſpecially after ſhe vnderſtood that there ſhould come to his ayde 10000.

And knowing that he was alreadie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> arriued in her kingdome, and that her Caſtle of Dalmas was beſieged, ſhe was by this newes greatly troubled, ſeeing her ſelfe disfurniſhed of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, and fearing to be expelled forth of her kingdome by the Frier, and to loſe that which ſhe held moſt deare, falling from the dignitie and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of a Queene, to the ſtate and condition of a miſerable Ladie, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that Albe-iula (wherein were her Iewels, and moueables, and the Crowne of Hungarie, which aboue all things was ſpecially deſired of the Frier, and alſo greatly eſteemed of her) could no longer hold out, ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted of ſuch an agreement as was offered her; and gladly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereunto, commaunded thoſe of Albe-iula to ſurrender the towne, <note place="margin">Albe-iula yeelded to George.</note>

Whereupon hee permitted not that any ſouldiour ſhould enter into the towne, vntill all the Queenes moueables were carried out: and to the end they might be carried to the place where ſhe deſired, he prouided them of many waggons for the more commodious carrying of their baggage.</p>
            <p>Preſently vpon the taking of this towne, hee failed not ſpeedily to ſend aduertiſement to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> of all that which had happend vntill then; and withall ſent to him a certaine Comiſſarie to guide and direct him through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the paſſages of the countrie, and to march with his armie towards Egneth, where hee might at pleaſure commodiouſly lodge and refreſh his Campe certaine daies, the place being very pleaſant and abounding in victuals. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi>

ſecuritie, attending there a certaine time, to finde the meanes to ioyne with the Frier, who after the taking of Albe-iula, went to ſee the Queene, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> gaue her notice of the comming of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> further perſwading her to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund thoſe of Dalmas, that they ſhould yeeld to him, and not hold out any longer againſt them which did beſiege it, nor againſt the Artillerie which greatly endamaged them; eſpecially conſidering that ſhe very well knew, that granting to their accord, this Fortreſſe ſhould become hers. The Queene conſented to it for two cauſes: the one, that ſhe might not ſee thoſe within the Caſtle ſo greatly oppreſſed for the loue and affection they bore to her, and the place to fall in decay and ruine: the other, to the end that the Counte (for the hope which the Frier gaue him) might not by the loſſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> his people receiue any detriment, and for that reſpect hee might not ſhew himſelfe too cruell towards her people. Thus by reaſon of ſuch feare, ſhe gaue commaund to all the ſouldiours of Dalmas to yeeld. They following <note place="margin">Dalmas yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde.</note> this commaund, failed not to ſurrender the place into Counte <hi>Felix</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, euen at the ſame inſtant when a myne was almoſt finiſhed to haue blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen it vp, in ſtead of the Cannon; and withall to haue giuen a fierce aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</p>
            <p>As this Caſtle was yeelded, and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> remained at Egneth, the Frier came to conferre with him, who although hee was councelled to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked <note place="margin">The meeting of George and Caſtalde.</note> for into the place where he was lodged, yet was it not done ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it was diſcouered halfe an houre before his comming. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> notice therof, preſently went forth of the towne well accompanied to meete him, the Frier comming in his Coach, drawne with eight great horſes, as he was vſually wont to ride, there being in his company for his guard more then 400. horſe, the moſt part of whom were Gentlemen and Knights, and of the principall and chiefe of the kingdome, hauing beſides 200. Harquebuziers. In this equipage the Frier approaching <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> preſently deſcended his Coach, and mounted vpon a well paced horſe, which alwaies he cauſed to beled with him, and comming to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> he imbraced him very kindly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting what infinit content he receiued at his comming, there paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them a thouſand ſpeeches full of curteſie, and ſhewing excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> honour one to another. After which ſalutations betweene them, the Frier turning himſelfe towards <hi>Aldene</hi> Maſter of the Campe, and other Spaniſh Captaines who alſo were there preſent, entertaining them with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friendly and kinde ſpeeches, hee made it knowne to them what ſingular comfort he receiued, in ſeeing them ſo ſafely arriued and conducted thither. After all theſe friendly ſalutations, they entered together into the towne, and went directly to <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> lodging: where after they were refreſhed, and had diſcourſed together of many important things, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſhewed him the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> acquainting him with the authoritie and commaund that his Maieſtie would he ſhould haue in managing theſe affayres of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>

commaund, to content and gratifie him in any thing which ſhould pleaſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and ſatisfie his liking. Whereof the Frier was exceeding glad, and thought himſelfe well apayd, as well in reſpect of <hi>Caſtalde</hi> himſelfe, as alſo for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which was done him, and of the fayre words which (in the name of <hi>Ferdinand)</hi> was reported to him. For being by his naturall diſpoſition of a proud and haughtie ſpirit, and puffed vp with honour and renowne, would by no meanes endure that any ſhould bee his ſuperiour. And conſidering the great authoritie and commaund that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> (as Lieutenant generall for the King of Bohemia) had, and the reuerence, honor, and ſubmiſſion which neuertheleſſe he made ſhew to vſe towards him, hee eſteemed it a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to continue his pride and greatnes, and that in all the affayres of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> kingdome he might commaund and diſpoſe thereof according at his owne pleaſure. Deſirous then to enioy (according to his accuſtomed manner) ſuch preheminence and authoritie, and to ſhew the commaund and greatnes which he had through all Tranſiluania (two daies after that he was departed from <hi>Caſtalde)</hi> he preſently ſeized vpon Albe-iula for himſelfe to lodge and remaine in, not acquainting <hi>Caſtalde</hi> therewith, ſaying, that that place was the moſt commodieſt and fitteſt to finde him, when neede ſhould require, and the neceſſarieſt to treate of all buſineſſes that might fall out. That being <note place="margin">George went to the Queen.</note> done, he poſted to the Queene to Saſſebeſſe, to informe her of all which had paſſed betweene him and <hi>Caſtalde.</hi>

            <p>During the time the Frier was on his way, the Queene (who nothing was idle nor ſlept) had by one of her Lords, who was a Polonian, a man of good eſteeme in his countrie, ſent another way to viſit and ſalute <hi>Caſtalde.</hi> By him, and by the offers which ſhe made to him, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> did prognoſticate what the iſſue and euent of all the affayres of that countrie would ſort vnto, and principally of thoſe which concerned the Queene, he wel knew they would ſucceede to his deſire, and haue ſuch ending that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould thinke himſelfe well apayd therewithall.

The manner of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was againſt the counſell of <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> and <hi>Thomas Nadaſdy,</hi> and many other, who thought it not conuenient ſo ſlightly to repoſe himſelfe in this man, who becauſe they knew him to be ſo mutable in his opinions, and ſo variable in his doings, might bee able within a ſhort time after, vnder the colour of any occaſion whatſoeuer, to inuent and ſtirre vp ſome new matter, and be more hardie and bold to execute the ſame, ſeeing <hi>Caſtalde</hi> alone, then otherwiſe he would be, if his forces were with him: and for that cauſe they perſwaded him, that he would not depart but with a good troupe. But <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> conſidering, that although he ſhould haue all his people to guard him, yet was it little and to ſmall purpoſe to reſiſt the Frier, in caſe he would vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny treaſon againſt him: wherefore hee iudged it much better to goe ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, whereby he ſhould outwardly manifeſt the great and ſpeciall truſt he repoſed in him, rather then by a ſtrong guard to giue him ſuſpition and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

to ſtand vpon tearmes, an act which in no ſort he found to bee conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the beginning of ſuch affayres, and ſpecially ſeeing hee had to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with a man ſo giddie brained, who was almoſt of a childs condition, that for the leaſt toy whatſoeuer, would bee offended and alter his opinion; reſoluing that if he did otherwiſe, he would eaſily eſcape his hands, and all his purpoſes ſhould be ouerthrowne.</p>
            <p>But proceeding on his determinate iourney, in the end he arriued at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-iula, where (according to the foreſaid aduertiſement) hee found not the Frier, for that he was yet at Saſſebeſſe with the Queene, vnto whom he was gone, without giuing him any notice thereof.

And that therefore knowing Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania to be the key and bulwarke of all Chriſtendome (as by apparant ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was to be ſeene) which if it were loſt, not only the vtter ruine of the reſt of Hungarie and Auſtria would follow, but alſo of Germanie, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian countries. Wherefore for theſe reſpects ſhe ought to deſire, that this Prouince ſhould fall into the gouernment and rule of a Chriſtian Prince, great and puiſſant, as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was, who might at all times be a curb againſt the force and violence of the Turke, and might hinder him from further proceedings: and the rather, that ſhe ought to haue ſuch a deſire, for ſo much as ſhe ſaw her ſelfe (though a Queene) yet of no force nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> for ſuch an enterpriſe, neither was ſhe able to promiſe her ſelfe any defence, to maintaine that kingdome, without ſhe craued ayde of others. Therefore all theſe things duly conſidered, it were much better for her to accept of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> offer, as the moſt ſure and peaceable for her, although it were leſſe, then remaine in continuall danger and trauaile, and to raigne

in a kingdome, which was not in her power to preſerue nor keepe. Beſides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> theſe foreſaid agreements, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> for the more aſſurance and confirmation <note place="margin">Offers made to the Queen by Caſtalde in the name of Ferdinand.</note> of both parties, offered the Queene in the name of his Maieſtie the <hi>Infanta Ioane</hi> his youngeſt daughter, with 100000.

Theſe offers ſeemed generally good, and reaſonable to all, and ſpecially to Frier <hi>George,</hi> who alſo made ſhew to bee well pleaſed therewith. And after many aduertiſements, it was concluded that he ſhould cauſe the Queene to vnderſtand thereof, and bring an anſwere from her. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This charge was committed to the Frier, who willingly accepted thereof; and being come to the Queene, he recited to her all which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Councell. She being attentiue, and vnderſtanding what had paſſed, and withall conſidering the offer of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and that it was a meanes for her to wade out of that ſubiection, wherein the Frier ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily held her: ſhe preſently anſwered, that whatſoeuer he did, ſhe eſteemed it greatly beneficiall to her, committing all her actions and affayres into his hands; of which particularly and by peecemeale they conferred together by the ſpace of fifteene daies. But the Frier continued ſtill without reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now ſaying this, then that, apparantly ſhewing that he had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but to his owne proper commoditie, which he ſhadowed by this, that he fained that herein he aymed at nothing, but that which particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Queene and the good of her ſonne, whom he proteſted he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more then himſelfe, in reſpect of the indiſſoluble bonds of gratitude that forced him to it, which oftentimes hee had receiued from his father King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was his raiſer and maker, and of whom depended all which he poſſeſſed in this world, being raiſed by him of nothing, and exalted to this high degree of honour wherein he was now. And thus cunningly did he diſſemble and draw backe the moſt he could.</p>
            <p>As theſe affayres proceeded on in this manner without any reſolution, it happened one day the Queene, without the Friers knowledge, found opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <note place="margin">The Queene conferreth with Caſtalde, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of George.</note> to haue ſome priuate conference with <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> and in ſuch a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place where ſhe might freely diſcouer and impart the conceptions of her owne minde; aſſuring him what ſingular contentment ſhe receiued, in that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the Romanes, had ſent ſo ſufficient and worthie a man as hee was, to negotiate in theſe affayres; the vertue and renowne of whom, ſhe had before heard an exceeding good report of, and ſhe thought her ſelfe thrice happie of his comming, greatly commending the choiſe that was made of him, and the iudgement of the King, in giuing him that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authoritie to diſpoſe of things in his name as he thought good of, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby ſhe ſhould haue occaſion ſpeedily to bring her miſeries to an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> end, which vntill then had held her wrapped vp: effectuouſly importuning him that he would giue faith and credit to the integritie of her heart, which had alwaies deſired and endeuoured her ſelfe to doe his Maieſtie ſeruice. And afterward ſhe earneſtly deſired <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that for her diſcharge he would amplie aduertiſe his Maieſtie, that for the time paſſed ſhe was not of her ſelfe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21983:63"/>
withdrawne from the agreements betweene them, but that all proceeded through the Friers ſubtilties, who neuer would agree nor conſent that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſhould proceed to the execution of them; but to the contrarie intreated her ſo badly (as ſtill he did) that finding none to whom ſhe might haue recourſe in ſuch neceſſities, ſhe was conſtrained (as being in deſpayre) to demaund ayde of the Turke, of whom ſhe had been many times importuned and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to leaue that kingdome peaceably vnto him, in exchaunge of another great eſtate, which he offered her, eſpecially ſeeing it was in his power (as he ſaid) to thruſt her out of it. And although ſome great feare might giue her good occaſion to thinke ſeriouſly thereof, yet neuertheleſſe ſhe meant not for all that to offer that diſpleaſure to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> eſpecially conſidering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that ſhe was a Chriſtian borne, and that it was not conuenient for her to yeeld to any agreement with a Heathen Prince, ſhe being greatly ſorrowfull for that which was paſt.</p>
            <p>Thus to releaſe her ſelf out of the Friers ſnares (which ſhe reputed a worſe and more intolerable ſubiection, then that of the Turkes) as ſhe had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſtrained peaceably to depart from one part of her kingdome, ſo for <note place="margin">The Queene yeeldeth her ſelfe to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand.</note> the like effect, ſhe would now willingly forſake the other, with a reſolute determination to deale with him ſo, that beſides the conſideration of the ſeruice which ſhee meant to performe to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> hee ſhould finde great contentment freely by her meanes, thus without any condition to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> this Prouince, which by force of armes ſhe would neuer haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to any. And yeelding all things into his Maieſties hands, ſhe would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate him that he would haue regard to her ſonne, who was a King, a child, and an orphane, for which reſpects he ſhould not refuſe to be a Lord and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, and eſteeme of him ſo in regarde of the time to come, as if hee were his naturall ſonne, hauing that particular reſpect and care of him, as ſhe would, and ought to haue of him her ſelfe: and ſpecially acquainting him with the paines and torments whereinto ſhe was fallen, yet withall hauing patience to ſee her ſelfe brought to that low ebbe, that of a great Queene (as in former time ſhe ſaw her ſelfe to be) ſhe was now forſt to become a poore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Lady and a begger, hauing neuer ſince the time ſhe was expulſed Buda, with her ſonne in her armes, and accompanied with a ſmall traine (leauing that towne (by the Friers iugling) in the gouernment of the Turke) receiued any comfort, vntill now that he gaue her occaſion of exceeding conſolation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf now readie to depart out of Tranſiluania, which ſhe would leaue vnder the gouernment of ſuch a King as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was, who no doubt would defend it, and neuer loſe it; and who might repute it for no ſmall good fortune, ſeeing ſo voluntarily ſhe ſuffered her ſelfe to bee by him depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of her kingdome, with ſo ſmall a number of men &amp; Artillerie, of which others with great armies could not diſpoſſeſſe her. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> name anſwered her, that hee accepted of her good and ſincere affection, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which ſhe manifeſted in theſe proceedings, more then any rich kingdome whatſoeuer; promiſing her that in all fidelitie and ſinceritie, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that had been treated of from point to point, and he firmely aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her (gaging his word) that his Maieſtie from thence forward, would haue ſuch reſpect to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> as to his owne children. And for his owne
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21983:63"/>
particular, he offered in all her affayres to remaine her obedient and faithfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſeruant, and protector of her cauſe, deſiring no leſſe to ſatisfie her expectation and to pleaſe her, then <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelfe who ſent him thither.</p>
            <p>After ſuch like diſcourſes, they tooke leaue one of another, the Queene retyring to her chamber, and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> to his lodging. In the meane time the Frier began to practiſe a diſſoluing of all the agreements which already were <note place="margin">The deuiſes of George to diſſolue the agreements of the Queen and Caſtalde.</note> but lately propounded, and miſtruſting the diſpoſition and humour of the he Queene, to bring that to better effect which he deſired ſhould happen, would neuer conſent to any concluſion, but deferring it from day to day, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied his braine about no other things, then trifeling delayes. And that his purpoſe might not bee fruſtrate, and to the end alſo that he might not bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thought he preſſed ſo much for his owne particular commoditie, as for the good of the Queene and her ſonne; he would that before any other thing, <note place="margin">The ſecond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand and Queene Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</note> they ſhould begin to treate of that which concerned them, that ſo he might at the length perceiue what concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he might make, minding alſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any act of renouncing the kingdome to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould paſſe, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſhould be firſt bound to giue and performe to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Queenes ſonne, a yeerely reuenew of 25000. crownes, to him, his heires, and ſucceſſors, euen as had been alreadie promiſed him, and that out of ſuch eſtates which were free, peaceable, and ſure. Which was preſently accepted of by <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> and promiſed (notwithſtanding that when ſuch offers were made, Buda was not then loſt, nor other principall places of the kingdome, for the loſſe of which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Crowne was ſhrodely weakened) there ſhould bee giuen and aſſigned the Dutchie of Oppolia and Rhatibor, which are two pleaſant and fertile countries, abounding in all things which can bee deſired, and are within the Prouince of Slecia. The Frier thinking himſelfe ſatisfied for that point, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly propounded another motion; which was (beſides the agreement of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and decreed vpon for the good of King <hi>Iohn)</hi> he ſhould pay to the Queene the 150000. crownes, which for her dowrie was impoſed vpon King <hi>Iohn</hi> her husband: and vntill ſhe was fully ſatisfied and payed it, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> ſhould be bound to giue her ſome towne in pawne, whither ſhe might retire with her ſonne, and remaine there vntil ſuch time they had performed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all, and put them in poſſeſſion of the aforeſaid States, and diſcharged the ſaid ſumme, with reaſonable intereſt therefore, and in like ſort the reuenew of 25000. crownes which was promiſed. This demaund was alſo agreed vpon, and immediatly ſhe was appointed the towne of Caſſouia, which is one of the greateſt and richeſt in that countrie, wherein ſhe might for her owne commoditie remaine, vntill an abſolute accompliſhment ſhould bee, of all that which had been promiſed.</p>
            <p>After they had concluded and decreed in this manner, of all which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained <note place="margin">George Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uode of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania.</note> to the Queene and her ſonne, the Frier began to negotiate and practiſe for himſelfe, and demaunded that they would beſtow vpon him the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Vayuodſhip of Tranſiluania, with the ſame condition that King <hi>Iohn</hi> was wont to giue it, which was 15000. crownes by the yeere; which requeſt was graunted him, neuertheleſſe with this condition, that he ſhould haue for his copartner and companion <hi>Andrew Battor.</hi> But by no meanes he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereof, alleadging that he had alwaies been accuſtomed to commaund
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21983:64"/>
and rule alone, and not accompanied, neither would he receiue into his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment an equall, in reſpect it would rather be a charge and burthen to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> him, then an honour. In the end, not to diſcontent him in any thing, he had his full asking. He hauing obtained this dignitie, he yet demaunded the Treaſurerſhip, which in former time he executed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinarie wages of 4000. crownes yeerely: and beſides that, his demaund was that they ſhould allow him aſwell in peace as in warre 1500. horſe for his guard and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: <note place="margin">1500. horſe for the guard of George.</note> and further, he deſired to haue the Salt pits at Torde, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding profitable, and he at that time was in poſſeſſion of them. He motio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this laſt demaund with ſuch craft and ſubtiltie, that he thought thereby to finde ſome iuſt cauſe to fruſtrate the former conference, aſſuredly think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> they would neuer agree vnto it. But herein his expectation failed him, <note place="margin">The cuſtome and maner of Princes.</note> and diſcretion would he ſhould haue credited the contrarie, in reſpect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was often wont to ſay; <hi>That it was requiſite for him who would raigne and gouerne, although he had not the gift to accompliſh them, yet to giue fayre words and promiſes to euery one, and to performe but a little thereof:</hi> which well hee might imagine to be practiſed vpon him by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſince hee ſaw that ſo readily they condiſcended to all that he demaunded. He hauing now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all which he deſired, yet could he not thus ſuppreſſe the great thirſt of his couetous and greedie minde, but altering euery houre from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he often repented himſelfe euen in a moment of that which hee had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> done, not ſuppoſing that his inconſtancy was any ſhame or diſcredit to him. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> being one day with him, marueiled greatly at his vncertaintie, and that he was ſo changeable in his proceedings, telling him that he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſtoniſhed at this his mutabilitie, for that hee ſaw his nature was to ſpeake of one particular matter, at one time this, and another time that, by this meanes cauſing euery one to bee doubtfull, and without any reſolution he deferred the time, vntill he found the occaſion ſuch as hee deſired, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fauourable for his affayres.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe affayres were thus trauerſed betweene them, one day hee acquainted <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that hee greatly deſired to be a Cardinall, and deſiring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> him greatly for that purpoſe hee would ſolicite <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to write to the Pope concerning it. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> promiſing him his beſt endeuour, ſpeedily aduertiſed his Maieſtie thereof, giuing direct intelligence of the Friers am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and of the ſpeciall deſire he had of the Cardinals hat. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notice hereof, loſt no time, but preſently diſpatched a meſſenger, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Ferdinand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth the Pope to make George a Cardinall.</note> to Pope <hi>Iuly</hi> the third, that it would pleaſe his holines to receiue Frier <hi>George</hi> into the Colledge of Cardinals, amply reciting to him his vertue and proweſſe, and how for many yeeres with his owne forces and induſtrie, hee had defended and maintained the kingdome of Tranſiluania againſt the puiſſance of the Turke, whom he had often foyled; greatly praiſing him, that from an vncredible pouertie (although hee was diſſended of a noble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> houſe) he had by his vertue and wiſedome attained to theſe high degrees of honour, wherein he was now inſtalled, in oppoſing himſelfe for the generall good of Chriſtendome againſt the Infidels (as appeared to all the world) as a prouident and valiant Captaine; ſhewing thereby to his holines, that in conſideration of ſuch commendable acts, he well deſerued to be admitted
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21983:64"/>
to that dignitie. He alſo writ to his Ambaſſadours who were at Rome, to vſe the beſt meanes they could to further this ſuite, and to haue anſwer of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Pope according to his deſire.</p>
            <p>Whileſt this matter was negotiated at Rome, the Archbiſhop of Strigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium <note place="margin">George made Archbiſhop of Strigonium.</note> died, by whoſe death the Biſhopricke was voyde, which was yeerely worth 150000. crownes. The Frier omitted no time, but preſently made ſuite for it, which was as readily graunted by <hi>Caſtalde</hi> in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> name, to whom hee writ with all ſpeede, praying him that with like diligence hee would ſend him the confirmation thereof, ſeeing they had to deale with ſo variable and inconſtant a man, it was therefore requiſite to make a briefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, for that in prolonging time to beſtow it of him, and not to yeeld to that which he demaunded, was too much to aduenture and hazard the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> affayres. In the end, there remained not any thing for him to demaund more, but onely to bee King, thinking he had now well effected all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, was at laſt content to allow and ratifie the articles made betweene them. Now to conclude or repent that which he had done, was all one to him, inſomuch that euen at the ſame inſtant, he went to the Queene to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <note place="margin">George diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth the Queene from the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made with Caſtalde.</note> her, not ſo eaſily to paſſe theſe articles, which were alreadie accorded, telling her ſhe might doe it without bringing her honour and name in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; in ſaying, that ſhe would not depart out of the kingdome, vntill <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> had accompliſhed all that which hee had promiſed: for the reſt hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> would afterwards take it vpon himſelfe, aſſuring her to finde the meanes to diſmiſſe <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> armie out of Tranſiluania, and to deliuer her out of that ſubiection wherein ſhe was, promiſing her by fayre words, that he would alwaies be faithfull to her, and neuer contrarie her in any thing, further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her, that this kingdome becauſe it was iuſtly come by, did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rather to her ſonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> then to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Whereto the Queene made no great ſemblance neither with yea nor nay, giuing him thereby to vnderſtand, that it was neither iuſt nor lawfull to halt and diſſemble ſo often in his words: and on the other ſide ſhe told him, that ſhe had committed all her affayres into his hands, from which ſhe rather deſired to be deliuered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then from the Turkes. The Frier not perceiuing himſelfe deceiued by her ſuttle fetch, and conſidering that hee could not worke ſo with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as he had effected with the Queene, and that he ſhould not bee any more of that great commaund in thoſe quarters, as hee had been, began to manifeſt exceeding great contentment of that which in priuate they had agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, faining afterward, that the Queene would neuer condiſcend to ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements. But the Queene much doubting that the Frier would not faile to practiſe moſt cunningly that which hee had ſaid to her, cauſed <hi>Caſtalde</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Queene accuſeth George to Caſtalde.</note> once againe to come and ſpeake with her, aduertiſing him of all which had paſſed betweene her and the Frier ſince the time of their two meetings; plainly telling him, that thoſe whom <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had choſen for arbitrators in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this buſines, were the moſt oppoſite to his proceedings that poſſible could be, and eſpecially Frier <hi>George,</hi> who brewed new inuentions to diſſolue all that which had been concluded amongſt them, acquainting him with ſome particulars of his diſpoſition, and inſtructing him of that which was requiſit for him to doe in time to come, that ſo he might the better treate of theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21983:65"/>
with him, againſt the next Diet; becauſe beſides that which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood alreadie touching his condition, deceits, and ſubtilties, hee ſhould yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the further hee went on perceiue more and more: but yet not ſo well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who by their experience they haue had of him, haue diſcouered ſuch his deceits. In fine, the Queene for concluſion added, that by no meanes he ſhould repoſe any confidence in him, becauſe that by how much the leſſe he ſhould thinke thereof, by ſo much the more he ſhould finde himſelfe to bee deceiued and ſold.</p>
            <p>The Frier ſeeing his deuiſes ſucceeded not to his liking, was in the end <note place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</note> content to accept thereof, and conclude all the articles contained in their parley: that is to ſay, that the Queene among other points ſhould depart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> out of Tranſiluania within ſixe daies, and retire her ſelfe to Caſſouia. The premiſes being thus determined, notice by writing was giuen to <hi>Peter Vicchy,</hi> that the Queene would forſake the kingdome, and that alſo ſhe would leaue to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the low countries, wherein Lippa and Themeſuar are ſituated, and that they would in recompence therof, giue her in Hungarie, or in ſome other places, ſo much as would ſatisfie and content her. And to the end that this buſines might with better expedition be diſpatched, there was ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſent him, that he might with more ſecuritie, and without any ſuſpition come himſelfe to the Court. <hi>Vicchy</hi> miſtruſting that it was a traine of the <note place="margin">Vicchy repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no truſt in George.</note> Frier to get him into his clutches, and not thinking that the Queene would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſo ſoone aduance the King of the Romanes, and renounce and depriue her ſelfe of her owne kingdome, (which vntill then ſhe had with many trauailes and cares defended and preſerued): and not daring to come himſelfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee ſent two Ambaſſadours to know in what eſtate and condition the Queenes affayres were. They being come to Saſſebeſſe, they vnderſtood of all the occurrants which had paſſed vntill that day: and it was concluded with them, that ſeeing <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> would not otherwiſe come, for his greater ſecuritie, and alſo ſpeedily to remoue all diſtruſt, <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> ſhould bee ſent to manage thoſe affayres with him. Thus they went together from thence, and <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> notwithſtanding led with him 2000. horſe for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> his guard; and alſo becauſe they vnderſtood that <hi>Vicchy</hi> daily expected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from the Turke (to breake all this agreement) who preſently after, as he had aduertiſement of that which the Frier practiſed with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> gaue commaund to the Baſha of Buda not to faile, but ayde him. And truly if theſe ſuccours had been arriued before <hi>Battor</hi> had ſpoken with <hi>Vicchy,</hi> this peace had neuer been made, neither had they ſpoken any more of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Battor</hi> being now arriued at Lippa, whileſt he conferred with <hi>Vicchy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Battor and Vicchy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre together.</note> the effect of his charge, there departed from Saſſebeſſe a French gentleman, who was called <hi>Monſieur de Santon,</hi> whom <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had ſent to be entertained amongſt the Spaniſh companies, he being recommended <note place="margin">A French Spie in the armie of Ferdinand, who aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Turke of the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania.</note> to him by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> his brother. This man (as it was reported) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> had been a Captaine in France, whither (he ſaid) he would not returne, vntill hee had reuenged certaine iniuries which was offered him; in memorie whereof he wore his haire ſo long, that it reached to his ſhoulders, and ſayd, he would neuer cut it off, vntil he had firſt ſatisfied himſelf with reuenge. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi> had great diſtruſt of him, thinking (as it proued) he was a Spie for the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21983:65"/>
Turke, and ſent thither by <hi>Henry</hi> King of France, to the end that hee might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> take notice of all occurrances which paſſed in Tranſiluania, to aduertiſe the Turke thereof. And although he liked not, that one whom he ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted, ſhould bee ſuffered to practiſe and bee familiar amongſt his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, yet neuertheleſſe would he not in any ſort diſturbe him, for that he was greatly recommended to him by <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Within a while after hee was departed from Saſſebeſſe, it was certainly knowne that hee was a Spie, and what diligence ſo euer was vſed to recouer him, yet hee could not bee found; and at the ſame time came commaund from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that his head ſhould bee cut off, being aduertiſed by the Emperour that he was a Spie for the Turke. In the meane time, while they expected newes of him, hee ſaued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> himſelfe at Lippa with <hi>Peter Vicchy,</hi> to whom he was ſent. <hi>Vicchy</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the decree, and the proclamation that was made againſt him, and how they ſought him in euery place, gaue aduertiſement to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> that he was arriued at Lippa, and that if hee ſo pleaſed, hee would ſend him to him: but during this meſſage, he cauſed him ſafely to be conducted with a good guard to Belgrade, from whence he tooke the way directly to Conſtantinople, to aduertiſe the Turke of all which was done in that countrie.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the day came that was appointed for the Diet to be held <note place="margin">A Diet held at Coloſuar, where the Queene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned all the royall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde.</note> at Coloſuar, where ſhould haue been all the principall of the kingdome, and where (as it was determined) the Queene ſhould renounce and reſigne to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the kingdome, and acknowledge and approue himſelfe King <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thereof. After all the Deputies of thoſe Prouinces and townes were arriued, the Queene the 28. of Auguſt departed from Saſſebeſſe, accompanied with all the Knights and Gentlemen of the countrie, and alſo with Frier <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> the one riding on the right hand, the other on the left. Two daies after they were departed, they arriued at an Abbey, diſtant from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſuar eight miles, where they lodged; and there it was concluded betweene them, to execute all that which before had been a greed vpon. And the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this ſolemne reſignation, was by the royall ornaments, which were, a Crowne made of plates of gold, mounting on high in forme of a <note place="margin">The ornamets of the King of Hungarie.</note> high crowned hat, inriched with ſtones and pearles, and hauing a little croſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of gold on the top. The next was a Scepter of Iuorie, garniſhed with gold, and a Mantle of cloath of gold, after the ancient habite in manner of a Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſet with many ſtones, but of ſmall value. A gowne, and a payre of ſhooes of gold, which in reſpect of the worke were like to thoſe made for the Apoſtolike Sea. Among all thoſe Iewels, the Frier demanded of the Queene that ſhe would commit the Crowne into his cuſtodie and keeping. Which requeſt ſhe abſolutely denyed him: ſaying, that ſhe would neuer giue her conſent, that a Frier ſhould bee King of that kingdome, whereof ſhe diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed her ſonne; but ſhe would that they ſhould bee conueied to him, to whom in right that Prouince belonged. And cauſing them to bee brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> before them all, ſhe tooke the Crowne in her hand, in the preſence of the Frier, and many great perſonages, and after great effuſion of teares, from her owne eyes, and from her yong ſonne (who was preſent at the whole action) <note place="margin">The ſorrow of Iohn, ſeeing his mother giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crowne to Caſtalde.</note> turning her ſelfe towards <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> ſayd in Italian, ſuch or the like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

               <q>Although inconſtant Fortune following her cruell alterations, cutting off and confounding at her pleaſure the affayres of this world, hath in ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſort ſubuerted mine, that now both my ſonne and my ſelfe are forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake this kingdome, this Crowne, and all theſe other royall ornaments, which in times paſt were belonging to my deare Lord and ſpouſe King <hi>Iohn</hi> of moſt happie memorie (but now vnhappie that wee bee) and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne into the hands and protection of others: yet notwithſtanding ſhe ſhall not for all this hinder me, but that at the leaſt in my troubles and anguiſhes, I may take this onely contentment, ſeeing them to fall into the hands of a Prince, who is not only a Chriſtian, but alſo ſo puiſſant and benigne, as is the King of the Romanes, whom I repute for my Lord and father, who alſo ſhal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> know with what zeale and affection they are giuen him, and whom by our good liking we reeſtabliſh in this State, praying God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may enioy it with greater tranquilitie and longer time, then we haue done.

            <p>
               <q>But the Queene turning her ſelfe towards him, ſayd: Since (O <hi>Iohn</hi> my deare and tender ſonne) that I know thy fortune and mine is not ſufficient and able to defend this kingdome, without the ayde and helpe of others, by occaſion of the great number of thoſe, who either by enuie, or of ſome certaine malice, or by ſome wicked diſpoſition, make themſelues maſters of others, continually ſearching with the loſſe of the ſame, our ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Thou oughteſt not to conceiue ill thereof, if hauing a care rather to publike good, then to our particular profit, which wee cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againſt the Turkes power, who by the daily prouocation of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> doth moleſt vs, and in a manner depriue vs of all. Therefore in the middeſt of ſo many aſſaults of miſerie, which fortune hath bequeathed vs, I haue choſen this to be the beſt meanes, to giue and reſigne this kingdome to the King of the Romanes, who will defend and deliuer it from the Turkes violent attempts, and who in recompence will aſſigne thee ſuch eſtates, as he hath promiſed me, for the renouncing which I haue made to him; to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21983:66"/>
end that thou maiſt (at the leaſt) yet liue as a great Prince, if thou canſt not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> liue like a King: and I haue the rather yeelded to this, as not minding with common loſſe, to bee obſtinate in warre, and to leaue and omit the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine for the incertaintie in the diſpoſition of Fortune: conſidering alſo the inconſtancie and mutabilitie of her tickle gouernment, which is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med raſhly to rule and gouerne Kings houſes, which are fallen in diſgrace and contempt with the world, &amp; who oftentimes imprudently and without thinking thereon, ſuddenly doth depriue them of their kingdomes, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them into perpetuall exile. Therefore that on my part I may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch infelicitie, and not to fall into ſuch an indignitie and miſerie (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forſaken of all ayde and helpe) with the loſſe of the kingdome, I am <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eaſily perſwaded with a comfortable hope, to reſerue thee to a perpetuall and quiet repoſe, with a leſſe eſtate and condition, and to take thee out from ſo many troubles, amongſt the which I doe not yet deſpayre, that for a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which thou doeſt now leaue, it may bee in his power that taketh it from thee, to giue thee another, and happely of greater commaund. Let it not ſeeme ſtrange to thee to leaue this kingdome wherein thou wert borne and nouriſhed, being a thing which happeneth to many: but bee aſſured, that by the fauour and dignitie of vertue, a noble courage ſhall neuer be ſo much reiected of fortune, that he ſhall want any States or kingdoms. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the deliuerie of the poore people, which are afflicted and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our warres; for common repoſe, and for the preſeruation of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> faith, thou oughteſt not to withſtand or gainſay it, but confirming all that, which for thy good I haue yeelded vnto, conſent that theſe princely orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee ſent to his Maieſtie.

               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing in this manner receiued the Crowne, cauſed it to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept, being aboue all things by the Kings of Hungarie highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in reſpect of the vulgar opinion which is held thereof in that countrie: the report being, that an Angell brought it from heauen to S. <hi>Ladiſlas</hi> King <note place="margin">The common opinion which is held in Hungarie of the royall Crowne.</note> of Hungarie; and that the King which doth not poſſeſſe it, cannot bee the true nor lawfull King, nor iuridially gouerne the people, nor execute iuſtice to them. Men doe yet ſay further, that if by chance this Crowne ſhould by ſome caſualtie be loſt, and found by any whoſoeuer, although hee were the pooreſt in the world, preſently without any other triall, he ſhould be created King, and they ſhould ſweare fealtie and homage to him, as to their lawfull and vndoubted King. But whether this be true or no, I know not; yet vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> this opinion, the Turkes haue a ſpeciall deſire to get it within the compaſſe of their cuſtodie, as alſo Frier <hi>George</hi> had. All the Gentlemen and Lords who were preſent at the deliuerie of this Crowne, iudged that which the Queene had done, was of no ſmall importance, eſteeming the validitie of the Crown to be of equall price with the kingdome it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>For this reſpect <hi>Caſtalde</hi> cauſed it continually to bee kept in his chamber with great vigilancie, vntill with a good conuoy he ſent it to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by <note place="margin">The Crowne of Hungarie ſent to Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> the Lord <hi>Iohn Alpohnſe Caſtalde Peſcaire,</hi> his nephew. The Queene being arriued at Coloſuar, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> alſo arriued there within a while after, where he remained certaine daies, attending thoſe who ſhould be there, and that were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> called to the Diet, to know what their affection was to the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and to confirme them in their good deuotion, and to ſatisfie the Queene of that which was promiſed her; to appeaſe all the tumults which was amongſt them, and to incite them to take armes againſt the Turke, and chaſe them from thoſe parts, vnderſtanding they would once againe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to enter thereinto. And after they were all arriued and aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> acquainted them with all the paſſed proceedings, whereof euery one was well contented. And if peraduenture there were ſome, yea, and of the chiefeſt, to whom it ſeemed not good what the Queene had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> done, yet durſt they not make ſhew to the contrarie, for that <hi>Ferdinands</hi> part was then the ſtrongeſt. And thus they all with one accord did ſweare feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">The Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſweare fealtie to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand.</note> to his Maieſtie, manifeſting great ioy to ſee themſelues returned vnder the gouernment of their natural Lord and King, to whom of right that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome belonged. And although <hi>Caſtalde</hi> diſcouered the affections of many (who rather inclined to the amitie and league of the Turke, then to that of

            <p>
               <q>I haue alwaies eſteemed it (Lords, and chiefe Commanders of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) to be a thing very conuenient and neceſſary, not to ſpeake at any time for any grace or friendſhip, which we haue purchaſed from other men; nor for the fauour which wee haue, or hope to receiue from them; nor for any inſtinct which we haue towards any: but only ſincerely to explaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what we take to bee good and praiſe worthie, as well for the particular, as publike benefit; and not at any time to perſwade any thing which is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> both reaſonable, iuſt, and holy, as well before God as men; which I for mine owne part haue practiſed as much as hath bin poſſible for me, and (by Gods aſſiſtance) will alwaies do it, chuſing rather the good and glorie of the King (your Lord and mine) and the publike and generall quiet, then my owne proper life, as this day I meane to manifeſt to you, not minding to doe any thing, but that which ſhall bee ſitting for the office of a louer of peace and publike tranquilitie, who ought not to omit vnſpoken any ſpeech, that may bee neceſſarie for the good and ſafetie of this countrie and kingdome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with his owne proper blood, he ſhould not faile to ſuſtaine and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it. Now, conſidering the preſent eſtate and condition into which you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are fallen, by the ſecret hatreds which raigne amongſt you one towards an other, and by the diſſentions ſprung amongſt you, and your former Lords: by occaſion whereof you haue called the Turke to your ayde, and haue brought him into this countrie, with the ruine, not onely of the vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but alſo of your ſelues, and haue ſhewed him an open high way for the time to come, in a moment to be maſters of you, he practiſing towards you that which he did to the <hi>Paleologians, Comins, Buccals,</hi> and other of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of Greece, who for their conceiued hatreds, thinking by the Turkes ayde wholly to baniſh and expulſe their Emperour, did not only ruinate the Empire, but alſo loſt their owne goods, honours, themſelues, and liues, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Turkes being allured with the goodlines and fertilitie of the countrie, and faining to fauour or ſupport the diſcords of one faction or other, learning to make war after their maner, &amp; hauing therewith in ſuch diligent obſeruance, noted the ſituation and paſſages of their countrie, that with little labour they thruſt in vpon them, with ſuch multitude and force, that after they had ſeene their young infants, their deare ſiſters, their beloued wiues and kindred to be prayes and ſlaues enchained; their townes burnt and deſtroyed, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie harried, and the common people made ſlaues, and they forced to flye and ſeeke other Prouinces to inhabite, wherein liuing in calamity they were forced to end their miſerable life; of Lords to become ſeruants, and of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to be in the thraldome of ſubiection, which is the greateſt miſerie and calamitie of all, and ſurely which in all the world hath not his like; being too painfull and intolerable a burthen, that a free man, fortunate, and rich, ſhould become a ſeruant, miſerable, afflicted, and begging to ſatisfie his neceſſitie. All which miſchiefes had aſſuredly happened to you, if Gods goodnes, and

the bountie of the King had not foreſeene it, opening the eyes of your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to remember the paſſed glorie and renowne which your Kings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> haue vndoubtedly atchieued, by the victories and triumphs obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turkes. Conſidering, I ſay, this your poore ſtate, and knowing that you are not ignorant with what abilitie and force I am come hither, and how his Maieſtie hath ſent me with an armie, to take care and charge of this Prouince, and to ſuccour and aſſiſt it in her afflictions, and by your friendly ayde to deliuer it out of the hands of Infidels, our common enemies; I haue eſteemed it neceſſarie to declare vnto you, that you ought to ſweare fidelitie to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> your King and Lord, with ſuch homage as you are bound to performe, and to perſwade you, that you ought ſo much the more to ſettle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> your ſelues in his fauour and clemencie, who will imbrace you not as his ſubiects, but will place you in his boſome, as his naturall and deare children, in ſuch affectionate manner, that you may ſay, you haue rather gotten a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then a Lord, who will not faile to aſſiſt you in your neceſſities, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you in all chances of fortune, counting himſelfe happie if they be ſuch: and on the other ſide, deeming himſelfe wretched with you, if it ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede otherwiſe (which God defend it ſhould) ſeeing the fortune of men is variable and more mutable then the waues of the ſea, and ſubiect to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite hazards.

After this your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> manifeſt and couragious fidelitie, it behoueth that you deliberate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with me for the publike libertie (although it bee a thing that ſeemeth daungerous) to denounce warre againſt them, which being iuſtly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly managed, will promiſe to vs victorie, and immortall glorie with them that ſhall ſucceede vs, who learning of vs to eſteeme honour and glorie, (more deare then their liues) will freely chooſe rather to die fighting for faith and libertie, then to bee as prayes to theſe inhumane Barbarians, liuing in continuall diſhonour. And if theſe reaſons are not ſo perſwaſiue, nor yet of that force to moue your courages, yet ought they at leaſt to make them tremble, by reaſon of the horrible cruelties you ſhall receiue when the Turke ſhall become your Lord: for aſſure your ſelues you ſhall not for all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that enioy any great content or quiet, but euen daily your ſorrowes and griefes will be redoubled with great and tedious impoſitions, for that he will not ſatisfie himſelfe with an ordinarie and reaſonable tribute: but with an abſolute commaund hee will take away the deareſt of your children, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to denie our faith, and to forget both the father and mother,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21983:68"/>
who haue begotten, produced, and brought them vp; and will nouſle them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> among his Ianiſaries, to increaſe by that meanes their wicked and heatheniſh opinion, and ouerthrow and ſuppreſſe ours, which is grounded vpon the blood of our deare Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And beſides, if you haue a fayre yong daughter, who is of ſeemely and well fauoured countenance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched and adorned with vertue, ſhe ſhall preſently bee taken from you, and put into the Serraile, to ſatisfie the vnſatiable luſt and incontinencie of this abominable Tyrant, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually will aſpire to no other thing, then whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to extirpate and ruinate you, and to make you in the end to become his ſeruants and perpetuall ſlaues, purloyning from you the beſt of whatſoeuer you haue, and the remainder of all which ſhall be left vnto you by your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> neither can you ſay any thing in defence of your ſelues, nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them, which if you do, or make any ſhew of diſcontent, then ſhal you be ſtraight in preſent danger of your life. Conſider by this and firmly impreſſe it, what theſe calamities are, and how horrible and grieuous the effects be. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, awake therefore, I ſay, your drowſie ſpirits, and waite not vpon a vaine deſire, &amp; vpon a ſwelled pride, ſo willingly to yeeld your ſelues vnder ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable a ſeruitude, yea much worſe then death it ſelfe: but valiantly oppoſe your vttermoſt abilities againſt ſuch enterpriſes, and giue not occaſion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to call you tyrants: for ſurely not onely he is a Tyrant, who is the cauſe of another mans ſeruitude, but alſo he who is able to oppoſe himſelfe againſt the violence of another, and yet maketh no reſiſtance. Call together with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you all the Sicilians and Tranſalpinians, making a league with your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and with thoſe of whom in time you may hope for ſuccour and ayde, and in defending your ſelues, offend the enemie; this being no diſhoneſt thing nor worthie of blame, for defence of your ſelues, to enter into league with any ſtraunge nation whatſoeuer. And reſolue and vnite your ſelues quickly in one, conſidering that in the occurrances and aduentures of warre, too long remiſſenes increaſeth more detriment then profit. And by ſuch a ſudden determination, doing that which in reaſon and courage ought to be done, you ſhall manifeſt to your King a quicknes of ſpirit, and declare how much your hearts are cleere and cleane, as well in proſperitie as in aduerſitic, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thoſe onely meriting to bee reputed truly couragious, and of a firme reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who perfectly diſcerning troubleſome things, and things that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant one of them from another, not doubting at any hand any perill, nor withdrawing themſelues from the ſeruice of their Lord, as I aſſure my ſelfe you will not doe; making full account of this, that hauing before your eyes the pregnant experience of euils paſſed, and deeply thinking on the preſent labours, you will rather make choiſe to loſe your liues by a iuſt and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable warre, then liue with a vile peace and an infamous quiet.</q>

            <p>Theſe ſpeeches animated Frier <hi>George,</hi> with all the reſt and chiefeſt of Tranſiluania, preſently to yeeld themſelues (knowing the veritie of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cauſe) to the Kings ſeruice, and he offered himſelfe with them altogether to his deuotion, acknowledging him for their true Lord and King.

            <p>Theſe affayres being thus decreed and concluded, the day following, which was the 9. of September, the Queene departed from Coloſuar, with a conuoy of 400. Hungarian horſe, which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſent with her, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Queene out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with teares and ſorrow.</note> her himſelfe from that place two miles, which maketh foure French.

            </p>
            <p>Scarſe was the Queene departed, but newes was brought her that <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> had agreed with <hi>Andrew Battor,</hi> into whoſe cuſtodie he had alreadie <note place="margin">Vicchy yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the low countries to Battor.</note> yeelded Lippa and Themeſuar, with Becch, Becherech, and Chinad, and all the other Caſtles which were vnder his gouernment, not being willing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to come to this agreement, vntill hee was acertained by the Queenes letters, of all which had paſſed vntill then. And after he had thus yeelded his whole commaund, hee ſet forward on the way towards the Queene, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie her to Caſſouia. Whileſt he was proceeding on his iourney, <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> entered into the ſaid townes, and taking ample and ſure poſſeſſion of them, furniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a garriſon of ſuch ſouldiours, as he had drawne out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of certain Fortreſſes, and who for that purpoſe he had brought with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 800.

With this warlike companie he greatly aſſured the countrie, ſpecially becauſe the Caranſebanſſes, the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſiens, and the Rathians (people very puiſſant) were reduced vnder the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and had declared that they were content to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

his Maieſties deuotion, and to ſerue him in all occaſions of warre which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſhould be offered.</p>
            <p>The affayres of Lippa and Themeſuar being thus with diligence diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> thought then he had fully effected his moſt important buſines; becauſe that whileſt theſe two Fortreſſes were not yet vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> men thought, that that which he had negotiated before, was to little or no purpoſe, for that thoſe two places were of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <note place="margin">Lippa and Themeſuar townes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</note> and ſpecially Lippa, which was eſteemed and reputed the key and port of all Tranſiluania. The ſame, beſides it was of great importance, was exceeding profitable and commodious, and therefore neceſſarie to be more carefully maintained and kept, in reſpect of the great reuenewes which come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from thence, becauſe it is the Port where al the veſſels of ſalt are laden, which is tranſported by the riuer Maroſſe through all Hungarie, and is a marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of the beſt and greateſt trafficke diſperſed into all thoſe countries. Frier <hi>George</hi> demanded this toll of the King, importuning that his Maieſtie would giue it him: but afterward the King vnderſtanding it was yeerely worth 300000. Florins, hee would not intirely giue it him; but yet hee had it at a reaſonable rate, although the other would not ſo accept thereof: and becauſe he was not willing to giue him any occaſion to complaine of him, hee libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <note place="margin">George had the third part of the toll of ſalt.</note> gaue him the third part thereof. All Tranſiluania being reduced vnder the obedience of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the Marqueſſe of Balaſſe, and <hi>Francis Chen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> men of ſpeciall authoritie and credit in their countrie, being alſo entered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> into amitie with him: <hi>Bernard Aldene</hi> Campe-maſter of the Spanyards, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <note place="margin">Bernard Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard, ſent to to commaund Themeſuar and Lippa.</note> 
               <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that ſince hee would ſend other Captaines for the defence of Themeſuar and Lippa, that it would pleaſe him to ſend him thither, being the rather deſirous to goe, for that he vnderſtood he would ſend Spanyards thither. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was therewith well content, and preſently diſpatching him, he gaue vnto him 300. Spanyards, and ſent with him Captaine <hi>Rodrigo Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liandrando,</hi> who then was come to the ſeruice of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> during this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and who was by the ſame <hi>Aldene,</hi> earneſtly deſired to haue him in his companie, and that to the end that he might aſſiſt him both by his vertue and good aduice in any Martiall affayres, for that he was a man of truſt, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and very deſirous of honour. Being thus diſpatched, hauing with them two peeces of Artillerie, they ſet forward on the way from Coloſuar, drawing towards Themeſuar, which according to the iudgement of all, was of greateſt importance, taking with them diuers Ingenors, to fortifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre the other places which were of leaſt ſtrength. On the other ſide they cauſed to fortifie and ſtrengthen Sibinio, Albe-iula, and Saſſebeſſe, which are townes ſituated vpon little hils in the middeſt of great plaines, and which with little coſt would bee made impregnable. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> cauſed theſe fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to bee repayred, to no other end, but onely to ſtop the Turkes incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in caſe he would enter into the kingdome; and that in the meane time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he might make other prouiſion and haue commoditie, to expect the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould ſend him, if need ſo required. And for that in the late Diet of Coloſuar, the Tranſiluanians being for that particular cauſe required to ayde <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with certaine ſummes of money, they had excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues in reſpect of the great pouertie of the countrie, which was an
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21983:70"/>
occaſion they could not contribute thereunto: therefore by the commaund <note place="margin">The reuenews of the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the countrie.</note> of the King it was ordained, that all the reuenewes of the Biſhoprickes in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Tranſiluania, with the Biſhopricke of Agria, ſhould bee employed for the charges of ſuch fortifications.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were thus in doing, the Frier made ſemblance as though he had been very glad thereof, but eſpecially becauſe he had thruſt out the Queene before him: and thinking that his purpoſes had at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning taken good effect, hee hoped (as it many times chaunceth to men who often deceiue themſelues in their owne affayres) that alſo the middeſt and the end would ſucceede fortunately, as his owne conceits had alreadie promiſed him. Now the Frier knowing that hee had greatly offended the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Turke, in bringing <hi>Ferdinand</hi> into this Prouince, hee endeuoured by all meanes to cleere himſelfe thereof, and againe to creep into his former grace <note place="margin">George ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth againe the fauour of the Turke.</note> and fauour. Thus by his ſubtilties thinking to hold <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in one ſleeue, and the Turk in another, and to content them both, he meant now to kindle that, which afterward in the end hee could not extinguiſh. And to execute this his intention, he departed from Coloſuar to go to a Caſtle of his owne, which he had built from the ground, named Wiuar. He had giuen order that there he would meete the Chiauſs, which the Turke ſent to receiue the tribute which that Prouince yeerely payed him, to the end they might liue in peace. The Chiauſs was alreadie arriued at this Caſtle, whileſt they nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> all the premiſed affayres. And the Frier cauſed him to be ſo priuately, yet well entertained, that none could ſpeake with him, which he did in this reſpect, for feare that any ſhould aduertiſe him of what had paſſed. For this cauſe he appointed him to bee lodged and friendly vſed in this place as the moſt commodious, being more ſolitarie and leſſe frequented of waies, then any other in the kingdome. The Frier being arriued at this place, preſently cauſed many ſports and rich preſents to bee ſhewed and giuen to this Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſs, with ſumptuous entertainment, and after he ſent for <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came thither, and by their generall agreement and conſent, he payed the tribute to the Turke, the time being almoſt expired, in which the ſaid tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſhould be payed; and the truce yet continued, during which, it ſeemed <note place="margin">Tribute payd to the Turke by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluanians.</note> not good to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> (and ſpecially at that time) to giue the Turke any other occaſion to infringe or breake it, then that he had alreadie done, which was, in lifting him out of Tranſiluania; which he meant not to doe for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and ſpecially becauſe he had a purpoſe with ſpeede to prouide for the fortifications of the places before mentioned; and becauſe that in the meane while hee meant to gaine the good wils of the ableſt and mightieſt men in the countrie, and to increaſe himſelfe both with men and money to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and keepe it: but fortune would not ſuffer that he ſhould long enioy his deſire. For being one night at ſupper with the Frier, newes was brought <note place="margin">The Turkes in field to take the Queene.</note> him, that by the commaund of <hi>Achmeth Baſha,</hi> there was gone out of Buda <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 3000. horſe to aſſay to take the Queene, her ſonne, and the Crowne of the kingdome, which was ſent to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> aſſuredly thinking that ſhe would carrie it with her as a precious Iewell. But ſhe (as good fortune was) tooke the way towards Caſſouia, going in the pooreſt habite and painfulleſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile <note place="margin">The miſerie of Queene Izabella.</note> that could bee imagined, not any thing diſſembling the extreame

griefe which ſtill heauily oppreſt her. To her vttermoſt abilitie ſhe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this her immeaſurable affliction, which hourely gnawed and ſorely diſtempered her minde. Inſomuch that one day paſſing a mountaine, which ſeparateth Tranſiluania from Hungarie, and going downe the ſide thereof, which was very rough and tedious, by which ragged way her Coach could not paſſe, ſhee was conſtrained (during a great ſhewer) to goe on foote, and downe that ſide with her children and Ladies, and that not without great labour. Walking in this ſort, ſhe greatly complained her ſelfe of her aduerſe fortune, who not contenting to be contrarie and oppoſite to her in great and waightie things, would yet afflict her in ſmall and meane matters. And attributing this ſorrow and diſcontent of minde, which vntimely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to her, to the wickednes of her deſtinie, ſhe tooke a knife, and with the point thereof (to eaſe a little her vntolerable griefe) writ in the barke of a great tree (vnder which ſhe was retired to repoſe and ſhrowd her ſelfe from the raine, which powred downe amaine) theſe Latin words; <hi>Sic fata volunt,</hi>

The firſt whereof was, becauſe they ſaw the ſonne of King <hi>Iohn</hi> in league with the now preſent King, and to haue taken in mariage the <hi>Infanta Ioane</hi> his daughter, which aliance and amitie did indifferently mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to euery one an aſſured expectation of a perpetuall and quiet repoſe, and that in time, by meanes of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> clemencie and bountie, the way ſhould not altogether be taken from <hi>Iohn</hi> one day, to reenter againe into that kingdome. The other was, that for the late ſuſtentation which by theſe new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> agreements happened to them, they thought themſelues ſo ſufficiently aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in abilitie, that the Turk for feare of the puiſſant authoritie of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> his brother, durſt neuer more, or at the leaſt not ſo often as hee had done, moleſt and ſpoyle them: but on the contrarie, in

            <p>But fortune not minding to ſatisfie their expectation, vnhappely ſhuffled all the cardes in their hands, and altered that ſweete deſire of peace, into a trembling feare and ſuſpition of warre. For this Frenchman (of whom wee haue before ſpoken) being arriued at Conſtantinople, declared how he fled from Saſſebeſſe, vpon ſuſpition that he was a Spie for the King of France; and being retired to the grand Seigniour, informed him of all that which had paſſed betweene <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Queene. <hi>Solyman</hi> now knowing <note place="margin">Solyman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to muade Hungarie.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing notice of this by ſpeciall aduertiſement, in the greateſt haſte he could, muſtered his men of warre, and began to perſwade with the Frier, that he ſhould prepare his forces to incounter the enemie, and giue preuention the beſt he could to the ſiniſter chances which ſhortly might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, becauſe that they were not able to prouide for the time. The Frier great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreading the Turke, in reſpect hee was vehemently incenſed againſt him, for his former proceedings: anſwered (diſſembling his thoughts) <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that hee would not faile him in any furtherance. But on the other ſide hee <note place="margin">George nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiateth with the Baſhnes.</note> cunningly practiſed his attonement with the enemie, to whom faining to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> write for the good and behalfe of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he onely writ for his owne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie and commoditie, and ſending certaine preſents to <hi>Roſtan Baſha,</hi> and to him of Buda, to draw and allure them to his friendſhip, he aſſayed as much as he could to ſhake the blame from himſelfe: ſaying, that if the Turke ſhould ſend an armie into Tranſiluania to conquer it, becauſe they had put the King of the Romanes into poſſeſſion thereof, that for that purpoſe he neede not ſend thither, ſeeing that all was done by the Queene, and not by him; who had alreadie maried her ſonne <hi>Iohn</hi> with <hi>Ferdinands</hi> daughter, to whoſe Lieutenants alſo ſhe had freely, and from the perſwaſion of her owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, intirely relinquiſhed her countrie and crowne, and her ſelfe was reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to Caſſouia: and that for theſe reaſons it was to no great purpoſe to ſend an armie to deſtroy the kingdome and ſpoyle the poore inhabitants, who were vtterly ignorant and guiltleſſe of the ſaid facts: and promiſed that hee would herein ſo carefully trauaile, that he would chaſe from thence all thoſe

ſouldiours and men of warre which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had ſent thither, and that he would continually pay the ordinarie tribute, and that according to ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as before was promiſed, and as they had alreadie begun to pay it: and further writing many other reaſons for his excuſe: and alſo to confirme this his deuice, he cauſed likewiſe certaine of the principalleſt of the kingdome, priuately to write to the ſaid Baſhaes to approue all that which he had ſaid. Yet would it not induce the Belerbey to deſiſt from marching on with his <note place="margin">The Turks ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie.</note> troupes, which he brought with him from Conſtantinople. He being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Belgrade, he began to muſter and aſſemble his Campe, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prepared certaine bridges ouer Danubius, he paſſed to the other ſide, and went to lodge by the riuer Tibiſcus, vpon which he alſo cauſed likewiſe another bridge to bee made, and from thence paſſing on a long, he came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> neere to a Caſtle named Becche, ſituated almoſt vpon the riuers ſide. In the next plaine he pitched his Campe, and from thence gaue aduertiſement to all the neighbour Prouinces which were ſubiect to the Turke, that they ſhould not faile, but preſently ſend him men and horſes, ſuch as they are bound to ſend in the like affayres.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the Belerbey buſied himſelfe to gather the reſt of his Campe, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi> commaunded <hi>Aldene</hi> the Maſter of the Campe (who then was in the low countries for the defence and aſſurance thereof) that <hi>Stephen Lozonſe,</hi> a famous Knight among the Hungars, ſhould with <hi>George Sotede</hi> enter into <note place="margin">Lozonſe Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant for Ferdinand at Themeſuar.</note> Themeſuar with 600. horſe, for the guard and defence thereof. And further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for the better aſſurance of the ſame, he commaunded that <hi>Aldene</hi> himſelfe ſhould enter thereinto with all the Spanyards which he had, making <hi>Lozonſe</hi> Gouernour of thoſe countries, and Generall ouer all the warlike affayres.

Whereat the beſieged being greatly aſtoniſhed, and perceiuing themſelues caſt away, becauſe the whole Caſtle was broken downe and layd open, they preſently yeelded to the Belerbey, with this condition only that their liues might bee ſaued, who obſeruing no promiſe towards them, were notwithſtanding ſlaine by the Ianiſaries, who after they were come forth, of 200. men left not one aliue, the Captaine excepted, whom the Belerbey with great difficultie ſaued.

whileſt he was occupied about theſe attempts, the Rhatians of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> part, ſeeing the Turks Campe approched with great force and violence, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thinking <hi>Ferdinands</hi> power deferred too much time before they came into the field, they all perſwading themſelues, that it was neither ſhame nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour <note place="margin">The Rhatians reuolt from Ferdinand, and incline to the Turkes.</note> to breake their words and othes which they ſwore to the King (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had receiued pay) they wholly retired to the Belerbey, ſending to him for his greater aſſurance, their wiues and children, and that becauſe the Turkes are not accuſtomed to repoſe ouer much truſt in them, knowing their extreame inconſtant diſpoſitions. After he had entertained theſe Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, he cauſed thoſe of Senath to bee tempted to ſome agreement, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them that if they would yeeld, he would preſerue both their honours and liues, and he would permit that peaceably euery man ſhould enioy their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> owne proper goods.

            <p>Euery one was of opinion that hee meant not to enterpriſe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this towne, becauſe that hee was certainly informed there was a ſtrong garriſon within it, and that it was ſufficiently munitioned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> inſomuch that hee eſteemed the exployte very difficult, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he ſuppoſed he ſhould neuer get it. Thus leauing the ſiege thereof, vntill a more commodious and fit time, he thought it more profitable to take from him all the Fortreſſes thereabouts, and eſpecially Lippa, (which was the direct paſſage by which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was forced to ſend all the ſuccours that were neceſſarie for him) and that afterwards hee ſeeing himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all hope, hee made no doubt, but that either by force or compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſhould carrie it.

The ſouldiours who were within were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Hungars, and little regarding the Turkes Campe, valiantly defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, hoping that within ſhort time <hi>Caſtalde</hi> would relieue them (as for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he did) and ſhewing their valiantnes and courage, which was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great, they daily made ſallies out vpon the enemie, and endamaged and annoyed the Belerbey as much as they could, ſo that hee ſeeing neither by promiſes, good words, nor by more then reaſonable offers he could winne it, he was forced in the end to depart, and let them liue in peace, perſwading himſelfe that he ſhould in the end haue it either by a long ſiege, or of their owne good will. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p>Thus leauing within Lippa 5000. horſe, and 200. of the beſt Ianiſaries which were in his Campe vnder the charge of <hi>Oliman Bech</hi> a Perſian (who a little before for ſome indignation which hee conceiued againſt the Sophy, was come from Perſia to one Turkes ſeruice) departed with the reſt of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to beſiege Themeſuar, thinking that vpon the conqueſt thereof, hee

ſhould not leaue any thing behinde him which was not firme and aſſured to him, and that hee ſhould not haue any more occaſion to conceiue any feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or doubt to be ſtaied by the ſuccours which was hoped to bee ſent by <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand:</hi> and for the better notifying of this towne of Themeſuar, I will make a briefe deſcription thereof.</p>
            <p>Themeſuar is a little towne enuironed with the riuer Themes, whereof <note place="margin">Themeſuar.</note> the towne taketh his name.

            <p>This towne being thus fortified, they got thereinto all the victuals which were in either of the Suburbes, and fiered the greater of them, for that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie ſhould not finde commoditie to lodge therein; and the other part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which was enuironed with two armes of the riuer, remained whole vntill they ſaw where the Belerbey would incampe himſelfe, with intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, as well for that it was of it ſelfe naturally very defenſible, as alſo for the commoditie which they receiued thereby; and all of them determined to keep and defend that towne againſt the furie and force of the Barbarians, or elſe to make an honourable and glorious end. They being generally of <note place="margin">Themeſuar beſieged.</note> this firme reſolution, behold the Vauntgard of the Turkes arriued the 14. of October, to peruſe and ſuruay the place: and whileſt they were buſied and attentiue about their view, <hi>Lozonſe</hi> ſallied forth with 400. horſe, ſomewhat againſt the liking of the Maſter of the Campe, <hi>Aldene.</hi> Captaine <hi>Viglian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drando</hi>

Harquebuziers to skirmiſh with the enemie, and ſo effectually did hee purſue it, that that day hee performed the acts of a valiant and couragious Leader: as for the ſame valour there was renowned and commended a Spaniſh Knight, named <hi>Alphonſe Perez</hi> of Saiauedra, to whom a little before <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had giuen a companie of Hungariſh horſe. <hi>Lozonſe</hi> on the other ſide with his horſe performed as much that day, as was poſſible for a man of experience and valour to doe againſt his enemie, ſo that being well ſeconded by the vigilancie and dexterie of the Harquebuziers, he forced the Turkes (which were 2000.) mauger their braueries, to retire themſelues to their maine ſquadrons. And this skirmiſh continued vntill the Maſter of the Campe ſent to them, with commaund to retire, fearing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that by their too much forwardnes, there might befall them ſome ſiniſter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, becauſe the Turkes were a great number, and conſidering alſo that they had giuen the enemie ſufficient notice of their pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>esse. Obeying this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, they retired without the loſſe of any one of their men, although they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21983:75"/>
were very hotly charged euen to the very enterance of the Suburbes, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Vigliandrando</hi> well foreſeeing the euent, had placed certaine Harquebuziers to relieue them, when they ſhould make their retraict. And this preuention ſtood them in ſingular good ſtead, and greatly endamaged the enemie, who for feare of the ſaid ſhot, were forced to make a ſtand, and in the end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</p>
            <p>The day after this skirmiſh, the Belerbey preſented himſelfe before the towne with all his Campe in a well ordered battaile, who (by reaſon of the Rhatians that had forſaken and disbanded themſelues from our part, and were linked to the Turks) was growne to the number of 90000. men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he thought to amaze our people onely with the ſight of their armie: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> minding to begin to take ſome knowledge of the place, was by the ſallies of the aſſieged ſo ſharply annoyed, that he could not at that time poſſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what hee went about. The Maſter of the Campe in the meane time placed 100. Harquebuziers within the Suburbes to defend it againſt the Turkes, vntill the munition which was therein, was gotten and had into the towne, the better thereby to ayde themſelues during the ſiege. The ſecond day after, the Belerbey in the night time cauſed his batterie to be placed, and on that ſide which <hi>Lozonſe</hi> and the Maſter of the Camp had begun (as good fortune was) to fortifie. Which thing when our men had vnderſtood (by the confeſſion of certaine priſoners, whom they had taken in their ſallying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> forth) they preſently cauſed with all expedition that night, to lengthen the Trench which they had begun fiftie paces, and ſo diligently did they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that the next day they thought themſelues ſufficiently ſtrong. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie hauing viewed the place, began at dawning of the day to batter with two Cannons, two Culuerines, and other ſmall peeces, with which he bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered againſt thoſe defences to beate them downe. Our men ſeeing ſo weake a batterie (although that <hi>Aldene</hi> had alreadie ſent to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> to certifie him that if within 20. daies he was not relieued, he ſhould be forced to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the towne) eſteemed as nothing the Turkes violence, for that they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly thought, they were well able to maintaine the defence of their towne, vnleſſe perhaps they ſhould be ſo battered with a great number of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that by maine force the walles on all ſides ſhould be broken downe and laid open, whereof they had ſome diſtruſt, fearing that the Belerbey would haue brought thither ſeuen other double Cannons, which they ſhould bring from Belgrade for this warre, euen as they had vnderſtood by the foreſaid priſoners.</p>
            <p>Now whileſt theſe things paſſed thus at Themeſuar, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing firſt furniſhed all the Fortreſſes with Germane garriſons, and after that he had appeaſed the diſorder which was at Breſſouia by the ſouldiours (who were <note place="margin">A tumult at Breſouia.</note> riſen againſt the citizens, and had offered them great outrage: and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which mutinie, he was forced to vſe ſeuere iuſtice againſt thoſe who were authors thereof, and to manifeſt thereby an example vnto others, to liue more peaceably and in duer obedience: for ſome of them were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, others baniſhed, and others condemned for a certaine time to priſon): After (I ſay) that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had ſet in order theſe affayres, he came and ioyned
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21983:76"/>
with the Frier, who with great diligence and promptnes had already leauied <note place="margin">The armie of Caſtalde.</note> as well horſe as foote an armie of 70000. men, which daily increaſed, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> namely by the arriuall of the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce Pallauicin,</hi> who came thither with 3000. Germanes, and of <hi>Charles Scerettin</hi> with 400. horſe, and laſtly by the arriuall of <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> with 10000. men, who after his retraict from Lippa, had thus redreſſed and reunited his armie, which ſo timerouſly and by ſuch a confuſion was disbanded and fled. By this augmentation <hi>Castalde</hi> and the Frier had in their Campe well neere 90000. men, as well thoſe of his owne pay, as alſo thoſe which were ſent him by others, and 50. peeces of Artillerie. But although the number was great, yet were they of little abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to performe any matter of moment, for that they were men of ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> 
               <note place="margin">The Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanians for the moſt part are ſouldiours of ſmall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and ſuch as were ſent of euery houſe, (as the cuſtome is in this kingdome alwaies to ſend vpon ſuch neceſſitie) meanly armed, and meerely ignorant of any warlike diſcipline: ſo that they are more fit to moue trouble and flie, then to fight or purſue the enemie. For theſe reſpects <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had no great affiance in them, but only vpon a few men which were in the Kings pay, of whom, and of no other hee made ſpeciall account for any important ſeruice, which number might amount vnto 15000. horſe and foote of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but ſpecially he repoſed ſingular confidence in 500.

And becauſe that among ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> many nations, which from diuers parts were come thither, men could not perceiue any great order or obſeruation of Militarie diſcipline amongſt them, but rather, by reaſon of the hatreds, quarels, priuate and publike enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which they had one againſt another, they might behold an extreame confuſion, becauſe that one Prouince would not ioyne and conſort with an other, but euery one would muſter and range himſelfe a part, the intreatings and perſwaſions of their Captaines and Officers nothing auailing: <hi>Castalde</hi> ſeeing the inconuenience thereof, and endeuouring to abate and ſuppreſſe all their particular diſſentions, and to reduce and vnite them into one attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he might not by the meanes of ſuch tumults and diſorders, cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to grow the hope of the enemie, and weaken <hi>Ferdinands</hi> forces; cauſed the principall and chiefe men of marke among them to aſſemble before him, and vſed to them this or the like perſwaſiue admonitions.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By vertue of theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches, al the people which before were ſo diſordered, did now vnite themſelues louingly into one, hauing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the perſon which did thus ſpeake, then regard of their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and were content to be ordered and muſtered with the other. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>This done, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> and Frier <hi>George</hi> with this armie and Artillerie, began to march with great iournies, deſirous in time to relieue <hi>Lozonſe</hi> and <hi>Aldene,</hi> who were beſieged at Themeſuar. In the continuance of their marching, the Frier would alwaies leade the Vauntgard, hauing all his people with him. But when he approched the enemie, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> tooke the conduct with the beſt and approued ſouldiours which hee had, leauing the battaile to the other. And marching in this manner, hee himſelfe appointed the quarters for the armie to lodge, alwaies chuſing the places of moſt ſtrength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, whereby his people ſhould not receiue any detriment, continually cauſing his Campe to march in good order, although it was with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, for that the armie was great, and the way where they ſhould paſſe very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> narrow and tedious, and ſpecially in ſome places which they found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the mountaine and the riuer, they being ſometime 12. or 13000. in length, where they were ſo ſtraightly crouded together, that very hardly a Coach could paſſe. In reſpect whereof the iournies were little, which did much trouble <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> ſeeing that thereby the ſuccours which he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhould enter into Themeſuar were ſlackened, which he knew to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently battered by the Belerbey.</p>
            <p>Now whileſt the Campe marched, the Commaunders of the armie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed <note place="margin">A conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Commanders of Ferdinands armie.</note> among themſelues, whether they ſhould goe to Lippa or Themeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar: and after many and ſundrie opinions, it was thought fitteſt that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhould direct their courſe to beſiege Lippa, and others were of opinion to proceed on and ſuccour Themeſuar, and that afterward they would returne and aſſaile the other. Againſt which opinions, Frier <hi>George</hi> firmely oppoſed himſelfe, ſaying, that it was much better directly to goe to Lippa; alleadging
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21983:77"/>
for his reaſons, that the Belerbey to relieue <hi>Oliman,</hi> would raiſe his Campe from before Themeſuar, and that hee would aſſuredly come to them; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by this meane they ſhould auoyde a tedious and cumberſome iourney; and that afterward they might commodiouſly ſend ſuch ſuccours as they would to the beſieged at Themeſuar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> tooke theſe opinions not to bee good, and prouing his ſpeeches by diuers reaſons, in the end perſwaded euery one to determine vpon this reſolution, to leaue a Campe before Lippa, which ſhould bee ſufficient to maintaine a ſiege there, and ſo to hinder <hi>Oliman</hi> that he ſhould not by ſallies be greatly offenſiue to them, neither eſcape himſelfe: and with the reſt of his people (ſince he had ſufficient) he would march on towards Themeſuar, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and that he would take the way which leade towards Caranſebeſſe, which is a Caſtle ſituated in the confines of the Tranſalpinians, not farre from The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſuar, from whence he might within few houres ſend ſuccours to <hi>Lozonſe</hi> and <hi>Aldene,</hi> and that if he did otherwiſe, it would redound to ſmall profit; and this enterpriſe could bee ſubiect to nothing elſe, but to inconſtant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, voyde of all reaſon.</p>
            <p>After (I ſay) ſuch aduices diſcourſed and determined of, the Frier at the ſame inſtant called to him <hi>Battor,</hi> that he might bee preſent at that which he would ſpeake; and ſaid to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that he had altered his minde, and that he thought it not good to goe with this armie to relieue Themeſuar, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that this armie compoſed rather of people muſtered together, who were but badly armed and vnexperienced, then of good and trained ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, (whereof the Turkes no doubt would bee aduertiſed) it would bee ſuddenly incountered by the enemie, and that theſe two armies rudely ſhocking together, our Campe without doubt would be broken and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, by the good order, practiſe, and long experience of the enemie. And thus publiſhing to them many other friuolous reaſons, hee concluded in the end (appartly ſhewing) that he was mutabilitie it ſelfe, and that his diſpoſition was not to bee long firmely ſtayed vpon one reſolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> anſwered him, that he had reaſon to be as he was, eſpecially in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affayres, in which it was behoouefull to take good counſell, and vſe a conſideratiue foreſight, it being commendable for him ſometimes to change his opinion from good to better; but onely he now meant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to goe to Lippa, where (according to the euent of things) they would agree amongſt themſelues either to aſſaile Lippa, or relieue Themeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar. The Frier replied, ſaying, that he well knew Themeſuar to be a place not very ſtrong, and that by a Polacque, (whom he had of purpoſe ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and after that hee had diligently conſidered all that which was done there, as well within as without, hee was againe returned to him) by whom he had alſo notice that the Turkes expected more Artillerie to be ſent them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and that the beſieged, although they were couragious (and had good deſire to fight) yet were they not able any longer to endure the ſiege, in reſpect of the intolerable and laborious toyles, which day and night they endured, in digging and fortifying with ſtraw. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hearing theſe things, with other
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21983:77"/>
more colourable reaſons, ſtrengthening ſtill his owne, tolde him he ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> remember that which vſually hee was wont to ſay; that except Lippa were recouered, Tranſiluania would bee loſt, and that it might pleaſe him not to deceiue Chriſtendome of that ſpeciall hope, which it had conceiued of him, and of that glorie which it ſhould get, by the recouerie of this towne, and by the retraict of the enemie, being very well content that in this matter he himſelfe ſhould abſolutely commaund, and that he would obey him as a priuate Captaine. By theſe reaſons he endeuoured to perſwade the Frier to march to Lippa, and ſpecially becauſe the time approched that hee ſhould relieue <hi>Lozonſe</hi> and <hi>Aldene,</hi> as they had demaunded, hauing proteſted, that if during the limited time of twentie daies, they were not relieued, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> could no longer hold out, but be forced to yeeld to the Belerbey. The Frier, whether it were that he feared to giue battaile to the Belerbey; or that it was for ſome conſideration of the practiſes which hee had with him, that by his meanes he might reconcile himſelf againe to <hi>Solyman;</hi> or elſe that he thought not his Campe to be ſufficiently furniſhed of ſuch men, vpon whoſe valour he might aduenture the hazard of a combat, I know not, but for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hee would not vpon had I wiſt, neither aduenture his perſon nor the kingdome, nor march any further, and leſſe relieue Themeſuar. But in the end he manifeſted with an euill will to goe towards Lippa, and thinking to eſcape from thence (ſince otherwiſe he could not doe it) he held on his pace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with ſlow ſpeede, not without ſuſpition, as it ſeemed, to giue leiſure that <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> might retire himſelf, for that he thought he would neuer aduenture nor attend him within ſo weak and vnfortified place. Thus the Friers idle excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was not without ſome conſiderations beſt knowne to himſelfe. And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſome were diſputing to proceede on, and others to make no haſte, newes was brought how the Belerbey, after hee had battered Themeſuar eight whole daies together, was now retired; notwithſtanding there was brought <note place="margin">The Turke retireth from Themeſuar.</note> him more Artillerie and munition, eſteeming it to bee his beſt ſafetie not to attend there any longer, vnderſtanding that Frier <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neere with a great armie. And thus vpon the day that our men thought to receiue the aſſault, at the dawning of the day, they perceiued the Turkes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had forſaken and quitted their Trenches, and left them disfurniſhed of their accuſtomed guards, and that they had drawne their Artillerie into thoſe Caſtles which they had wonne before, and were in the night diſlodged with ſo great a noyſe and tumult, that our men thought they yet planted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Artillerie to endamage them the more. <hi>Lozonſe</hi> and <hi>Aldene</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of this departure, would not that any ſhould yet goe out, fearing the enemie was not wholly retired; but cauſed certaine Aiduchs to goe forth to ſuruiew the Trenches, and diſcouer the occaſion of ſo ſudden a remouing. Theſe being abroade, ſaw that the Turkes were aſſuredly retired, and that in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſuch great haſte and diſorder, that in token thereof they had left in their Trenches more then 200. iron bullets for Artillerie, which preſently were taken into the towne by our men. The Frier taking courage by this diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made ſhew to be very ioyfull thereof, and cauſing the day following an aſſemblie of the Councell, it was concluded then among them, more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21983:78"/>
to aſſaile Lippa, (and not leaue it behinde) then to follow the enemie. The army proceeding on in this courſe towards Lippa, they had notice how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
               <hi>Oliman</hi> determined reſolutely to defend it, and as they marched (being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie within foure miles of Lippa) there arriued the 20. of October in the night, a Currier, who brought newes, that Pope <hi>Iuly</hi> the third, at the requeſt <note place="margin">George made Cardinall.</note> and inſtance of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> had created Frier <hi>George</hi> a Cardinall, and brought him the red Hat, with many Cardinals letters, who not knowing him, but being onely induced thereunto by the good and commendable reports which were ſpoken of him, ſent to him this newes, with great and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſalutations, aduertiſing him with what good affection of all their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Hat was beſtowed vpon him, aſſuring him alſo, that not onely this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> dignitie was due to his worthie merits, but alſo an honour farre more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, for a man of that ſincere Chriſtianitie, and religious protector of the Romane faith, defending this kingdome with ſo great trauaile and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie againſt the Turkes, whereof they generally receiued a ſingular content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>As theſe and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had written to him theſe particulars, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the great information which was reported of his vertue, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and courage, hee ſeeing ſuch commendations to bee greatly to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, could not ſo much containe himſelfe within the bounds of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but that hee apparantly declared to all men great tokens of ioy in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> countenance, conſidering that euery where men made ſo ſpeciall an account of him, yea, and euen at Rome it ſelfe, whither all the world reſorted. But on the other ſide he was much diſquieted, fearing that the Turke, vpon aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of theſe honourable fauours which he daily receiued of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſhould in reſpect thereof, and in time to come greatly ſuſpect him, and vpon theſe reaſons might haue iuſt occaſion not to repoſe the like truſt in him, as he before, euen vntill that time, had done. By reaſon of theſe two contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he had in his minde, there were contrarie ſhewes in him: for vnto them which did little knowe and vnderſtand his practiſes, hee made ſhew as though hee little regarded the Hat: but to others who were of a deeper reach, hee to vaile their iudgements, endeuoured himſelfe by many inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to make it apparant to them, what ſingular pleaſure he conceiued of it. The ſame night, in token of reioycing, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> commaunded that a Salue ſhould bee made with all the Artillerie, to the end that the Frier being throughly prouoked with ſuch ſignes of honour and ioy, he might reſolue himſelfe wholly to follow <hi>Ferdinands</hi> part, and that with ſuch ſinceritie as he ought, and that hee would wholly giue ouer himſelfe to his ſeruice, and not haue ſo many Irons in the fire. But all this was done to ſmall purpoſe. For with his deceits and ſhifts, he ſtill continued to maske his falſehood, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding any perſon of what qualitie ſoeuer; which was a thing that greatly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> diſpleaſed as well <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> as all the other Commaunders who were adhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Kings part. This, and the ambitious deſire of power and great <note place="margin">The cauſe of the hate that Caſtalde had againſt George.</note> places, were firſt the cauſe of the hate which was ingendred againſt him, and in the end procured his death, becauſe that all the Commaunders ſeeing he did not any thing eſteeme nor fauour them, but on the contrarie held them
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21983:78"/>
in diſdaine and contempt, began to apprehend a ſuſpition of being betraied, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and in ſome place or other, when occaſion ſerued, to be maſſacred.</p>
            <p>Now while Frier <hi>George</hi> by his malice, in concealing his purpoſes, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled one thing, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> with as great policie and wiſedome fained another, alwaies ſhadowing his intention with ſuch diſcretion, that none had any perſeuerance of the diſlike which he conceiued in his heart againſt him; and hauing before noted the Friers deceitfull proceedings, as it was ſaid, he repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no truſt in him at all, but continually had a vigilant and ſuſpitious eye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his actions. As theſe affayres proceeded on in this ſort, two daies after <note place="margin">Aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Ferdinand to Caſtalde, to kill George.</note> there arriued with <hi>Caſtalde</hi> a gentleman of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> retinue, named <hi>Iulius Salazar,</hi> who was come poſt from Vienna, with letters of credence, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> imported, that if <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was not then departed out of Tranſiluania, hee ſhould not now ſtirre from thence, but reſolue to keepe and maintaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there ſo ſtrongly, that the Frier ſhould finde no deuiſes to expell him out: and that he ſhould inuent the beſt meanes he could preſently to haue him ſlaine, for that he perceiued not onely by his owne letters, but alſo he vnderſtood for certaine, by ſpeciall aduertiſements from thoſe who were come from the Turkes Court, and from the King of Polonia, and ſome of his Secretaries, that he intended to enter league with the Turke, and to ſeeke the deſtruction of him and of all his armie, and thereby to make himſelfe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lord of Tranſiluania: and that before he ſhould put in practiſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, he aduertiſed him to haue a ſpeciall and vigilant eye of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and that he ſhould in ſuch ſort doe it, as though there were no ſuch intended practiſe to intrap him; and that hee referred to his wiſedome the meanes which hee ſhould vſe to effect it, skilfully endeuouring to deliuer himſelfe from the danger in which he might behold his perſon and people at that time. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> then vnderſtanding <hi>Ferdinands</hi> pleaſure, he thought it no new or ſtraunge thing, becauſe that hee alreadie very well perceiued that the Frier vſed but little ſinceritie and true dealing in thoſe affaires which concerned the Kings ſeruice, which poſſeſt him in a confirmation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, which he not without cauſe conceiued of him. Now to fruſtrate his iealous braine from ſuſpecting any intended practiſe againſt him, hee by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſome new deuiſes, for his better ſatisfaction, diſſembled the Kings meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: and his temporiſing with him was ſo diſcreete and wiſe, that hee neuer gaue him the leaſt occaſion to ſuſpect him, imparting to him what deſire <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had to ſee a good ende of this warre, and what ſpeciall hope he had of his valour and integritie, to obtaine by his meanes ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned victorie, attributing all the glorie which ſhould be gotten thereby, to his vertue and proweſſe. With ſuch colourable fictions he continually entertained him, vntill that time which then ſhould preſent vnto him the meanes to execute his enterpriſe, euen as hee well hoped it would come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> effect, without any danger or loſſe, and after ſuch manner, that by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it he ſhould neither hazard that kingdome nor his armie: which he knew ſo well to conduct and manage, and that with ſuch ſuttletie and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and to bring it ſo to end, that the Frier ſhould neuer haue any ſuſpition or coniecture of it, which might haue giuen him any trouble in his minde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:21983:79"/>
In the meane while the Campe approched very neere to Lippa, and then the Frier for that day would needes leade the Vauntgard, which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> no meanes would denie, but gratified him in any thing he demaunded. The Frier being arriued at a place where hee lodged that night, found the paſſage <note place="margin">George and Caſtalde diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth for the conduct of the armie.</note> to be exceeding bad for the Artillerie, the way being very narrow, by reaſon of the mountaine and riuer which fronted each other: but yet not ſo rough that it ſhould bee any occaſion to hinder or ſlacke that which hee deſired to doe; yet did the Frier finde it to be a ſufficient ſubiect, to execute his waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring intention. Thus he now ſeeing it was time to accompliſh that which he had imprinted in his braine, hauing ſuruaied the paſſage, declared to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> that he thought it would bee impoſſible for the great Artillerie to paſſe that place, and that he was of minde that it was good to leaue it there, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> with ſuch a guard of horſe and foote as might defend it, and that himſelfe alone with the field peeces would proceede on the iourney. <hi>Caſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> not liking of that which the Frier aduiſed him of, went himſelfe to view the ſaid paſſage, and ſaw it was not ſo bad, as that it ſhould ſtay or hinder the Artillerie from paſſing: and thinking the Frier was not ſo ſimple, but that he knew this paſſage might eaſily be fitted, iudged in himſelfe that he ſet before them theſe difficulties to no other end, but to ſlacken the deſeignes of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> Vpon which conſideration, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> cauſed good ſtore of Pioners to bee ſet on worke, and made them bring many pickaxes, who within a ſhort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> time ſo repayred and enlarged the way, that two horſes might goe in front with a wagon, and ſo by little and little they cut ſo much of the Rocke, and made the paſſage ſo large, that the Artillerie might well paſſe without any inconuenience. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> with the other Captaines to bring the worke to an end, began themſelues to ſet to their hands, and there they laboured ſo long, till it was farre in the night, in reſpect whereof he was forced there to lodge his Battaile and Rereward, and commaunded certaine Spaniſh Captaines who were then with him, that although it was not yet day, they ſhould march with the Artillerie the reſt of the night, notwithſtanding it was then time rather to repoſe and reſt themſelues, in reſpect of the former daies wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and himſelfe, not being perceiued of any, with his owne guard depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſecretly out of the Campe, and went from thence priuately to the place, where two miles from Lippa the Frier was lodged, and being entered into his Tent, accompanied with ſundrie Spaniſh and Italian gentlemen (among whom was one <hi>Iulian de Carleual)</hi> he ſaid to him, that he ſhould not be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, although they came to him at that time of the night, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (as hee ſawe) to ſpeake with him, for it was for no other purpoſe, but to knowe the cauſe that moued him without any occaſion, to wiſh him to leaue the great Artillerie, being ſo nigh the enemie, againſt whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding couragiouſly marching, they ſhould be ſure to get vncredible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> honor, and making themſelues maſters of Lippa, to obtaine ſo great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable reputation, as they might well hope for, from all this warre: and ſo much the rather, for that the enemie had raiſed his Campe from before The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſuar, vpon the bare bruite of their comming to relieue the beſieged, which vndoubtedly had alreadie purchaſed to them ineſtimable honour,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21983:79"/>
and great aſtoniſhment to the enemie. The Frier anſwered him; that the occaſion which moued him to come vnto that place with the armie, was, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that hee thought the Belerbey would intirely retire himſelfe: but, ſith hee vnderſtood that he had not yet paſſed Tibiſcus, it gaue him to ſuſpect ſome further matter, ſeeing that <hi>Oliman</hi> bouged not from Lippa, but reſolued to withſtand all the inconueniences and hazards of a ſiege, not beleeuing that ſuch a reſolution did proceede from any other thing, but onely of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which the ſaid <hi>Oliman</hi> repoſed in the neere aſſiſtance of the Belerbey, and that if it were ſo, he could ſee no aſſurance to proceede any further, for that heretofore he neuer incountered with ſo great an armie, compoſed of ſo many warlike ſouldiours, as that of the Turkes was, and that for this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and alſo for the regard and care which they ſhould haue of thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours which were vnder his commaund, hee was very confident that hee was not able to reſiſt them, nor to reconquer the half of that which the Turks had inuaded and gotten, and that therefore hee would not ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately aduenture his perſon and the kingdome together, and that he thought it more expedient to make ſome truce with the enemie, without remouing from the place where they were, conſidering it was to their more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that it could not chuſe but bee greatly to the honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> tolde him, that ſpecially they were to conſider the foule offence which would be greatly imputed to them, if they retired without ſome iuſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cauſe, it being reported through the world, that they two were in the field with ſo puiſſant an armie, as that was which they had conducted to this place, with a reſolution to expulſe the Turks out of that kingdom, and that in retyring and leauing Lippa in the enemies poſſeſſion, it might be iuſtly ſaid to bee done, not without ſome ſecret practiſe and conſpiracie which wee ſhould haue with them: and ſpecially the ſame being a towne of great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, and knowne to be the moſt important key of all Hungarie and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania, and conſequently of all Chriſtendome, which being in the Turkes commaund, he might continually make incurſions from thence, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of great ſpoyles and robbings, and by many inconueniences enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all the whole countries and ſubiects of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Therefore to auoyd that ſtaine of diſhonour, hee moſt inſtantly prayed him, that at the leaſt he would goe to Lippa, and (by Gods aſſiſtance) he would promiſe him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it into his hands within ſixe daies. In the end he purſued his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo effectually, that he was content to goe as farre as Lippa, although he often alleadged the great inconuenience which might befall them for want of Artillerie, which by good fortune, and by the diligence of the Spaniſh Captaines, arriued that day at the Campe, to the great admiration of the Frier, who aſſuredly thought they could not bee there in eight daies. This animated <hi>Caſtalde</hi> preſently to troupe on with 3000. Hungariſh horſe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 400. men of armes to view Lippa, which of one ſide is ſquare, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Lippa.</note> keepeth the circuite of an ouall forme, ſo that it is more long then broad. The length thereof is 720. paces, and the bredth 380. being of one part (for that the riuer Maroſſe watereth it) very ſtrong, and of the other it ſeemeth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21983:80"/>
very weake, by reaſon of a mountaine which doth greatly commaund and annoy the defences thereof. It is altogether mured with a wall after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> manner, without any defences and few turrets. There is in the lower part of the towne a little ſquare Caſtle, garniſhed in euery corner with a tower, and is compaſſed about with a deepe Ditch full of water. Preſently vpon <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> approaching, he lighted from his horſe and walked on foote, and paſſing through certaine gardens, accompanied with <hi>Iulian Carleuall,</hi> and two other Spaniſh Captaines, he went to peruſe the Ditch, hauing firſt ſent a good troupe of thoſe which he had brought, to dare the Turks to skirmiſh, who by no meanes would aduenture forth to fight, imploying themſelues from the wall wholly to annoy our men with the harquebuze, and hinder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that none ſhould haue a view of the towne. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing well and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently viewed all, and after he had cauſed his men to retire, the ſame night he returned againe to the Campe, where he found the Captaines <hi>Roderic Vigli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrando,</hi> and <hi>Francis Henry Teſcieda,</hi> who were come forth of Themeſuar to bee at the aſſault of this towne. He fully learned of them the aduentures which had paſſed in that place, and the manner of the Belerbeys retraict, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not before vnderſtood any thing for certaine.</p>
            <p>Vpon this newes, the 2. of Nouember they all marched to Lippa, where <note place="margin">Lippa beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde.</note> all the Campe being arriued, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> martialled all his battalions and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie before the Turks, with a marueilous crie and confuſed noiſe of all thoſe barbarous nations, and continuing there a certaine time in ſuch apparance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> they tooke poſſeſſion of the Mountaine, and the Frier incamped with his people on the otherſide towards the Caſtle. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> poſſeſſing all the hill, (which commaunded in manner of a Caualier) quartered thoſe higheſt who were entertained by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> namely the Spanyards, Germanes, and Hungars, and cauſed his Tent to be erected in the middeſt of them. Whileſt the Campe lodged there, the Turkes came forth to fire one of the Suburbes, which was well prouided of victuals, and ſpecially of wine which groweth in that quarter, as good as could be deſired. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> vnderſtanding hereof, commaunded Captaine <hi>Iohn Vilioa</hi> that preſently he ſhould take 100. Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Harquebuziers, and ſo force the enemie to retire: and that after hee had quenched the fire (which alreadie began violently to burne &amp; to ſpread it ſelfe vpon the houſes) he ſhould endeuour as much as he could to ſaue the victuals, for the better reliefe and prouiſion of the Camp, and that he ſhould hinder that they might not bee ſpoyled by thoſe nations. But they could not ſo well bee kept, neither take ſo good order, but that the Friers Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duchs came and tooke their pleaſure and fill of the wine, in ſuch ſort, as the ſuperfluitie thereof ſo chafed and ſtirred vp their courages, that 500. of them being pricked with that Bacchinall furie, they ranne inſtantly to aſſaile the towne, without ladders or any order, thinking by their brauing tearmes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to ſubuert and ouerthrow the walles. By this ſudden attempt, happened an alarme to the whole Campe, euery man thinking that the Turkes had made ſome ſallie forth to skirmiſh with our men. On the other ſide, the Turkes alſo aſſuring themſelues by this horrible bruite and noyſe, to be aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both with ſcallado and batterie, they preſently ſtood vpon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21983:80"/>
couering the walles with men, and with their harquebuzes they made a great ſlaughter of theſe Aiduchs, who like beaſts were eaſily diſcouered; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and graſping the wall, attempted to leape vp, vttering to the Turkes many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious ſpeeches (as their manner is) who being couert and attentiue behind the wall, ſhewed them by their defences that they were in double ſafetie, ſo that they at pleaſure ſlew whom they liſted, vntill they were wearie of killing them. On the otherſide, certaine horſemen ſtinged with the ſame mad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ranne with their Sables drawne in their hands euen to the Ditch, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and menacing the Turkes, who in the end ſeeing their order to be but diſorder, made a great maſſacre of them, as well from the wall as within the Ditch, and with maine ſtrength cauſed them to retire backe. But this retraict was preſently ſtaied by the courage which their companions gaue them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> who offering themſelues to the like perill, ſeemed not any thing to ſhrinke from the daunger. This diſorder had proceeded further then was imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the firſt, if the Frier had not hindered it, who ſpeedily thruſt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and cauſed them to retire. And this was the end of this drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alarme that proceeded of wine, which in the end being appeaſed, the armie was then quietly lodged.</p>
            <p>During this time, there arriued at the Campe a Hungariſh Lord named <note place="margin">Patocche a Hungarian Captaine.</note> 
               <hi>Patocche,</hi> with 400. horſe and 600. foote, which he leauied and brought with him at his owne proper charges, to be imployed in the ſeruice of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> during this warre of Lippa. He alſo brought with him foure good peeces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Artillerie, with which paſſing by a Caſtle that held for the Turkes, not farre from Lippa, he thought good to trie his fortune, and to ſee if he could by any meanes take it by force. Thus arriuing on a ſudden, he aſſailed it with ſo great courage, and with ſo good order, that during the batterie his people behaued themſelues ſo valiantly, that winning one port, and ſetting fire on another, they entered it, killing and vanquiſhing as many Turkes as they found therein, not ſparing any, but onely the Captaine. This place being thus ſacked and burnt, <hi>Patocche</hi> with his people proceeded on his iourney, leading priſoner with him the Captaine, by whom vnderſtanding of what qualitie and condition he was of, he determined to giue him to <hi>Caſtalde.</hi> But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> neither the one nor the other did long enioy him, becauſe that vpon the day following, as this Captaine marched in the middeſt of the troupes, one of the ſouldiours who was at his taking, vnderſtanding that he was of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and reputation, that hee might well pay a large raunſome, and that he ſhould haue nothing thereof, for that <hi>Patocche</hi> had taken him from him: whereupon being poſſeſt with deſpayre, he ſuddenly diſcharged his peece againſt him, betweene his ſhoulders, and ſo mortall was the wound, that he ſuddenly fell dead to the ground, he not minding that any other ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe that, which himſelfe could not enioy. This Captaine, as it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward knowne, was of ſuch qualitie and parentage, that if the line of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomans</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had failed, the ſucceſſion of the Empire belonged to none but to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Patocche</hi> being arriued at the Campe, was honourably receiued by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde,</hi> and great mirth and ioy was made for the good ſucceſſe and taking of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21983:81"/>
this Caſtle; and not without cauſe, ſince voluntarily and at his owne expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without any particular hope of profit, but onely in regard and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of honour, he was voluntarily come to ſerue his Prince. The ſame day they had newes alſo, that vpon the Belerbeys retraict, were gone forth of Themeſuar 200. horſe, with 26. Harquebuziers mounted, to cut of the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and thoſe who were disbanded from the Turkes Campe, and that theſe returning without performing any thing, they came by a Caſtle named Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, poſſeſt by the enemies: againſt which preparing themſelues to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gala a Caſtle taken by the Hungars, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh apparell.</note> they could winne it, they enuironed it, who being diſcouered by the Sentinels, and perceiuing that the Turkes made not any ſhot of Cannon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, nor no other ſhew for their owne ſafeties, they were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue an aſſault to it, and force the Port, and aſſay if by that meanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> they could ſurpriſe it. Which did as fortunately ſucceed as they themſelues deſired: for that the Turkes (in a happie time for our people) expected that day certaine men, which they had ſent to demaund of the Belerbey, power and ſuccour to maintaine themſelues againſt <hi>Ferdinands</hi> armie, which they knew ſhould preſently march againſt Lippa: and they ſeeing our men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, did verely thinke that they had been the ſame which they expected, inſomuch that they were not any thing moued or feared therewith, and the rather in reſpect of their habits, who were apparelled after the Turkiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which they had gotten of thoſe who were dead in the Campe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this traine deceiued, and thinking our people had come to their ayd, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> they did not any thing furniſh their guards with more men, but gaue place and commoditie to our ſouldiours to approach neere the Caſtle, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to enter into it by the Port: the guard of which Port, before that they were knowne, were diſcomforted, and afterwards the enemie perceiuing the deceit, and taking weapons in hand valiantly to defend themſelues, our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were conſtrained to force the reſt of the Caſtle by maine force, and carie the victorie not without great paine and hazard, compelling the Turkes (mauger their wils) to retire to the end of a ſtreete, where, not being able a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer to deſend themſelues, were in the end ouercome by the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Hungars, who were on foote, killing as many of them as they could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> incounter, without receiuing any damage to themſelues, but by the death of two Spanyards, who at the firſt incounter were ſhot with the enemies Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers: and after this execution they ſet fire on all, leading all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants priſoners, and then they retired to Themeſuar. The taking of this Caſtle, although it were of ſmall moment, yet it gaue ſpeciall content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to euery one, and greatly encouraged the Captaines; not in reſpect of the importance of the thing, as to ſee fortune ſo fauourable, and incline to them in euery place.</p>
            <p>After ſuch ioy and mirth, the night being come, it was decreed that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the ſame, ſome ſhould bee ſent to ſuruiew Lippa, to approach more neere, and plant the batterie. Of one ſide thereof was ſent Captaine <hi>Iohn Viglioa, Don Antonie Azinetta,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Varcocche.</hi> To another part were diſpatched Captaine <hi>Vigliandrando,</hi> and the <hi>Alferus</hi> of <hi>Lewis Barientos.</hi> And <hi>Andrew Lopes</hi> Sergeant Maior, <hi>Iulian de Carleuall,</hi> and certaine other Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21983:81"/>
Captaines, had the charge of another quarter. The diligence was great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of euery one to haue knowledge of the towne, and report thereof being made to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> he cauſed the very ſame night certaine peeces of Artillerie to be planted vpon the hill which was aboue the towne, neere to the place of Iuſtice, with which the day following he made many a ſhot, to hinder and annoy the enemie that he ſhould not fortifie himſelfe, and to force him to quit the ſtreetes and paſſages about the walles, which from that hill might eaſily be diſcouered. The ſecond night being come, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> commaunded to begin the batterie on that ſide which <hi>Vigliandrando</hi> had viewed, as it was generally thought to be the weakeſt and leaſt defencible of any part thereof. That being done, after the vapouring away of the fogge (which towards the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> morning doth vſually riſe vpon the riuer) they began vpon the 4. of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember to batter the towne with foure double Cannons, &amp; two ſmall Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerines, with which it was battered al the day long, both in the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the morrow after. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſeeing that the Artillerie had ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected his purpoſe, was determined the ſame day to giue the aſſault, and not ſuffer the Turkes to haue ſo much leiſure to fortifie themſelues any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not minding to impart it to all, he tolde it notwithſtanding to ſome few, in whoſe friendſhip he greatly affied for all that which he purpoſed to doe. But vpon this determination they diſcouered the Fort which the Turks had erected within, inſomuch as they were forced to alter their opinions, and commaunded the Canoniers to increaſe their batterie and ruinate it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſaying, that he would not loſe his people at the furie of an aſſault, but would preſerue them for a battaile. The batterie being reenforced with two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, they began to batter ſo terribly againſt theſe Rampiers, that in euery mans iudgement they thought it to be quite ouerthrowne.</p>
            <p>Whileſt they continued their batterie, and that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was gone to Frier <hi>George,</hi> to giue order for that which ſhould be fitting for an aſſault, fiftie Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards (who then were out of their quarters, within the Trenches for the guard of them, and to ſee what was done by the batterie) began to diſcourſe and conferre among themſelues of it: the breach ſeeming good &amp; commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to giue the aſſault: theſe men taking reſolution, becauſe they onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> would haue the glorie to goe thither firſt, were of this minde, that firſt they muſt view it, and that finding it to bee ſo as they verely beleeued, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently would haue marched to the breach, without any other companie to aſſiſt them, if it had ſo pleaſed <hi>Caſtalde</hi> that they ſhould haue gone alone to the aſſault. As they diſcourſed of this enterpriſe among themſelues, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ſouldiour greedie of glorie, offered himſelfe to goe and view it: but he ſo badly viewed it, that he was afterwards the cauſe of great diſorder (as wee ſhall preſently declare) for he reported that it was very reaſonable, not any thing perceiuing the Trench which the Turks had made within, halfe a pike in heigth, and a whole in breadth, raiſed vp with two rankes of baricadoes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> one vpon the other full of earth, and well furniſhed with neceſſarie defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: vpon the which they had planted two ſmall peeces of Artillerie, hoping thereby to warrant themſelues from the aſſault which they hourely expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. At the report of this ſouldiour, the fiftie Spanyards being greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21983:82"/>
were attentiue to the ſignall which ſhould bee giuen, for that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> would be the firſt which ſhould ſhew themſelues vpon the breach.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was with the Frier, accompanied with all the Colonels, Captaines, principall Lords, and many other ſouldiours of the armie, it was concluded to goe to the aſſault, and generally incouraging euery one, and promiſing to them liberall rewards, he ſpake vnto them after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If it bee true (as the trueth is ſo) that Gods goodnes neuer faileth thoſe, <note place="margin">Caſtalde his oration to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa.</note> who for the maintenance of infallible faith, for iuſtice, and for the good of many, imploy their vttermoſt endeuours: I make no doubt (my ſouldiours) but that this day, fighting for the defence of our Religion, the iuſt cauſe of the King our maſter and Lord, for the deliuerie of Lippa, and for the recouering and preſeruation of this kingdome, that wee ſhall not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of God this preſent victorie, which voluntarily prepareth it ſelfe fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to vs, but alſo after our death an euerlaſting felicitie in the world to come. And this will be the day (although it ſeemeth ſomewhat perilous) if we fight couragiouſly, which will crowne vs with infinit honour, and infuſe ſuch a feare and terror into our quailing enemies, that increaſing our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will cauſe the other to tremble, as well at our very names, as at our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent warlike exploytes. Therefore let euery one of you diſpoſe and prepare himſelfe couragiouſly for the aſſault, and conceiue neither feare or horrour thereof. For it is neceſſarie to all thoſe who are deſirous of glorie, to oppoſe and thruſt themſelues into difficill and daungerous attempts, and not to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> daunted by any baſe repulſe. O ſouldiours, what a ſhame would it bee to you, hauing in time of peace accuſtomed your ſelues to martiall exerciſes, and in time of warre to ſubdue and conquer, to bee now vanquiſhed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome by the force and proweſſe of the Turks, whom you now ſee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die full of feare, through the batterie and ruine of their walles? Therefore I promiſe to thoſe who ſhall be the firſt that this day mount vpon the wall, or that ſhall performe a ſufficient proofe of their valour, to prize and reward them, as their commendable acts doe proclaime them worthie. Thus you being confirmed in a reſolute courage, feare not to goe to it, for that you ſee God is on our ſide, and oppoſite to our enemies, who alreadie begin to feele <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> his anger, which is manifeſtly ſeene to come vpon them by their broken and defaced walles; by the fearefull ſiege which they painfully, and with great horrour endure, in reſpect of the famine which they piningly ſuffer; by our warlike ſquadrons which we cauſe to march againſt them; and by the death which they within few houres ſhall receiue, to their perpetuall damnation: whereas we dying with valour, ſhall liue eternally. And whileſt wee ſee the occaſion fauourable to vs, euery one ſhould aſſay to ouercome, all of vs ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating one another: it being alwaies a commendable thing, that good and valiant ſouldiours in haughtie enterpriſes and difficult attempts, ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and encourage one another valiantly to performe his deuoire, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> end, that through negligence, miſſing of the victorie, it bee not imputed to their diſhonour: and by this meanes, euery one ſhould bee in daunger of blame, if at the leaſt once, he made not triall of his vertue and proweſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemie. And you Hungarian ſouldiours, whom this ſiege doth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21983:82"/>
more import then any other, valiantly endeuour your ſelues this day to ſhew your vttermoſt vertue and courage; becauſe that in this day you may in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> blood of the Turkes (our common enemies) reuenge the death of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſlaine and moſt horribly murthered by them, and take reuenge for the rauiſhment of your daughters, the taking away of your ſonnes, the ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of your Temples, and the prophaning of your Moneſtaries. I doubt not but bearing your ſelues valiantly, you will carrie away the victorie, and that by the ſlaughter of your enemies, you will ſecure the liues of your countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and reconquer the loſt honour of your townes. Now then, you being all vnited and linked together with one like friendly league of amitie, refuſe not theſe honourable perils, which may make you thrice happie, and of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects make you free; ſince (I aſſure my ſelfe) you haue courages ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from feare: and know this, that only to haue a couragious and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heart in great perils, giueth great hope vnto them to ſaue themſelues; who deſpiſing death, count it all their glorie and renowne to die in an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable battaile.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Preſently after he had ended theſe ſpeeches (and hauing heard the report of this Spanyard who had viewed the breach (as wee haue aforeſaid) who had alſo certified that with little labour they might eaſily mount to aſſaile it) and that euery one had offered himſelfe, either to winne it, or elſe there ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably to end his life; hee appointed the Enſignes ſhould march to the Trenches, which he commaunded to be made in euery place, that the Turks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by no meanes ſhould either ſaue themſelues, or yet receiue any ſuccours of any ſide. They being all come thither, he cauſed to be proclaimed, as well of his owne behalfe, as alſo of Frier <hi>Georges,</hi> that whoſoeuer ſhould firſt enter into Lippa, if hee were a gentleman, he ſhould haue giuen him in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence <note place="margin">The meanes to incourage ſouldiours to an aſſault.</note> 200. Duckets of yeerely reuenew, and 200. ſlaues: and if hee were meanly diſſended, that the King would make him noble, and giue him 100. Crownes of yeerely reuenew, with 100. captiues. Vpon this proclamation, thoſe who were in the Trenches, ſeeing the Enſignes to march towards them for the aſſault, deſirous to winne glorie, and to bee the firſt, began di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to march to the breach. The others who came after with the Colours, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſeeing thoſe Spanyards to iſſue out of their Trenches, thinking that thoſe by a certaine dexterie would carrie that honour away from them, did preſently double their pace to ioyne with them: and thus both the one and the other confuſedly in haſte and without any order ran to the aſſault, the Captaines not being able to remedie it, nor ſtay thoſe who were the firſt that went out of their Trenches, and who arriued there ſomewhat before the other. The Vauntgard being now come thither, <hi>Don Antonie de Enzinellia,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Vigliandrando,</hi> without further reſpect of the qualitie of the place, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched to the batterie, and thruſt themſelues in, and hauing with them 30. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> approued ſouldiours, they perceiued how the Turks were retrenched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and how ſtrong their new fortification was, which hindered them from further proceeding; and duly conſidering their Rampiers, they knew that the Turkes had forſaken their Artillerie, and ſhot many arrowes with vollies of Harquebuziers againſt thoſe who firſt attempted to enter. And of all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21983:83"/>
this they would willingly haue giuen notice to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> to renue and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the batterie with more Artillerie, and make the breach more large and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſaultable, at what time Captaine <hi>Aldene</hi> arriued there with his Enſignes, with whom (not giuing reſpite to thoſe to execute that, which they not without cauſe had aduiſed vpon) ſuddenly he began to renue the aſſault, and with certaine Hungariſh gentlemen (who to be knowne from others in fighting, had faſtned to their caskes certaine markes) reſolutely entered with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours into the breach, couragiouſly forcing themſelues vpon their enemies, it being bruited that theſe were the firſt who mounted vpon the wall: but among the Spanyards and Germanes, the honour thereof was giuen to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian de Carleuall</hi> to be the firſt that vaunted himſelfe vpon the top of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and euen vnto him <hi>Caſtalde</hi> gaue the due honour and promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But the Frier would haue attributed the praiſe thereof to the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars. At this aſſault there began a horrible and bloodie fight, with great loſſe of our people, and aduantage to the Turkes, who were 3000. only to defend that little breach, and who alſo fought ſo couragiouſly, that they often durſt ſally out of their Fort or Baricadoes, to fight pell mell amongſt our men, and that euen hand to hand. They firſt ſlew Captaine <hi>Aldene,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonie de Enzinellia,</hi> and many other valiant and expert ſouldiours. Captaine <hi>Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liandrando</hi> was wounded in the foote with a ſhot, which forced him to fall downe among the dead, and he preſently was ſtriken with a greater bullet, which tooke away the creaſt of his murrion, and if a ſouldiour had not by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> force drawne him from thence, he had in like ſort ended there his life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others. They alſo ſlew a Sergeant of Captaine <hi>Peter de Auila,</hi> named <hi>Ferrant Botto,</hi> who in the abſence of the right <hi>Alferus,</hi> that day bare the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which alreadie he had fixed on the top of the Turks Fort, and a Turke cauſing him to fall with a harquebuze ſhot, and minding to pull it out of his hands, he neuer could doe it, vntill aſſiſted by others, he cut off his head, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp by that meanes his Enſigne all tainted with his blood, ſprinkled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Colours which were azure and ſables. They alſo within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſlew the <hi>Alferus</hi> of Captaine <hi>Aldene,</hi> and wounded thoſe of Captaine <hi>Diego Velez,</hi> and <hi>Mendoze,</hi> out of whoſe hands they violently pluckt away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> their Enſignes. The which thoſe ſeeing who were had out of the throng, the wounded were forced to retire themſelues, and after their retraict, the Turks ſallied forth and cut off the heads of <hi>Aldene</hi> and <hi>Antonie,</hi> and of certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom they thought to be of the principalleſt, either for that they ſaw them valiantly to fight, or elſe, in that they were better ſet forth in armes and abiliments then the other. And ſeeing they had wonne 4. of our Enſignes, they became by this victorie ſo peremptorie and proude, that they aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to come forth of the breach to fight with our people, and ſo ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to chaſe them from their walles and Ditches, with ſuch a ſlaughter, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> was incredible, and ſtill they carefully kept their rankes. Whileſt <hi>Ferdinands</hi> people were thus miſerably beaten, and the Turkes ſo couragiouſly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their aſſaults, <hi>Castalde</hi> aduiſed and reſolued that this night Lippa ſhould be taken, how deare ſoeuer it coſt him, in reſpect to auoyd the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill which might afterward enſue, vpon the comming of the Belerbey, who
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21983:83"/>
was ſaid to be on his way to relieue <hi>Oliman.</hi> Vpon which aduertiſement, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the Captaines into his preſence and the Friers, reprouing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and incouraging them to renue the aſſault; with ſuch words thus deliuered, he put courage againe into them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If euer the memorie of high exploytes and glorious acts of any whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, hath had the force to moue the hearts and courages of men, and to prick <note place="margin">Caſtalde his oration to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the ſouldiours to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault at Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa.</note> them forward to a like commendable deſire; it is euen this day, and that by a more vehementer reaſon (my ſouldiours) by the vile &amp; infamous retraict, that againſt all expectation, you haue vntimely ſhewen, which ought now to haue power and commaund ouer your. For which I ſee you, with an vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for loſſe, ſo much diſcouraged, that hardly (containing my heart from breaking) can I with patience endure to behold you. And although that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cannot alwaies haue in our power our owne deſires and fortune vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet ought wee not for all that to ſuffer, that that courage which in vs ſhould be inuincible, ſhould remaine ſuppreſſed by this fortune, for any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie whatſoeuer. Truly whoſoeuer now ſhould ſee theſe ſhamefull things in you (who alwaies heretofore haue been victorious, as if to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh were to you peculiar) I know not what they ſhould cenſure, but that, conſidering your former victories, they might imagine that you haue rather wonne them by ominous fortune, then by your owne proper vertue; ſince that by ſo great diſhonour you haue ſuffered your ſelues to be ſhamefully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, and in the middeſt and furie of the fight, like women and children <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be beaten away by the Turks. You may well thereby thinke that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of your precedent feates of armes, which (vntill now) appeared to the world by your great triumphs, is now darkened and obſcured by this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious repulſe, with which incouraging theſe enemies, whom ſo often you haue ouerthrowne and ſubdued, you are the only cauſe that in time to come they will not any more feare you, ſeeing your courage, your force, and agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is decayed. It ſeemeth to me a wonder and a great infamie, that the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious dreadeth the vanquiſhed. And beleeue me (ſouldiours) there is not in the world a greater ruine and confuſion, then when an armie debaſing it ſelfe, by giuing courage to his enemie, leaueth it ſelfe ouercome by puſalini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For then, in what diſaduantage ſoeuer, it muſt diſſolue and diſperſe it ſelfe, for that it often happeneth in warres, the valour and reſolution of the minde, profiteth more then that of the bodie. If this day, and during theſe aſſaults, you duly conſider of the honor and end of this warre, you will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſee it a ſufficient motiue to incite you to recouer your firſt loſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe, and conceiue that ſubtiltie and wiſedome nothing auaileth, where is an apparant defect of courage and valour. Therefore preſent neceſſitie doth vrge and conſtraine you this day, to ſhew your ſelues valiant and vertuous ſouldiours, for that you ſhall not now fight for a toy of nothing, but for life it ſelfe, for the countries good wherein you were nouriſhed and brought vp, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for your wiues and children, for your ſiſters and kindred, and finally for all diuine and humane things, and for your goods: which if you remaine vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, they remaine yours as they haue been before; and on the contrarie, they muſt bee a ſpoyle for the enemie if you will loſe your ſelues. You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21983:84"/>
know how the Belerbey of Greece, and Baſha <hi>Achmeth</hi> are on the way with an huge number of horſe and foote to relieue Lippa; If they ſhuld <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> arriue, and wee not haue taken the towne, what might then become of vs? Therefore if you deſire (as it is moſt requiſite you ſhould doe) to auoid theſe imminent dangers with an honourable victorie, to increaſe your reputation, and not to interre or obſcure it; valiantly endeuour your ſelues to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and fight with an aſſured and manly courage, ſtill bearding and facing the enemie: for thoſe who are deſirous of victorie, doe neuer turne their backes. And doe you thinke, that ſeeking the ſafetie of your liues, to finde it by flying? No, no, you haue alreadie ſeene by experience the contrarie, that more haue been ſlaine by flight, then fight. Aſſure your ſelues then, that if you doe not with your beſt abilities, endeuour your ſelues to ouercome, you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> will neither finde place, mountaine, nor forreſt which can preſerue you in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie, but all things ſhall be contrarie and aduerſe to you, and in the end you ſhall leaue as a pray to your enemies, thoſe things which you moſt dearely eſteeme of: which neuertheleſſe by meanes of victorie, winning this towne, you may preſerue; and there is no doubt but the enemies wil be faint-harted and begin to humble themſelues, and in their retiring they will giue you ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meanes to recouer that, which hath been loſt and poſſeſſed by euill hap; and to purchaſe with a glorious name (fruſtrating them from al hope euer to bee maſters of you againe) this libertie, this quiet repoſe, and this happie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> peace which you ſo much deſire and long for, vnchaining your ſelues from the perpetuall ſeruitude, in which for preſent example, you may to your griefes beholde your neighbours. For there is not any thing that doth more aſtoniſh and terrifie an enemy, then a ſudden onſet and gallant charge; nor nothing which doth more animate a friend, then to recouer a deſpairing victorie, as this day may happen to you, if you will. Returne then (my ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours) to the aſſault, with a prefixed deſire to carie the victorie from thence, and not to flie at any hand, and rather aduenture to die honourably for it, then in loſing, to ſuruiue with ſhame; conſidering that to die is common to all, but to die with reputation is bequeathed but to few. And I aſſure my ſelfe, that if you more reſpect that which I haue ſaid vnto you, then the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> offers which I haue made you, you ſhall within few houres remaine vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to your great glorie, and to the exceſſiue loſſe of our enemies, and you ſhall in the end ſee that no corporall force can euer ſurmount the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which this day will make both you and me to be eternall.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſaid, hauing firſt reenforced the batterie with more Artillerie, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cauſed an alarme in the whole Campe. At the bruite whereof, they all in good order went to the wall with ladders and other engines to mount vpon it, and to obtaine the breach, which now was ſomewhat inlarged, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironing the towne with more then 40000. men. There was within it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> for the defence of the breach 3000. Turkes, and 100. Ianiſaries, and in all with the people of <hi>Oliman,</hi> there was ſome 5000. men appointed in places conuenient. Thus they began cruelly to fight as well within as without, and very fiercely with ſo great cryes of thoſe barbarous nations, and ſuch a thunder of our Artillerie, ſounding of Drummes and Trumpets, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21983:84"/>
the world would preſently haue ended. And the great diſorder which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was committed in many places of the aſſault, being reported to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> he preſently cauſed all the men of armes and Caualarie to march with him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing both the one and the other where they ſhould attend with their ſquadrons, conſidering that there was leſſe perill and daunger in ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then to cauſe his men to retire, vpon whoſe retraict he iudged greater inconuenience would enſue. And approaching nigh the breach, he ſaw that <hi>Oliman</hi> had appointed 600. horſe in a place by, and very neere to them, well foreſeeing the end which would betide him, who had appointed them there not onely to ſuccour the breach, but with a reſolute purpoſe alſo to ſaue himſelfe with them, ſeeing alreadie he could not any longer reſiſt, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our men from entering by force into the towne, perceiuing that he was forſaken of the ſuccours which hee expected from Buda: and with thoſe horſe, for the ſame reſpect, he had mixed certaine bands of Ianiſaries. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> perceiuing this, and the more to expell <hi>Oliman</hi> from all hope of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie &amp; ſuccours, he ſent <hi>Iohn Turky</hi> with 4000. horſe, and <hi>Charles Scheretin</hi> with his 400. men of armes to poſſeſſe the other ſide of the riuer Maroſſe, by which paſſage might come the ayde which he expected from the Baſha of Buda and the Belerbey, and by which place alſo he might haue ſome hope to ſaue himſelfe. And thus ioyntly with the Frier (who that day performed the acts of an expert and valiant Captaine) he prouided for all things which <note place="margin">George a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captain.</note> were neceſſarie, now riding on this ſide, then on the other, as one that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vnderſtood the proceedings of martiall affaires, who failed not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of all accidents which might befall him in any reſpect whatſoeuer, thinking on fit meanes to remedie the ſame. On the other ſide <hi>Oliman</hi> loſt no time, but animating his people, he effected that the beſieged fighting couragiouſly, endured a very ſore aſſault, which was for foure houres ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bloodie on both ſides, in which the Turkes did not any thing yeeld to our people. Certaine Captaines of thoſe who were the firſt that mounted vp the breach with <hi>Iulian de Carleual,</hi> ſeeing the Turkes ſo brauely defended themſelues, and that it was now growing late, and not minding to ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they had alreadie loſt, to be caſt away, aduertiſed <hi>Caſtalde</hi> that their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> aduice was to ſound a retraict, ſeeing the fight had ſo long time endured, and that therein the Turkes had made a great ſlaughter of our people. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi> returned them preſent anſwer, that they ſhould firmely maintaine the fight, and that they ſhould remember, that the aſſault which in former time they had giuen to Dure, had in like ſort continued foure houres; and that by any meanes howſoeuer, they ſhould not faile but that the towne might bee taken that night: and if they entered not that night, (beſides the loſſe of their reputation, which is a thing of ſpeciall importance in feates of warre) they ſhould put themſelues in daunger, to leaue there that glorie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with loſſe of their liues; which (in reſiſting) would aſſuredly ſhroud them from ſuch ſiniſter accidents: and that further he plainly ſaw, how the retraict would be farre more dangerous, then the entering.</p>
            <p>At this time Frier <hi>George</hi> (couered then with a greene caſſocke, by which he hid his habit, for feare of being knowne by the enemies) and Counte
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21983:85"/>
               <hi>Thomas Nadaſdy</hi> came together to the aſſault, and to the quarter where the Germanes and Spaniards were mingled with other nations, who animating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> them, ſaid, that they ſhould couragiouſly force themſelues to enter into the towne, to reuenge the blood of their friends, who yet freſh before their eyes had been cruelly ſlaine and wounded, and in many places pitifully ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by the Turkes. Whileſt theſe two on the one ſide animated the ſouldiours, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> on the other ſide perceiued that the Caualarie, which <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> had ordered in a ſquadron by the breach, began to recoyle and retire backe, which was a likelihood they could not any longer reſiſt, and that they ſhould be either forced to flie, or preſently to yeeld. He taking hold of this oportunitie, commaunded preſently that the 200. men of armes of <hi>Oureſtolf</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſhould diſmount from their horſes, and that one part of them taking the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and Cutlace, and the other the Pike, ſhould force the breach. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo before appointed, that all the ſtraglers of the Campe, only armed with the Hatchet, <hi>a la Hungreſque,</hi> ſhould goe to that hill which commaunded the towne, in forme of a Caualier, and that there with ſome brauing ſhew, they ſhould make a view and front of ſouldiours, whereby the Turkes ſeeing them, they would iudge them to be ſouldiours indeede, who came to aſſaile that part of the wall which was oppoſite to them: theſe people made a ſhew of an infinit number of men. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> then preſently ſent to the Captaine that commaunded them, that inſtantly when hee ſhould ſee the aſſault re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, that then he ſhould deſcend from the hill with all his people, and with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the cries and ſhrikings, vſuall to that nation, he ſhould directly march to the wall of the towne, to giue (although not effectuall) yet at the leaſt, in ſhew, a feare of a cruell aſſault. That done, he went where he had cauſed thoſe men of armes to diſmount themſelues, who were readie to goe to the breach, and ſaid to them, enter, enter my companions, the houre is now come which will make vs, together with this victorie, very glorious. Theſe ſpeeches ſo kindled the heart and courage of euery man, that the Turkes, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected our men would haue retired, ſeeing them come with greater courage to the breach then before, and alſo perceiuing the others, who at the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> inſtant with great cries deſcended from the hill directly towards them, they began ſo faintly to abate their courage, that preſently loſing all heart and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they ſuffered our people to enter into the towne, ſome at the breach, and others in other places, with a great throng and preſſe of our Vauntgard, which then was conducted by the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce Palauicin,</hi> who at the <note place="margin">Sforce Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicin.</note> ſame time alſo behaued himſelfe valiantly in the fight, as in all other his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actions he had done, diſcharging the Artillerie ſo effectually againſt the towne, that it was an incredible thing. Captaine <hi>Iohn Viglioa</hi> was the firſt that mounted vpon the wall, and preſently he was ſeconded by <hi>Francis de Salcede</hi> who bore his Colours, and who was onely remaining, all the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away at the firſt aſſault by the Turkes. <hi>Carleual</hi> was alſo one of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> firſt vpon the breach, and in like ſort entered many of the Hungars, and other <note place="margin">Lippa taken by aſſault of Caſtalde.</note> ſouldiours who were the firſt that aduanced themſelues at the breach, vpon which was ſeene more then 1200. dead Turkes. All the Ianiſaries, who were the laſt that ſhronke or retired, and the other who remained aliue with <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:21983:85"/>
began with ſuch feare and ſo tumultuouſly to flie to the Caſtle, that it was a marueilous thing to ſee thoſe men ſo vilely forſake and diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that had before ſo gallantly defended their liues, by the ſpace of more then fiue houres. <hi>Ferdinands</hi> people being entered into the towne, they found not any Turke who durſt lift vp his ſword againſt them, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelues to be beaten downe like beaſts: and the noyſe was ſo great both within and without, that nothing elſe was heard but grieuous ſighings and groanes of thoſe who gaue vp the ghoſt, and ſuch a confuſed medly of others, who not finding any to incounter withall, &amp; crying <hi>victoria, victoria,</hi> kill, kill, did runne vp and downe through all Lippa like mad men, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſacked the towne. The Turkes who were on horſebacke thinking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to ſaue themſelues, forſooke the towne, and they fell into the ambuſcado of thoſe horſes, which (as we haue aforeſaid) were for that purpoſe ſent by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi> to guard the riuer, and there by theſe horſemen they were miſerably diſordered, and the greateſt part of them ſlaine. The remainder willing to auoyde this bloodie perill, fell into another the like or more great, and for one death receiued two; becauſe, that venturing into the riuer to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by ſwimming to the otherſide, the Hungarians, Germanes, and Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians ſetting themſelues againſt them, pearced both them and their horſes with their Launces on euery ſide, inſomuch that he who died not by dint of the ſword, was forced pitifully to end his life in the water and to drowne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> himſelfe, a long time ſtayning the water with their blood. The other ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their companions thus badly intreated, and returning vpon the ſpurre to the towne, with hope to ſaue themſelues in the Caſtle, were by our men in all parts ſo cut off and ſlaine, that not a man could ſaue himſelfe. <hi>Oliman</hi> (who alſo had forſaken the towne with a good troupe of horſe, with intent to ſaue himſelfe) ſeeing what was done to others, tooke for the laſt refuge, which fortune that day alotted to him to ſaue his life, (wherein moſt of his people loſt their liues) a reſolution to ſaue himſelfe in the Caſtle. Flying thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a pace, he found there a great throng of his people, that as yet remained ſafe from this furious and bloodie tempeſt, who for the great preaſe to ſaue themſelues from ſlaughter, endeuoured to enter in, many falling from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> railes of the bridge into the Ditch ſorely bruſed and cruſht in peeces, and by this time there was more then fiftie horſe and men ouerthrowne therein, who with their maſters there periſhed. <hi>Oliman</hi> being alſo arriued at that time, mixt himſelfe with this throng, although he often ſaw himſelfe almoſt troden downe by this multitude, and entered into the Caſtle vpon the bridge, whereon there was alſo ſome of our people mingled among them: and if then they had bin well aduiſed to haue throughly charged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on that ſide, they might eaſily that day (which was the 6. of Nouember) haue taken the Caſtle, and <hi>Oliman</hi> had neuer been ſaued.

occaſion to bee incenſed againſt this countrie, onely contenting themſelues with this that they had alreadie done againſt him, in taking this towne by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> force, and hauing killed therein ſo many valiant ſouldiours of his, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Belerbey to retire with ſhame: and on the contrarie, it was now more expedient to ſweeten and temper his crueltie by milde courſes; to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which, he thought it good to let all thoſe freely and in ſafetie paſſe, who were retired into that little Caſtle. <hi>Castalde</hi> replying, ſaid vnto him, that by no meanes he would ſuffer ſuch a ſtearne enemie as <hi>Oliman</hi> was to ſcape, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they now had him in their hands, and that none but God ſhould free him thence: and that vſing ſuch rigour and ſeueritie in his proceedings, he ſhould begin to abate the pride and boldnes of the Turk, and by no meanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> he would ſuffer ſuch fauourable occaſions to ſlip away, which of a long time they found not ſo happy and fortunate to them as now; and that they ſhould not haue (it might bee) in time to come ſo proſperous ſucceſſe, as this which was now offered by this good occaſion. The Frier neuertheleſſe ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting him, and maintaining that it was needfull to ſaue <hi>Oliman,</hi> and the end at which he aymed being manifeſt to all the Campe, as that alſo which the Slauonian had confeſſed (who a little before was taken) he was in the end forced to diſcouer his wicked intent, and plainly to tell <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that for no mans pleaſure hee would not become enemie to the Turke, but that hee meant to ſet <hi>Oliman</hi> at libertie, and permit him freely to depart with his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> armes, horſe, and all his people who were with him, and that if this could not be done, he muſt be forced to defend him againſt any who would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> anſwered him, that ſince he had determined to doe ſo, this was his aduice, that before hee would conclude any other thing, hee would cauſe all the principall Lords and Captaines of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> armie, and them of Tranſiluania, to bee called together in a publike aſſemblie, to the end that euery one might ſpeake his opinion thereof, and that by this meanes they ſhould haue no occaſion to complaine, that they were depriued of that honour and profit, which they had dearly purchaſed with their owne blood and with extreame paine, without giuing them to vnderſtand ſome good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> matter therefore, and that they ſhould not haue any occaſion to complaine of them two. The Frier liked very well of this motion, aſſuring himſelfe that none neither would nor durſt contradict his will. And thus being in his Tent, accompanied with <hi>Caſtalde, Andrew Battor, Thomas Nadaſdy</hi> (who not long before was made Palatine of Hungarie) <hi>Perein Peter, Iohn Turky,</hi> the Marqueſſe of Balaſſe, and other Lords and Captaines, as well Hungarians and Bohemians, as Spanyards and Germanes, and with them all the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of townes and prouinces of the kingdome, Frier <hi>George</hi> in the preſence of them all began thus to ſpeake in Latin:</p>
            <p>
               <q>My louing Lords and friends, I perſwade my ſelfe you are not ignorant, <note place="margin">Frier George his oration.</note> how much the force and terrour of the Grand Seigniour is to be redoubted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and Feared, in reſpect of his imperiall rule and command, which I know hath been by experience too ſoone proued by you, to your vnſpeakeable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the ruinating of your townes, and death of your deare friends and kindred: and in like manner you know of the enormious cruelties, which at
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21983:87"/>
his pleaſure and in his furie he knoweth iuſtly or iniuſtly to vſe againſt men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and women, ſparing neither children nor virgins, vſing fire and ſword not onely againſt you, but alſo againſt your Temples, houſes, and laſtly the very trees, plants, and beaſts themſelues, are not any thing warranted from the furie of his barbarous ire. For this cauſe I eſteeme it to be more then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that wee wilfully draw not more hatefull indignation vpon our ſelues, then that which alreadie his people naturally are poſſeſt withall againſt our Religion, and former iniuries: but on the contrarie, that wee endeuour our ſelues by all meanes and manners to appeaſe him, and to make him mild and mercifull, that in time to come, he contenting himſelfe with the accuſtomed tribute, he may ſuffer vs to liue in peace, &amp; quietly poſſeſſe our goods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dread of warre. To accompliſh which, I am of this minde to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy therein this <hi>Oliman Bech,</hi> now ſtraightned by you in this Caſtle of Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, to whom and to his people giuing libertie ſafely to depart, ſhall recite to the Grand Seigniour our good and friendly intention, who, in reſpect of ſo friendly a deliuerance, will rake vp in obliuion the reuenge, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would violently vſe againſt vs, for the wrongs which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by vs in this warre, and no doubt he will let vs poſſeſſe this tranquiltie and peace, which is ſo vehemently deſired of euery one. Therefore I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire you, that well conſidering of my words, you would follow my counſell, and imbrace this my good intention, which is ſincerely ſpoken for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the publike good, and that you would not through any ambition ſeeke to put <hi>Oliman</hi> and his people to death, or retaine them priſoners: becauſe that when you haue put them all to the ſword, yet can you not cleere your ſelues neither of hate nor further trauaile, conſidering that the Grand Seigniour hath no want of other men and forces, hauing fifteene miles from hence more then 40000. men, readie to reuenge their deaths; and as I am certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed by a friend, (which euen at this time is come to me from their Campe) that the Belerbey and Baſha of Buda, will within a ſhort time come to aſſaile vs: which if it proueth to be ſo, what then ſhall become of vs? what hope of kindnes can we expect, hauing not vſed any curteſie towards their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> people? Therefore we iudge it better for vs not to bee found beſieging of them, knowing this, that beſides all kinde of horrible and cruell death, they will reuenge vpon our heads, and deare friends, their mens blood which we haue ſhed. We may auoyde and ſuppreſſe theſe cruelties, by our clemencie and milde proceedings, and may thereby make him of an enemie, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gentle, tractable, and gratious, there being not in this world any glorie more extolled and recommended then that, which is gotten in hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of an enemie, who feeleth himſelfe reduced to the extreamitie of his honour and life; neither is there any magnanimitie more illuſtrious, then to pardon thoſe, whoſe liues are in the victors power to diſpoſe of. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            </p>
            <p>At theſe ſpeeches of the Frier, <hi>Gaſtalde</hi> (as the chiefe and principall man among them) made this effectuall replie: <q>It was not needfull that you (moſt <note place="margin">Caſtalde his reply,</note> reuerend Sir) ſhould haue ſent (not few moneths ſince) to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. to promiſe him vpon your faith, that you would alwaies be as well fauourable to the Chriſtians, as on the other ſide a cruell and mortall
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21983:88"/>
enemie to the Turkes: neither was it in like ſort neceſſarie, that you ſhould deſire <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the Romanes to ſend you ſuccours, and deliuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this kingdome of Tranſiluania, from the tyrannicall oppreſſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemie, if you would haue vſed theſe courſes, which now with a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reputation I ſee you practiſe. And although that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did not any thing doubt of your inconſtancie, hauing before too truly had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof: yet neuertheleſſe not taking regard to this your ſudden alteration, he was willing to aſſemble this armie together, and againſt the opinion &amp; counſell of many to ſend it to your ayd. And this force hath been ſuch, that not onely it hath holpen this kingdome, and you your ſelues from the tyrannie of Infidels; but alſo it hath recouered a great part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> which by force and treacherie was vſurped by them. Now what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion moueth you, being victorious, and hauing put your enemies to flight, wittingly to bring your ſelues into thraldome, and with ſhame procure that wee, and all you the reſt, ſhould bee ſubiect to thoſe which wee now detaine priſoners, and are conſtrained to yeeld themſelues to our diſcretion, and to intreate vs, that we ſhould recommend our ſelues to him who is the capitall enemie, not onely of our libertie, but alſo of our holy and inuiolable faith: and to manifeſt ſo great cowardlines by fearefull words to thoſe, who to our great glorie (manifeſting our couragious hearts) we haue ouercome and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and eſpecially at this time, who as it were quite caſt away, betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to ſuch infamous compoſitions, that they ſhew themſelues vnworthie of life, as aſſuredly they would eſteeme of you, if you had bin vanquiſhed by them, manifeſting thereby, that they are not worthie to be heard of ſo noble and honourable perſonages as theſe Lords here preſent, and all theſe nations which are about vs, who not long ſince for their countrie, honour, life, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and freedome from ſo horrible captiuitie, haue ſhed ſo much blood, that Maroſſe ranne coloured of another hew? What ſhould auaile this famous reputation, which with ſo many trauailes, ſo many hazards, and with the death of ſo many valiant perſons hath been atchieued, if now by a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſition you would let it be loſt? Doe you not ſee that in yeelding to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thoſe who are you priſoners, you will wholly loſe your boldnes hereafter to dare the enemie to the fight, neither ſhall you bee able at any time to make warre vpon them, for that they will alwaies preſume to hold you in ſo great ſubiection and little eſteeme, that tenne of them will not feare to aſſaile an hundred of you, in which you will the rather aſſure them, in reſpect of your fearfulnes; and ſo the concluſion will be, that of vanquiſhers, you are like to become vanquiſhed. I would gladly know what doth incite and incourage ſouldiours, if it be not glorie and reputation, and to gaine therewith by their trauaile and induſtrie, honour, renowne, and recompence? And now, that with great admiration you haue atchieued it, and brought to happie end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> this warre, would you with your great ſhame and loſſe, leaue to the enemie this triumphant victorie and reputed fame, which in euery place will raiſe you vp to the heape of all honour and praiſe? What will the Chriſtians mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among themſelues, if not, but that you haue been fearefull to ſee the Turkes in your power, and that you rather haue fled away, then had the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21983:88"/>
courage to detaine them priſoners? Doe you not thinke, you Hungarians, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Saxons, and Sicilians, that the palme of victorie ſhall be giuen to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards, Germanes, and Bohemians, and that in ſtead hereof you ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of infamie, ſuffering ſo ſhamefully the enemie to depart, and to haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of ſo cowardly a compoſition which they demaund of you, cleerely thereby manifeſting to euery one, the feare which you conceiue of him? Alas (my Lords) remember your fathers, children, brothers, and kindred, who haue been miſerably ſlaine, or faſtned in chaines by theſe Turkes, and thinke vpon your wiues, which not without your great diſhonor, haue been violently carried away and rauiſhed by thoſe, whom you now hold in your ſeruitude: and if for the premiſed cauſes you will not vſe to them the rigour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of iuſtice, eitherin killing, or detaining them priſoners, as at this preſent they hold your children, brothers, and friends; yet at the leaſt make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that their liues, liberties, their armes, horſes, and Enſignes are at your mercie and diſpoſe, which if you will needes graunt them theſe things, yet let them acknowledge by ſpeciall grace and fauour to haue receiued them of you, and not by a forced conſtraint, or by ſome certaine feare. And neuer reſpect any falſe or fained aduertiſements, nor threats which are bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Baſhaes and Belerbeys comming, for that he flying, hath alreadie paſſed Danubius with all his armie: and though he ſhould returne againe, you ſhall manifeſtly ſee that our ſouldiours, taſting of the happie former ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> will be more diſpoſed to fight with him, then we expect for; inſomuch that both in the one and in the other, we may frankly promiſe our ſelues cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine victorie; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe that courage is wanting in him (in regard of the diſcomfortures which he hath receiued) and will be increaſed in vs, by reaſon of the victories which wee happely and valiantly haue performed and atchieued againſt them.</q>

            <p>Vpon this declaration, all thoſe of the Councell began to looke vpon Frier <hi>George,</hi> and to chaunge their opinions, ſeeing it was an infamous and foule fault, to let <hi>Oliman</hi> eſcape vnpuniſhed for his wickedneſſes and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the Frier earneſtly importuned. And the concluſion was, that by no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> meanes he ſhould haue any libertie, but that they would ſo diſpoſe of him, as he would doe of them, if they were in the like tearmes. Frier <hi>George</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that neither in priuate nor publike hee could performe that which hee greatly deſired, and that his reaſons were not allowed of, preſently ſaid in great choler to <hi>Caſtalde;</hi> that although he would not graunt it, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in conſideration of the publike good and tranquilitie of Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania, he meant to ſaue <hi>Oliman.

Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Councell was riſen, the Frier diſpatched a meſſenger to <hi>Oliman,</hi>

them ſafe conduct to come foorth and depart with their armes, horſes, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and baggage, accommodating them of waggons to carrie the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> And that they might march with more ſafetie, he demaunded that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi> would giue them ſome other ſafe conduct, wherby that <hi>Oliman</hi> ſhould not in any ſort bee diſturbed by theſe nations which he commaunded.

In the end the Frier preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo farre, that he was forced to promiſe for all thoſe who were in <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinands</hi>

            <p>At the ſame inſtant that <hi>Oliman</hi> departed forth of Lippa, the Marqueſſe of Balaſſe ſecretly went out of the Campe with his 200. horſe, not acquainting any perſon therewith. With him alſo ioyned 2000. horſe more, who ſtole forth of the armie, for the deſire which they had to maſſacre theſe Turkes, becauſe that they did not a little complaine for the agreement which the Frier had made, in ſuffering them ſo ſafely to depart, and warranting them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> from the furie of theſe nations, who had receiued by them cruell burnings, irrecouerable loſſes, and infinit inconueniences. For the ſame exploite alſo went out of Themeſuar 200. other horſe, with whom was <hi>Alphonſe Perez de Saianedra,</hi> who ioyned himſelfe with the Marqueſſe. They being all in this manner aſſembled, and ſwiftly riding on, ouertooke <hi>Oliman</hi> in a plaine field, where was neither tree nor buſh which hindered them from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. When he perceiued our men, he began to march more cloſely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the moſt part of his people being on foote, hauing in the middeſt of his ſquadron foure or fiue waggons, about which with the wounded he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced 35.

The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> (the better to ſet vpon him) preſently ordered his people, and when he perceiued himſelfe to draw neere <hi>Olimans</hi> ſquardron, he by good ſpeech prouoked his owne people, placing himſelfe in the fore ranke, thinking at this firſt ſhocke to force the Turkes, who not to ſpend their ſhot in vaine, made no great haſte to diſcharge their Harquebuzes, but ſo effectually they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21983:89"/>
ſhot, that at the firſt vollie the Marqueſſe was wounded, and his horſe ſlaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſo that he fell to the ground. His followers ſeeing him fall, fearing the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would runne ouer him, opened and diuided themſelues in that manner, that of one ſtrong ſquadron, they made two weake ones, and running with more furie then diſcretion againſt <hi>Oliman,</hi> not being able to reunite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againe, the one bare in vpon the Vauntgard of the Turkes, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the Rereward, leauing the battaile of <hi>Oliman</hi> ſecure, and not any thing broken. The Turkes taking courage of this their vnlooked for aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ſeeing <hi>Oliman</hi> fought ſo gallantly, carefully endeuoured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtill to march cloſe together, and all the way they fought ſo brauely, that our men neuer durſt returne to aſſaile them, but quietly ſuffered them to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> depart to the place where the Belerbey expected them.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Oliman</hi> was thus departed from Lippa, they began from the <note place="margin">The meanes that Caſtalde vſed to intrap George.</note> next day after to permit thoſe who were ſent from the kingdome, to returne againe, and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> alſo demaunded of the Frier, that thoſe who were of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> pay ſhould be lodged in Tranſiluania. But the Frier would not that any of theſe nations ſhould enter into thoſe countries, but that rather they ſhould be lodged in the Countie of Varadin, excuſing himſelfe by the charges which alreadie that kingdome had been at, and that in biliting his ſouldiours within that countrie, (it being now peaceable and quiet) would bee a beginning to ruinate and ſpoyle it, he thinking it farre better that they ſhould be in garriſon in places of his Biſhopricke, where (in his iudgement) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they ſhould liue more commodiouſly and profitably, it being a plentifull countrie, and neighbouring vpon the frontiers of the enemie, rather then to place them in Tranſiluania, where <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had not ſo much to doe, as in the foreſaid places. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſeeing this ſpeech did greatly diſcouer him, and being needfull for him to manage theſe affayres with more policie, then before he had done, ſaid to the Frier, that he thought it good and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that they ſhould ſend backe the Artillerie into the kingdome, from whence it was brought, and that with ſo good a guard, as belonged to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch moment. The Frier was well content therewith, but with this condition, that there ſhould bee no more then one hundred Germanes to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conduct it: which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> agreed vnto, and preſently ſent word to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that they ſhould cauſe the Artillerie to march, before the Frier knew thereof, and that therewith ſhould goe fiue Enſignes of Germanes, hauing charge to put one part within Albe-iula, and the other in neighbouring pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by. And in the meane time, he with his beſt skill declared to Frier <hi>George,</hi> that it was very neceſſarie to leade the ſouldiours into the kingdome, not ſo much for the aſſurance thereof, as to recreate them, in recompence of their trauailes which they had endured, and for their exceeding valour which they had manifeſted at the aſſaults of Lippa, as he himſelfe had ſeene: and alſo to the end that they ſhould ſhew them ſome ſigne that they had good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> regard of them, and were alſo mindfull of them. The Frier at theſe ſpeeches was content to yeeld thereto, perſwading himſelfe, that they being ſo ſmall a number, they ſhould not bee able to diſturbe that which he had ſecretly plotted in his minde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:21983:90"/>
Whileſt the Artillerie was thus on the way, the Frier and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> began to giue directions for the affayres of Lippa, cauſing the dead bodies of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Turks to be conuaied away, which were thickly ſpread in the towne ſtreetes, within the Ditches, and at the breaches, and ſpecially at the Caſtle, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the walles ſhould bee repayred the beſt they could. And becauſe in this towne were many perſons, who willingly, or by compulſion of the Turkes, had taken armes for their defence againſt <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Campe, the Frier depriued them all of their goods, and beſtowed them in recompence vpon many his Captaines and ſouldiours. Among which was in like ſort beſtowed the goods of a certaine Marchant, who was ſlaine at the taking of Lippa, a man of good ſufficient wealth, and one who had a wife, who beſides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> her beautie and youth, was alſo vertuous and of good reputation, as any was <note place="margin">A vertuous wife.</note> in that countrie. This woman ſeeing ſhe had loſt, by the ſacke and ſpoyle of the towne, her whole ſubſtance, and that nothing was left her, but her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell which ſhe then did weare, and that alſo they had taken all her poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from her, and that the Frier had diſtributed them betweene two of his Hungarian Captaines, who vnkindly had expulſed her out of her owne houſe; ſeeing her ſelfe very poore and beggerly, and not knowing what courſe to take, was counſelled to make her complaint to <hi>Caſtalde.</hi> Vpon this ſhe went, and being come to his Tent, and preſſing to goe in and ſpeake with him, was ſtayed and enquired by the Guard what her buſines was. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that ſhe would no other thing, but ſpeake with the Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The Guard ſeeing her very faire and ſeemely both of face and bodie, thought that ſhe came for no other thing but to make ſhew of her beautie, and ſale of her honeſtie, and the rather, conſidering the ſeaſon which was ſomewhat late, and approaching towards night: whereupon they ſuffered her not to waite any longer, but let her preſently goe in: who approaching the preſence of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> ſhe heauily explained the cauſe of her comming, humbly intreating that hee would not ſuffer that ſhee ſhould ſeeke her reliefe among charitable people: ſorrowfully telling him, that although her husband was found with an ill wil to be at the wall of Lippa againſt him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> he had alreadie payd dearely for it, euen the price of his life: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe being a woman, and a Chriſtian, ſhe could not in any ſort be found culpable thereof, neither beare the offences of another, being of her ſelfe cleerely innocent of that fault: and that therefore it would pleaſe his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie to haue reſpect vnto her condition and honour, and that he would not permit, that for the inriching of two, who had no neede of her goods, ſhe ſhould bee vtterly ſpoyled, and bee forced to paſſe the remnant of her mournefull daies in perpetuall miſerie, whereof he ſhould receiue but ſmall honour. She vttered theſe ſpeeches with ſo good a grace and ſeemely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, well fitting the ſubiect of her diſcourſe, that ſhe manifeſted to be no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> leſſe adorned with an inward vertue, then outwardly appeared in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and bodie. Vpon which her pitifull complaint, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> cauſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently theſe two Captaines to bee called for, to whom giuing as much and more of that which belonged to <hi>Ferdinands</hi> part, in recompence of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans goods, he commaunded them that inſtantly they ſhould reſtore al that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21983:90"/>
which they had of hers: which they willingly did, and one of the two, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> had offered her the greateſt wrong, within a while after tooke her to his wife, in reſpect of her ſingular beautie and vertue, which he ſaw that naturally ſhe was inriched with.</p>
            <p>In this time the Campe-maſter <hi>Aldene,</hi> required <hi>Caſtalde</hi> to beſtow the gouernment of Lippa vpon him, with ſuch conditions as he had in charge to <note place="margin">Lippa com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cuſtodie of Aldene a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Captain.</note> beſtow it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other: which was preſently granted him, &amp; left there, with his companie to gouerne it, &amp; he was commanded to fortifie it, and repayre the Caſtle, he recommending that place to him, as a thing of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to all the countrie, and eſpecially becauſe it was the only Bulwarke and Key of that kingdome, and therefore that for this cauſe he was to repayre it into ſuch ſtate, and as ſtrong as it was before, and that he ſhould giue order, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that the inhabitants who were fled from thence, ſhould returne thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and that he ſhould haue a ſpeciall care to vſe all his neighbours friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vſing the like to thoſe about the Caſtle of Solimos, within which he was to place his Enſigne, vntill the Caſtle of Lippa was well repayred and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and leauing him good prouiſion of victuals, yea ſuch as by it he might maintaine himſelfe for many moneths: <hi>Caſtalde</hi> on the other ſide to prouide for Themeſuar, ſent thither <hi>Don Iaſper Caſtelluio,</hi> with his companie of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards, <note place="margin">Iaſper Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelluio Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Themeſuar.</note> raiſed of thoſe who at the aſſault of Lippa had loſt their Captaines, (as aboue is ſaid, whereof <hi>Ferdinand</hi> not long before had prouided him) and gaue him ſpeciall charge to fortifie this towne, and to take ſuch order <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that it might not want any thing, that might bee neceſſarie for any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Hauing ſufficiently prouided for theſe two townes, he lodged his whole armie within the precinct of Varadin: and hauing well accommodated them, he cauſed the Spaniſh and Germane companies to march on the one ſide of the riuer Maroſſe, and on the other ſide (not to giue the Frier any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition) he went himſelfe alone with him, onely but with 25. Harquebuziers on horſebacke for his guard, cauſing to march on the other ſide 2000. horſe, and 500. Harquebuziers, and in this manner they began to diſlodge, they both (for the more aſſurance and leſſe diſtruſt) like good friends riding in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> one Coach.</p>
            <p>Now the time approached wherein he thought to kill Frier <hi>George,</hi> and ſo <note place="margin">Ferdinand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuneth the death of Frier George.</note> much the rather, for that he was earneſtly ſolicited thereto by <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> who alſo at that time had ſent another meſſenger from Vienna, that he ſhould vſe expedition in this attempt, and bereaue him of life, and ſpecially becauſe he vnderſtood by <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> letters what he had done to and with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman.</hi> And to the end that the Frier ſhould not diſtruſt any thing vpon the comming of this new meſſenger, he told him that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the taking of Lippa, and that he gaue him infinite thankes for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he had there done him, whereof he would neuer bee vngratefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite his loyaltie, hoping by effect to ſatisfie and recompence him ſo, that during his life he ſhould thinke himſelfe well ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Whileſt by ſuch diſguiſed maskes he couered theſe his ſtratagems, <hi>Caſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Binſe where George was ſlaine.</note> in the end arriued with the Frier at Binſe, a Caſtle which was built by him
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21983:91"/>
in reſpect of the pleaſant ſituation of the place. There <hi>Caſtalde</hi> obſerued, that the occaſion he waited for and ſo greatly deſired, was now come, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> aſſuring himſelfe that it was alreadie performed. And although that many times he had an intent openly to maſſacre him in the plaine field as he trauailed through the kingdome, yet neuertheleſſe he thought it not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and that he might not put himſelfe nor his people inconſiderately vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fortunes pleaſure, he did defer this execution vntill the Frier was come to this Caſtle, which hee eſteemed the moſt fit and commodious place of any other to practiſe his death with the leaſt danger. After then that they were both lodged in this ſaid Caſtle, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſeeing the Spaniſh Infantrie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued not ſo ſoone as he deſired, (without which he could effect nothing to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the purpoſe) and ſpecially ſeeing the ſhort time the Frier would there abide, who thought to depart from thence within two daies: writ with great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by a truſtie meſſenger, to the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce Palauicin,</hi> and to all the other Spaniſh Captaines, that in what place ſoeuer they were, they ſhould preſently diſlodge with their ſouldiours, and without ſtaying in any place, repayre to Binſe. If the diligence of the meſſenger was great, that of the Captains was nothing inferiour, marching as farre in one day, as they could hardly haue done in two. This day <hi>Caſtalde</hi> behaued himſelfe very pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, finely entertaining the Frier with ſoothing and familiar diſcourſes, who dreamed not of any thing but of his departure to go to a Diet, which he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to bee aſſembled at Waſrael, in which he was determined to treate and conferre with thoſe of the countrie, concerning the meanes which ſhould bee vſed to expulſe <hi>Caſtalde</hi> and all his armie (which were in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> pay) out of the kingdome, and euen to the end (as might bee vehemently ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) to defeate and cut them in peeces, imagining that thereby he ſhould bee able to make himſelfe abſolute Lord of all thoſe countries. The Frier was lodged in his Caſtle, as he was vſually accuſtomed, as often as he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in like ſort <hi>Caſtalde.</hi> And in the towne by the Caſtle was lodged the Friers guard. And as they were there accomodated, the Spanyards arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſame night, whom the Frier commaunded ſhould be lodged in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> other towne, ſituated on the other ſide of the riuer, which runneth betweene theſe two townes, being not very broad nor deepe, but yet as cleere as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, it is called Sebeſſe, and a little beneath it caſteth his ſtreames into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſe. <note place="margin">The riuer Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe.</note> This riuer hath a bridge of wood, for the commoditie of the Caſtle, paſſing from one of the townes to the other. Theſe ſouldiours being thus lodged, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> required the Frier that he would appoint the place where the Germanes ſhould winter, which by no meanes he would reſolue vpon, not willing that any great companie of them ſhould lodge in one place, but diuided into houſes and villages, to wit, twentie in one place, fortie in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo conſequently according to the proportion and receit of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> place: to the end, that (as <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> Courtiers ſaid, and as afterward was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by them) euery towne taking his armes, might eaſily at the prefixed time kill all the ſouldiours they found therein; which was not concealed from <hi>Caſtalde</hi> by ſome who were about the Frier. But with great diſcretion he bore all patiently, diſſembling in his countenance that which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21983:91"/>
purpoſed, he employed al his care (as being greatly deſirous thereof) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to effect that execution, which many a moneth before he had reſolued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the generall good of them all, might come to good end; knowing that if this exploite did well ſucceede, all his people might be well and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly lodged ſecure from any ſecret treaſons. Hauing then vpon this point reſolutely determined in his heart, he cauſed to come to him the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>Sforce Palauicin,</hi> with whom he had expreſſe commaund from <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> to conferre about this deed, which he vntill then concealed from him, and reciting to him that which he was to doe, and ſhewing him the meanes that muſt be obſerued therein, he told him in his Maieſties name, that it was neceſſarie that he himſelf ſhould be an actor in a fact of ſo great importance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and ſpecially the time being now come, in which they were not to goe back, neither was it to bee omitted; and fortune alſo had offered the occaſion, which of a long time he expected, the Frier being in the Caſtle (forth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he would by no meanes that he ſhould come a liue) and he told him, that although he ſaw this enterpriſe exceeding difficult, (the end whereof could not well be iudged of) yet neuertheleſſe ought he not for the ſeruice of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> to refuſe it, it being more then neceſſary, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night following with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay it ſhould bee effected. The Marqueſſe readily offered his owne perſon, and all his power, yea and with ſuch a deſire as could be expected in ſuch a perſon, not contradicting any thing which was ſaid to him; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that he would appoint what he ſhould doe, and as for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which concerned his owne action, he would not in any thing faile of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his vttermoſt: whereupon taking ſpeciall care of this, he preſently departed, and went to prouide for that which was neceſſarie therefore. And then <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> vnder colour of aduiſing touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> placing of his ſouldiours in ſome garriſons, went to ſee the Frier, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he found readie to heare Maſſe, and ſuffering him to go quietly to his deuotions, ſtayed himſelfe in another roome by, to conferre with certaine there. There ſome of them that were preſent came &amp; told him, that the Prieſt being at the conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, forgetting to take the Hoſt, he tooke the Chalice and eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, <note place="margin">Preſages of George his death.</note> which was a preſage of the Friers death, and of the blood which hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhould ſhed on the ground. This ouerſight was well perceiued by euery one, but not by the Frier himſelfe, and none did diuine any thing thereby, but did rather attribute it to the negligence of the Prieſt, then as to a ſigne ſent from God. The Maſſe being ended, they withdrew themſelues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre together, and in the end not agreeing of places for garriſons, euery one withdrew himſelfe to his owne lodging: whereupon <hi>Caſtalde</hi> preſently ſent for Captaine <hi>Andrew Lopez,</hi> to whom he imparted, that this night of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie the Frier muſt be ſlaine, and that it was the Kings pleaſure it ſhould bee inſtantly performed; and that for the good regard that he had of his perſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he made ſpeciall choiſe of him, with Captaine <hi>Monin, Cheualier Campegge,</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21983:92"/>
there could not poſſible betide of it, but ſingular good: and although that there might bee daunger by meanes thereof, to ſee ſome alteration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Tranſiluanians, yet he hoped to prouide therefore a prompt and fit remedie: aſſuring him further, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would gratefully accept thereof; and inſtructing him how he ſhould carrie himſelfe therein, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him that out of all the Spaniſh companies, he ſhould onely make choiſe of 24. Harquebuziers, the moſt reſolute amongſt them, and leſſe knowne of the Friers men, and that at the opening of the Caſtle gate, he ſhould finde the meanes, as wiſely as he could, to bring them in, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once entered, they ſhould ſeize on foure towers, diuiding ſixe to euery one, and that there they ſhould keepe themſelues quiet, vntill they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> commaunded to performe that which they ſhould doe. On the other ſide, he called for Captaine <hi>Peter d' Auila,</hi> and commanded him that foure houres before the baggage was readie to march, he ſhould goe to the Port of Saſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe, to gather without ſound of Drumme or any noyſe, the ſouldiours who were within, and that afterwards vpon day breake, they ſhould preſent themſelues before the Caſtle gate of Binſe, with their Colours diſplayed and ranged in battaile, and that there they ſhould attend the charge which ſhould be giuen them: which was preſently done.</p>
            <p>Now the night being come, which was very clowdie and darke, during which the element would demonſtrate ſome ſigne of the Friers death. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in that night the windes were ſo horrible, and the tempeſt and raine ſo ſtrange, that in mans memorie the like was neuer ſeene. Nothing was heard but vnaccuſtomed ſounds in the ayre, clapping of doores and windowes through all the Caſtle, and that ſo terrifying, as though the world would preſently haue ended. In ſumme, as well in the ayre, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vallies, this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall tempeſt made ſuch rude hauock, as though all the Furies in hell had been there vnchained. The tempeſt being ceaſed, and day light appearing, which in reſpect of the diſtempered night paſt, ſeemed not very cleere, and that the Frier was then vpon his departure; that day the Aiduchs, who were of the guard of the Caſtle, opened the gate ſomewhat before the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> time, to let his waggons go forth. At the very inſtant Captaine <hi>Andrew Lopez</hi> performed to the full of all that which was commanded him, cauſing very ſlily thoſe 24. Harquebuziers to enter in, ſo that as well for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth of the waggons, as alſo for the deſire to diſlodge, not any tooke regard to them who entered in, they being all apparelled in Turkiſh habits in long and large gownes, which they had gotten at the taking of Lippa, and with theſe robes they couered their armes and harquebuzes. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus entered, <hi>Lopez</hi> diſpoſed of them in places conuenient where they ſhould keepe; and preſently after, he went from thence to the place where <hi>Castalde</hi> expected him, with the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce,</hi> who was the chiefe actor in the enterpriſe, and certainly knew the determined order which he ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> obſerue therein, hauing with him foure Italian gentlemen: one of them was named Captaine <hi>Monin,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Cheualier Campeggio,</hi> the third <hi>Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muccia,</hi> and the fourth was called <hi>Piacentino,</hi> men of an approued reſolution, and of as great confidence: &amp; to be ſhort, ſuch were theſe men, as in a whole
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21983:92"/>
world could not be found their like to effect ſuch an attempt. Beſides theſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there were yet foure other Spaniſh ſouldiours, which <hi>Lopez</hi> amongſt many had culled out to bee the moſt valiant. With theſe, the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce</hi> about day breake went towards the Friers chamber vpon the 18. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the Friers Secretarie who perceiuing the drift of this rumour, went to giue him notice thereof, but he was turned againe by theſe conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators. Before them all went <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> Secretarie, named <hi>Marc Antonie Ferraro</hi> of Alexandria, with certaine letters and fained patents in his hand, with intent to ſhew them to the Frier, and to requeſt him to peruſe the one, and ſeale the other, telling him that it was for the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce,</hi> who that day ſhuld depart to go to Vienna, and who would not go without knowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his pleaſure, whither hee would commaund him any thing to <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Court. This Secretarie was accuſtomed early and late to haue free acceſſe to the Frier vpon any affayres, yea, and euen at vntimely houres, and the Frier bore him good affection, and alwaies vſed him familiarly, affoording him great fauour and many rich gifts, and repoſed a ſpeciall truſt in him. For theſe reſpects he was ſent with them, that the more colourably and with leſſe ſuſpition, the groomes of the Friers chamber might open his doore, they knowing the good affection that their maſter bore him, and that the ſaid Secretarie not foure daies before, about the ſame houre was come to him to negotiate ſome important buſines. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had expreſſely ſent him at ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an houre before, to the end, that when time ſhould come to execute this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, no ſuſpition ſhould grow by his comming, and that he might be the man who ſhould kill him.</p>
            <p>They being all thus arriued neere the Friers chamber, they preſently loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the guard of the Aiduchs into a hall thereby, who little ſuſpected any ſuch matter, for that they were all cluſtering about the chimney to warme them, and to refreſh themſelues, by reaſon of that troubleſome night which they had endured. And after the Secretarie knocked at the doore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reported to the Frier who it was, he cauſed him preſently to come in; the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce</hi> following him, whom the groome would not let enter in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but told him that he ſhould attend him at the doore. The other thruſting his foote and knee betweene both, hindered that the groome could not ſhut it. The Marqueſſe keeping himſelfe firmely there, the Secretarie in the meane time approached Frier <hi>George,</hi> who was in his ſhirt and night-gowne, he vſing no other circumſtances to apparell him, but onely came preſently out of his bed, and leaning then on the table, vpon which he had a little Clocke, a Breuiarie, and a booke of his notes, with an Inkehorne by. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie told him, that the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce</hi> was to goe to the Court of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and before his departure he was come to kiſſe his hands, and would know his pleaſure if he would commaund him any ſeruice: that being ſaid, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he put into his hands the letters and patents (aforeſaid) to ſeale them. After that the Frier had peruſed them, and taking penne and inke to ſubſcribe his name, the Secretarie not omitting any time, with a poynard (which ſecretly he had) he gaue him a ſtab betweene the throate and the breaſt, but not ſo deepe that it was mortall. The Frier being greatly amazed herewith, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21983:93"/>
comming to himſelfe againe, and ſaying <hi>Virgo Maria,</hi> he pulled the dagger out of his breaſt, and for that he was a man of great ſtrength, and of a bolde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> reſolution, he made the Secretarie retire to the end of the table. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe being very attentiue, hearing this bruite, entered preſently into the chamber, and laying hand vpon his ſword, gaue him ſo great a blow vpon the head, that he cleaued it. Whereupon all the reſt entering with Captaine <hi>Lopez,</hi> diſcharged their Harquebuzes vpon him, which the Frier ſeeing, ſaid no other thing but theſe words in Latin: What meaneth this my friends? <note place="margin">The laſt words of George.</note> and ſaying, <hi>Ieſus Maria,</hi> he fell dead to the ground.</p>
            <p>Behold now the end of the proudeſt and inſolenteſt man in the world, and the greateſt and cloſeſt Tyrant that euer liued, God permitting that he ſhould in that very place end his daies, which he had cauſed to be built vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the foundations of an ancient Church and Moneſtarie of religious perſons, which for that occaſion he cauſed to be defaced and pulled down, &amp; for the <note place="margin">The death of George was foretold him.</note> ruine whereof, his death was foretold vnto him by the Abbot of that place. And neither could his authoritie, wiſedome, nor great wealth protect him from the action of ſo miſerable an end, whereinto (his daies being almoſt come to a period) he ſuddenly fell. The bruite ranne, that this death inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him, was rather by the enuie and malice of thoſe who hated him, then by any act which he was culpable in: for that the defence which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke for <hi>Olimans</hi> protection and ſafetie, tended to no other end (as was afterward perceiued, and as wee ſhall hereafter more at large treate of) but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that by ſuch curteſie vſed to <hi>Oliman</hi> and his people, he might pacifie the Turkes furie, and cauſe them to abſtaine from further oppreſſion of Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania, and ſuffer euery one to liue peaceably. This wee are ſure on, that all thoſe which were actors of his death, in time fell into great misfortunes. The Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce</hi> within a while after was ouerthrowne and taken priſoner by the Turkes, who inflicted great torments vpon him. Captaine <hi>Monin</hi> was <note place="margin">Reuenge from God againſt the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of George.</note> beheaded at S. <hi>Germanes</hi> in Piemont. <hi>Marc Anthonie Ferraro</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1557. was alſo beheaded in Alexandria, by the Cardinall of Trent his commaund. Another was quartered by the Frenchmen in Prouence. <hi>Cheualier Campeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1562. was in the preſence of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> mortally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> wounded with a Bore in Bohemia. And the concluſion was, that in the end Tranſiluania remained not long vnder the obeyſance of his Maieſtie, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnder the gouernment of yong King <hi>Iohn:</hi> ſo that the death of Frier <hi>George</hi> was more offenſiue and preiudicial to the Chriſtians, then profitable, as we will hereafter in his due place mention.</p>
            <p>Returning then to the purſuite of our hiſtorie: whileſt theſe were buſied about their execution, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was walking vpon the Caſtle wall to giue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to their proceedings, and there to expect the iſſue of this bloodie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. Being now aſſured that the Frier was dead, he preſently came downe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and went to the Caſtle gate, where ſuddenly with his ſouldiours which were entered into it, and other gentlemen which he had with him, he cauſed all the Aiduchs (who then were appointed for the guard of it) to goe foorth, who hearing the bruite which was within, and ſeeing the Spanyards in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile without, and that the Frier their Lord was dead, they ſo ſuddenly were
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:21983:93"/>
amazed, that without betaking themſelues to armes, they moſt willingly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fled; and departing in this manner, aduertiſed the Friers guards, who were at the bridge on the other ſide of the Caſtle, of what had happened. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploite being now finiſhed, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> doubting that many of the Friers friends would depart: whereupon he preſently went forth to finde <hi>Francis Chendy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Francis Chen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> 
               <hi>Ference,</hi> who was alreadie in his Coach to bee gone, and taking him by the hand, he deſired him to ſtay. And ſurely if hee had not then at that inſtant ſtaied him, he would haue fallen into a great daunger, for that he was one of the greateſt friends Frier <hi>George</hi> had, and hee was of that might within the Realme, as he could ſtirre them vp againſt the ſouldiours of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to be reuenged of the Friers death. Hee hauing thus ſtaied him, brought him to the place where the Spanyards and Germanes were, among whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he placed him to ſee what would become of this tumult, that the gentlemen and ſeruants of the Friers would make, and ſpecially his guard, who moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all on horſebacke, and gathered together in the field, hauing for their Captaine <hi>Paul Bancchy,</hi> who at the ſiege of Lippa was the Friers Lieutenant. <note place="margin">Paul Bancchy.</note> They being thus all ranged in battaile in a plaine, began among themſelues to deliberate what was beſt to bee done, and being acertained of the Friers death, made no other ſemblance againſt <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> doubting they could not make their partie good, in reſpect he had an infinit companie of men with him, and that this murther was not done without great intelligence: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which cauſe, eſteeming they could not greatly preuaile, but rather receiue more loſſe and damage, they reſolued for the preſent to obſcure this reuenge in ſilence, and reſerue the chaſtiſement thereof, vntill a more conuenienter time. And ſo this aſſemblie was diſcomfited, euery man taking his neereſt and ſafeſt way, leauing their maſters dead bodie to bee a pray and ſpoyle, and vnburied. It remained there many daies aboue ground all naked and <note place="margin">The buriall of George.</note> without light, there being not any who reſpected to couer or burie him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſtiffe with cold, that he ſeemed as a man made out of Marble, hauing in the head, breaſt, and armes many wounds, vpon which was yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the blood all frozen: which to ſay truly, was an obiect worthie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and on the other ſide, it was very execrable and enormious, to ſee ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> great a perſonage ſo vily left without buriall, by thoſe who (God knoweth for what cauſe) had practiſed his death. In the end, by ſome of his friends he was conuaied to the Church of Albe-iula, where <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> at the charges of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> cauſed him to bee buried in a Tombe of ſtone, in the middeſt of the new great Church, by King <hi>Iohn Huniades Coruin.</hi> Theſe Aiduchs and other of the Friers people being thus retired, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſeeing that in theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of fortune, there would not befall vnto him any great diſturbance nor tumult for the death of the Frier, came on foote before the Spaniſh ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, hauing <hi>Francis Chendy</hi> by the hand, and began with him to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to Saſſebeſſe. He was not yet farre on his way, but a meſſenger came and told him that the Caſtle of Binſe was rifled by thoſe who were left in cuſtodie thereof, and that the Friers Secretarie was taken by <hi>Iohn Alphonſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of George ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> 
               <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> and warranted from death, and how that in the Friers chamber there was found a little Cabenet, within which was 12000. Hungariſh Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21983:94"/>
which Captaine <hi>Andrew Lopez,</hi> with foure other ſouldiours, had taken and broken vp, and parted ſhares according to their qualities, reſeruing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> greateſt quantitie for himſelfe. He vnderſtanding this newes, preſently ſent Captaine <hi>Diego Velez</hi> to pacifie this diſorder, and take the money againe from them who had thus ſtollen it, and to cauſe them to reſtoreal the moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of the Frier, and eſtabliſh them in the former eſtate, waiting till he ſhould ſend a Comiſſarie, who ſhould receiue all the Friers treaſure to the vſe of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> By this meanes he cauſed the pillage to ceaſe, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe much money, and other things to the value of 80000. Duckets, which was all committed to the charge of his Maieſties Treaſurers. And marching thus along, very diſcontented with thoſe who had rifled the Friers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> chamber, within ſhort time after hee arriued at Saſſebeſſe, from whence he preſently ſent to the Captaines and Gouernours of ſuch Caſtles and Forts, as were at the Friers deuotion, that they ſhould yeeld to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, that if they would not obey his commaund, he would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſend his armie and Artillerie to ſubdue them. Among which places there was one called Wyuar, where the Frier had his treaſure, and there hee alſo <note place="margin">Wyuar.</note> priuately kept an Ambaſſadour of the Turkes, which <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> preſently after the Frier had yeelded vp the ghoſt, ſent Captaine <hi>Diego Velez</hi> to apprehend and bring the ſaid Ambaſſadour to him whereſoeuer he ſhould be, to ſee if any matter of moment could bee learned out of him touching the Friers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> proceedings, and whether there had been any intelligence and practiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as was vehemently ſuſpected, and ſpecially in reſpect of the Diet of Waſrael, where they looked for the Sicilians, and in which (as the common bruite and ſpeech amongſt our people was) they ſhould haue diſcourſed of the meanes which ſhould be vſed to expulſe <hi>Caſtalde</hi> out of Tranſiluania, with all the Spanyards, Germanes, Bohemians, and Hungars, who ſhould be at that time found in it, and were payd by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand.</hi> This Ambaſſadour being vnder <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> commaund, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, they could neither know nor finde in him any matter as they deſired, but onely certaine letters of credit written in the Turkiſh language, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> directed to <hi>Solyman, Roſtan Baſha,</hi> the Belerbey, and to certaine other of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall credit in the Turkes Court, and ſealed with the ſeale, which the Frier was wont to vſe in all the affayres concerning the kingdome, which letters he had diſpatched, without imparting any thing thereof to <hi>Caſtalde.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at Saſſebeſſe one whole day, that by the meanes of <hi>Iulian de Carleual,</hi> he might aduertiſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of all that which happened, and writ to all the townes to acquaint them with the enterpriſes and death of the Frier, and to pray them to remaine in a loyall deuotion to the King. The day following, fearing the Sicilians (being ſpeciall friends to the Frier) would riſe againſt him, and that it was not in his power to auoyde the tumult, which he alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſaw ſtirred vp, determined to goe to Sibinio, for that it was a towne of <note place="margin">Sibinio.</note> good ſtrength and moſt faithfull to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and leſſe affected to the Frier, among all thoſe which were in that quarter, in which he thought to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, while he might, together with his ſecuritie, ſee what end theſe matters would haue: whereupon he left good garriſons of Germanes in Albe-iula,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21983:94"/>
and at Saſſebeſſe, and he left alſo at Binſe Captaine <hi>Diego Velez</hi> with his Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> companie, and went himſelfe to Sibinio, where being arriued, he lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the reſt of his armie without the towne: but ſo neere at hand, that vpon any neceſſitie and firſt ſigne giuen, within foure houres he could bring them into the towne, onely retaining with him 50. Harquebuziers for his guard. There he was very friendly receiued of the citizens, who greatly reioyced with him, for that he had deliuered them from the ſubiection and feare of this ſtearne and proud Frier, promiſing not to faile him in all proſperous and aduerſe accidents whatſoeuer, and offering him all that which ſhould be any way neceſſary for him. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> gaue them many kind thanks, and was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly pleaſed, for that hee found the Sibinians in ſo good an humour, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſuch aſſured friends: and minding afterwards to depart from thence and go to Segheſuar, that ſo he might be more neere to Waſrael (where the Sicilians <note place="margin">The Diet at Waſrael.</note> were aſſembled, expecting the Friers arriuall) and alſo the better to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know of them what their purpoſe might be: and whether after they vnderſtood of the Friers death, they would continue in the friendſhip and deuotion of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> The inhabitants of Sibinio would by no meanes permit him that he ſhould goe out of their towne without a good guard, telling him, that to goe to ſuch a Diet, it was very neceſſarie he ſhould leade with him more men then he had, and that by no meanes he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any truſt in the Sicilians, vntill he ſaw how they would take the Friers death, vrgently perſwading him not to go to that Diet with leſſe then 15000. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> men. Vpon theſe conſiderations, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſent to ſeeke the men of armes of <hi>Charles Scerettin,</hi> and certaine Spanyards and Germanes to the number of 1800. and went from thence with this troupe to Segheſuar, ſtill hauing in <note place="margin">Segheſuar.</note> his companie <hi>Francis Chendy,</hi> whom he now had wonne, and by offers and kind vſage (although it might bee thought it was more by compulſion then loue) had drawne to the ſeruice of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> They being arriued in this towne, they repoſed themſelues there the firſt day: and the day following <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſent <hi>Chendy</hi> to Waſrael, where alreadie were met the principall men <note place="margin">The Sicilians mutinie for the death of George, and are appeaſed by Chendy.</note> of Seculia, deuiſing together of the meanes which ſhould be vſed to reuenge the death of the Frier. <hi>Chendy</hi> being now preſent, before them all, in <hi>Caſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> name, ſaid vnto them, that they ſhould louingly and faithfully embrace <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> of whom they ſhould receiue more pay, rewards, and curteſies in one houre, then they had receiued of the Frier in 20. yeeres, whoſe death fell vpon him in regard of his bad demeanour, hauing abſolutely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring the Turkes into theſe countries, and to make himſelfe ſole Lord of Tranſiluania: which would haue been not onely their particular ruine, but alſo an irreparable damage to all Chriſtendome. With theſe friendlie ſpeeches, and other plauſible reaſons which he alleadged to them, he wonne that abilitie ouer them, that he conuerted them from their former malice, to ſweare all obeyſance to his Maieſtie, and to offer him to be faithfull and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hereafter in all his affayres, performing whatſoeuer <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them. The principals among them within a while after came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to viſit <hi>Caſtalde</hi> at Segheſuar, to manifeſt vnto him in his preſence the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of that true fidelitie, which in words they had by <hi>Chendy</hi> promiſed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21983:95"/>
vnto him. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> receiued them with infinit ioyes and demonſtrations of kindnes, promiſing large penſions to thoſe who were at the Friers pay, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> giuing honourable titles and liuings to others: and beſides, at <hi>Ferdinands</hi> charges, he beſtowed as well vpon the poore as rich many preſents; to ſome, horſes, robes of ſilke, apparell of cloath; to others, money, entertaining eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man with good loue and curteous words: and aſſuring them with great and ample hopes of a future and preſent acknowledgement of their ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, hee made them in a manner ſo fauourable vnto him, that hee verely thought he might well truſt them, and aſſiſt himſelfe with them, in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe whatſoeuer. Obſeruing herein the cuſtome of the ancient Romanes, who by meanes of curteſie and liberalitie, made all ſorts of men, how proud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> or inſolent ſoeuer they were, to be tractable and louing friends, and by force of armes and feare, to become ſubiect and obedient.</p>
            <p>The Sicilians being exceeding well ſatisfied by theſe ſpeeches, ſhewed themſelues ſo well contented with this new friendſhip, that it was an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible thing &amp; hardly to be beleeued, conſidering how within ſo ſhort a time this barbarous and rude nation was wonne, and who (in all iudgement) was to bee greatly miſtruſted. By ſuch managings men may eaſily ſee how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly the induſtrie and gouernment of men are; and how greatly the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Francis Chendy</hi> ſerued to reduce thoſe, who for our deſtruction were purpoſely vnited together, and who alſo had ſworne to deſtroy all <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinands</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> people, and to driue <hi>Caſtalde</hi> out of thoſe regions: and alſo how great and excellent his foreſight was, in ſo wiſely tempering that people, that from that time forward they alwaies ſhewed themſelues to be <hi>Ferdinands</hi> ſpeciall friends. After then that theſe nations were thus appeaſed, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> began to diuide all the companies into commodious places of the kingdome, to the end that his ſouldiours, by the benefit of their ſafegards, might in part begin to reſtore themſelues from their trauailes, which they had endured: and that after they were refreſhed, they might prepare and finde themſelues better diſpoſed to the future warre, which alreadie was diſcerned to come from the Turkes. And although that all tumults ſeemed then to be pacified <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and extinct, yet neuertheleſſe there wanted not ſome, who ſecretly kindled the fire in many places, and practiſing with inward hatred many things, (according as time fitteth we ſhall write of) brought great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Ferdinands</hi> affayres, and great paines and hatred as well to his people, as to the particular quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that kingdome.</p>

together ſo much poyſon, and ſpread abroad ſo many perturbations, that ſhe gaue vniuerſall notice, of how many miſchiefes ſhe had been the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> cauſe. Then, after the diſcontent of the Sicilians was appeaſed, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was departed from the Diet of Waſrael, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> returned to Sibinio, when all the Caſtles and Fortreſſes (which in the Friers name for a time held out) they ſent to him in the name of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and offered vnto him all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance, <note place="margin">All the places of George ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Ferdinand.</note> and yeelded vp all the treaſure which was found therein, that in any ſort appertained to Frier <hi>George.</hi> In the end hauing accepted their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and reeſtabliſhed the ſame Captaines in the ſaid places, he preſently certified <hi>Ferdinand</hi> thereof, to the end that with all expedition, he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch certaine Comiſſaries, to receiue by account, all that which was found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> in thoſe places to haue been the Friers, and afterward to diſpoſe of them as it pleaſed him.</p>
            <p>Whileſt hee expected theſe Comiſſaries, and that hee was at Sibinio, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine newes came daily by Marchants of Tergoniſta, (a principall towne of <note place="margin">Tergoniſta.</note> the Tranſalpinians) concerning that which was done at Conſtantinople, and touching the great preparation that the Turke made, (being exceeding <note place="margin">The Turke prepareth to make warre vpon Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> angrie and enraged for the death of the Frier) and cauſed to bee leauied two great armies to ſend them againſt the Tranſiluanians, with which he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at one inſtant to aſſaile this Prouince on two ſides, on the one ſide by the Moldauian, and on the other by the low Mariſhes.</p>
            <p>Vpon this newes, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> both by letters and meſſengers vrgently preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for preſent reliefe, and that he would in time prouide himſelfe <note place="margin">Caſtalde ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</note> of ſufficient men, and other fit neceſſaries, which ſhould bee needfull for the warre, and that he ſhould draw from the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> as many Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards as he could. He alſo ſent to his Maieſtie the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce,</hi> to the end he ſhould acquaint him with all the particulars, and that it would pleaſe his Maieſtie to giue him meanes to leauie ſome force of Italians, and that with ſuch expedition, as he might bee able, before neede ſhould require, to returne into Tranſiluania: and ſpecially to tell him, that he ſhould ſend good ſtore of great Artillerie; for the conduct of which, there ſhould not be vſed ſuch detracting of time, as was in ſending the other, to the end that by ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſuccour and preparations, they might be able to reſiſt ſo puiſſant an enemie, who aſſuredly would make no ſhew of any ſloth or negligence, to prepare for the ruine of this countrie and poore miſerable people.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe being now arriued at Vienna, he preſently acquainted <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with all the occurrants of Tranſiluania, as alſo of that which was committed to his charge. His Maieſtie being attentiue thereunto, and duly conſidering of theſe vnwelcomed nouelties, preſently diſpatched him into Italie, to leauie 4000. Italians, and to bring with him as many Spanyards as he could: and afterward writ to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that he would not faile to ſend him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſuch ayde as he demaunded againſt that time he required, hoping to ſend him no leſſe then 50000. men: namely, 5000. men of armes of Bohemia, 20000.

Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Italians, which ſhould make vp the ſaid number and more, of which he ſhould alſo compoſe a good ſtrong armie vpon Tibiſcus, for the defence
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21983:96"/>
of the paſſages, and of all thoſe places, and that all theſe people ſhould bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> payed for foure moneths: the which if <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had done, Hungarie for that time might haue been in good eſtate. But this good intended prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not ſort to effect, in reſpect of the aduerſe accidents that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and particularly that Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> brought to Germanie, by occaſion whereof he was conſtrained to bee carefull ouer the affayres of his brother <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. which were in ſome hard tearmes, and to lend his aduice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe that diſcord, happened for the not deliuering of the Lantgraue, and the Duke of Saxonie, being greatly buſied on all ſides by ſuch vnlooked for broyles, which brought ſo great diſcommoditie to him, that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſend money, nor men ſufficient for ſuch an enterpriſe: which default <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was partly the cauſe of the vnfortunate ſucceſſe which happened this yeere in Tranſiluania, farre different from the former.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> with the greateſt expedition he could, cauſed the fortifications of Themeſuar, Lippa, Coloſuar, Sibinio, and many other places to be reered, and he omitted no time, but ſtill carefully imployed his beſt endeuour to that which concerned him. During which imployments <note place="margin">The treaſure of George committed into the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of the Comiſſaries.</note> about ſuch munitions, the Comiſſaries arriued, which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance had diſpatched to receiue the Friers treaſure, which after his death was committed to ſafe keeping for his Maieſties vſe; <hi>Caſtalde</hi> not willing to defile his hands therewith (although the bruite was that he had the tenth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> part of the goods) knowing that ſuch affayres were daungerous, and apt to giue occaſion to ſlanderous tongues to accuſe and detract euery man, yea although he ſhould carrie himſelfe therein a thouſand times more ſincerely then <hi>Iacob</hi> himſelfe, and ſpecially when any colourable occaſion doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them to it: in regard whereof, and to auoyde all ſuſpition, he altogether abſtained, and by no meanes would haue them in his owne cuſtodie.</p>
            <p>His Comiſſaries being come, he cauſed them to receiue it by Inuentorie, opening with his owne hands certaine places which were yet faſtened, as the Frier had left them, which vntill then were not opened, and which for the greater ſuretie he cauſed to be nailed vp and ſecurely preſerued. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was found amongſt them in wedges and ingots ſo much gold, as amounted to 1744. markes, and of ſiluer 4793. markes; 1000. ancient Meddals of <hi>Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> euery Meddall valued at three or foure Duckets; twentie ſtones or peeces of gold which were found in the riuers of Tranſiluania, which were valued to be more worth, then if they had bin altogether gold, and weighed 34. markes; 934. markes of ſiluer wedges of the myne; ſixe very great veſſels of ſiluer and guilt; certaine chaines of gold which in all weighed ſixe markes and a halfe; 32. cups of ſiluer guilt ouer after the Hungariſh faſhion, wrought with faire and curious works; 60. gold rings, ſet with many precious ſtones; a faire coller of gold made in manner of a Croſſe, inriched with faire Rubies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Diamonds; 36. great ſiluer cups double guilt, ſo that one of them made two; twelue guilt Baſons and Eures, great, and of a large receit; an infinit companie of ſiluer drinking cups, great and ſmall diſhes, bowles, ſpoones, trencher-plates parcel guilt, and ſome not guilt; 1534. of Hungariſh Duckets; many bundles of Martine ſable skins, there being in euery bundle 80. or 100.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21983:97"/>
skinnes: many other bundles of diuers skinnes of great value; certaine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs and other Iewels inchaſed in gold; diuers ornaments of cloath of gold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and ſilke, and other goodly moueables for houſehold, as clothes, Tapiſterie, and Arras of incredible eſtimation. He alſo had a race of 300. Horſes and Mares, and in his ſtables were found good ſtore of Turkiſh Horſes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of Mules, which afterward were all giuen by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to his ſonne <hi>Maximilian</hi> King of Bohemia, and in his name deliuered into the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of <hi>Andrew Battor:</hi> and beſides all theſe, there was found great ſtore of victuals and munition, ſo that all things together (not counting that which was purloyned at Binſe, at Varadin, at Wyuar, at Deua, and at other places by the Captaines, which was eſteemed to bee worth more then 50000. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> crownes) was valued at 250000. crownes.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were thus deliuered by Inuentorie, Queene <hi>Izabella</hi> writ to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that it would pleaſe him to commaund <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that hee <note place="margin">Izabella de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of Ferdinand the moueables of George, and alſo requeſted the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that which he had promiſed her.</note> ſhould reſtore to her all the gold and ſiluer which was King <hi>Iohns</hi> her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that was found amongſt the Friers treaſure, which he had purloyned and vſurped by force, and in like ſort a portion of the Mares, and that hee would cauſe them preſently to be deliuered her. And further, that he would obſerue and performe all that which was promiſed to her, vpon the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp the kingdome of Tranſiluania. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> anſwered her, that for his part there ſhould be no fault: whereupon he commanded <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> he ſhould reſtore whatſoeuer might be found to belong to her, which was preſently performed, and there was giuen to her of the breede and other things the halfe. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> alſo commaunded the Comiſſaries that they <note place="margin">Caſtalde and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of George, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with Georges moueables.</note> ſhould giue to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> 200. markes (to the end he ſhould haue part of the ſpoyle of Frier <hi>George)</hi> in ſuch veſſels of the guilt plate, the beſt wrought that he would chuſe, and eight guilded cups of the Hungariſh faſhion, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great diſhes of thoſe which were found at Varadin, foure bundles of Martins skinnes, and other moueables: and beſides, 400. golden Meddals of <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> whereof he was alreadie poſſeſſed, beſides the 1000. which were in the hands of the Comiſſaries. He alſo cauſed to bee giuen to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> murtherers of the Frier, ſo good a portion of his moueables and ſiluer, that with it and the reuenew which he gaue them during their liues, they held themſelues well contented and ſatisfied. The bruite went that the Frier had infinit treaſure, but in the end it proued not ſo much as was reported, yea and it neuer amounted to the third part of that which was eſteemed, and the iſſue proued, that the report exceeded the ſubſtance, and the fame thereof was much more then the effect it ſelfe. The Comiſſaries being diſpatched, returned well contented, hauing in their cuſtodie all theſe riches, and a good part of the money which was found at Binſe in the Friers chamber, which were recouered by good diligence that ſome vſed therein, there being (by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> occaſion thereof) apprehended Captaine <hi>Andrew Lopez, Guydo Gozio,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> houſe, and certaine other ſouldiours, who afterward were conſtrained to reſtore all that which they had taken, and to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder <hi>Ferdinands</hi> mercie, who meant not, according to the ſeueritie of iuſtice, to chaſtiſe them, but with ſweete and milde clemencie did pardon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21983:97"/>
them. Now for that the ſouldiours were to be payed a twelue moneths pay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for their content, they cauſed to be coyned all that golde and ſiluer which was found in wedges, and by that meanes they were payed the greateſt part of their due, and they retained their affections vnder the oath of all fidelitie, which for want of payment were daily readie to mutinie and depart. As this payment was made, newes was brought that our forces had taken Zege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din, <note place="margin">Zegedin ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed from the Turkes.</note> which is a towne of Hungarie, not far from Lippa, containing about it 1000. houſeholds, and is furniſhed with a ſtrong Caſtle built vpon the ſhoare of Tibiſcus, neere the place where it entereth into Danubius. This towne is rich and of great traficke, and much frequented by occaſion of theſe two riuers: the maner in taking of it, was thus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>At the time that <hi>Castalde</hi> was incamped before Lippa, there came then to ſpeake with him, in the preſence of <hi>Andrew Battor,</hi> a Hungarian, named <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiall,</hi> (who at that time was Burgomaſter of Debrecen, a towne in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, <note place="margin">Ottomiall.</note> hauing been alſo Burgomaſter of Zegedin, before the Turkes were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters thereof) and he tolde him, that if he would vouchſafe him his conſent and ayde, he would finde the meanes to ſurpriſe Zegedin, the Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants being at his diſpoſe, who alſo had conference with him about it: and beſides had at his deuotion the neighbouring places, who deſiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to vnwinde themſelues from the Turkes ſlauerie, would at no hand faile him in his enterpriſe: he hauing alreadie receiued letters from them, by which they gaue him to vnderſtand, that if he had the courage to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> put in practiſe this exployte, he ſhould not doubt, but that approaching to them with a good troupe of men, they would put the towne and Caſtle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his commaund. <hi>Castalde</hi> well conſidering hereof, and knowing of what great ſtrength this place was, ſuppoſed this motion to be but a mockerie: neuertheleſſe, not minding to repell him, but with good and friendly ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſeeming to imbrace his aduice and councell, gaue him many heartie and intire thankes for his good affection in the attempting of ſo waightie an enterpriſe, and intreated him to continue the attempt of this practiſe, well hoping after the iſſue of Lippa, to furniſh and prouide him of all whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he demaunded, and that then he ſhould not want of what ſuccours he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> would himſelfe: and with this anſwere they departed.</p>
            <p>After that Lippa was taken, <hi>Ottomiall</hi> returned againe to <hi>Castalde,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of him that which to fore he had put him in minde of. <hi>Castalde</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he perſeuered in this reſolute opinion, and with ſo ſincere affection, in offering his dutifull ſeruice to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as before he had made ſufficient proofe thereof, and that he ceaſed not both by words and deedes, to ſhew himſelfe very forward in all things, (although that at the firſt ſight, he was not ſo entertained as he perſwaded himſelfe he ſhould haue been) he tolde him, that he ſhould haue as many men with him, as ſhould be neceſſarie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> performe this exploite, aduiſing him, that if in caſe he got the towne, and that notwithſtanding he could not get the Caſtle, that by no meanes he ſhould loſe any time for the batterie thereof, but hauing ſackt the towne, he ſhould ſet fire thereon, and afterward retire with the bootie, to the place where he ſhould be, for feare of being charged by the Turkes, and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21983:98"/>
with his life, and the liues of his ſouldiours, he ſhould not loſe that which painfully he had gotten, eſteeming the ſurpriſe, and the worthie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of this enterpriſe of no ſmall importance. <hi>Ottomiall</hi> obtaining this ſuite, and hauing taken his leaue, aſſembled the ſouldiours which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him at Lippa, to the number of 2000. foote, and 500. horſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing from them the cauſe which led him thereto, offered to euery foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foure crownes the moneth, and to euery horſeman ſixe: and hauing thus payd them, he cauſed their <hi>rende vous</hi> in a place commodious not farre from Lippa.</p>
            <p>The Campe-maſter <hi>Aldene,</hi> who (as is aforeſaid) was remaining for the defence and gouernment of Lippa, vnderſtanding of this aſſemblie, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> knowing the cauſe, gaue preſent aduertiſement thereof to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him anſwer, that he ſhould not diſturbe him, nor enquire any further of the occaſion, ſince what he did, was for the ſeruice of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Vpon the receit of this anſwer, <hi>Aldene</hi> went preſently to <hi>Ottomiall,</hi> of whom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the particularitie of the enterpriſe, perſwaded ſo much with him, that if it ſhould fortunately ſucceede, he would giue him preſent notice thereof, to the end that he himſelfe might come in perſon to relieue him. <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiall</hi> hauing ſet them all forward, and the one halfe of Zegedin being at his diſpoſe, gaue ſecret notice to the inhabitants of the ſaid towne, that hee had well commenced and proceeded in this attempt, and that they ſhould at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> any conuenient time ſend him word, when they would haue him to come vnto them. The townes-men preſently preſcribed a determined day to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this practiſe. The time approaching, one day before he cauſed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to march the whole night, and the day following he held them ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within a wood, and within two nights hee arriued ſo ſecretly, that his comming was neuer diſcerned: and comming before Zegedin at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed houre, about day breake, he of one ſide diſpoſed the greateſt part of his people in ambuſcado in the next by woods, and by another way he ſent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſouldiours to giue an alarme to the towne. Which being vnderſtood by the Turkes, preſently many of them ſallied forth of the Caſtle and towne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to view the occaſion of this alarme: and ſeeing ſo ſmall a number of theſe ſouldiours, and being ignorant of the ambuſcado, they boldly went forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; which when the other ſeeing, faining fearfully to retire, yet ſtill fighting, vntill by little and little they trained them within the compaſſe of their ambuſcado, where preſently they were ſo enuironed, and on euery ſide beaten downe, that they had no meanes to defend themſelues; and deſirous to make a retraict to the towne, euery one made haſte who ſhould bee there firſt. But the inhabitants well vnderſtanding this ſtratagem, hauing alreadie taken armes, they ſhut the ports againſt them, and ioyning with <hi>Ottomials</hi> men, they made ſuch a ſlaughter amongſt them, that of all thoſe who were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> gone forth, there remained not one aliue. The Turkes who were remaining for the guard and defence of the Caſtle, ſeeing this ſlaughter, retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and ſtood vpon their guard, and drew vp the bridge, aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within it, giuing diligent order the beſt they could to preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Our people being entered into the towne, and not being able to take
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21983:98"/>
the Caſtle in this manner, determined to ſacke all the Turks houſes, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Marchants, who were very rich, there being come thither many Conſtantinopolitans to dwell there. Thus ſeazing vpon all their moueables, wiues, and children, and committing them into a great houſe, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they might ſhare them amongſt the ſouldiours, <hi>Ottomiall</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe maſter of Zegedin, who afterwards being deſirous to aſſaile the Caſtle, found that the Turkes within would brauely defend themſelues. For the place of it ſelfe was naturally very ſtrong, and beſides, well furniſhed with Artillerie, and it was in ſuch ſort defenſible, that it cauſed <hi>Ottomiall</hi> to come ſhort of his conquering purpoſe. Therefore ſeeing he could by no meanes winne it without other forces, he writ preſently to the Camp-maſter <hi>Aldene</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of all that he had done. He receiuing this newes, without expecting other <note place="margin">Aldene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miall.</note> commaund from <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> calling to minde the promiſe which he made to <hi>Ottomiall</hi> to relieue him, determined with at ſpeede to goe to him, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two hundred Spanyards out of Lippa and Themeſuar, and foure field peeces, he began with all expedition to march towards Zegedin, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe that with this ſupplie of men and Artillerie which he brought with him, hee might vpon reaſonable tearmes get the poſſeſſion of this Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he iournied on, he acertained <hi>Caſtalde</hi> of this good newes, and how he marched thither, and deſired him that he would not faile to ſend after him with all ſpeede men and Artillerie, for that <hi>Ottomiall</hi> might not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> left deſtitute, and to the hazard of fortune, ſeeing he was now maſter of the towne, and aſſured him, by the meanes of ſuccours which he demaunded, eaſily to get the Caſtle. Before this aduertiſement from <hi>Aldene, Caſtalde</hi> had alreadie receiued newes thereof, by thoſe which he ſent with <hi>Ottomiall,</hi> that they ſhould preſently aduertiſe him of all the occurrants that ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, hauing in the meane time prepared a good number of men, and of all other neceſſaries which ſhould bee fitting, if in caſe the Caſtle were taken, that then he would preſently ſend ayde. But vnderſtanding that it was yet in the Turkes commaund, and that but onely the towne was taken, which he thought vnpoſſible to keepe without the Fortreſſe; ſent to <hi>Ottomiall</hi> that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhould fire the towne, contenting himſelfe with that which he had alreadie done, and ſparing thoſe who were friends, he ſhould preſently retire with the bootie which he had gotten, reputing it a great vanitie to loſe his time in an opiniatiue iudgement for the conqueſt of impoſſibilities (and ſpecially not being able to ſurpriſe it ſuddenly) which would require a greater armie then that which he had, not being able to furniſh, together with foote and horſe, more then 4000. men, neither he hauing any peeces of batterie to ſend him: and in the end he commaunded him that he ſhould deferre no longer time in that place, for that if he did not ſpeedily diſlodge, he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſome doubt that the Turkes (by the ſuccours which they prepared) would come in the meane while to charge them, they not thinking thereon, and ſo by that meanes to loſe at one time both that which they gotten with their honour and liues.</p>
            <p>As he had diſpatched this commaund, came <hi>Aldenes</hi> Courier, by whom
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21983:99"/>
he vnderſtood that he was departed from Lippa, with ſuch a number of men and Artillerie, as wee haue ſaid, to relieue <hi>Ottomiall.</hi> By this Courier he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> intreated that he would ſend him more men and Artillerie, aſſuring him that the taking of this Caſtle was very eaſie. But <hi>Caſtalde</hi> by no meanes could be induced to credit it, hauing been ſufficiently informed of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſituation of this ſaid Fortreſſe, and that within there were yet 500. Turkes remaining of thoſe who were ſlaine at the ſurpriſe of the towne; that it was well furniſhed with good ſtore of Artillerie, and that the walles were very large and thick, and rampierd behinde with as much earth as they were high, inſomuch that hee ſaw no poſſible meanes that the purſuite thereof could reſt victorious to our people. And although he apparantly knew that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to ſend men thither was much time loſt, eſteeming it vnpoſſible to take the Caſtle in this manner, yet he determined at all aduentures to ſend them ayde and Artillerie, as <hi>Aldene</hi> requeſted. Which he was the rather content to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme (although he-eſteemed it a friuolous thing) for that the fault ſhould not bee imputed to him if they did not take it, and that they ſhould not ſay that this fauourable occaſion was loſt, for not ſending them in time ſuch ayd as they demaunded. And thus in the greateſt ſpeede that could be (although it was ſtill contrarie to his liking) he writ to <hi>Thomas Varcocce,</hi> that hee ſhould preſently take two Cannons out of Varadin where he was, and two out of Albe-iula, with certaine field peeces, and with all ſpeed ſend them with their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> munitions and other neceſſaries to <hi>Aldene,</hi> who was at Zegedin: which preſently was commodiouſly ſent, by meanes of the riuer Maroſſe. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards commaunded <hi>Oureſtolph</hi> (who then was in garriſon in the Countie of Varadin) that he ſhould preſently march with the men of armes to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour <hi>Ottomiall</hi> and <hi>Aldene.</hi> In like ſort he ſent to <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> (who was Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell of the Infantrie, and who alſo at that time had his garriſon at Varadin and Albe-iula) that he ſhould march with <hi>Oureſtolph.</hi> At this commaund, the one hauing with him 2000. foot and horſe, and the other 200. men of armes, they proceeded on towards Zegedin, without permitting their troupes to repoſe themſelues any time. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>After that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had giuen directions, according as aforeſaid, he alſo <note place="margin">An offence to disfurniſh a garriſon.</note> writ to <hi>Aldene,</hi> reprouing him for the fault which he had committed by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Lippa and Themeſuar, becauſe he had withdrawne from thence the garriſons, greatly marueiling at his folly, how he ſhould be drawne to ſettle himſelfe vpon ſo vaine an enterpriſe, which by all likelihoods could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately ſucceede; and to thinke that with ſo few men hee could take that Caſtle, which in reſpect of the ſituation and ſtrength thereof, would require ſixe times as great a power: that hee had ſent them thoſe ſuccours that hee demaunded, which he would not haue done, but onely to the end that none ſhould accuſe him, that becauſe he had not ſent them, this Fortreſſe could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> not bee wonne, further aſſuring himſelfe that time would witnes his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment true, and make the detriment to appeare, which was very probable would happen thereupon: and this he was ſo much the rather perſwaded of, for that then he ſaw himſelfe to bee in want both of men and money, ſo that in loſing thoſe which he had now ſent him, he ſhould finde himſelfe out of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21983:99"/>
hope, vpon any occaſion to reunite ſo many againe. This done, he departed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from Sibinio, and went and ſeated himſelfe in Albe-iula, that ſo he might be more neere vnto Zegedin, and in the middeſt of the kingdome, to the end that hee might the better prouide for all places; and if happely the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres ſucceeded well, that hee might preſently tranſport himſelfe thither, and giue both by his preſence and by the ayde of the reſt of his ſouldiours (which he had lodged about Albe-iula) vigour and courage to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. But hereof there was not any neede at all: for within a few daies after newes was brought, that all thoſe who were at the expedition of Zegedin, were quite ouerthrowne by the Baſha of Buda, without knowing the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular trueth how things had paſſed. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> although the diſpleaſure which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he conceiued of this defeate was exceeding great, yet did he not entertaine this report as any noueltie, for that from the beginning euen to the end hee well foreſaw what would happen, and the rather being induced thereunto, in reſpect of the abſurditie which was committed from the firſt, which was not likely to effect any other end then ſuch as it had. Now after that, beſides he had more aſſured newes, that for certaine all his people were defeated and loſt: for feare leaſt the loſſe of Lippa and Themeſuar might not follow, (which <hi>Aldene</hi> had left both disfurniſhed of ſouldiours and of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder) he ſent in poſt to Captaine <hi>Roderic Vigliandrando,</hi> commaunding him that he ſhould goe to Lippa, and that he would ſend him ſo many men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as was needfull for the defence thereof. He alſo commanded <hi>Diego Velez de Mendoza,</hi> that he ſhould go to Themeſuar with his companie, leading with him beſides 300. Germanes, and 300. Hungariſh horſe, and of that troupe he ſhould ſend a good part thereof to Lippa, and that he ſhould be very vigilant vpon all that quarter.</p>
            <p>Theſe now marching on with tedious iourneys, met many people of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers nations, who fled from about the townes of the low marches, for the feare which they had of the crueltie, which (as they vnderſtood) the Baſha of Buda had vſed in maſſacring an infinit companie of people: vpon which bruite they retired in great confuſion and tumult towards the mountaines. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But they ſeeing there were ſuccours ſent to the quarters from whence they were fled, ſtaied their fearefull courſe, and by little and little regained their courages againe; and being perſwaded by theſe Captains to expell all feare, and to returne againe to their houſes, they ceaſed their ſlight, and taking hart returned with them, and others went to Lippa and Themeſuar: where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The defeate of Ferdinands people at Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedin by the Turkes.</note> all arriued, they vnderſtood how <hi>Aldene</hi> ſaued himſelfe, with all the Spanyards and <hi>Oureſtolphs</hi> men of armes, with a true relation of all the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter which happened in this ſort:</p>
            <p>It was now alreadie eight daies that <hi>Aldene</hi> had been about the Caſtle of Zegedin, and had enuironed it with a large trench, (expecting the arriuall of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Artillerie, which approached with all ſpeede) when a day before, <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> arriued with thoſe 2000. ſouldiours (as is aforeſaid) and when alſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from Canoth 100. Germane Harquebuziers, 30. Spanyards, and 100. horſe. The tenth day <hi>Aldene</hi> early in the morning cauſed all his people to be muſtered in a field, and he found his number to be 3000. horſe, 230. Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21983:100"/>
100. Germanes, and 2000. Hungarian footmen, beſides the 200. men of armes of <hi>Oureſtolphs,</hi> who at the ſame time arriued. Whileſt that <hi>Aldene</hi> was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> buſied to diſpoſe and lodge them, and before they were ſeated, the Turks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a plaine by Zegedin, at the ſight of whom the alarme was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen in euery place, and our men ſarried cloſe vp together. They ſent foorth ſome to take a view and notice of them, who diſcouered a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of 1500. horſe, and many Coaches, within which they might alſo diſcerne men, and it was the Baſha of Buda, who purpoſely came with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to attempt the enterance into the Caſtle, and not to fight with our people, being not ſufficiently accompanied for ſuch a purpoſe: but he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was alreadie diſcouered, made a ſtand in that place where our people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> might well perceiue them, and of his whole troupe he made two ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, the one greater then the other, cauſing all the Ianiſaries to mount vp into the Coaches, with which vpon the left hand he made a defence, among whom and with the greateſt ſquadron he placed himſelfe, and the leſſer he ſet on the right hand, cauſing thoſe Coaches and Waggons to couer and defend both the one and the other in manner of a Rampier: and being come but onely to relieue and ſuccour his people, and not to fight with our men, he ſtaied there to ſee what we would doe. Our men ſeeing the Turkes thus ranged in battaile, made a ſquadron of their Hungarian light horſe, and <hi>Oure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolph</hi> made another with his men of armes, right oppoſite to that of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha. <hi>Ottomiall</hi> and <hi>Aldene</hi> made another ſtrong bodie of all the Infantrie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which they placed by the towne, without giuing them charge to fight, or any other directions what to doe.  As theſe ſquadrons of Caualarie were before the enemies, and a good diſtance betweene them, <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aldene:</hi> 
               <q>What ſhall we now doe? <hi>Aldene</hi> anſwered him, that in reſpect hee knew not the manner of the Hungars fight, he would commit all to him, to doe what hee thought fitting.</q> Afterwards <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> ſaid; <q>Since you know not our manner of fight, let me alone.</q> 
               <hi>Oureſtolph</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Aldene</hi> (Generall of the armie) doubted not a little of that which he had to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous of honour, and couetous not to bee the ſecond that ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> charge the Turkes, without further conſideration of the matter, ſpurred on amaine with his men of armes againſt the Baſhaes great ſquadron: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who were in the front tooke more vpon their left hand then on their right, they did not ſo fully incounter the ſaid ſquadron in the middeſt, but made as it were a touch alongſt the ſide of the ſquadron, but yet ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, that they ouerthrew all thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they incountred withall. The Hungars did ſecond them, and charged but in the ſame place where the men of armes before them had attempted, without diſordering any. This ouerſight was the beginning of their diſorder, indiſcreetly preſſing and incumbring one another, and ſeeing many Turkes dead on the ground, who not by them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> (the Hungars) but by the people of <hi>Oureſtolph</hi> were ſo ouerthrowne, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny horſes courſing about the plaine, thinking that they had alreadie wonne the victorie, and not reſpecting the other ſquadron which was yet whole with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coaches, they ſeemed careleſſe any more to fight or expect the iſſue of the battaile, ſo that many among them diſmounting from their horſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21983:100"/>
to rifle the Turkes which were remaining on the place either hurt or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſlaine. The Baſha perceiuing this which was done at the firſt incounter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deſpayre, and thought the victorie inclined to the Chriſtians: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he began to retire his ſquadrons and waggons to ſaue himſelfe: but afterward ſeeing that none followed him, and that the Hungars did not orderly manage in the field, but with confuſion thwarting one another without any diſcipline, being more attentiue to the ſpoyle, then to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of victorie, and conſidering that a good part of his ſquadron was yet intire and whole, determined to make head and returne to the charge, commaunding firſt to aduance 300. Turkes, with certaine Ianiſaries and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſouldiours which ſhould enter into the Caſtle, (which they eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> without any hinderance) and after they kept cloſe with their other ſquadrons in a ſtrong battalion, and began with great courage and nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to giue in among the Hungars, who alreadie were disbanded and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed euery where, to whom they gaue the greateſt mate that could be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, putting all to the ſword without any pitie, ſo that there were more horſe ſeene ſtraying vp and downe, then men running away, the plaine being ſo harried, that they could not finde any place to hide and ſaue themſelues. The men of armes in the meane time reunited themſelues into a ſtrong ſquadron, and deſirous againe to charge and thwart the Turkes, perceiued how the Hungars by their beaſtlines and couetouſnes of ſpoyle were all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne and ſlaine, and the reſt that were remaining were put to ſlight. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> In reſpect whereof, not willing to indaunger themſelues to the euent of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſo ſlightly to aduenture a ſecond charge, thought it more expedient to goe and ioyne with the Spanyards, who not once remoued from the place by the towne, but were ſtill raunged in battaile all vnited together, and who now began with good ſpeede to retire themſelues to other places of more ſtrength and ſecuritie. The Baſha of Buda ſeeing now the victorie to be his, &amp; greatly marueiling that that which he neuer thought of, was happened to him, could not eaſily be induced to beleeue it; but without pauſing he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ranged ouer the field as victorious, not ſparing the life of any which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered, commanding the like to be done in the towne by the Turks who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were in the Caſtle, and by thoſe which he had ſent for their ayd, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in imployed themſelues ſo bloodily, that amongſt thoſe whom they knew their profeſſed enemies, they ſo tyrannouſly dominered, that they neither ſpared men, women, nor children, cauſing all pitifully to end their liues by the edge of the ſword. The Baſha afterwards gathering all his people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe, and making of them a great ſquadron, raunged the plaine all the reſt of that day, and purſued the remainder of thoſe ſouldiours that <hi>Ottomiall</hi> had brought with him, of whom he defeated &amp; left vpon the ground there, more then 1500. dead and wounded, inſomuch as for that day, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as within the towne, there was more then 5000. perſons that periſhed: and afterwards reſting himſelfe, as one tyred in ſhedding ſo much blood, and to ſee whether any thing elſe would offer it ſelfe vnto him, he deſcried a farre off to come towards the towne 300. Aiduchs (who are footmen) who two daies before that our men had receiued this ouerthrow, went to ſeeke their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21983:101"/>
fortunes in the Turkes countrie for ſpoyle: which they well performed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> great ſlaughter of the enemies, and returned from thence well laden, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to finde all things as they left them, not any thing dreaming that in ſo ſhort a time and ſo miſerably, Fortune had brought them to ſo vniuerſall a ruine. Thus ioyfully continuing on their iourney, and haſtning themſelues to Zegedin, as though they had been to goe to their owne homes, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the Baſhaes ſquadron, whereat they were greatly aſtoniſhed, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they were enemies or no: neuertheleſſe perſwading themſelues they were of our people, who were there placed for ſome good purpoſe, they reſted aſſured, and began againe to proceede on their way: they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not much further, but they were perceiued by the Baſha, who knowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them to be of our Aiduchs, and a ſmall number, and that they had no woods to ſaue themſelues, but only a little Church, which was not farre from them, they began to prepare towards them, who ſeeing themſelues ſo ſuddenly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed and enuironed, contrarie to their expectation, were not any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat: but euery man taking the courage of a lyon, began ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fight, continually retyring towards the Church, that although there did not any one of them eſcape, yet neuertheleſſe they ſold their liues ſo deare, that there was not any one of them ſlaine, but firſt he killed a Turke or two, and many three or foure, and theſe did twice as much endamage the Baſhes people, as all thoſe which <hi>Ottomiall</hi> had brought againſt them, beſides his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 3000. horſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe being thus defeated, the Baſha remained entire Lord both of the field and towne: where being entered, he gaue in token of victorie to all his people, as well in money as in apparell, what he himſelfe thought good. And after hauing thanked Fortune for ſuch happy ſucceſſe, he addreſſed himſelfe to the repayring of the towne, and to mend vp that which our people had ſpoyled. Whileſt the Baſha was imployed in the defeate of theſe Aiduchs, <hi>Aldene</hi> retyred himſelfe with his Spanyards and men of armes with ſo great haſte and ſpeede, as if the Baſha had been at their backes, or all the Turkiſh Caualarie had purſued them, himſelfe being the onely cauſe of this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in reſpect of his negligence and ſmall iudgement, becauſe he had not cauſed theſe Aiduchs to ſtay and fight. Thus retyring and flying from Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedin, he trauailed in one day and a night 16. miles, which maketh 32. French miles, and retyred himſelfe to a Caſtle named Cornoch, not farre from <note place="margin">Cornoch.</note> Lippa.</p>
            <p>During this ſaid battaile, there happened a ſtrange accident to a ſouldiour, which I would not let paſſe in ſilence, eſteeming it worthie of memorie: and this it was. When <hi>Aldene</hi> paſſed Tibiſcus to goe to Zegedin, he left a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <note place="margin">The coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, who in the end killed himſelfe.</note> of a ſquadron, named <hi>Higueras,</hi> with certaine ſouldiours, who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a man of good ſufficiencie, and very valiant, and he was left there to keepe the boates in which he had paſſed the riuer, to the end he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> haue them in readines, &amp; as it were for any neceſſitie which might happen. Now this ſouldiour being in perſon at the guard of the paſſage, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day that the defeate aforeſaid happened, ſeeing a multitude of men to come towards him flying, and demaunding of them what was happened,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21983:101"/>
and for what cauſe they ranne ſo haſtily. They anſwered him: that all our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> people were quite defeated and cut in peeces by the Baſha of Buda, and that to warrant themſelues from his victorious hand, they fled in the greateſt haſte they could to ſaue themſelues. This ſouldiour hearing this, without any other inquirie or information of the ſurpluſage, aſſuredly beleeuing that the Spanyards were alſo defeated, vnlooſed all the barkes for feare of being purſued, &amp; preſently paſſed to the other ſide of the water. Theſe other ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours who were with him did the like, and entering a wood together, they tooke the way towards Themeſuar, the Corporall of the ſquadron hauing a boy with him who came ſomewhat behinde: and trauailing along with others a good while, he preſently recalled his ſpirits to him, thinking of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which cowardly hee had done; and ſet before his eyes the little eſteeme which euery man would haue of him, in ſo vily forſaking thoſe boates which <hi>Aldene</hi> had giuen him in charge, without making further inquirie how all things were paſſed at Zegedin: and further conſidering, that if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely the Spanyards were ſaued, he could neuer haue the courage to look the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the face: &amp; on the other ſide, if they were loſt, that thoſe that ſhuld ſee him come ſo ſound &amp; ſafe, might demand of him the occaſion and manner how his companions were ſo ouerthrowne, to which he could neither ſatisfie nor anſwer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; he began now to turmoyle his braine vpon theſe conſiderations, and being plunged into the depth of ſhame for this his vile flight, ſo farre was he growne into horror thereof, that he reſolued to kill himſelfe: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> drawing out his ſword for that purpoſe, he was in good time preuented by his boy, who fearing that his maſter would continue in his wicked purpoſe; to aſſure his life, hee tooke away his ſword and poynard from him, which the other willingly ſuffered him to doe, diſſembling that which gladly hee would haue executed. The boy not thinking of any other thing, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe of his maſters life, by reaſon of his weapons which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, tooke no further care nor reſpect to him. But this ſouldiour perceiuing the little account that his ſeruant made of him, faining to repoſe himſelfe a little out of the way, commaunded that he ſhould there attend. Whileſt the boy had no other regard of him, it was not long but, that he fell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> on ſleepe, being drowſie and wearie of his iourney. And when his maſter ſawe himſelfe alone, hee preſently charged his harquebuze, and ſet the mouth of the peece againſt his ſtomacke, and diſcharged it with his foote, which ſhot him quite through, ſo that within a ſhort time after he gaue vp the ghoſt; and ſo long as his life laſted, he did no other thing but inſtantly deſire his boy (who at the noyſe came running thither) that he would finiſh the killing of him, it being not fitting (ſaid he) that a man ſhould liue, who ſo diſhonourably was fled, and eſpecially being meerely ignorant for what cauſe, and vpon what occaſion hee had ſo done: and with theſe words the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſoule departed out of his bodie. Behold here the tragedie of this vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate iourney, (which wee haue before deſcribed) which was the beginning and an vntimely forewarning of al the future and miſerable accidents which happened in this yeere 1552.</p>

And although his Maieſties Ambaſſadours directly informed the Pope of the cauſe, for which he was put to death, his Holines notwithſtanding for all that would not be appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, demaunding whether Frier <hi>George</hi> was of that bad diſpoſition as they deciphered him, and wherefore did their maſter write in his behalfe, for him to be a Cardinall, and being one, why did he tolerate him to bee ſlaine: and furthermore, for that he aſſured all the Colledge of Cardinals of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fidelitie, and endeuour which hee had manifeſted againſt the Turkes, to the profit and commoditie of Chriſtendome: for which good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> reports, he could by no meanes be induced to beleeue that he was now fallen into that crime, whereof he was accuſed: but rather that he was ſlaine by enuie, and to rob him of his treaſure and moueables, which were more worth then 300000. crownes: which in reſpect he was a Cardinall, <note place="margin">The moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of a Cardinall dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inteſtate, belong to the Pope.</note> and dying inteſtate, they did of right belong to the Apoſtolike Sea. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the Pope and Cardinals could not be ſilent concerning this, that with ſuch ignominie had laid hands vpon the blood of a Cardinall, which by no meanes they could ſupport or digeſt, in reſpect of the reuerend degree and honour due to that calling, and to giue example to others not to attempt the like enormitie. Thus they grieuouſly being incenſed againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Pope by no meanes would ſuſpend the excommunication: yet in the end, at the earneſt inſtance of his Ambaſſadours, he was contented and agreed, that three Cardinals with the Deane (who was the Cardinall of Trany) ſhould enquire and take notice of this fact, and ſhould ſee whether the death of Frier <hi>George</hi> had been vniuſtly proceeded in or no, and that they ſhould ſend appointed men to Vienna, and into thoſe countries, to informe him of the offence; and that in the meane time the Friers moueables ſhould be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the name, and to the vſe of the Apoſtolike Chamber. Againſt this laſt demaund of the Pope, the Ambaſſadours obiected, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had alreadie diſpoſed of the ſaid moueables, as well to pay his ſouldiours, as for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> other neceſſarie occaſions concerning the warre which daily he had againſt the Turks, and that they were not of that great value, nor ſo goodly and rich as was ſaid, but farre inclining to a meaner proportion. This accord being thus concluded, there were preſently ſome diſpatched to iourney to Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, to informe and inquire out the cauſe, and to proceede therein. To theſe Commiſſioners, his Maieſties agents failed not to manifeſt the infidelitie of the Frier, and how hee would haue accorded with the Turke, and purloyne <note place="margin">Information of George his death.</note> Tranſiluania from Chriſtendome, and make himſelfe abſolute Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in paying tribute to the Infidels, and (as happely it was diſcouered by many of his letters writ to diuers Lords of the Turkes Court) to maſſacre all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> thoſe who in his Maieſties name were vnder the conduct of <hi>Caſtalde.</hi> And to agrauate the matter the more, they produced many horrible facts, and the death of certaine perſons.</p>
            <p>Againſt ſuch accuſations, the Pope in defence of the Frier obiected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and among others produced certaine letters of the Grand Viccar
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21983:102"/>
of Albe-iula, and of certaine other perſons, who aſſured him that he was ſlaine by the enuie and wickednes of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Captaines, who doubting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that he meant to reeſtabliſh in the kingdome King <hi>Iohns</hi> ſonne; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to tolerate that he was ſo plauſible and popular; and that they were in ſo little eſteeme with him; and that hee diſpoſed of all things as abſolute Lord of the countrie, without conferring with them of the particularities; to thruſt him out from among them, and to vſurpe his poſſeſſions, that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely they might haue the commaund, they accuſed him to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of treaſon, who too lightly repoſing credit in them, conſented that hee ſhould be thus cruelly ſlaine, it being afterward very apparant, that this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was not inuented, but only to ſpoyle him of his treaſure and moueables, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there neuer yet falling out any matter, which could in any thing blemiſh or obſcure his honour.</p>
            <p>Whileſt vpon theſe particularities many aſſemblies were in the Deanes houſe, and that the Comiſſaries went to Vienna to inquire the manner of this ſaid fact, <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> was created Vayuode of Tranſiluania, and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Andrew Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Vayuode of Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note>

               <hi>Loſonze</hi> went from thence with them to Themeſuar, to repayre the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that towne; and the Vayuode tooke regard to the affayres of the kingdome.</p>
            <p>Now it was alreadie diuulged in all parts, that <hi>Solyman</hi> had made <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Baſha</hi> (his Lieutenant generall) to come and beſiege the townes of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſuar <note place="margin">Mahomet Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha commeth againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania.</note> and Lippa, and that he was onward on his way at Belgrade, where he amaſſed together a great armie to inuade that countrie. It was alſo euery where certainly bruited, that the Vayuode of Moldauia prepared the like to enter into the kingdome about Braſſouia. About the ſame time arriued in Tranſiluania the Counte of <hi>Helfeſtaine</hi> with 4000. old Germane ſouldiours, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bringing with him tenne peeces of Artillerie. By him <hi>Ferdinand</hi> writ to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde,</hi> that very ſhortly he would ſend him 1500. men of armes, and 7. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies more of Germanes, and that the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce Palauicin</hi> ſhould alſo within a ſhort time bee with him with 3000. Italians and 2000. Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſouldiours, and with as many Caualarie as poſſible he could ſend him. Whileſt theſe preparations were directing on the one partie, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> and the Vayuode on the other made a decree, by which it was commaunded that all the gentlemen of the countrie ſhould aſſemble at the towne of Torde, and <note place="margin">A Diet at Torde.</note> there to aduiſe and determine for the defence of the countrie, vnderſtanding that <hi>Mahomet</hi> determined to enter at the ſame time in diuers places with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> two armies: to wit, with his owne armie by the low Marches; and with the Moldauian armie by Braſſouia. All the Nobilitie being (according to this commaundement) aſſembled, order was giuen for neceſſaries, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the publike weale; and it was concluded that the townes of Lippa and Themeſuar ſhould be well furniſhed with men and victuals, and that the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21983:103"/>
fortification ſhould with all expedition be preſently reared, for that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie might finde it well defended, and that the greateſt force of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſhould be aſſembled together, as the ancient cuſtome was in ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, and that they ſhould be mingled with thoſe who were in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> pay, and that of all they ſhould make but one armie, with which they were to march directly againſt the Moldauian, to hinder him from entering into that quarter, where there was not any ſtrong place to withſtand him, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Segheſuar, which neuertheleſſe was not of that force that it could reſiſt <note place="margin">Segheſuar.</note> nor hinder him, but that at the firſt vollic of the Cannon he muſt needes alſo be maſter of Braſſouia, which was a towne of as great importance as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Braſſouia.</note> in Tranſiluania; and that likewiſe he ſhould not burne the Prouince of Seculia, poſſeſſed by the Sicilians, and in the middeſt of the kingdome. This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> bruite and feare, although it had not brought with it any other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience then a fabulous report, yet was it ſufficient to infuſe a dreadful amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the minds of the inhabitants, inſomuch that euery one with great loſſe did alreadie begin to retire to ſome other aboades, and abandon their owne homes and goods. And for that Torde was a place ſtrongly ſituated, <note place="margin">Torde.</note> commodious and abounding in all manner of victuals, it was concluded that there ſhould bee the <hi>Rende vous</hi> for the armie, and that thither ſhould come the Vayuode to receiue the ſouldiours according as they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The gentlemen of the countrie being ſpeedily departed, with charge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and commiſſion to bring as many men as euery one was rated at: and being now arriued amongſt their people, with great expedition (obſeruing their commiſſion) they performed their charge, and began to march with their people to be there at the prefixed time and place.</p>
            <p>Whileſt they were thus aſſembling, there happened a memorable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which I would not omit to ſpeake of. There was at Torde an ancient cuſtome, and which yet continueth; and that is, that if the husband findeth his wife in adulterie, he may cauſe her there to bee publikely executed, in manner as I will ſpeake of: and alſo on the contrarie, if the wife finde her husband in the ſame fault, ſhe may purſue that againſt him, which he would doe againſt her. It happened then at that time, that a certaine Tayler who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
               <note place="margin">The cuſtome betweene the husband and wife touching adulteric.</note> was of Varadin, named <hi>Paul,</hi> found his wife in bed with one of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and purſuing the cuſtome of the ſaid towne, he accuſed her of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and hauing proued the offence, it was permitted him to haue the courſe of law, to cut off her head with a Sable in the middeſt of the market place. She being brought thither by her husband, and by the courſe of Iuſtice, and the appointed houre being come for this execution; ſhe with teares and ſighs kneeling downe before him, began pitifully to deſire that hee would pardon her notorious fault, faithfully promiſing him, that from that time Forward, ſhe would hold his honour moſt deare, and that he ſhould neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> hereafter haue any occaſion to bee offended againſt her; and that it would pleaſe him to giue her her life, in regard of the kinde affection which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bore her, during the time ſhe liued in good reputation, and that ſhe would euer after ſerue him, not as a husband, but as her Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. (Good) <hi>Paul</hi> being ſurpriſed by theſe her wofull ſpeeches, and moued
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21983:103"/>
by a (natural) kindnes to pitie, was content to pardon her, exhorting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> her to become a dutifull and louing wife: whereupon he abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remitting all her hainous offence, tooke her to him againe. When within a while after it happened that this (dutifull) wife found her ſaid husband <hi>Paul</hi> in adulterie with a young wench: whereupon ſhe accuſed him to the Iuſtice, who cauſing him to be apprehended, appointed that he ſhould bee put into his wiues power, to execute him according to the foreſaid manner. She hauing brought him with officers to the deputed place, hee kneeled downe, and there (good kinde <hi>Paul)</hi> pitifully intreated her that ſhe would pardon him his offence; thinking that ſhe would neuer bee ſo vnkinde or cruell to him, but that ſhe would vſe the like counterchange of mercie, as he before in his owne behalfe had done to her. But by no meanes ſhe would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> once vouchſafe to hearken to his complaints, but like an vngrateful monſter, <note place="margin">Saue one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gallowes, and he will ſeeke to hang thee.</note> forgetting all loue, and the fauours which ſhe had receiued of him, not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with any loue or pitie, but followed the extremitie of the law of the place, lifting vp her arme on high, hauing a Sable in her hand, wherewith ſhe gaue him a blow vpon the necke, and like an inraged Bitch ſhe killed (kind) <hi>Paul.</hi> For this his death all the towne was greatly incenſed againſt her mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous ingratitude, cenſuring her to be very cruell, for ſo requiting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good deede which ſhe had receiued of her husband: and if ſhe had not preſently fled from thence, ſhe had receiued ſome ſiniſter and condigne inconuenience. And this ſeemed to many ſo vile an act, that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> endeuoured to aboliſh this foule and infamous cuſtome. But by no meanes it could bee done, for that it was of long continuance in that place.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſent Counte <hi>Iohn Baptiſtad' Archo,</hi> in place of <note place="margin">Iohn Baptiſta of Archo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>While theſe things were in doing, Sibinio (the capitall towne of the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) offered to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> all the ſuccours and victuals which he ſhould need of againſt the Belerbey, yea, both of ſouldiours and money: for which their
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21983:104"/>
kindnes he gaue them many heartie thankes, and entertaining their offers, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> willed them to bee in a readines, vpon any neceſſitie which ſhould bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Thus as Fortune at her pleaſure ouerthrew the decrees and enterpriſes of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Lieutenants and Captaines, with extreame daunger: ſo did ſhe in like manner play her part worſe in Germanie, where then was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the Romanes in the towne of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purch. Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> of Saxonie (an Elector of the Empire) incenſed againſt <note place="margin">Duke Mauris of Saxonie confederate with the King of France, raiſeth forces againſt the Emperour Charles.</note> the ſaid Emperour, for that he would not deliuer the Lantgraue his father in law, who with Duke <hi>Frederick</hi> of Saxonie were detained priſoners, thinking that they had not performed their words, and finding himſelfe to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iniuried, he was determined, in ſome ſort whatſoeuer, to ſet them at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> being the rather incited thereunto, for that his ſaid father in law was come to the Court, vnder the ſafegard of his word, crediting the Emperours fidelitie, in promiſing to ſet him at libertie within a while after: who ſeeing it was not performed in a yeere, nor many moneths after, and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee thus mocked and abuſed: before hee came to that, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was conſtrained to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh, he went to ſeek <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at Lintz, to intreate him that it would pleaſe his Maieſtie to negotiate with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſo much, that he would not derogate from his faithfull promiſe, but ſet his father in law at libertie. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was for the ſame occaſion come to Iſpurch, and conferring with the Emperour his brother about the requeſt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Duke <hi>Mauris,</hi> he could by no meanes draw any other thing from him, but onely a good hope of a ſpeedie deliuerie. But <hi>Mauris</hi> eſteeming of this as of a vaine hope, preſently practiſed with <hi>William,</hi> the ſonne of the ſaid Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue, and with the Duke of Mechelburge, and other Princes and kinſmen, as well of his father in lawes, as of the ſaid Duke of Saxonie: with whom making a firme and reſolute confederacie, ſeeing by loue and fayre intreaties they could not ſet theſe priſoners at libertie, but to deliuer them by force of armes, he made (by the ayd &amp; aſſiſtance of his confederates, and other ſecret enemies of the Emperour) a good ſtrong armie, hauing firſt negotiated and compacted with <hi>Henry</hi> King of France, that the ſaid King ſhould enter into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Germanie, to vphold and maintaine his affayres. According to this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the King of France deſirous to aſſiſt the Duke, and greatly aſpiring to the Empire, failed not to bee preſent at the promiſed time with great forces. And on the other ſide, <hi>Mauris</hi> couertly brought his Campe to a little towne, which was but a mile from Spire, from whence with all diligence he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards Chiouze, and towards the Caſtle of Ambergh, which belonged to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and by the mountaines and other difficult paſſages, rude and vnknowne in the night time, in great ſilence he marched ſo farre, that then he thought he had the meanes and oportunitie to come in vpon the backes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of the Emperours people, and to cleere the way that might hinder and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his ſafetie. Thus being arriued on the ſudden at Chiouze, he ſeazed on the gate thereof, which is betweene two mountaines in a deepe vallie, from whence hauing beaten the guard, he meant alſo to poſſeſſe the Caſtle. But being brauely defended by thoſe within, he could not make himſelfe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21983:104"/>
maſter thereof: whereupon leauing certaine people before it, hee went with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> incredible diligence to Iſpurch, where was the Emperour and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who being aduertiſed of this ſudden noueltie, and greatly aſtoniſhed, not knowing what to doe in ſuch an vnlooked for accident of fortune, ſeeing themſelues diſarmed of forces, determined for his better ſecuritie to retire towards Carinthia. And thus the Emperor departing in the night in a Litter, ſomewhat ſickly, with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by Torch-light, he took the way of Villach, a towne ſituated vpon the riuer of Drauus: where being arriued, they ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there certaine daies, to ſee what courſe Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> tooke: who being now arriued in Iſpurch, and not finding the Emperour there (who the night before was fled from that place) would not that any ſhould offer violence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there, nor to no other place belonging to the King of the Romanes. Being a little from Iſpurch, there came to him a gentleman of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> retinue, to know the occaſion that incited him to take armes againſt the Emperour, and what his meaning was, and for what occaſion he poſſeſſed certaine places of his, and entered into them as a publike enemie, and not as a friend. To theſe demaunds <hi>Mauris</hi> anſwered him, that he was not come to offend the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, nor to withhold any of his townes or Lordſhips from him, neither had he taken armes againſt him, but onely againſt his enemies and aduerſaries; among whom were the Biſhop of Arras, the Duke of Albe, and certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councellors of the Emperour, who were ſaid to be in that quarter, and whom he would purſue and take, if it were poſſible: and that concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his ſacred Maieſtie, he had no other meaning but a good and ſincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and if he could not meete the ſaid enemies by the 25. of May next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, hee would retire his armie, without offending him in the leaſt thing whatſoeuer, and that hee would haue reſpect to his ſubiects, as to his owne, and that afterwards he would bee at the Diet, which his Maieſtie had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, hoping (that being there, with many Princes and States) there might be made ſome good peace and reconciliation betweene the Emperour and him.</p>
            <p>Whileſt this accord was treated of betweene <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Mauris,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> King of France ſtill aduanced himſelfe to further the proceedings of <hi>Mauris,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The King of France com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note> when newes was brought him that <hi>Martin Roſtan</hi> was entered with a great armie into Piccardie and Champagne, where he made great ſpoyle &amp; waſte, and had fiered three townes, and burned almoſt twentie Caſtles, putting all to fire and ſword, and that with great iourneys he marched towards Paris. By occaſion of this newes, the King was conſtrained (maugre his liking, and for all Fortune ſeemed to ſmile on him) to returne backe and defend his owne. Thus he who thought to make himſelfe maſter of anothers, was in danger to loſe his owne: and hauing left and retired from Germanie, hee forced <hi>Roſtan</hi> to returne and leaue his countrie at libertie, which was alreadie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> greatly aſtoniſhed, yea and euen Paris it ſelfe, which (for feare) was in great diſorder. <hi>Mauris</hi> hauing gotten little of his deſired intendment, departed from Iſpurch, and from the Countie of Tyroll, with his men: and leauing Chiouze went to the Diet, where <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelfe was incontinently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In this Diet were treated many important things, but eſpeciallie the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21983:105"/>
peace of <hi>Mauris</hi> with the Emperour, which at the intreatie of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and many other Lords, it was concluded in this manner: that the Emperour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
               <note place="margin">An agreement betweene the Emperor and Duke Mauris.</note> willingly and freely ſhould deliuer the Lantgraue to <hi>Mauris,</hi> and the Duke of Saxonie to his children, and that <hi>Mauris</hi> ſhould bee bound to goe and ſerue <hi>Ferdinand</hi> againſt the Turke with 12000. Lanſquenets, and 3000. horſe all the whole ſummer. This concluſion ended, with many other articles, <hi>Mauris</hi> diſmiſſed his ſouldiours, and the Lantgraues children went from thence with their people againſt a Captaine named <hi>Henſtain,</hi> who in the Emperours name was entered into the land of Heſſe, and who had defeated and ouerthrowne in battaile the Counte of Odemburg, who was in the field with 16. Germane Enſignes. But in regard of that ouerthrow, the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> children were forced to retire to their places of more ſecuritie; and Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> ſent the reſt of his armie to raiſe the ſiege from before Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg in Saxonie, which was beſieged by the Marqueſſe of Brandeburg and the Duke of Brunſwick. Vpon the approaching of <hi>Mauris</hi> his people, the ſiege was preſently raiſed, the towne remaining at libertie vnder certaine conditions, and then the Duke of Brunſwick, and the Marqueſſe <hi>Albert</hi> tooke the Emperours part, with Counte <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and came to ſerue his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie againſt France with 15.

            <p>Behold the end of theſe tumults, which greatly blemiſhed the renowne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and glorie of ſo great an Emperour, inſomuch that it may ſeeme almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him (who would but conſider his puiſſance, and the victories which he before had gotten) to beleeue that he ſhould bee forced to flye to Villach.

            <p>All theſe diſcords being thus appeaſed in Germanie, there began others to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſpring vp in Tranſiluania, no leſſe troubleſome and daungerous then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

theſe ſaid complaints ſhe ſent <hi>Matthias Lobosky</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to ſolicite the laſt expedition.

As for her dowrie, he aſſured her it ſhould be ſatisfied, in giuing him ſome reſpite, and that in the meane time hee would allow her ſufficient conſideration for it, as vpright men ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thinke meete: and that beſides, he would eſteeme her as his ſiſter, and would account of her ſonne, as of his owne begotten, perſwading her with good and friendly ſpeeches to liue contentedly. With this anſwer <hi>Lobosky</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, more inriched by a future hope, then a preſent effect.

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of the preſent neceſſitie he was in, deſiring him he would not faile to ſend him the 50000. men which hee promiſed, and to cauſe <hi>Palauicin</hi> to haſten himſelfe, that he ſhould with all ſpeede come vnto him, with the people and Artillerie which he could gather. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> returned him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that for that time he could not ſend him the ſuccours which hee had promiſed, in reſpect of diuers lets which of late he had in Germanie: but that hee would ſolicite <hi>Palauicin,</hi> that hee would bring his people into Tranſiuania, and would alſo ſend others, as the commoditie and neceſſitie of the time would permit him, and that he hoped that Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> would very ſhortly come himſelfe in perſon to this warre with 12000.

            <p>

In like ſort he did aduertiſe him by <hi>Don Gaſper,</hi> that he could not then ſuccour him any more, in reſpect of the few men himſelfe had, with whom he could not goe into the field againſt ſo puiſſant an armie as <hi>Mahomets</hi> was, for that he was diſappoynted of the ayd he expected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by reaſon of the late troubles happened in Germanie, and that he had no other Infantric vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> whom he might truſt, but a few Spanyards who remained vnto him, with 4000. Germanes which lately were come to him, and 1000. men of armes: therefore he willed him that he ſhould rampier and fortifie himſelfe the beſt he could, and prepare himſelfe for the defence of that towne, which in the end would be the onely fountaine and cauſe of all his glorie and reputation: and that he ſhould not expect to bee relieued by thoſe of the countrie (who ſhould preſently be aſſembled) for that they were not eſteemed ſuch that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truſt was to be repoſed in them: and therefore he ſent him word, that it was requiſite that in any caſe hee ſhould make of neceſſitie a vertue, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſo much the rather, becauſe he ſaw himſelfe conſtrained to march with thoſe few men which he had, againſt the Vayuode of Moldauia, who would enter into Tranſiluania by Braſſouia, where he had not any Fortreſſe to ſtay him; thoſe of the countrie ſuppoſing that the damage which they ſhould receiue on that ſide would bee greater, then that which <hi>Mahomet</hi> could bring vnto

him about Themeſuar, by reaſon of the ſtrong places which were in that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> quarter, and for the commoditie which was there to reſiſt him: for which conſiderations he was forced to march againſt the Moldauian, to withſtand him from entering into the countrie, and from the poſſeſſion of that towne, and to goe into the field with as great force as he could, and that beſides he was conſtrained to doe this, except he would ſee the kingdome vtterly loſt, and becauſe of the little content which he perceiued in the hearts of euery one, whom he ſaw more inclined to a reuolt then a defence: and alſo becauſe he knew that this quarter was more commodious and fit for aduantages to keepe the field with a few men, by reaſon of woods, mountaines, and other hard paſſages, then was that about Lippa or Themeſuar: for which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and aduantages, he not any thing feared the Moldauian, much leſſe his Caualarie, which he doubted not but with his Infantrie to defeate and force them recoyle. And whereas he could not come to relieue him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a like armie to that of <hi>Mahomets,</hi> that he and <hi>Don Gaſper</hi> ſhould doe their vttermoſt deuoyre to defend themſelues, and valiantly to reſiſt the enemie in that quarter, whileſt he of his part ſhould make reſiſtance againſt the Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauian, aſſuring him, that if his enterpriſe did fortunately ſucceede, (as hee truſted in God it would) he would preſently come to ſuccour him with as great an armie as hee could: and although hee might not come neere vnto Themeſuar, for that the enemie was very ſtrong, yet he would lodge neere to Lippa, where, cauſing a trench to be digged, going from thence to Solimos, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he would not (by reaſon of that Fortreſſe) feare the Turkiſh armie, thinking aſſuredly to ſeate his Campe in ſuch a ſure place, that the ſituation thereof ſhould be able to defend him againſt the violence of the enemie, hauing on the left hand the riuer Maroſſe, and on the right the high mountaines; from whence he well hoped to be ſo offenſiue to the enemie, that he would either conſtraine him to retire, or elſe ſomewhat neglect the ſiege, inſomuch that he ſhould be able to relieue and preſerue it: earneſtly importuning them both to be of good courage, and in like ſort to perſwade all the Spanyards whom he intreated, to remember what they were, and to thinke vpon that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they were wont brauely to performe when they were in ſuch wars as theſe, which through all the world had gained to them the name of valour, which they ought now to maintaine without ſpot or blemiſh, eſteeming this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe no leſſe glorious to them, then the former on his owne part; aſſuring himſelfe that they would no leſſe vertuouſly performe that now, then that which they had alwaies performed in ſuch honourable exploytes. Beſides, he ſent them certaine aduertiſements very profitable and neceſſarie, how they ſhould behaue and gouerne themſelues in fights and aſſaults which ſhould bee offered them: and for that they were young and of little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he intreated them continually and onely to thinke vpon this, that he who fighteth couragiouſly to the end, doth maintaine his life in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe directions were giuen on the one ſide, <hi>Aldene</hi> on the other informed <hi>Caſtalde</hi> that hee was in meane eſtate, and that hee could not any <note place="margin">Aldene faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted.</note> longer remaine at Lippa to take charge thereof, and that he ſhould ſend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21983:107"/>
in his place to take that charge. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> conceiued of this with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for that the time was ſo ſhort that hardly he could make prouiſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> conſidering that this was to incourage the enemie, and quaile his owne people, ſeeing before their eyes ſuch a Chieftaine to forſake that Fortreſſe, and that another ſhould come thereinto for defence, conſidering that ſuch a worthie man for his owne honour was come to keepe and defend it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he returned him anſwer, that if he thought not himſelf ſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Lippa, for feare of the Baſha (although it was now ſomewhat late) hee ſhould giue him notice thereof, for that he would ſend ſuch an one thither, who ſhould defend it. <hi>Aldene</hi> remembring himſelfe of the fault which he had committed, and chaunging his opinion ſent him word, that ſeeing he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> was now reſident in the towne, he doubted not but to defend it. Theſe things thus concluded on, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> preſently departed from Torde and went to Coloſuar, there to aſſemble the ſouldiours that were in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> pay, and which were ſent him, in like ſort giuing aduertiſement to the Counte of Helfeſtaine, that he ſhould ſpeedily repayre to him with his Regiment of 4000. Germanes, ſending him two payes of foure which they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. He alſo ſent to <hi>Zena</hi> (Generall of all the ſouldiours in that countrie) that he ſhould preſently and with all ſpeede he could come to him, becauſe he waited for no more but him, that ſo he might march into the field.</p>
            <p>As theſe preparations (which we haue ſpoken of) were in hand in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the meane time (leauing Belgrade behinde him) was <note place="margin">The armie of Mahomet Baſha.</note> now betweene the two riuers, and had alreadie erected a bridge vpon Tibiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. He had in his Campe 100000. men, and 60. peeces of Artillerie, among which were thirtle double Cannons. With him alſo came the Belerbey of Greece, who the yeere before was Lieutenant generall in that countrie for the Grand Seigniour, and he brought with him vnder his conduct 20000. horſe. He had alſo another great Captaine with him named <hi>Caſſombaſſa,</hi> who likewiſe conducted 15000. horſe, and 2000. Tartars, who anciently were called Scythians, which are a warlike people, cruel, and greatly redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Tartars.</note> by theſe nations, and they fight on horſebacke with Bow and arrowes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Sable and Mace.</p>
            <p>The enemies being in this place, the ſouldiours of the kingdome were in a manner aſſembled altogether, when Counte of Helfeſtaine arriued with his Germanes, being halfe in a mutinie, and they were that night lodged in one of the Suburbes of the towne, which were very great. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> minding to depart, theſe by no meanes would diſlodge; but mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tining, they ſeazed on the Artillerie, (as their cuſtome is, not willing to take one pay for two, which was due to them, which alone ſhould then haue bin payed them) and after they imbattailed themſelues to poſſeſſe and ſacke the towne. And vpon this reſolution they began to batter on the top of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
               <note place="margin">Coloſuar bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Germane mutiners.</note> walles. Which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſeeing, and that this was not done counterfeitly, he ſent to the inhabitants that they ſhould defend themſelues. Whereupon they betaking themſelues to armes, and comming to the walles, they began to diſcarge their Artillerie and good Harquebuzes among the Germanes, making a great ſlaughter of them: who ſeeing themſelues put into diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb facs="tcp:21983:107"/>

            <p>Behold how in this yeere began the diſcord amongſt vs, as though the comming of two ſuch puiſſant armies againſt vs, was not ſufficient to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchecke our turbulent ſpirits, but we of our ſelues by another warre, worſe then the firſt, muſt ouerthrow and make hauocke of one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> being buſied at Torde, in aſſembling his men to march againſt the Moldauian, who had alreadie paſſed the mountaines with 40000. men, <note place="margin">The armie of the Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian.</note> and entered into the countrie of Braſſouia, newes was brought him how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> hauing paſſed Tibiſcus, not without great difficultie, was alreadie incamped with all his armie before Themeſuar, and that from S. <hi>Iohns</hi> day <note place="margin">Themeſuar beſieged by Mahomet.</note> vntill that preſent, he did batter it in three places with 70. peeces of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and that thoſe within did brauely defend themſelues with great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it was alreadie twelue daies ſince the batterie neither cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed day nor night, and that it ſtill continued. This newes was brought to him by a Spanyard, conſorted with a Rhatian ſouldiour, being both appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled after one manner, and were in the night departed from Themeſuar, being commaunded to come to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> to demaund a new ſupplie of men, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for that the Artillerie had ſlaine many of them. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> vpon this report preſently diſpatched a meſſenger for <hi>Ottomiall,</hi> who then was at Iula, (a very <note place="margin">Ottomiall.

The
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:21983:108"/>
Counte had ſo well ordered his people, and thoſe which were left him of Counte <hi>Felixd' Archo</hi> (who in Ianuarie laſt was gone to Vienna) that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as the enemies ranged in that place, they ſuffered not any of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne aliue, and he continuing ſtill victorious, and valiantly fighting, gaue them ſo many routes and ouerthrowes, that they ſcarcely any more durſt ſo ſuddenly aſſaile our men, as they were wont. And among other ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes which the enemies receiued, there was one which partly happened through the Countes prowes, for that the Moldauian retired himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde: and it fortuned in this ſort. Counte <hi>Iohn Baptiſte</hi> was aduertiſed that a troupe of Moldauians (among which were 300.

This multitude then of Barbarians preſenting themſelues vpon theſe paſſages, and hauing paſſed them, they managed and ranged about the towne, and were preſently aſſailed by a ſtrong troupe of horſe and foote, who ſallied foorth to skirmiſh with them, and were ſo hotly charged, that they were forced to retire more then ordinarie: and comming to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which I haue ſpoken, they were in ſuch ſort aſſailed behinde, without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> thinking thereupon by thoſe who were in ambuſcado, that being incloſed betweene them, they were ſo throughly beaten, that there remained neither Moldauian, Tartar, nor Turke aliue, nor any who could carrie newes to the Moldauian of their ouerthrow, they being all either ſlaine or taken priſoners in the ſtraites: and in token of this victorie, thoſe of Braſſouia ſent three wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons laden with thoſe heads (who were ſlaine) to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> who was neere approached to the Moldauian, and ſo boldly, that the enemy thought he had more men then was reported vnto him, not being able to perſwade himſelf, that a man of that qualitie (as was <hi>Caſtalde)</hi> durſt appeare in the field, except <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> his armie were of more ſtrength, or at the leaſt equall to his. Vpon this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he was not ſo hardie to attend him, but ſpeedily and with ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order retired, that he loſt many men in his retraict, and had loſt more in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">The retraict of the Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauian.</note> paſſage for his Artillerie through the mountaines, if happely Counte <hi>Iohn Baptiſte</hi> had had more men to haue followed him, ſeeing 500. horſe which onely purſued him, had been ſufficient to haue put him in diſorder and into ſuch hazard, that little would haue wanted but he would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all his Artillerie to the chance and hazard of fortune. And if the Sicilians had then done their deuoire, and ſhewed themſelues ſuch as they ſhould haue done, moſt certaine that day was come wherein the Moldauian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> had loſt his armie, his kingdome, together with his life, and Tranſiluania had been no more moleſted on that ſide: and this defeature might haue been a happie preſident for others neuer to attempt the like inuaſion. Vpon the newes of this retraict, it was reported that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> would diſlodge from Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſuar, where he remained, vnderſtanding that the enemie had not diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

his Campe, but that he with his people were incamped on the other ſide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the mountaines, by reaſon whereof he was conſtrained to ſoiourne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies in that towne, and there to expect what the Moldauian would doe: for that if he ſhould then depart from thence, the other would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returne againe into Tranſiluania, (as for certaine he vnderſtood) and in reſpect of that feare and ſuſpition, he durſt not yet depart, ſo that he could not march to the reliefe of Themeſuar.</p>
            <p>Being thus ſtayed, continually there came aduertiſements to him by the way of Caranſebeſſe and Lippa, that the affayres of Themeſuar were in bad <note place="margin">Themeſuar in bad termes.</note> tearmes, in reſpect of thoſe who were within, who had parlied with the Turkes, who told them that the ſuccours of the 400.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had ſent them, vnder the conduct of <hi>Ottomiall,</hi> were defeated and cut in <note place="margin">Ottomiall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the Turkes.</note> peeces by them.

At the ſame inſtant newes was brought that the Turkes had ſlaine Captaine <hi>Don Gaſper,</hi> whoſe companie was giuen to <hi>Roderic Viglian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drando,</hi> with command to endeuour himſelfe to enter into Themeſuar, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering they were in danger to periſh, and for no other cauſe then that there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was not any to gouerne them. They ſent thither alſo with him Captaine <hi>Andrew Lopez</hi> with his companie, and 200. Germane Harquebuziers, to whom <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſaid, that he well knew this enterpriſe was difficult, ſpecially conſidering the enemies being very vigilant to hinder that no ſuccours could enter into Themeſuar: and that they were very glad that thoſe Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duchs, which <hi>Ottomiall</hi> brought vnder his conduct to the reliefe of that towne, paſſed by the edge of the ſword: and that neuertheleſſe whatſoeuer hee ſhould doe in this behalfe, was to no other purpoſe but that hee might faithfully diſcharge his dutie, &amp; not giue any occaſion to detracting tongues to cenſure hardly of him: and that to that end to relieue this towne (either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by one meanes or other) he ſent them, greatly relying himſelfe in the good eſteeme which he conceiued of their manhoods; aſſuring himſelfe that they would to the vttermoſt endeuour themſelues to enter therein, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them would now vſe this commendable wiſedome, which euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this preſent was worthily noted in them, promiſing them, that within ſhort time with as great force as he could leauie, he would come and lodge by the Caſtle of Lippa, to the end, that if the affayres of Themeſuar did bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceede, thoſe of Lippa ſhould at the leaſt be preſerued, and that towne (which ſo much imported the good and commoditie of euery one) ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bee maintained and kept. Theſe Captaines thus diſpatched, departed with their people. But the diligence and care of <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſerued to ſmall purpoſe at that time: for vpon the ſame day in which they tooke leaue of <hi>Caſtalde, Francis Henriquez</hi> (who a little before was ſent to ſee how Lippa was victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, munitioned, and fortified) arriued with newes of the taking of Themeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar. <note place="margin">Themeſuar taken by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homer.</note>

The loſſe whereof made euery one very grieuous and heauie, as well for the loue and regard they bore to thoſe valiant and excellent ſouldiours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> who were within, as alſo for that it vntimely happened by the negligent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Captaines. Vpon this griefe of minde, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> did indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently comfort himſelfe, vnderſtanding that <hi>Aldene</hi> ſhewed himſelfe to haue good courage valiantly to defend Lippa, and that the ſouldiours deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more, then that the Baſha would come and ſalute them, that they might make him vnderſtand what their valour and courage was, and the deſire they had to winne honor and renowne againſt him, and that they were all reſolued to dye within it, rather then to ſee themſelues brought to ſuch an end, as was happened to thoſe of Themeſuar: the loſſe whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> I will here ſet downe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loſonze</hi> being Commaunder within this towne, with ſuch a number of <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſiege of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſuar.</note> men, as before is ſaid, and imploying himſelfe the beſt he could for the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereof: which for the contrarieties and hatreds, proceeding from the concurrence of qualities, and from ſome other precedent cauſe, could not be ſo well munitioned as it was neceſſarie; for that <hi>Aldene</hi> (for the foreſaid oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) had conuerted all the money to the affayres of Lippa, leauing this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortreſſe vnder the mercie and protection of Fortune. As one day at the riſing of the Sunne he walked about the towne to viſit it, <hi>Mahomet</hi> (the 24. of Iuly, which was dedicated to the feaſt of S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt)</hi> then preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> himſelfe with his Vauntgard, which was 15000. horſe, conducted by <hi>Caſſombaſſa.</hi> He preſently cauſed to take notice of the ſituation of the towne, wherein was built fiue Bulwarkes of earth, ſome whereof were alreadie mounted to the heigth of the wall, but that which was lower was raiſed no higher then the length of an Halbert and a halfe: and of all theſe there were two very defencible, and the other were but in a meane. There was with <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Belerbey of Greece, who was greatly practiſed and perfect in that countrie. As they were thus arriued within the ſight of Themeſuar, he ſaid to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> behold a part of the towne, the Spanyards who are within will ſhew you the reſt: and marching about it, <hi>Alphonſe Perez de Saianedra</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> preſently ſallied forth with 400. horſe, and 100. Spaniſh Haquebuziers, and began to skirmiſh with the Turkes, entertaining them vntill they themſelues were forced to retire. Vpon the 27. day following, all the Campe arriued with ſo great cryes, neighing of horſes, clattering of armour, ſounding of Drummes and Trumpets, that it ſeemed the world would haue turned top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie turuie, and preſented themſelues before our people in ſtrong and fearfull ſquadrons, with great ſtore of Artillerie: whereof thoſe within ſeemed to make little account of, but receiuing them with a bloodie ſallie, they gaue them ſufficient notice of the little eſteeme they conceiued of their proud and contemptuous puiſſance: but for all this their gallant reſolution, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> deſiſted not to incampe, lodging his people round about the towne, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſo ſtraightly enuironing it, that not a man could enter in, to their reliefe, but onely by certaine mariſhes, where it could not ſo well be beſieged, but that our people might enter in thereby. Vpon their approaching our people oppoſed themſelues with a gallant reſolution, and for the ſpace of ſixe daies
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21983:109"/>
they made continuall ſallies vpon the enemie, not without great effuſion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> blood, during which time they aſſured the Suburbes. But in the end <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> vrged them hard, and cauſed thirtie great peeces of Artillerie, and many other leſſer, to batter the defences, and made three batteries, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle, another againſt the towne-gate, which was not walled, and the third againſt the Bulwarke: which for that it was of leaſt ſtrength, was defended by the Spanyards. They in this ſort battered the towne eight whole daies, and not any of the beſieged making ſigne of faintnes, and ſo long vntill they appertly ſawe the great ruine which the Artillerie had made, and that the towne in many parts was as it were all open, and that they had loſt many a braue ſouldiour in two aſſaults which the Turkes had giuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them, of whom were remaining within the Ditch more then two thouſand, and many wounded. <hi>Lonſonze</hi> knowing then they could not long hold out, and that all the towne was ſorely bruſed and battered by the Cannon, and that a good part of the Bulwarks, which maintained and defended the wall, were beaten to the ground, called to him all the Captaines, imparting to them the daunger wherein they were, and how within a ſhort time they were likely to fall vnder the edge of the ſword, or mercie of the enemies. And he told them, that before <hi>Mahomet</hi> had paſſed Danubius, the Vayuod of the Tranſalpinians on his part wrote to him, that the Campe had not come into thoſe quarters, if <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had meant to haue payed <hi>Solyman</hi> the tribute, which <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> was wont yeerely to pay him for the Countie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Themeſuar; to whom he would giue no anſwer, nor aduertiſe <hi>Caſtalde</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he beleeuing they were deuiſes and brauadoes of the Baſha, as he was accuſtomed to doe, thinking with himſelfe that he would not come thither with ſo great force, to content himſelfe with that which another declared vnto him. But ſeeing himſelfe deceiued in his opinion, and conſidering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a miſerable condition they were like to fall into, if the batterie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, he ſaid to them: that he was of opinion, they ſhould ſend to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha to obtaine truce of him for foure daies, during which time they might aduertiſe <hi>Caſtalde</hi> of all the accidents, and ſolicite him to conſent to pay the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yeerely tribute to the Turke, vpon condition he would raiſe his Campe and retire: and ſo by that meanes happely they ſhould giue remedie to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed fortunes. This aduice was approued by ſome, and refuted by many others, as vſually it happeneth in councels, where is daily ſeene ſome contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties among opinions, in reſpect of the reaſons and arguments which are alleadged either of the one part or other: in regard whereof, they could determine nothing that day.</p>
            <p>The 3. of Iuly the Baſha on the Caſtle ſide and towards the towne-gate, cauſed to be giuen an hot and fierce aſſault, which endured foure long houres, with the death of more then 1500. of the aſſailants, and about ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 150. of thoſe within. In this aſſault <hi>Loſonze</hi> with the other Spaniſh and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Captaines valiantly defended themſelues, and forced the enemies to retire to their Tents. After this retraict, and that all our people were dreſſed of their wounds, and ſomewhat refreſhed, all the Captaines were againe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in councell to determine vpon the foreſaid buſines, and then there
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21983:110"/>
were more then before of <hi>Loſonzes</hi> opinion. Thus he perceiuing many to be of his minde, without expecting any more, ſent by a truſtie meſſenger to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Baſha with his intention: to whom he returned anſwer, that the Tranſalpinian had truly managed and conferred of this buſines by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: but he ſhould haue conceiued, that this accord ſhould haue been accepted of, before hee had aſſembled his armie, and paſſed Danubius and Tibiſcus, and not at this preſent, he being now in the field and incamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the towne: in conſideration whereof, he would not that this expedition ſhould haue any more reſpite, nor otherwiſe conſent to raiſe the ſiege, nor depart from thence before he were maſter of the towne and Caſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loſonze</hi> vnderſtanding this anſwer, and perceiuing no meanes of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> not willing to ſubmit himſelfe to the diſcretion and mercie of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, ſet vp his reſt to fight it out to the laſt man. Whereupon the Turkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to renew the batterie more fiercely then before, without any intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of daily aſſaults, and to doe the worſt they could: and thinking that the great quantity of Artillerie which they had was not ſufficient to ſatisfie their miſerable crueltie, one night they put into the Ditch more then 2000. Pyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who began to myne the Bulwarke which the Spanyards kept, which was in ſuch ſort indamaged and impayred, that one might eaſily mount to the top of it by the ruines: for that all the defences and flankes which might annoy and withſtand them, were all broken and throwne to the ground. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> The Spanyards ſeeing this imminent daunger, &amp; to giue redreſſe thereunto, with all ſpeede they made within the ſaid Bulwarke a Caue ſufficiently large and deepe, in which they erected certaine defences, where in euery one of them eight Harquebuziers might be commodiouſly placed, without being impeached or indangered by the enemie. Theſe (whileſt that the Pyoners were moſt buſie in their labour, and euen as they were readie to giue fire) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſo effectually to diſcharge their ſhot amongſt theſe Deluers, that it was a marueilous thing to behold, they falling one vpon another in ſuch heapes, that the dead bodies hindered the reſt of the liuing, in regard whereof they were forced to giue ouer the worke and be packing, without daring once to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> returne thither againe. Inſomuch that the Turkes ſeeing this deuice of the Chriſtians, and that by this meanes they could not come to the concluſion of their intended purpoſe, gaue that ouer, and purſued another; daily ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them by promiſes, aſſurances, and perſwaſions, that it were beſt to yeeld to them. But ſeeing in the end they could not bring them to yeeld, neither by letters, nor by gifts, nor by any other great offers, and that all their labours were to ſmall purpoſe, they made vpon the Caſtle ſide two great Caualliars of Carpenters worke, in bignes tenne fadome, as any man would iudge, and brought and ſet them right ouer againſt the Bulwarke where the Spanyards were caued: vpon which they mounted certaine peeces of Artillerie, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof not any could be in ſafetie vpon the ſaid Bulwark, nor remaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> vpon the defences, inſomuch that the Spanyards were conſtrained to retire from one place to another, ſecretly to make Trenches and certaine Rampiers to couer themſelues withall, when they ſhould defend the towne, which <note place="margin">Don Gaſper Caſteluio ſlaine.</note> then was very open. <hi>Don Gaſper</hi> at this inſtant was ſlaine with a ſmall ſhot,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21983:110"/>
which ſtrooke him in the forehead and pearced him quite through, and ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hotly did they ſhoot and neerely marked our men, that there were few Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards, Germanes, and Hungars left: yet neuertheleſſe thoſe which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loſt not any courage, but reſolutely defended themſelues, as though they had been a great number. But the Turkes for all their brauerie ſlacked not their endeuours to enter into the towne, and our men did no leſſe then gallantly oppoſe themſelues for the defence thereof. Thus both the one and the other tooke greater heede to themſelues, continually indamaging one the other with diuers conflicts. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> diſtruſting himſelfe, that he was not able to conquer this towne by force of armes, determined one day to haue ſome ſpeech with <hi>Loſonze,</hi> and to ſeeke him out to parley with him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that ſo he might perſwade him to ſome compoſition, which <hi>Loſonze</hi> meant not to refuſe: but the others not willing to conſent thereto, were the cauſe that of the ſaid conference proceeded no effect at that time. The Turkes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe ceaſed not from daily aſſaults, which they alwaies renewed with greater force then before, hauing no want of able men more freſh and luſtie then our people were, of whom they had few ſound amongſt them, &amp; many cruelly wounded; and ſpecially by meanes of thoſe two miſchieuous engins which they had made, who alſo cauſed more to bee made like vnto them, in place where our Bulwarkes and walles were, by the violence of their Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ruinated: and the rather they were incouraged, becauſe that victuals and munition greatly abounded in their Campe, whereas our men daily wanted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all: as it often happeneth after a long and tedious ſiege.</p>
            <p>The Baſha wearie (as I well beleeue) to ſee ſo great a ſlaughter of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that he muſt fight ſo continually, earneſtly deſiring that our people would yeeld themſelues to him, practiſed this deuice following. The day before, <hi>Ottomiall</hi> was defeated with his 400. Aiduchs, which hee brought with him to put into Themeſuar (as is aforeſaid) and they were by a ſtrong ſquadron of Turkiſh Caualarie alſo cut in peeces, that not any one man of them eſcaped, the fight being perceiued by the Sentinels of the towne. The day following this ouerthrow, the Baſha for the foreſaid reaſons, the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to amaze and terrifie our people, cauſed 100. of theſe Aiduchs heads to bee moſt vily deformed, and to be ſet about the walles, with inſcriptions that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, thoſe were the ſuccours which came to them, and that they ſhould not hope of any other, for that they would vſe the like to al thoſe who would attempt to come. Preſently vpon this ſauage deuice, certaine of the towne came forth, and beholding this horrible ſpectacle, and ſeeing that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affayres were in deſperate tearmes, had an apprehenſion of feare to fall into the like miſerable end, as theſe poore Aiduchs were. The night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Spanyards came foorth, one whereof had his wife and children at <note place="margin">The treaſon of two Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards.</note> Conſtantinople, where he was maried, after that he was taken at Caſtelnouo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and had denied his faith: and the other was a Moreſque borne in Granado. Theſe halfepeny fellowes hauing but faint hearts (by reaſon of the feare which doth ordinarily raigne in ſuch baſe perſons) louing rather to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their liues with a ſhamefull and miſerable ſeruitude, then to loſe it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an honeſt libertie, with a glorious death (as it is the guiſe of valiant and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21983:111"/>
magnanimious mindes, to finiſh their daies with the loſſe of their deareſt blood) they went to the Baſha, and acquainted him with the whole eſtate of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Themeſuar, aſſuring him there were few men within it, and that their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were cooled; and although they fought valiantly, yet were they greatly aſtoniſhed, and that the towne was in diuers places ſo open, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they could longer maintaine it, if they continued the ſiege and their aſſaults, but that they muſt of force yeeld. This aduertiſement gaue ſome courage and hope to the Baſha to winne this place, although he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement from the Grand Seigniour to withdraw his Campe from thence to Belgrade, ſeeing it was ſo long in taking, and that he had loſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men before it: whereupon it was ſaid, that <hi>Solyman</hi> was ſomewhat incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> againſt <hi>Mahomet:</hi> which if thoſe within had had but ſome inckling thereof, and had been able to maintaine it ſixe daies longer at the moſt, they had neuer taſted of this aduerſe fortune, which within few daies after happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them with ſo great effuſion of blood, and the Baſha had retired with his armie, as it was afterward certainly knowne. But <hi>Loſonze</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> obſtinately perſeuered to moleſt him day and night, conferred with all the ſouldiours to yeeld; conſidering how they were all greatly wearied and timerous, by reaſon of the laſt aſſault which they receiued ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the two Spanyards (who were fled from thence): during which, towards the Caſtle ſide they ſaw themſelues in very great danger, the Turks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> being entered in, who had poſſeſt and made themſelues maſters of that place, if certaine Spanyards and Germanes had not preſently been ſent to ſuccour that breach, who vpon their arriuall forſt them to retire, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them euen to the entrie of their Trenches, making a great ſlaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Which being vnderſtood by all the nations there, euery man fauoured <hi>Loſonzes</hi> opinion to yeeld, his life, armes, and baggage ſaued, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Spanyards, who ſaid; that according to their iudgement, they ought not to ſeeke for any accord, but to be well aduiſed how they might eſcape in the night by the mariſhes adioynant to the Caſtle, which if they could paſſe, they ſhould preſently finde woods which would procure them ſafe paſſage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> vnto Lippa, and that there was not any who could hinder or annoy them from going foorth, and from arriuing at that place: and this ſhould bee ſo much the more eaſily performed, becauſe that towards that ſide there was not any perſon lodged, by reaſon of the great mariſhes which were in that place, which was a thing they might eaſily compaſſe, and which was farre better for them, then to repoſe any truſt in the Turkes faithleſſe promiſes, euery one knowing by too many preſidents, that very ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they obſerue or keepe them, which aſſuredly they will now much leſſe performe, for that they will remember that our people halted in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to <hi>Oliman</hi> when he departed out of Lippa, this act being not any thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> concealed from the Baſha, nor yet ſlipped from his memorie, whereof they thought good to aduertiſe them, whereby they ſhould be the leſſe deceiued and ouerthrowne. <hi>Loſonze</hi> anſwered them, that they ſhould not any thing doubt, but that they ſhould giue him leaue to proceede therein; and that he would ſo order the matter, that his compoſition ſhould bee ſo cleere and

euident, that euery one ſhould ſecurely depart with his honour: which was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> liked of many, ſaying, that 27. whole daies they had couragiouſly fought, and were continually annoyed by the Artillerie, and receiued ſo many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and ſlaine ſo many Turkes, that they might well with their great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and commendation yeeld.

Theſe ſouldiours being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the towne, they openly recited the large promiſes and fayre offers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that the Baſha had made them. <hi>Loſonze</hi> too lightly giuing credence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, writ in a paper all the conditions which he eſteemed to bee either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie or meete for him to demaund; which were theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That it ſhould be permitted him to carrie away all the Artillerie which was within Themeſuar, and ſafely to conduct it, without any impeachment, <note place="margin">The Articles of agreement.</note> to the place he thought good.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That all the ſouldiours ſhould goe forth with their armes, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes diſplayed, with all their baggage, and that the Baſha ſhould giue them ſafe conduct to ſome ſecure place.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the towne ſhould be held in ſome regard, and that there ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not any of the inhabitants bee moleſted: and to conclude, as well in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth, as in going on their iourney, there ſhould not any bee annoyed or indangered by his armie.</p>
            <p>All theſe articles were very willingly accepted of by the Baſha, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by oth to bee ſincerely performed, and returned them to them againe ſigned and ſealed, without contradicting any of the demaunds of <hi>Loſonze,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming (as he that was determined to obſerue neither faith nor promiſe) theſe couenants of ſmall validitie, and to promiſe and deceiue of one conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

keeping and ſtopping the way where they ſhould paſſe, which was a little hill on both ſides. The Spaniards who marched laſt, perceuing ſo many men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in their way, and conceiuing hardly thereof, preſaged what was like preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to befall them: whereupon they ſent to tell <hi>Loſonze</hi> that they would not forſake the towne, except the Baſha would cauſe thoſe ſquadrons to retyre out of their way: whereof the Baſha being aduertiſed, anſwered them, that vpon paine of his head they might ſecurely come forth, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any preiudice, and that he ſent theſe troupes into that place to no other end, but onely that his ſouldiours ſeeing them goe forth of the towne, they might by them take example vpon the like and future occaſion, to carrie themſelues valiantly, conſidering that ſo few men had ſo wonderfull well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> defended themſelues againſt ſuch an infinite multitude; and ſeeing they all profeſſed armes, &amp; were men that liued by war, it was neceſſarie they ſhould be inſtructed therein, according as occaſion ſerued. Vnder the protection of this aſſurance they all came forth, and began to march through the midſt of theſe ſquadrons, being diſtant from the towne ſome 300. paces, which they had no ſooner performed, but the treacherous ſignall was giuen with an harquebuze ſhot, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> had appoynted. At the report whereof one <note place="margin">Loſonze and all his people ouerthrowne.</note> part of theſe ſquadrons preſently enuironed the Artillerie and thoſe who marched before, and the other part enuironed the reſt, and ſo compaſſing thus our people in the midſt of them, they began to execute their barbarous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> tyrannie in maſſacring them, and ſpecially thoſe who offered to defend themſelues, and who loued rather a famous libertie, honorably to dye fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then to remaine ſlaues during their liues, vnder ſo wicked a nation. Of this number were the moſt part Spanyards, and ſome Hungars, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and thoſe who would not defend themſelues were preſently forced away and lead priſoners, and among others <hi>Loſonze</hi> was taken and conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Baſha.

He perceiued by the way that all the Hungarian Knights and nobilitie, who then followed him, were very penſiue and diſmayed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that leauing all at randome, to the pleaſure of Fortune, they ſeemed careleſſe of any thing: whereupon turning himſelfe towards them, he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly reproued them with ſuch milde ſpeeches as he thought good, and gaue them ſome heart and hope that this loſſe ſhould ſhortly be recouered by <hi>Ferdinands</hi> power (which daily was expected) &amp; by their own force and vertue, exhorting them to defend the reſt: hee ſo effectually perſwaded them, that he expelled from them all feare &amp; diſpaire, and cauſed to increaſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> in them courage and boldnes, and to thinke more vpon the reuenging of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonzes</hi> death, and the death of his Captaines and ſouldiours, then euer they had done. But Fortune (which is not alwaies permanent, but at her pleaſure cutteth off the deſſignes of men in the moſt flouriſhing time of their Aprill, and doth raiſe and abate humane actons as ſeemeth good to her) would that <hi>Aldene</hi> ſhould not perſeuer long in this his braue reſolution, in which vntill then he was reſolute in the defence of Lippa, againſt any ſtrong and puiſſant armie whatſoeuer, the ſame being vnto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of as great importance as the loſſe of an armie or kingdome, as we ſhall hereafter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>During the time that <hi>Mahomet</hi> beſieged Themeſuar, and that he was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The carleſnes of Aldene.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the point to capitulate with <hi>Loſonze, Aldene</hi> perhaps thinking that this towne would neuer be taken, was nothing prouident to vſe that diligence which was requiſite for the due of his charge, neither yet did he imploy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpies to aduertiſe him: and now foure of fiue dayes were alreadie paſt, <note place="margin">Spies neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> that he knew nothing of the enemies proceedings, neither had he any other newes then by the Rhatians or others, who by chaunce brought him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Turke priſoner, who imparted to him as much as he deſired: and when a Captaine of the Vſſarons, named <hi>Demetre Vzarenky,</hi> exhorted him to vſe greater diligence, and tolde him that he would accomodate him with ſuch perſons that ſhould faithfully ſerue him in ſuch affayres: he made ſleight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thereof, neither did he endeauour himſelfe to retaine them with giftes or rewards, nor yet ſo much as with any good words, ſo that the affayres of Lippa daily proceeded from euill to worſe. In the end newes being come that Themeſuar was reduced vnder the Turkes commaund, and of all other occurrances which paſſed there; <hi>Aldene</hi> thought that <hi>Mahomets</hi> campe <note place="margin">The cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aldene.</note> would preſently viſite him, and thinking that the Caſtle was not ſo ſtrong, as gladly he would haue had it, to reſiſt his victorious enemie, and ſeeing the occaſion conformable to his conceite; and perſwading himſelfe that the little hope which he had to defend himſelfe (both by reaſon of the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the towne, and alſo of the Caſtle) would be a ſufficient excuſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> him of ſo vile and infamous a thing as this which he pretended to doe, he reſolued in himſelfe to leaue it. And to the end the Turkes ſhould not ayde themſelues by the Caſtle, he determined to fire it with all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie and munition, without acquainting any therewith, but onely at the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21983:113"/>
inſtant when he would execute his enterpriſe, (as he did) although he ſaw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not the Baſhaes campe approaching, and notwithſtanding that ſome tolde him that <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould ſtay, that ſince Themeſuar was ſo tedious to him, (although it was a place of no great ſtrength) he would not now march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Lippa, aſſuring himſelfe that he ſhould doe no good there, knowing the exceeding diligence and care which had been vſed to fortifie it, and the reſolute ſouldiours of all nations which was within it, and the quantitie of Artillerie and munition that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had cauſed it to bee furniſhed withall, and the great care which he had for the defence thereof: for all which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons duly conſidered, he was in deſpayre that he ſhould neuer be able to take it. This report neuertheleſſe could not any thing diuert <hi>Aldene</hi> from his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wicked reſolution, although he well perceiued that <hi>Iohn Turky</hi> and <hi>Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Coruatte</hi> made not any ſemblance to bouge from that place where they were, which was an Abbey of Monks, ſituated three miles from the enemie, where (during the ſiege of Themeſuar) they daily with 1000. horſe annoyed and endamaged the enemie as much as was poſſible for them. Which to him who had no eyes, it muſt needes ſerue for a ſufficient argument to make him diſcerne, that the Baſha was not determined to come againſt him: for that alſo ſome of our people, who were lodged foure or ſixe miles off, neuer once offered to remoue or retire, hourely expecting what the Baſha determined to doe. Notwithſtanding all that, <hi>Aldene</hi> ſtill perſeuered in his infamous and ſhamefull fantaſie. And as puiſſance and rule cannot long continue where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> feare and cowardiſe preuaileth, ſixe houres before hee meant to depart, he declared his conceit to certaine old Spanyards, who greatly blamed this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, telling him that in no caſe he ſhould not remoue or diſioyne himſelfe from thence, before they ſaw whether the Baſha would come or no, and that he ſhould duly conſider in what eſteeme he ſhould bee, if hee forſooke this place (at the leaſt before he ſaw the enemie) which was recommended to him, in regard of ſpeciall truſt repoſed in his worthines; and that if in this he would not haue reſpect to his owne reputation and honour, yet at the leaſt he ſhould haue regard to the credit of his nation; and that ſith neuer any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Spanyard, vntill now, had committed ſo cowardly an act, that he would not be the firſt, into whoſe hart ſhould fall an infamie ſo ſhamefull and villanous, which aſſuredly would equally redound vpon all, and ſpecially in ſuch a place, where honour ſhould more preuaile, then any fearefull deſire which was in him, in reſpect from being noted of puſillanimitie and cowardiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe barbarous nations, with a perpetuall and infamous blot. But theſe admonitions were not ſufficient to withdraw him from his baſe determination: but continuing therein, other ſouldiours had notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and among others, Captaine <hi>Paul</hi> of Zaraz, a Germane Colonell, who went to ſee <hi>Aldene,</hi> deſiring leaue that he might enter into the Caſtle with his ſouldiours, and other Spanyards, who were more deſirous of glorie then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of life, and that he might cauſe all neceſſaries to bee put therein before the bridges, which were made for the bringing in of prouiſion needfull for the Rampiers, ſhould bee broken. <hi>Aldene</hi> anſwered him, that he ſhould enter therein when time ſhould require. The ſouldiours ſeeing this diſorder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21983:114"/>
to murmur, and ſay, that before they entered they would know what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> quantitie of victuals there was within. The next day in the morning, they intreated him to goe vnto the ſouldiours (and as their Chiefe) to appeaſe them, and to take an oth of euery one of them to liue and die in the ſeruice of God and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as by dutie they were all bound thereunto; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to depart from Lippa, before the Turkes were gone from thence. Which being done, and the oth taken, certaine ſouldiours entered into the Caſtle to ſuruey the munition and victuall, whereof was found good ſtore: by reaſon of which they were incouraged, and they againe redoubled the ſaid oth, and after that, euery man retired to his lodging, where they were not long, but that they vnderſtood the commaund that <hi>Aldene</hi> (the Camp-maſter) cauſed to be publiſhed: which was, that euery one ſhould be readie with his armes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and prepare himſelfe to march. Whereupon all the nations who were in the towne began to ſet forward, not without ſome little mutinie, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Paul</hi> of Zaraz went againe to <hi>Aldene,</hi> to diſſwade him from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch a diſhonourable fact, telling him, that neither he, nor none of his did euer thinke to commit ſuch a miſchieuous treaſon againſt <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and that if he would needs goe, he might, but as for himſelfe he would with his people defend the Caſtle againſt <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or elſe he would there end his daies. All the Hungars aſſured him alſo that they would doe the like. To whom he anſwered, that they vnderſtood him not, and that he well knew what he meant to do, and that the King ſhould receiue more ſeruice by that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which he had determined to do, then by all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they had propounded. Vpon this the Spaniſh ſouldiours began to bee of diuers factions and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions among themſelues, the greateſt part eſteeming it a foule fault to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge themſelues from thence, as <hi>Aldene</hi> had commaunded; and the fewer ſort were of opinion to doe that which he determined, perſwading the other to take part and goe with them, and not remaine to caſt away themſelues: which the Germanes and Hungars by no meanes thought conuenient, and gaue notice thereof to <hi>Aldene,</hi> who ſaid to them, that he knew not what to doe therein, but hee would thinke thereon, and prouide for it. Now, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> was about Lippa ſome 10000. Hungariſh and Rhatian waggons, within which they carried their wiues, children, and their beſt moueables, theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fled after this manner from their townes and houſes, then when the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha paſſed Tibiſcus, and were come thither to ſaue themſelues in Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and by the fauour of this ſtrong place, beneath which they were lodged in a champion vnder their Tents and Pauillions in manner of an armie, expecting the iſſue of Themeſuar. The principall of them vnderſtanding that <hi>Aldene</hi> would forſake this towne, and remoue with his people from thence, went preſently to him, to deſire him not to depart, and importuned him, that if hee were reſolued to forſake the Caſtle, yet that hee would not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> race it, but rather deliuer it into their cuſtodie, and that they would with their beſt endeuour defend it, or elſe reſolutely to die within it. But all theſe intreaties, admonitions, and proteſtations had not any force to remoue him from his diſhoneſt thought, but commaunded that all ſhould bee in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to march at the firſt ſound. The Germanes and Hungars perceiuing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21983:114"/>
the wicked and baſe intent of <hi>Aldene</hi> continued, ſaid to him, that although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there were many inclined to obey him, yet they would not for all that ceaſe from giuing him to vnderſtand, that they determined to remaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, that ſo they might ſhunne and auoyde the ſhame, which without all doubt they ſhould condignely receiue in diſlodging ſo vily: whereupon <hi>Paul</hi> of Zaraz reenforcing the guards, tooke charge of the towne, through which walking in the night ſeaſon, he ſaw many ſouldiours (who by <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> oppointment were with their horſes ſadled) readie to troupe on with their armes and baggage, to whom giuing incouragement, and perſwading them not to bouge, hee went from thence to <hi>Aldenes</hi> lodging, whom hee found vpon his bed, and conferring with him, he deſired to know why he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had commaunded that the Spanyards ſhould be in ſuch readines. For that, (ſaid he) he had receiued newes that the enemies were alreadie approached within two miles of Lippa, with fifteene peeces of Artillerie, and that vpon this occaſion he was reſolued, that he would not at any hand attend them, becauſe the place was not ſtrong enough, he hauing before hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded preſently to depart. To which, <hi>Paul</hi> replied, that he would ſtay, but vntill he had ſent to know the certaintie thereof. And he did ſo much, that three houres before day hee preſently diſpatched two horſemen towards Themeſuar, to diſcouer whether the Vauntgard of <hi>Mahomet</hi> approached or not. Theſe ſouldiours poſting with good ſpeede, arriued at the place where were lodged <hi>Iohn Turky</hi> and <hi>Bartholmew Coruatte,</hi> and ſeeing them to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be at quiet, and not fearing any trouble of the enemies, they returned backe againe with great ſpeede, to declare vnto <hi>Aldene</hi> that there was not any bruite or newes that the Baſhaes Campe was riſen from about Themeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar.</p>
            <p>During the time that theſe two horſemen made this diſcouerie, <hi>Aldene</hi> cauſed all the Canoniers to come to him, commaunding them to charge the Cannons euen to the mouth, with intent to breake them, and that they ſhould put the reſt of the powder into the vautes and ſellers of the towers and Bulwarkes, to blow them vp when neede ſhould require: and being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to expect the returne of theſe two ſouldiours, who ſhould bring certaine newes of all, a Sentinell (which was in the top of one of the towers at Sunne riſing) diſcouered two horſemen who came ſpurring on amaine. Theſe were the two ſouldiours, which we haue before ſpoken of, who rode in great poſt, thinking that if they deferred any time, <hi>Aldene</hi> would ſet fire on the Caſtle before they returned againe: and on the contrarie, the certaine newes which they ſhould bring, would expell this wicked determination out of his cowardly mind, and this was the cauſe of their ſpeed. Another Sentinell at the ſame inſtant, being not farre from the other, diſcouered a farre off a great duſt in the ayre, which was raiſed by a number of Cowes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which ranne wildly together in the fields without any keeper, and theſe two ſouldiours were neere the towne, crying with a loude voyce (although they could not perfectly be vnderſtood) and ſaid, that they ſhould make ſtay, and not fire the munition nor Caſtle. The other ſouldiours crying (by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement of the Sentinell) that this duſt was raiſed by ſome great batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <note place="margin">Baſe mindes ſuſpitious of feare.</note>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:21983:115"/>
of the enemies, and that theſe two ſouldiours came poſting before to giue notice thereof: they went preſently to aduertiſe <hi>Aldene,</hi> who was the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21983:115"/>
by meanes whereof he thought <hi>Aldene</hi> with all his ſouldiours might haue been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> conſumed in that fire. And demaunding of ſome that went wandring about the towne, who had comitted ſo vile an acte, they preſently made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him of the whole matter as it was done, which he vnderſtanding, and not minding (as a wiſe and prouident Captaine) to neglect any thing which ſhould concerne the ſeruice of his Prince, and the noblenes of his owne minde, without being conſtrained by any commaund, but moued onely by a true compaſſion for ſuch an vnſpeakeable calamitie and ſuddaine ruine, began in the beſt ſort hee could to giue order to cauſe to be retyred that Artillerie which remained whole from the violence of the fire, ſeeing he could not remedie any other thing, for that all was fallen to a marueilous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ruine. He remained within Lippa three dayes, and vntill he had ſeene all the Artillerie (which was diſperſed in the towne that remained whole, to the number of fifteene peeces) conducted in ſafetie, of which there were ſome ſound, and many broken and crakt, and with thoſe and all his people he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred to Iula, firſt cauſing fire to be ſet in euery place of the towne that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained vnburnt, to the end that the enemy might not in any ſort reliue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe tierewith. Which being done, he preſently gaue aduertiſement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> who alreadie vnderſtood of this miſerable ruine, which was exceeding diſpleaſant to the armie, and to all Tranſiluania, and ſpecially to the Spanyards, whoſe reputation it touched more then any other, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that he was a Spanyard which committed ſo infamous and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a thing; in regard whereof, they were alwaies held in contempt, and derided by all the nations of that Prouince, they being not able to alleadge any colourable reaſon for their excuſe, which procured great diſcontent and irkſomenes to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> for that he repoſed all his hope vpon this Fortreſſe; thinking, that in well defending it, all the Baſhaes force would not haue been ſufficient to haue wonne thereof one thumbes bredth of ground. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he eſteemed the kingdome, together with his armie and reputation to bee in a manner loſt, yet was he not troubled, nor made any ſemblance of feare in his heart of ſo great a loſſe: and although the cowardiſe of another had thus euerted his deſeignes, and that ſudden and raſh attempts common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bring more trouble and amaze, then thoſe which are foreſeene by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed conſideration; yet neuertheleſſe hee did not omit to aduertiſe <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> of all theſe accidents, and preſent daunger wherein he was, for that the Port of the countrie being by the careleſnes of another opened to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, to enter into that countrie, he being not able to withſtand him, without another armie anſwerable to that of <hi>Mahomets,</hi> or at the leaſt halfe as ſtrong. In like ſort he gaue aduertiſement to <hi>Roderic Vigliandrando,</hi> and to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Lopez,</hi> that they ſhould march no further, becauſe (as is aboue ſaid) they were ſent, who by ſome meanes or other they might enter into The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſuar; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and he commaunded Captaine <hi>Lopez</hi> to enter with his companie into the Caſtle of Deua, which next vnto Lippa was the ſtrongeſt Fortreſſe in that quarter, and of the moſt importance for the enterance into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <note place="margin">Deua.</note> commaunding in like manner <hi>Aldene,</hi> that he ſhould remaine in that towne with the companies which he brought from Lippa, and that vntill he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21983:116"/>
knew further of his pleaſure. The towne of Deua is very fayre and rich, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and ſituated in a place which participateth of a plaine and hill, hauing a Caſtle of good defence, neere vnto which, a few yeeres paſt, was found (by ſuch meanes as we ſhall ſpeake of) great ſtore of treaſure by the peaſants of the countrie, vnder an old ancient Caſtle or Palace all ruinated and decaied. The raine continuing a long time, and the water running in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with a forcible currant, by violence thereof there was diſcouered an infinit companie of golden Meddals, vpon one ſide of which was coyned the image of <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> and on the other ſide a victorie, euery one weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Money of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus.</note> two or three crownes. The ſtorme and rage of the water being paſt, and the Sunne ſhining vpon theſe, they made a marueilous gliſtering: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> perceiued by certaine peaſants of the countrie, and they running to ſee what it might bee, they remained rauiſhed with ioy, conſidering ſo great a quantitie of the golden Meddals, and offering to take them vp, they alſo <note place="margin">Treaſure found.</note> found a golden Serpent, which afterward <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſent to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> hauing had it at the death of Frier <hi>George,</hi> with a part of theſe ancient Meddals: this being an ancient cuſtome amongſt thoſe who buried their treaſure, to place Serpents there, in token of a faithfull keeper. And after that theſe peaſants <note place="margin">A cuſtome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> had taken no man knew what, others tooke from thence more then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand Duckets, and the report was, that they might haue taken more then 100000. for that this place had ſometimes been <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade: whereof <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had (as wee haue ſaid) 1000. and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 300. which coyne remained in this place from <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> his time. Among other notable antiquities that was found, there were two Meddals of gold, the one was of <hi>Ninus,</hi> and the other of Queene <hi>Semiramis:</hi> which two were <note place="margin">Meddals of Ninus and Semiramis.</note> ſent to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. And there was not any man in all that Prouince, of what authoritie or reputation ſoeuer, which had not ſome of theſe Meddals: ſo infinit was found this ſumme to be.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing taken order for the moſt important affayres of the kingdome, he went from thence with the Vayuode of Tranſiluania to Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſuar, from whence afterwards he went to Saſſebeſſa. And being there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, he lodged in the beſt manner he could within the towne, it being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in the midſt of the countrie, where he haſtened the fortifications of thoſe townes which were alreadie begun to be fortified, and into which places he determined to place garriſons, to defend them againſt the Baſha, knowing he had not the force to incounter him in the field, and writ againe to all the townes that they ſhould ſend him more ſouldiours, certifying them of the bad fortune which was lately happened to the low countries: and although they ceaſed not to ſend vnto him, yet could they neuer leauie but 16000. men.</p>
            <p>In this time arriued 1500. men of armes, which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had promiſed to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> 1000. whereof were vnder the conduct of <hi>Fabian Schinach,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the other 500. remained with the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce Palauicin,</hi> who brought with him 3000. Germanes, and as many Italians, with certaine troupes of Hungariſh horſemen, and ſome Artillerie, to ſuccour <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> and marched with great iourneys, hauing alreadie paſſed Papau, which is a Fortreſſe vpon <note place="margin">Papau.</note>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:21983:116"/>
the confines of Hungarie, neere to Veſprimia, and he marched very ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> There is found vpon the way (which is neereſt out of Hungarie into Tranſiluania) a Caſtle named Drigal, ſituated iuſt in the way, which then <note place="margin">Drigal.</note> was kept by the Turkes, ſo that they could not conueniently paſſe that way, which was farre better, and the ſureſt to conduct an armie into the countrie. Whereupon to finde ſome meanes to winne this Fort, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce,</hi> that arriuing neere vnto the ſaid Caſtle, he ſhould with all his power make ſome ſtay there, and endeuour himſelfe by all meanes poſſible to get it. Which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> vnderſtanding, and knowing by many reports the ſtrength of that place, by reaſon of the few men the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe had with him, he writ preſently vnto him, that he ſhould not at that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> time ſtay about that enterpriſe, vntill they were vnited together, becauſe that they two ioyning in one, happely they might attempt ſome fortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: which on the contrarie they could not poſſibly obtaine, if they were ſeparated: for that one was not ſufficient to make that conqueſt, but their vnion was likely to bee the cauſe of ſome good euent, and the time ſhould not be loſt in vaine (as it might happen) if he himſelfe would onely bee opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated to ſtay there, with daunger to loſe it. Beſides, aduertiſing him, that if in caſe he would perſiſt in this enterpriſe, and that he ſaw the Baſha of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da attempted to ſuccour that Caſtle, yet by no meanes he ſhould fight, for feare of loſing the battaile: but that he ſhould endeuour himſelfe to retire the beſt he could, it being now no time to hazard his men, ſeeing he very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> well knew the great and preſent neceſſitie which himſelfe had thereof. He alſo writ to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> concerning the ſame, deſiring him that hee would cauſe <hi>Palauicin</hi> to depart from Drigal, and that hee would commaund him preſently to march and ioyne with him, it being more neceſſarie then the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Caſtle. This reaſon although in it ſelfe it was ſound and true, yet was it not ſo apprehended by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> nor receiued by ſuch due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Marqueſſe: ſo that, for not inclining to this counſell, he fell into ſuch calamitie, as we ſhall hereafter ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> (who had not the heart to goe to beſiege Lippa) knowing it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was very ſtrong, and that the garriſon was of Spanyards, Germanes, and Hungars, all choſen and approued ſouldiours, hauing at this inſtant had newes, that the maſter of the Campe <hi>(Aldene)</hi> had forſaken it, and ſet fire on the Caſtle; and not beleeuing that a Spanyard would commit ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie, and ſo vnfit for him, ſent (the ſame day that <hi>Bartholmew Coruatte</hi> had drawne out the Artillerie) to know the certaintie. The Turkes who went thither, approached ſo neere vnto it, that they perceiued that the towne and <note place="margin">The Turkes ſeazed on Lippa.</note> Caſtle had not receiued very great damage, and they began as well as they could to quench the fire, and preſently aduertiſed the Baſha that this fire had procured no great detriment to that which was newly fortified, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Caſtle was broken and rift in many places, the Bulwarkes and Curtaines neuertheleſſe were ſound and whole, and very defencible: onely that there was two old towers fallen downe, but not any thing of that ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which was fortified within, and that the Caſtle it ſelfe might eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into his former ſtrength, and made ſufficient to defend it ſelfe. The
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:21983:117"/>
Baſha vpon this aduertiſement was ſo well content, as if he had conquered the moitie of Tranſiluania, and preſently diſpatched <hi>Caſſombaſſa</hi> with 5000. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> horſe to goe and enter into Lippa and defend it. Preſently vpon this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines arriuall there, he commaunded certaine Turkes to goe and view Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos, thinking for certaine that he ſhould ſpend more time in taking of it, <note place="margin">Solimos left to the Turks.</note> then he did, and that it might proue ſo ill an neighbour to him, that he ſhuld ſcarcely hold Lippa in peace, becauſe that although that Caſtle was very little, yet it was inexpugnable: for that it could neither bee battered by the Cannon, nor yet aſſaulted: and there was within the ſaid Caſtle a Corporall of <hi>Aldenes</hi> ſquadron with 25. Spaniards, and about ſome 100. Hungars, which number was ſufficient to defend it againſt all the world, they hauing victuals <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for two yeeres, and of Artillerie and munition as much as ſhould ſuffice them. But feare had alreadie poſſeſt euery mans heart, inſomuch that newes being come that <hi>Caſſombaſſa</hi> was within Lippa, the Corporall fearing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie would come directly to the Caſtle, did reſolue to leaue it to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of fortune, thinking that the former fault of others would excuſe him from the reproach of any diſhonourable act: vpon which reſolution, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded all the ſouldiours who were within to depart, who alreadie were ſo diſcouraged for the paſſed accidents, and for the faint-heart which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in him who commaunded them, that they were preſently induced (without any vrgent perſwaſions) to credit his ſayings: and began to goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> forth at the inſtant, when <hi>Caſſombaſſa</hi> had ſent 200. horſe to ſummon them to yeeld: who being arriued before the Caſtle, and finding it open (although <note place="margin">The coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the Spaniſh ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours.</note> they ſuſpected ſome deceit) yet they boldly entered in, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made themſelues maſters thereof: and conſidering that the garriſon could not be farre off, vnderſtanding that the night before they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, preſently they ſet themſelues forward to follow them: and they had not gone farre, but that they ouertooke, and ſo intrapped them with ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, as wolues commonly giue to amazed ſheepe being in flight, and put them all to the ſword, except the Corporall, whom they led priſoner to <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſombaſſa:</hi> and thus was the deſert of their ſhamefull cowardiſe duly rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> yea euen at the time when ſeeking their owne ſafetie, they then found death: which then had not ended their daies, if they had remained within the Caſtle, and valiantly employed themſelues for the defence therof, which men expect for at the hands of reſolute ſouldiours: for thus in keeping So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limos, they might thereby with good ſecuritie haue defended Lippa.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> at that time alwaies remained about Saſſebeſſa, with that ſmall force which wee haue ſpoken of, daily expecting the arriuall of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>Sforce,</hi> and aſſuredly beleeuing that the Baſha would not omit to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the enterance into the kingdome (and that ſo much the more boldly, becauſe he ſaw himſelf Lord, without any impeachment of the place, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he eſteemed of moſt importance) he was attentiue to ſee what he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of, becauſe that vntill then he could neuer vnderſtand the drift of his intention, but onely then when he was at Themeſuar, he heard that hee durſt not enter into Tranſiluania, becauſe it was reported that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was therein with a good number of men, and that daily he expected more, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21983:117"/>
that if he ſhould then enter there, he could not ſo eaſily retire himſelfe as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would. This opinion of the Baſha was grounded vpon certaine policies and ſtratagems, which <hi>Caſtalde, Andrew Battor,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Nadaſily</hi> had vntill that time vſed, deceiuing thereby his Spies, cauſing his people daily to bee newly muſtered, and ſtretching their ſquadrons at length, to the end that they might ſeeme double as great as they were, adding thereto very great <note place="margin">The policie of warre.</note> Salues of the Artillerie and Harquebuziers, hauing cauſed their Campe to be largely lodged, to the end that it ſhould ſeeme greater then it was; further reporting that daily they expected ayde, and that Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> would ſhortly arriue with 20000. men, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in perſon with a great armie. By ſuch and other like inuentions, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> greatly helped himſelfe in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wherein he then was, ſupplying therein by his owne induſtrie, that which he knew was wanting, by reaſon of the ſmalnes of his armie; and not being able therewith to reſiſt the power of the Baſha, he endeuoured to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelfe againſt him, and to delude them by the ſubtelie of his fained ſhewes; which <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſuppoſing to be true, was in doubt what to doe. But at the laſt <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing vnderſtood, that one day he would vpon a ſudden enter into Tranſiluania, and ſend the Belerbey of Greece before with 25000. horſe, to giue remedie to that, leauing the Vayuode <hi>Battor,</hi> with all his ſouldious of the kingdome in the ſame place, to the end he ſhould maintaine the reputation of a Campe; and to the end alſo that that might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies appeare to bee true which the Spies reported to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who vntill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then (in regard of the report, as we haue declared before) had put him into ſome feare and doubt, he departed with his Infantrie and men of armes, with this reſolute determination, to meete the Belerbey, and to fight with him: and although it ſeemed an expreſſe raſhnes, yet leauing the iſſue thereof in the hand of God, he was not any whit amazed or diſcouraged, but determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reſolutely, either to ouerthrow the Belerbey, (and by that meanes to giue iuſt occaſion to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> not to attempt any more the enterance into the kingdome) or elſe gloriouſly there to end his happie daies. For that if it happened that vnfortunately he ſhould loſe this battaile, yet for all that he would not cenſure himſelf to be vtterly ſubuerted, but as fierce as at the firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> becauſe hee ſhould leaue behinde him another armie, anſwerable vnto that which he met the Turkes withall.</p>
            <p>As theſe things were thus a brewing, he went to take view of a lodging between Deua and Saſſebeſſa, which he found very conuenient for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and commodious to fortifie with great aduantage for the ſafetie of his Infantrie, which he might well accommodate and lodge vpon certaine little pleaſant hils, which would be as a Caualliar againſt the Belerbeys horſe, and afterwards appointed a garriſon at Deua, wherein he placed Counte <hi>Helfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and two Spaniſh companies, with Vayuode <hi>Battors</hi> Caualarie, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> end that as occaſion ſerued, they ſhould make in vpon the Rereward and flanks, he being with his men of armes ſo well accommodated, that he might well offend and annoy the enemie, without any detriment to himſelfe. But all theſe inuentions and troubleſome conceits, which daily hammered in <hi>Castaldes</hi> braine, proceeding rather by neceſſitie then of free will, tooke no
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21983:118"/>
effect, for that the Baſha altering his determination, reſolued of ſome other courſe, and went towards Hungarie, he being aduiſed, that if he tooke the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſtrong places thereof, Tranſiluania would then bee wonne with leſſe paine and daunger, and without hazarding his armie, as then hee ſhould hazard them, if he entered into that Prouince. And truly it was a work of God, that the Baſha remained ſo blinded, and that he could not diſcerne ſo eaſie a way to conquer that countrie, becauſe that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> not being of ſufficient force to maintaine the field, it was neceſſary for him to retire his forces into ſtrong holds, conſidering that all the gathering together of the powers which they could make out of all the countries of the kingdome, was not ſuch as they might affront this barbarous tyrant: and yet though it had been ſufficient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to incounter him withall, yet for all that they knew not how, neither at the enterance, nor at the retraict of the enemies Campe, to auoyde in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie very great deſolation and ruine, which as well by reaſon of the one as of the other ſhould haue happened, and ſpecially if ſuch an armie had made long aboade therein, it being compoſed of more then 90000. men, beſides aduenturers, and other ſtraglers, who to rob and ſteale doe vſually follow a Campe.</p>
            <p>Whileſt that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was determined to enter into Hungarie, and that <note place="margin">Drigal beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauicin.</note> the Caſtle of Drigal was now beſieged, and ſorely battered by the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce,</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus Teifel,</hi> contratie to the liking of <hi>Caſtalde</hi> (as is aforeſaid) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and being not yet taken, <hi>Achineth</hi> (Baſha of Buda) vnderſtanding of this violent battering, and that this ſiege was maintained againſt the aduice and liking of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> he determined to relieue the aſſieged, and commaunding that all the Caualarie (which were vpon the frontiers) ſhould make their <hi>Rendevous</hi> in a place by him appointed, who in the end were 15000. horſe, with whom he marched towards our people, and at the dawning of the day he arriued neere to the Marqueſſe his Campe, ſending before 500. horſe to giue the alarme, and he with the reſt of his troupe paſſed towards another ſide of the Caſtle, not being perceiued of any, to giue in vpon the Rereward of our men, if they would offer to come out of their Trenches to fight with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thoſe who ſhould giue the alarme. At the ſight of theſe 500. horſe, our men began to make ſome ſallies and charges vpon them, and by little and little the alarme waxed ſo warme, that the greateſt part of our people, either by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie or deſire to fight, went out of their Trenches, and ranging themſelues in battaile, they ſo fiercely charged the Turkes, that they ſlew moſt of them, and put the reſt to a ſpeedie flight, ouerthrowing many in the purſuite. And as it often happeneth, our ſouldiours thinking by the defeate of theſe few men they had the victorie aſſured in their owne hands, not foreſeeing what might happen, they began to disband themſelues and purſue the Turks, one getting a horſe, another ſpoyling the dead; when to this medley the Baſha <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
               <note place="margin">The Palaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin defeated by Achmeth, the Baſha of Buda.</note> (after that he ſaw the occaſion to be ſuch as he deſired) came with ſuch great furie and rage, that our people could not really themſelues, nor reſiſt ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a charge, as well for that they were in diſorder, as alſo becauſe they ſaw themſelues out and farre from their Trenches, which might haue warranted them from this crueltie. The Germanes of <hi>Eraſmus Teifel,</hi> who made the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21983:118"/>
battalion, and were about 3000. were ſo at an inſtant ouerthrowne, as if lions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> had entered into a parke of ſheepe. The Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce,</hi> who was armed before the battalion of the Italians, ſeeing that our Caualarie and men of armes were all fled, and that alſo all the Germanes were defeated, and that on that ſide all was loſt and ouerthrowne; like a prouident Captaine would not indanger the reſt of his men, but would haue conducted them into ſome ſecure place, and cauſed them to take a wood which was there by, hoping by that meanes to ſaue them, his enterpriſe was by the Baſha ouerthrowne, who cut off his way, and forced him in ſpight of his teeth to fight.

The Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus alone and forſaken of his people, although he had as good meanes to ſaue himſelfe as others had, yet hauing a generous and a noble minde, did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to dye there with honour and glorie, then in flying to ſaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with ſhame and infamie. Wherefore ſeeing hee could not eſcape this certaine daunger, he determined to ſell his life to the Turkes as deare as he could, and valiantly fighting he would neuer yeeld, although in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he was very ſore wounded, killing and hurting many of thoſe who enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned him: and as he was in reaching at the necke of one, another hurt him in the right hand, ſo that he was forced to let his ſword fall, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his courage decreaſed, that he was forced rather to yeeld his bodie, then his minde. He being thus taken priſoner, hee was preſently led to the <note place="margin">The Palauicin taken.</note> Baſha, not without the great admiration of all thoſe who had ſeene him fight ſo brauely, being much aſtoniſhed at his valour and proweſſe, which moſt reſolutely they had ſeene him performe, not being vntill then euer knowne to bee Generall, but onely for a man of ſome good reſpect and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and for ſuch an one he was held by the Baſha.

There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dyed in this ouerthrow many perſons of marke, and among others the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Vaccia, who was Comiſſarie generall, and many other Germane Captaines.

            <p>After this route, the Baſha at pleaſure relieued thoſe of Drigal, and hauing effected this vnfortunate iourney, which happened the 8. day of Auguſt, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1552. he ſent to Buda all the pray and ſpoyle which he had gotten, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <note place="margin">Anno 1552.</note> another way to ioyne with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had willed him to come, that he might diſcourſe with him vpon that which he deſired to doe againſt Hungarie, for that <hi>Achmeth</hi> had the more knowledge in the diſcouery &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of that countrie. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> in the meane time hourely receiued news, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſome bad chance (becauſe he was not beleeued) of the ſuccours which he expected in this great neceſſitie wherein he was: &amp; during certaine daies, he aſſuredly beleeued that the Marqueſſe <hi>Sforce</hi> was ſlaine in battaile, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> he knew that he was liuing, and vnder the Baſha of Buda his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <note place="margin">The Palaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin ranſomed for 15000.

            <p>Now <hi>Achmeth</hi> being come to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> (who was determining to march into Hungarie, but yet with a colde reſolution, conſidering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that this yeare he had performed ſufficiently in conquering of Lippa and Themeſuar) he exhorted and perſwaded him earneſtly to follow on his firſt determination, with a reſolution of conqueſt, promiſing him within few dayes to render the Caſtle of Zaluoch and the towne of Agria to him, poſſeſſing him that the greateſt part of the townes of that Prouince would aſſuredly yeelde to him, in reſpect of the feare which was bruited in them, by the taking of the foreſaid townes, and by the ouerthrowe of <hi>Palauicin,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that by this meanes he ſhould get infinite renowne and glorie, and ſuch as he could not hope for, and that to that purpoſe he ſhould be now incited, for that he ſaw <hi>Ferdinand</hi> buſied in the Germane affayres, and oppreſſed by many reuolutions and garboyles, and by the loſſe of men and horſes, which he apparantly ſaw was happened to him, and which he could not preſently renew, being in extreame neceſſitie and want of money: ſo that by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities which he knew to be moſt true, he had now all the meanes that might bee to make himſelfe Lord of many townes, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment or danger to him, and to leade away infinite priſoners, and get ineſtimable bootie. <hi>Mahomet</hi> greatly incouraged by ſuch hopes, preſently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> tooke the way to Zaluoch with all his armie, marching with tedious iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. This Caſtle is very ſtrong, and about ſome three yeares paſt it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Zaluoch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</note> and built by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from the ground, in reſpect of the commoditie of the place, which by cauſe of the naturall ſituation, and by the ſhoares and bankes of Tibiſcus, ſeemed as though it had been erected by hand. <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> the rather was incited hereunto, becauſe he knew that <hi>Solyman</hi> ment to poſſeſſe himſelfe of that place for the ſame purpoſe, and for the fertillitie and pleaſure of the countrie. And thus he preuenting the determination of his enemie, firſt poſſeſſed himſelfe on this ſeate, and eſteeming it worthie of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Fortreſſe, procured with great diligence to builde that Caſtle, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely was eſteemed inuincible, and one of the faireſt workes that was in that kingdome, hauing about it fiue great Caualliars very high, watered on the one ſide by Tibiſcus, and on another ſide enuironed with another riuer named Zagiua, and in two other places there was a ditch very deepe which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:21983:119"/>
was filled with water from thoſe two riuers; and there was within it a large <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> place to range or embattaile fortie thouſand men: to be ſhort, this place was reputed one of the ſtrongeſt Forts that was in all Hungarie, and ſuch a one <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did eſteeme it, and alwaies maintained therein a ſtrong garriſon of men, Artillerie, victuals, and all ſorts of munition for ten yeares. To anſwer which with like correſpondence, if it had then been as well furniſhed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſouldiours, as it was well munitioned of other things, it ſhould not haue come to ſuch an vnfortunate end as it receiued, by the cowardiſe of thoſe who were in garriſon there. Beſides theſe aforeſaid preparations, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> had cauſed there to be kept 50. long narrow boates, with which they might vpon thoſe riuers fiſh and fight if occaſion ſerued; and within he had cauſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to be placed at that time for an ordinarie garriſon 300. Germans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Captaine who was abſent, 100. Bohemians, 200. Aiduchs, and 50. Spanyards, beſides 200. Hungariſh horſe, who in all amounted to 850. men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Castalde</hi> vnderſtanding that <hi>Mahomet</hi> marched towards Hungarie, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely perſwaded himſelfe (as afterward was ſeene) that if then he retyred from Themeſuar, he ſhould not haue the like occaſion and commoditie to enter into Tranſiluaniaas he had: and although he was glad to ſee him out of this Prouince, yet was he greatly perplexed in his minde, fearing that he would march directly towards Agria, becauſe that that was a towne of little ſtrength, but yet of great importance: notwithſtanding he had a ſpecial hope <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of this, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> would firſt (before he came to Agria) make ſome ſtay before Zaluoch, for that he would not leaue it behinde him; and he thought that this Caſtle would defend it ſelfe from his crueltie, becauſe it was ſo well munitioned, &amp; impregnable: ſo that he aſſured himſelfe that <hi>Mahamet</hi> ſhould conſume the greateſt part of his forces during the ſiege there, &amp; that if thoſe within it would ſhew their vttermoſt deuoire, he ſhould be forced rather to retire with ſhame and loſſe, then remaine there with profit and honour.</p>
            <p>Before that <hi>Mahomet</hi> approached Zaluoch, he ſent 2000. horſe to ſcoure and diſcouer the plaine, and gather what victuals they could for his armie, which ſtoode in ſome diſtreſſe, for that they had paſſed ruinated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Countries, from whence to auoide his tyrannie, all the people were fled into diuers places of ſafetie. Some of his Vaun-currers preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before Zaluoch, and being knowne to be ſuch as they were, our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſallyed forth to skirmiſh with them, and tooke ſome of them who were ſcattered from their companie, by whom they vnderſtoode that <hi>Mahomet</hi> would preſently come and beſiege them with all his armie. It happened the ſame day, that the Turkes Vauntgard arriued, a certaine Germane bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his lodging a little powder, fire tooke holde thereof and burnt the houſe, and almoſt all the Caſtle, becauſe that the flame being carried with the winde (which then was very great) diſperſed it ſelfe into all parts, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſuddainely flamed, for the greateſt part thereof being built of wood, and filled with ſuch other things which drew fire to it from a farre, and if they had not with great expedition ſlaked it, ſurely all had been conſumed into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes: and euen as the Vauntgard wherein <hi>Achmeth Baſha</hi> was arriued, the fire was quenched, and then al thoſe within put themſelues in battaile and good order about the wals, and with the force of Artillerie &amp; Harquebuziers, they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:21983:120"/>
began to ſalute the enemy with ſuch violence, that they brake that ſquadron, inſomuch that he was forced to retire from approaching any neerer: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> forthwith ſallying out, they made a great murder amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Turks. The day following arriued <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelfe with all the reſt of his campe, lodging a good diſtance off, and in a place where the Artillerie could not offend him, and preſently with a ſtrong troupe of horſe he went to view the Caſtle on the two ſides that were not enuironed with water, but onely with drie Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the day following he cauſed all his armie to approach before that place, quartering them on theſe two ſides, and they were ſo many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that all the ground within that compaſſe was couered with them: and afterward he ſent by ſome of his people to certifie him who commaunded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> within, that he ſhuld for certaine vnderſtand, that that place where the Caſtle was built, appertained to the Grand Seigniour, and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> erected it in a place which was none of his: and for that cauſe he commaunded them to yeeld it vnto him, offering vpon that condition ſome reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and that he would permit him, with all his ſouldiours, ſafely to depart with their armes and baggage; further admoniſhing him not to be obſtinate, leaſt he ſhould plant the Artillerie: for if he expected that, he had ſworne and proteſted not to make any accord with him at all, but the contrary, putting all to fire and ſword, he would without mercie murther all thoſe who fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands. The <hi>Caſtellan</hi> made him this anſwer, that being borne <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nands</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſubiect, and by him placed in this Caſtle, and hauing ſworne to him fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, and giuen him aſſurance to keepe and defend it (which alſo he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to doe) he could not yeeld it to him: but if he would be maſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſhould winne it by force, and that he ſhould not ſolicite him any more with the like friuolous meſſages, for that he had no dread nor feare of his words, and as little eſteemed he of his deedes, but that he ſhould doe his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, and he for his part would alſo doe what he could to defend and maintain it, deſiring rather to die <hi>Ferdinands</hi> ſeruant, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liue <hi>Solymans</hi> friend.</p>
            <p>The Baſha vnderſtanding of this reſolute anſwer, the day following he cauſed the Trenches to be made hard by the Ditches, on thoſe two ſides of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which we haue ſpoken, and that not without great labour, for that the Pyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were forced to carrie the earth very farre, becauſe the place was drie and ſtonie, and very vnfit for ſuch a purpoſe. And after they had finiſhed their worke, one morning before day-break, he cauſed his Artillery to be brought into them, and planted it againſt the Caſtle, and began very violently to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but the Cannon did no great harme, for that the Caſtle was well ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierd and enuironed with earth and faggots, which preſently did quallifie the force of the bullet. About three daies after that the Turks had continued their batterie, the Germanes aſſembled together, &amp; ſpake vnto the Captaine <note place="margin">The coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the Germane ſouldiours.</note> of the Spaniards, and to certaine other ſouldiours, telling them, that the moſt part of the Hungars were alreadie on horſeback, and that when they thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> leaſt of it, they would in the night depart and forſake them, and that if they did ſo, euery one might cleerely diſcerne, that they were not of ſufficient ſtrength to maintaine and keep it againſt ſo great an armie, as was that of the Turks: and that for that cauſe this was their counſell, that all ſhould diſlodge and endeuour to ſaue themſelues, perſwading this Captaine to ſpeake of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21983:120"/>
this matter vnto him who commanded the place, and was the <hi>Caſtellan,</hi> who for that he was his friend would not refuſe to hearken to him, and it might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be would yeeld to his opinion. The Spaniards replied, that as yet they ſaw no occaſion that ſhould moue them to depart from thence ſo vily, and they told them that they ſhuld not vſe any more ſo diſhoneſt and infamous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but rather they ſhould haue the courage to die honourably, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo cowardly an act; and that for their parts they would doe that which ſhould ſeeme good to them, not being willing at any time to lend their eares to ſuch vnfitting diſcourſes. The Germanes then ſeeing that the Spaniards reſpected not their motion, went to the Bohemians to acquaint them with their determination, and there they cauſed it to finde ſuch good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that they eaſily drew them to their opinions: whereupon they altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went to the <hi>Caſtellan,</hi> to tell him in few words that they would depart, for that they ſaw the Hungars had truſſed vp their baggage in their wagons, and their horſes were readie ſadled, of which they knew not the meaning, except it were to begon, and leaue the reſt as a pray to the Turkes: for that if they departed, who were the greateſt and ſtrongeſt part, it was not in their power to warrant &amp; withſtand the aſſaults of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt ſo puiſſant a force; in reſpect where of they thought it better to depart and retire in ſafetie, then to remaine in danger of ſo apparant a loſſe, which euery man might ſee readie to befall them with a cruell death. The <hi>Caſtellan</hi> willing to appeaſe them, told them that the Hungars had not loded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their baggage, neither were their horſes ſadled to any other end, but onely for feare of the fire, which in that extremitie they might more conueniently tranſport them from place to place, and that if they thought otherwiſe, they deceiued themſelues, and if they were of this opinion, hee himſelfe would be the firſt that ſhould burne their baggage, and maime all their horſes, and would cauſe that the Hungars ſhould euery one execute the like in his owne <note place="margin">The braue reſolution of the Caſtellan of Zaluoch euen to the end.</note> behalfe, promiſing to recompence them in the end according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: and this he did to the end that they ſhould be the more willing to put fire thereto, aſſuring them, that before he would depart from this Caſtle, he was reſolued rather to die within it. The Germanes ſeeing that by this means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they could not compaſſe their drift, they preſently replied, that they would not remaine, except they might haue their pay which was due to them. The <hi>Caſtellan</hi> made liberall promiſe to them thereof, and ſounding the bottome of his friends purſes, he got ſo much money as was needfull to ſatisfie them all that was their due.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Baſha ceaſed not from continuall battering: but it was to no great purpoſe, for that the Cannon did little good; in regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our people in ſtead of taking courage, they hourely ſeemed faint-hearted and more diſcouraged: and this batterie hauing dured 8. whole daies, they determined one night ſecretly to depart, and by the meanes of boates to ſaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> themſelues on the other ſide of the riuer. Which the Spaniards perceiuing, they preſently aduertiſed the <hi>Caſtellan</hi> thereof, who told them, that he had cauſed the boates to be ſunck, for that they ſhould not haue that meanes to flie, they being not able to goe forth at any other place, becauſe the enemie had wholly enuironed them, who would hinder their paſſage; which they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21983:121"/>
found not true, and the Spaniards in the night time walking the round, about the Caſtle, and viſiting the Sentinels, ſaw the Germanes in armes with their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> baggage readie to depart, and comming to the Port, they met the Hungars (who were all on horſebacke) and the <hi>Caſtellan</hi> that vrgently intreated them that they would not depart, and leaue this Fortreſſe with ſo great ſhame and infamie to their nation, and with ſo great a loſſe to K. <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> by which ſpeeches they in like manner ſaw that they preuailed not much with them, in their behalfe, for that they opening the Port by force, they all thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues forth. The Turks who were for the watch within their Trenches, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring firſt the bruite which was within the Caſtle, and preſently after hearing no more therof, and not perceiuing any ſigne or token of any watch (as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vſually perceiued it euery night before) went preſently to breake open the <note place="margin">Zaluoch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly left to the Turks.</note> Port, which was oppoſit to that part which the Hungars &amp; Germanes went forth at: and entering in, and not finding any perſon, they greatly marueiled thereat, and looking about them, they found the <hi>Caſtellan</hi> alone by the Port, who bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſhut it after his people, not meaning at any hand to depart with them, but rather to remaine and die therein, or elſe to be made a ſlaue, before he would commit ſo ſhamefull and diſloyall a fact to his Prince. The Turks preſently tooke him priſoner, and hauing bound him, they led him to <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi> Baſha of Buda: who after he had vnderſtood how all things had paſſed, he ſhewed him great honor, and entreated him curteouſly, eſteeming it to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> a thing no leſſe vertuous to vſe clemencie towards his enemies, then kindnes to his friends; yea although a man hath power to ſuppreſſe or raiſe them vp, and ſpecially when it is in the behalfe of thoſe who haue not committed any diſhonourable or vnworthie act, but on the contrarie haue performed that which was agreeable to their honour and reputation.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as the Germanes were out, they went towards the boates, which becauſe they were halfe on land and halfe in the water, they found very farre ingaged, and before they had drawne them out of their Docks into the water, they ſo filled them with their implements and their own perſons, that they could by no meanes wagge them: and thus loſing the time (whileſt on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> another ſide the Hungars ſaued themſelues in paſſing the riuer with their horſes at a foord) the Turks ſet vpon them as they were thus buſied, and put them all to the ſword, ſo that not a man eſcaped aliue. Whileſt that the Turks inflicted this puniſhment vpon theſe miſerable men (which they iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued) the Spaniards were almoſt al ſaued, ſome by water, &amp; others by land</p>

               <hi>Mahomet</hi> hauing in this ſort won this Caſtle with leſſe paine and trauaile then he expected (not conquering it by force, but by the cowardiſe &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie of the Germanes and Hungars who were there in garriſon, and who rather deſired to flie and forſake their King, then remaine fighting &amp; get ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and glorie, being well able to make reſiſtance without their loſſe or danger) repoſed himſelfe with his armie certaine daies in this place, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> leauing in it a ſtrong garriſon, he tooke his way towards Agria, with intention to beſiege it, thinking that thoſe who were within, would doe as thoſe of Zaluoch and Lippa had done. But God as an enemie to thoſe who truſt more in their forces, then in his aſſiſtance, would that all whatſoeuer we eſteeme impregnable, ſhould be loſt: and againe, that all that which we think
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21983:121"/>
vpon very good reaſon to be feeble and weake, forſaken of all helpe, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> anything fortified by any humane induſtrie, ſhould gallantly maintaine and preſerue it ſelfe: as appeared by this towne which the Turks found ſo ſtrong, that they had iuſt cauſe to bewaile that they were ſo euilly intreated there, as if they had receiued ſome bloodie ouerthrow in open field; this being an incredible thing how this towne could preſerue it ſelfe, and ſo exceedingly endamage the enemie.</p>
            <p>The loſſe then of Zaluoch ingendered in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> campe a great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and generally no leſſe aſtoniſhment to all, becauſe this was a place (as we haue ſaid) inuincible and impregnable, except by ſuch a manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was loſt: and <hi>Castalde</hi> bare inwardly in his heart, in finit griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for it, although outwardly he inforced himſelfe to ſhew very exceeding valour; and knowing that amongſt humane actions there commeth not one miſchiefe alone, but that it is accompanied with another euen hard at the heeles, this being the qualitie of Fortune, neuer to begin her ſports for a little while, he diſtruſted that this diſgrace would be accompanied with another, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe he ſaw ſo puiſſant an enemie, readie not onely to the ruine and ſubuerſion of Tranſiluania and Hungarie, but alſo of all Chriſtendome; and he ſuppoſed that he had done no ſmall matter, if he could maintaine himſelfe in ſuch eſtate as then he tooke himſelfe to be in, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but weake force &amp; a very ſmal armie, which alſo then he could not pay, and daily ſeeing the Fortreſſes to be abandoned, &amp; moſt cowardly left in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Turks power; and on the other ſide, continually perceiuing war to approach vpon him, and that euen by them from whom he hoped to find moſt fauour and ayd to maintaine <hi>Ferdinands</hi> part, and to aſſure theſe countries vnder his obeiſance, who on the contrarie wrought a dangerous reuolt, and ſecretly practiſed to depriue King <hi>Maximilian</hi> of al this prouince, to render it to King <hi>Iohns</hi> ſon, &amp; to reinueſt the Queene his mother into her firſt &amp; royall dignity, they being not able any longer to ſupport the wars, &amp; other inconueniences which daily afflicted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, labouring with al their skill to effect their purpoſes.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of theſe vehement ſuſpitions, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was in great vexation and heauines, fearing that that would ſhortly happen to him which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> before ſuſpected, ſpecially becauſe he knew the nature of the Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanians to be much inclined to nouelties and alterations, and that more then any neighbour Prouince whatſoeuer; and that alreadie oftentimes the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall perſons among them, vnder the colour of diuers vrgent occaſions, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into ſuch places, where they gaue more ſuſpition of reuolting, then aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of true amitie; all this notwithſtanding he omitted not to conſult and deliberate with the Vayuode and others, touching all that which was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and to prouide for it accordingly, not minding that any fault ſhould be attributed to him by his negligence or indiſcretion, nor to be reproued for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that he had not as a skilfull Captaine foreſeene euery inconuenience; as he very wiſely managed matters, which thing hereafter we ſhall more amply treate of in his proper place.</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21983:122"/>
who performed not any of his promiſes to her, and that it was reaſonable for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> her to breake with him, that had ſo often failed with her. With this choller and griefe ſhe practiſed the meanes to ſet footing againe into this Prouince, and to draw the principalleſt States thereof to fauour the cauſe of her ſonne, minding to aſſiſt her ſelfe with the offers which <hi>Mirce</hi> (Vayuode of the <note place="margin">Mirce, Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uode of the Tranſalpinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> Tranſalpinians) had made her, promiſing to ayde her both with men and money, and beſides to performe, what poſſibly he could, to reinueſt King <hi>Iohn</hi> into his former dignities. And before ſhe diſcouered any the leaſt inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of her determination, ſhe had cauſed <hi>Solyman</hi> ſecretly to bee intreated, <note place="margin">Izabella again ſeeketh the Turkes ayde.</note> that it would pleaſe him to fauour her cauſe, inſinuating to him how great and vnfained had been the amitie and affection which King <hi>Iohn</hi> her decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed husband bore him, and the great confidence that after his death ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had in him, and that he would vouchſafe not now to denie her his ayd in ſo great neceſſitie, which for the preſent ſhe was in, and eſpecially ſeeing ſhe was ſpoyled of all her goods, becauſe ſhe repoſed too great truſt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that if for her ſake he would not doe any thing, yet that at the leaſt he would haue a princely regard of pitie to her ſonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was a child and orphane, and expulſed from his owne inheritance, whom ſhe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into his armes, knowing that from the bountie of his princely diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe could not but hope of a remedie worthie of his excellent magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, there being not any thing more commendable among Princes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Monarkes, then to defend the iuſt cauſes of afflicted widowes and poore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, as ſhe and her ſonne were, in whoſe defence he ſhould greatly inrich his renowne with perpetuall glorie, and adde to thoſe his royall dignities, the ſurname of a pitifull and iuſt protector of thoſe, who vniuſtly are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the wickednes and intruſion of others: it being more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and behoouefull for his affayres, to haue them for his neighbours and confederates, then <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> from whom he could expect nothing elſe but continuall warre and perpetuall trouble.</p>
            <p>By theſe ſpeeches and other like reaſons which ſhe cauſed to be alleadged to him, ſhe (by the meanes and fauour of <hi>Achmeth</hi> Baſha) crept ſo into the fauour of <hi>Solymans</hi> liking, that preſently he writ to the Vayuode of Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <note place="margin">Stephen, Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde of Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauia.</note> named <hi>Stephen,</hi> that at all times, and as often as he ſhould bee requeſted by the Queene of Tranſiluania to ayde her, he ſhould not faile with the greateſt force he could make, to doe her all poſſible fauour: and the like he alſo commaunded to the Baſha of Buda.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> (during theſe practiſes) had alreadie intelligence how <hi>Chendy Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vicchy and Chendy for Izabella.</note> (one of the principall Peeres of the countrie) went often to viſit <hi>Peter Vicchy,</hi> who made his aboade in one of his Caſtles, ſituated in the confines of Polonia, and that they were accorded and vnited together, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie they had leauied forces, with intention to enter into the kingdome, and to reduce it vnder the Queenes command, alleadging for their reaſons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had obſerued nothing of that which was promiſed. Which truly they publiſhed, not ſo much for the intereſt &amp; fauour of the Queene, as to reuenge the death of Frier <hi>George,</hi> the which (and the authors thereof) <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> thought much of, and meant to reuenge it vnder the fauour and

power of <hi>Chendy,</hi> who after the death of the ſaid Frier, was growne puiſſant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in that countrie. And being thus vnited together, and ſtrengthened with many gentlemen, who ſecretly retired to them, they purpoſed greatly to trouble the affayres of the kingdome, by reaſon of the ſuccours which they aſſuredly hoped from the Moldauian, who as yet had not diſmiſſed his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and who alwaies (by <hi>Mahomets</hi> commaund) entertained it in the field, concluding with him, that they would at one inſtant enter into this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince: further alſo that they had agreed with the Vayuode, that cauſing all the countrie to reuolt againſt <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> he ſhould with al the other ſouldiours which were then with him, aſſaile thoſe of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> part, and cut them in peeces in the ſame field where <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſhould be incamped. But <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> diligent care and vigilancie, vaniſhed theſe deuices into ſmoake, ſo that this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> conſpiracie could take no effect; and ſpecially becauſe of the death of the Vayuode, which happened in the wiſhedeſt time that could be deſired, the ſame being practiſed many daies before: and which was as here follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> being at Segheſuar then, when he went againſt the Moldauian, there came to him at that time a Moldauian gentleman, a man of good <note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to kill the Vayuode of Moldauia.</note> countenance, well graced, and full of diſcretion. This man withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from <hi>Stephen</hi> the Vayuode, miſdoubting to bee ſlaine, in reſpect he greatly fauoured him who was the rightfull inheritour of this Prouince, which was by the ſaid Vayuode tyrannically vſurped. This gentleman <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> brought with him about ſome twentie horſe, with which hee offered his ſeruice to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whereupon he was receiued into pay: and theſe which ſerue in this manner, and with ſuch a number of men, are called in Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, Bugerons. Within a while after this Bugeron found the meanes to haue <note place="margin">Bugerons.</note> long diſcourſe with <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> concerning his affayres, to whom making an ample recitall of his eſtate and qualitie, ſaid; that the Vayuode had not yet wholly diſſolued his Campe, and that he yet entertained the greateſt part thereof, vpon opinion once againe to enter into this kingdome, vpon any occaſion when he ſhould ſee it moſt incumbred and oppreſſed by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of warre; and that if he would promiſe him his fauour and aſſiſtance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> he would aduenture to kill him; with this condition neuertheleſſe, that if in caſe he performed it, that then he ſhould bee a Captaine of 200. horſe in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> pay. Vpon this offer <hi>Caſtalde</hi> made him liberall promiſe thereof, and more then he demaunded, aſſuring him that beſides his promiſe, he would beſtow in reward of him 1000. crownes, if he returned hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this enterpriſe. The Bugeron nouriſhing himſelfe with this hope, returned into Moldauia, where he attempted many times to execute his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe: but yet could he not at that time attaine to the effect and iſſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for being diſcouered, hee was conſtrained to flie into Polonia, from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> whence he writ to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> of all what had paſſed, and that if he would that this conſpiracie ſhould proceede, that then he ſhould write to two of the Vayuodes houſehold ſeruants, who were very familiar with him, without whoſe meanes this enterpriſe could hardly take any effect: and that the contents of the letters which they ſhould write vnto them, ſhould bee to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21983:123"/>
requeſt them to haſten and performe that which they promiſed to him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of which they talked together, and that if it ſucceeded well, he promiſed to giue them all which he had offered, and a larger recompence then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and that they ſhould aſſure themſelues he would not any thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble or faile, in that whereof they ſhould haue need.</p>
            <p>This Bugeron meant that this letter ſhould be ſent ioyntly to them both, he practiſing by this policie to bring them in ſuſpition, (although indeede they were innocent thereof, neither were they imbrewed with any ſpot of this treaſon) and by this deuice to make them enemies to the Vayuode, and to incenſe them againſt him. This counſell was preſently practiſed, and that in ſuch ſort, that the Vayuode was as ſoone aduertiſed thereof, as <hi>Caſtalde</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had written to theſe two familiar friends of his, who could not keepe cloſe this letter, becauſe it was deliuered to them in the preſence of many. It alſo happened that when this letter was brought them, they were (as fortune would) both together, and preſently opening and reading it together, and remaining (by reaſon of the contence and nouelties thereof) wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſtoniſhed; and ſo much the more, becauſe they vnderſtood not what the letter meant, as men that had not any correſpondence with him who wrote vnto them: and afterwards thinking with themſelues what this might meane, and holding this letter ſtill in their hands, by chaunce there was by them a young youth alied to the Vayuode, who for that he was young, they had not any ſuſpition of him. This youth hauing neuertheleſſe well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the ſumme of their conference, went preſently to the Vayuode, and in order recited to him what hee had heard and ſeene. Whereupon theſe two were preſently ſent for, and the Vayuode commaunding them to ſhew the letter that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had writ to them, he interpreted it according to his owne minde; and ſo tooke them as traytors, and cauſed them preſently to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all their honors and dignities which they had in his countrie, with reſolution to behead them, and wholly to extirpate their houſes and goods; that by the horrible example of theſe, it might bee a iuſt preſident for others hereafter to bee better aduiſed from attempting ſo miſchieuous and vile an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> act.</p>
            <p>As the Vayuode was inquiſitiue about theſe practiſes, the Bugeron came from Polonia; and hauing vnderſtood that this letter of <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch effect as hee deſired; and that thoſe to whom it was written were greatly incenſed againſt <hi>Stephen</hi> the Vayuode, becauſe that by him (beyond all limits of reaſon) they were very cruelly abuſed and falſely accuſed of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that they could not tolerate this indignitie; and that they ſecretly conſpired a cruell reuenge thereof: and ſo knowing that the things would ſucceede according to his deſire, he meant not to omit this occaſion, which Fortune ſo fauourably offered to him, but willingly imbracing it, he ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ to theſe two, that if they would ioyne with him to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the wrongs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which were done them by the Vayuode, hee would gladly conſort with them, and eſpecially knowing betweene them how the other had moſt iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wronged them, and with what crueltie hee had much perſecuted them euen to death: diſcouering to them, that it was farre more conuenient
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21983:124"/>
to make him away by ſome deuice, then to looke for this that he ſhould take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> away their liues. Theſe two greatly ioyed at this vnexpected offer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to performe that vpon him, which vniuſtly he had impoſed vpon them, and to reuenge themſelues of the honours which were taken from them, and of the ſhame and obloquie, which vndeſeruedly they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt all right and reaſon. Many of their friends and kinſemen (who thought not wel of that which was done againſt them) conſpired with them, as alſo many others who were kinſemen to him, who lawfully ſhould haue been Vayuode. Theſe altogether complotted with the Bugeron, concerning the meanes that ſhould be vſed to put their conſpiracie in execution: which was, that they ſhould ſuddenly aſſaile their enemie and kill him; as within <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſhort time they performed it, entering furiouſly one day into the Vayuods Tent, who was laid vpon his bed to repoſe himſelfe, imagining that neuer any durſt haue the face to offend or diſturbe him; they gaue him ſo many <note place="margin">The Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> ſtabs with a poynard, that they cauſed him preſently to giue vp the ghoſt, and afterwards by the meanes of them that followed them, they ſet vpon 2000. Turks and Tartars, which he continually had for his guard, cutting and hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all in peeces, electing him for Vayuode, who indeed ſhould be he: which being performed, they conuerted their furie againſt the Tyrants kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, killing his mother, children, and friends (as the manner is in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie) not leauing aliue any of the contrarie faction, from whom afterwards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> they might haue any occaſion of miſtruſt.</p>
            <p>This death ſeemed to all very profitable, and ſpecially to the Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who by meanes thereof ſaw themſelues deliuered from very great dread and feare of being at any other time aſſailed by him: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, they ſaw this new Vayuode to make ſome ſhew to imbrace the amitie and friendſhip of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> which poſſeſſed them with a ſpeciall hope of a long and quiet repoſe. But all theſe vaine hopes in the end proued contrary, as wee ſhall more commodiouſly in another place ſpeake of: for that this new Vayuode of Moldauia did not long continue in this league, which he brake within a ſhort time after, that he might bee in the Turkes grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Alſo this death was the ſpeciall cauſe which hindered the conſpiracie that was wrought in Tranſiluania againſt <hi>Caſtalde;</hi> and alſo becauſe that at that time it came to be diſcouered, inſomuch that euery one knew all them that were actors therein, and who had promiſed him to enter thereinto: which made <hi>Peter Vicchy</hi> and <hi>Chendy</hi> to be greatly doubted, as all thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe who were compacted in this conſpiracie; of which number <hi>Caſtalde</hi> would not puniſh any therefore, knowing it was then no time, being on the one ſide withheld in regard of the feare and ſuſpition of the future warre: and on the other ſide ſeeing himſelfe more troubled then euer he was, by the vexations and diſcontents which his owne people hourely gaue him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which farre exceeded thoſe that he receiued by the enemie. For the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes in reſpect they were not payed, committed the greateſt outrages that <note place="margin">The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes muit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note> were poſſible, ranging and ſpoyling all the plaine countrie, killing the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of villages, and doing incredible things without any regard, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnworthie exceſſes, and ſuch as are vnfit for a Chriſtian, who is bound

            <p>In this time there arriued at Vienna the Popes Nuntio and Comiſſaries, <note place="margin">Information vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of George.</note> with articles drawne and propounded by Cardinals deputed thereto, touching the information of Frier <hi>George</hi> his death, vpon which they were to examine witneſſes, and to bee informed by them, if it were true, that hee practiſed treaſon againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in fauour of the Turkes: and namely, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cauſe him to loſe and be depriued of the Realme, and ſo accordingly to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if the death of Frier <hi>George</hi> was iuſt or no.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vpon ſome diſpleaſure which he conceiued againſt the Frier, was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an vnblameable witnes. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was greatly troubled to finde any who could verefie that which was imputed againſt the Frier: yet within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine moneths after there were ſent to Vienna certaine proceedings which they had paſſed touching that point, and afterwards they were preſented to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21983:125"/>
the Comiſſaries, who with ſpeede carried them to Rome. As theſe perſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> departed from thence, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being throughly informed of the vile and infamous loſſe of Lippa, and how it happened by <hi>Aldenes</hi> cowardlines: to the end therefore that this ignominious fact ſhould not remaine vnpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he commaunded <hi>Caſtalde</hi> that <hi>Aldene</hi> ſhould bee committed to priſon, and that by the conſent and aduice of the Vayuode, his proceſſe ſhould bee <note place="margin">Aldenes triall vpon life and death.</note> made againſt him; by meanes whereof he meant to make him vnderſtand that he would puniſh him rigorouſly, to the end that others by his example, ſhould learne more valiantly to maintaine their owne reputation, then hee had done.

In anſwer of which demaunds, he alleadged for his excuſe, that he was forced thereunto, by reaſon the moſt part of the ſouldiours were fled from thence, and that becauſe he had not time commodious to carrie out the victuals, Artillerie, and munition, he commaunded them to be burnt after that manner, chuſing rather to conſume them ſo, then ſuffer them to be a ſpoyle to the enemie, and that for the ſame conſideration he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the like to the Caſtle and towne, thinking that the Turkes ſeeing ſuch an apparant ruine, they would neuer afterwards make account of it, nor regard to fortifie it; he for his part purpoſing, that after they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence, he would returne thither againe, and eſtabliſh it in the former <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> eſtate, and fortifie it ſtronger then before: and that for theſe reaſons he was incited and conſtrained to doe that which he did. But more fully to know the trueth of all theſe matters, and to the end he ſhould not any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of iniurie that might bee done him, certaine Iudges were deputed to know and vnderſtand his cauſe, and to examine the ſouldiours who had been with him in Lippa.</p>
            <p>During all theſe proceedings which were managed at Vienna, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Frier <hi>George</hi> his death, and in Tranſiluania vpon <hi>Aldenes</hi> fact, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> ſeeing how all things did euen vntill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proſperouſly ſucceed with him, and how much Fortune did fauour him in his conqueſts, which he achie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> with ſmall labour; and how beſides ſhe had wonne him that honour and glorie, which he neuer expected to haue, perceiuing himſelfe by ſuch euents to be greatly redoubted and feared, did not one mite eſteeme the towne of Agria, perſwading himſelfe to haue wonne it eaſier, then he had done the other townes: and in the end (although he was greatly vrged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto) he marched thither, diſmiſſing a good part of his armie, aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he ſhould little neede ſo many men, nor ſuch a power of Caualarie, as vntill then he had, knowing this place to bee of no ſtrength, nor ſuch that it could long reſiſt his forces: whereupon he ſent the Baſha of Buda before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with certaine troupes of horſe to view the countrie, and to aſſure the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers thereof, hauing had aduertiſement that Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> was arriued at <note place="margin">Duke Mauris of Saxonie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie with 15000. men for Ferdinand.</note> Iauarin, where he was lodged with 10000.

good, as it was alſo accorded at Iſpurch betweene the Emperour and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him. This Duke had alreadie cauſed a bridge to bee built ouer Danubius, bruting it abroad that he would march to beſiege Strigonium. But although that at the beginning the Turkes had ſome feare and doubt thereof, yet this ſiege in the end was found to be nothing elſe but a particular ruine of this prouince, and it was the cauſe of a thouſand inconueniences and griefes to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and made him to conſume and ſpend all that treaſure which he had leauied to pay the armie which he entertained in Tranſiluania: and that was the cauſe alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither on the one ſide nor on the other, could any good be done. In the end the Baſha of Buda preſented himſelfe before <hi>Mauris,</hi> not with intent to fight (for his force was then but weake) but onely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his countenance, and whither he would march, that he might ſpeedily relieue that place, and in the meane time ſomewhat to bridle his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe two expected each others attempts, in ſuch ſort as you haue <note place="margin">Mahomet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegeth the towne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gria.</note> heard, <hi>Mahomet</hi> incamped himſelfe about Agria with 60000. men, and 50. peeces of Artillerie. This towne was in a manner all open, with a Caſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ancient fortification, without any defences or Bulwarkes, but onely certaine towers, and it is commaunded by a hill, the deſcent of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth within a ſtones caſt of the wall. This default of Rampiers and other weake meanes, was ſupplied by the inuincible courages of thoſe that were within, who were Hungars, to the number of 2000. of whom there were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 500. gentlemen well diſſended, and no leſſe eſteemed in the countrie for their vertue and proweſſe, who were retired thither with their wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and moueables, hauing no other place of ſtrength in the countrie but that, where they could finde any ſafetie for their goods and liues. Theſe, with the inhabitants of the towne and other ſouldiours, ſwore and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <note place="margin">The reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grians.</note> among themſelues, that not any one vpon their liues ſhould aduenture to ſpeake of any agreement, nor yeeld vpon no compoſition, nor yet to make replie to the enemies ſpeeches, but onely with Harquebuze and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: and in caſe that by the length and tediouſnes of the ſiege, they ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bee brought to extremitie of victuals, they ſhould firſt eate one another, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then cowardly to yeeld. And that daily (after interceſſion to God, and hearing Maſſe) both men and women, without intermiſſion, ſhould labour the ſtrengthening of the Rampiers and fortifications: and to auoyde all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they did expreſſely prohibit that none ſhould aſſemble aboue three or foure in a companie. Beſides, they ordained that all the prouiſion, as well for the munition as for the particular houſes, ſhould equally bee diſtributed by weight, and ſo much for a day: and that the Doues, Hens, Capons, Pullets, and other like victuals, ſhould ſafely bee kept and reſerued for the ſicke and wounded: and that all the ſpoyles which ſhould be gotten vpon the enemie, ſhould be put into a place apart, to make equall diuiſion therof among thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> who had beſt defended their countrie (comprehending therein the women alſo) who daily were marked and obſerued by a certaine Preacher, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſiege ſhewed himſelfe valiant and reſolute in fighting, and was the ſpeciall cauſe (by his exhortations) of this great effect, that thoſe of Agria
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21983:126"/>
brauely indured thirteene moſt cruell and bloodie aſſaults, and that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſhewed themſelues ſo gallant as they did, as preſently we ſhall ſpeake of. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of this reſolution, rather to dye, then yeeld themſelues vnder the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe mercie of the Baſha, they kept themſelues in continuall readines, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him with like armes to thoſe wherewith he ſaluted them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> (before he enterpriſed any thing againſt the towne) ſent to thoſe of the Caſtle, that if they would yeeld to him, he would then vſe them cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and with fayre warres ſuffer them to depart in all ſecuritie with their baggage, and he would yeeld them ſuch recompence, that they ſhould haue good occaſion to thinke well of him: and if they ſtood out and performed the contrarie, he aſſured them he would put them all to death, and pitch them vpon ſtakes, if they fell into his hands. But thoſe within would giue no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> eare to this ſummons, neither would they make any anſwer, but onely by ſigne, cauſing a beare or coffin, couered with blacke, to be faſtned vpon two Launces, and in this ſort to be ſhewed ouer the wall to the Trumpetter who ſpake to them, they not ſpeaking any one word to him, thereby giuing him to vnderſtand, that that Caſtle ſhould bee their ſepulcher, rather then they would yeeld it to them; it being then a cuſtome to vſe ſuch a ceremonie, when they would not accept of any conditions of yeelding, but rather die in libertie, then liue vnder the commaund of their enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> vnderſtanding of this their determination, and ſeeing in vaine he ſought compoſition with them, ſent that night to view the Caſtle, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> afterward appointed two batteries, the one towards the Church, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards the hill, and in each batterie he planted 25. peeces, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually played the ſpace of 40. daies. All the top and heigth of the Caſtle was wholly ruinated and ſo open, that the aſſieged could not any longer bee in ſafetie, in reſpect the Artillerie did greatly endamage them, and ſpecially that which was vpon the hill; which to warrant themſelues from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thereof, they within made a large and deepe Trench along the walles, where they rampierd themſelues, and in the night kept good watch without being farre from it, neither to eate nor ſleepe vntill the others were come thither to relieue them, which euery ſixe houres they carefully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>Preſently after, Baſha <hi>Achmeth</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> cauſed in one day to be giuen three aſſaults in diuers places, in which they loſt 8000. Turkes, who were climed vp to the top of the walles, and mounted vpon the breach, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their principall Commanders, for whoſe deaths the Turkes were more inraged and incenſed then before, and yet they ceaſed not without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to trie the aſſieged with new aſſaults and reenforcing of Cannons: and one day they gaue in foure places one of the horribleſt aſſaults that euer was heard of, to which ranne all the men and women of the towne, who with no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> leſſe courage then the men themſelues deſperatly fought like Lioneſſes with <note place="margin">The courage of the women of Agria.</note> weapon, ſtones, and skalding water, making ſo great a maſſacre of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that it was a dreadfull and moſt horrible thing, and worthie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration to beholde. During theſe aſſaults they performed many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table acts, and worthie to bee regiſtred in all volumes, of which the firſt was,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21983:126"/>
that the mother, the daughter, and ſonne in law fighting vpon the wall, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> husband of the ſaid daughter was killed, and the mother with compaſſion ſaying to her daughter, that ſhe ſhould goe and burie him: ſhe replied, that it was now no time to vſe obſequies, nor to attend vpon funerals, but rather to performe ſome cruell reuenge: whereupon taking her husbands ſword and his target vpon her arme, ſhe thruſt her ſelfe into the place of the dead, where ſhe ſhewed incredible valour, and by no meanes ſhe would depart from thence, before ſhe had reuenged the death of her husband by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate of three Turkes: which being done, ſhe withdrew herſelfe, and tooke the bodie of her dead husband in her armes, and carried it to the Church, cauſing him to be buried according to his degree. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>It happened alſo in another place, that a woman carying a great ſtone vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her head, with intent to throw it downe from the wall vpon the Turkes, a Cannon bullet ſtrooke off her head, and falling dead at her daughters feet, who taking that ſtone vpon her head all bloodie as it was, without omitting any time to bewaile the death of her mother, ſaying, that her death ought not to bee vnreuenged, and that it was not fitting for her (being her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to liue, without reuenging her death vpon another: and thus being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and as it were inraged, ſhe ranne thence with great furie where the greateſt throng and preaſe of Turks were, and killed two of them, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many other, imitating a true Amazon, or woman of Lacedemonia, and beſtirring her ſelfe from one place to another, ſhe exhorted euery one to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> performe their vttermoſt valour, putting them in minde of the oth which they had taken, and the glorious reputation which before God and the world they ſhould obtaine: and by this meanes ſhe preuailed ſo farre, that the enemies were ſhamefully repulſed and forced, maugre their brauerie, to retire &amp; forſake their Artillerie, in ſuch ſort, that there was two of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt peeces lipped. The courages now of the aſſieged was marueilous great, and ſpecially of the women, who with their husbands, fathers, children, and brothers, fought ſo couragiouſly, that they feared not any danger how great ſo euer it was. And as one day the Turkes gaue an aſſault to the towne (they being, as commonly they were wont to be, vpon the wall, armed with dead <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mens armour) it happened that a ſhot of Artillerie brought three or foure of thoſe to the ground, who were the formoſt and moſt readie to throw ſtones vpon the enemie; and although the blood and peeces of thoſe did much hinder the trauailes of them that were their companions, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they made not any ſemblance or token of feare, but rather in ſtead of hiding themſelues, they more inraged then before, preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the fight to reuenge their companions, and taking the ſame ſtones, all beſprinkled with their blood, they mounted vpon the top of the wall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming incredible valour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe heroicall acts, we may eaſily conceiue how great is the loue of our natiue countrie, and what commaund it hath ouer vs, ſince it incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for the defence thereof, a thing ſo feeble and weake as is a woman, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertly manifeſting to euery one, that there is not any thing in the world more deare or pretious, then our natiue countrie: for the good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation

of which, we are bound with our goods, honours, and liues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and preſerue. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe of Agria remained in this ſort ſo conſtant in their defence, (not willing at any time to ſpeake or lend their eare to any Turke, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were greatly importuned thereto) that in the end they put <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> and the Baſha of Buda in deſpayre for euer getting them vnder their puiſſance. And thus theſe two Commaunders of the Turkiſh armie, ſeeing the aſſieged would by no meanes yeeld, and that by ſtrength they could not ſubdue them nor force the towne, by reaſon of the loſſe which they had made of their people at the former aſſaults, and that the time now was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, for that the cold weather being now well forward, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ground often couered with ſnow, and their Campe ſorely infected with great mortalitie of men and horſes, they determined to diſlodge and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to retire. According to this reſolution, <hi>Mahomet</hi> one night (being the <note place="margin">Mahomet rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his ſiege from before Agria.</note> 18. of October 1552.) raiſed his whole Campe, and permitting <hi>Achmeth</hi> Baſha to march towards Buda, he himſelfe tooke the way of Belgrade, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging by this meanes the enterpriſe of Agria, not without great ſhame and diſhonour. The aſſieged not ſatisfied to ſee themſelues at libertie by ſuch a departure, the ſame day that the Baſha diſlodged, they cauſed to ſallie out of the Caſtle 1000. men, that charged thoſe in the Rereward, that kept not cloſe together, and killed many of them, and afterwards they returned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> loden with Turkiſh apparell, bringing with them many Camels and other beaſts loden with ſpoyle, and many priſoners, which was as a Trophie of their countrie, which they had well defended, and a glorie which worthely they achieued, meriting a glorious renowne, and an eternall memorie of a moſt excellent preſident to others, who may by ſo vertuous and honorable an act imitate them, cauſing to themſelues at the end of their honorable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, a like triumph, as happened to thoſe of Agria, and a generall praiſe amongſt all liuing people.</p>
            <p>Whileſt Agria was thus battered by the Turkes, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> aduiſed <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> to commaund Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> that he ſhould with his armie of the one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſide march againſt <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whileſt he with his people would aſſaile him on the other, aſſuredly thinking by this meanes to purſue and chaſe him, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the poore and weake eſtate wherein he then was, by reaſon of the great loſſe of men which he had receiued at the aſſaults of Agria, and of the ſorrow and griefe which was among thoſe that remained, by reaſon of the famine that was in his Campe, it being brought into ſuch ſtate, that the ſcarcitie increaſed more and more; inſomuch that for theſe conſiderations it would be very eaſie for <hi>Caſtalde</hi> and <hi>Mauris</hi> ioyned together, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the beſieged, to obtaine the famouſeſt victorie in the world, and in ſuch ſort to haue weakened the Turke, that for many yeeres after they ſhould liue ſecurely from receiuing any damage by him. But this counſell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> was not ſo followed as it ſhould haue been, whereby they loſt one of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt oportunities that euer valiant Captaine could deſire. For <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was not onely readie to aſſaile the enemie, but then had he the meanes to giue him battaile in the field, for that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had ſent him a good troupe of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21983:127"/>
light horſe: for want of which it hindered <hi>Mauris</hi> and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> to giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not willing raſhly to be ſubiect to the hazard of fortune.</p>
            <p>In ſtead of this counſell, it was commaunded to harrie the countrie of Alberegalis and Veſprimia, with intent to diuert the ſiege from Agria, which could not be executed for the contrarietie of the times.</p>
            <p>During the time that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was incamped before Agria, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the countrie and all the townes, with the conſent of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> had ſent <note place="margin">The Hungars ſeeke peace with the Turk.</note> to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that by his permiſſion they might (by meanes of <hi>Aly</hi> Chiauſs) treate of a peace and agreement with the Grand Seigniour. This Chiauſs was then with <hi>Mirce,</hi> Vayuode of the Tranſalpinians, and was come thither in <hi>Solymans</hi> name, to pacifie the people who were reuolted againſt their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Lord. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was well content at this requeſt, and willingly conſented to them; alwaies prouided it ſhould be with the accuſtomed conditions and articles, and with the ſame tribute that he had before times made peace with K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; alſo with charge that they ſhuld reſtore the townes, Caſtles, &amp; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Veſprimia, Drigal, Lippa, Themeſuar, Zaluoch, &amp; others which were taken by the Turks. He demaunded this, to the end that the truce or peace which was treated of, ſhould bring more honour then infamie to his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This commaund being come, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> permitted them to negotiate whatſoeuer ſhould ſeeme behoouefull for them, forbidding them neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, to name <hi>Ferdinand</hi> or himſelfe after any manner in this treatie, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it not conuenient to the reputation of his Maieſtie, nor himſelfe being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of that qualitie, as then hee was. The Deputies of the kingdome being thus diſpatched, they went to ſeeke the Chiauſs, to whom they manifeſted the effect of their comming. <hi>Aly</hi> hauing vnderſtood the ſumme of their demaund, anſwered them, that willingly he would negotiate this affayre with the Grand Seigniour, and that at the furtheſt they ſhould haue anſwer the 25. of October, and full reſolution of the whole: and that for that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they ſhould all then aſſemble at Waſrael, and not depart from thence vntill he made returne, or vntill ſuch time as he ſent to them.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Caſſombaſſa</hi> leauied as many men about Lippa as hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> could, aſſembling all the frontier garriſons, with intention to make incurſion into Tranſiluania to ſpoyle the countrie, and to erect a Fort vpon the way betweene Lippa and Deua, that hereafter it might make his proceedings more eaſie to him, by meanes of a ſtrong garriſon which he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine therein. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> to withſtand ſuch an enterpriſe, thought of many plots: and willing to reenforce the garriſon of Deua, he commaunded there ſhould goe thither three Enſignes of Germanes of <hi>Andrew Brandis</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But for want of three payes which was owing them, they did muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: whereupon aſſembling altogether, they ſeazed on the Artillerie, and <note place="margin">The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note> the moſt part of them came and ſacked the Spaniards lodgings, and namely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that of <hi>Caſtaldes,</hi> giuing them to vnderſtand that they would keepe him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and detaine him, vntill all the Germanes were fully ſatisfied their due. <hi>Caſtalde</hi> being aduertiſed of this tumult, mounted vpon a good horſe and went into the field, ſending after to them Counte <hi>Iohn Baptiſted Arco</hi> to appeaſe them. He being now come to them, ſharply reproued them for that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21983:128"/>
they meant to commit ſo infamous an act, ſpecially for this that all were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> fallen by meanes thereof into the like ſuſpition; and ſeuerely blaming the authors of that ſedition, he ſo farre preuailed that he appeaſed them, and procured their former obedience; neuertheleſſe aſſuring them that they ſhould receiue money, which preſently was payed them. Yet for all that they would not march on, ſo that they were conſtrained to ſend thither three other companies of Counte <hi>Helfeſtaines</hi> Regiment, who were better diſciplined in obeying their Commaunders. With theſe were ſent 400. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoliers, and they altogether marched to Deua, where <hi>Iohn Turky</hi> and <hi>Paul Banchy</hi> attended them with 500. horſe of their owne, and other companies which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had alreadie ſent thither: and hauing made one bodie of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> theſe ſouldiours, they marched towards Lippa, with a full reſolution to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter <hi>Caſſombaſſa,</hi> and they proceeded on euen to Perias, which is a ſtrong Caſtle kept by the Turkes, ſituated eight miles from Lippa, harrying all the countrie, ruinating this new Fort which the Turkes had vndertaken to erect betweene Lippa and Deua, killing all thoſe they found within; and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding yet further, they perceiued not any enemie whatſoeuer: for that <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſombaſſa</hi> hauing vnderſtood that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was not any thing ſleepie or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for the ſafetie of this Prouince, durſt not enter any further, fearing to be cut off at the retraict, diſtruſting himſelfe that the boldnes of thoſe who were ſo forward vpon his borders, was nothing elſe but ſome traine to delude and intice him to proceede on, that afterward they might circumuent and intrap <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his deſeignes. For theſe reſpects he proceeded no further, and our men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe from thence without any other profit, but onely endamaging their friends poſſeſſions, conſuming their victuals, &amp; ſpoyling them of thoſe little goods which they had, leauing to theſe poore villages (by this diſorder) a perpetuall memorie of the euill effects of warre.</p>
            <p>They being now all returned, the Captaine generall of the armie of the countrie would ſtay no longer in that kingdome: whereupon hee went to demaund leaue of <hi>Castalde,</hi> who by no meanes would permit him to depart, ſaying, it ſhould bee ill done of him to forſake him in ſuch a manner, being now alone in the field with ſo few men, ſpecially then becauſe it was certaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that the Baſha was not yet wholly retired; deſiring him to haue patience and expect a while, vntill the ſaid Baſha was at the leaſt further remoued from that quarter, from whence he was aſſured that he muſt ſhortly bee forced to depart, by reaſon of the Perſian warre which <hi>Solyman</hi> had determined to make againſt the Sophy, to recouer the countries which were taken from him; and to warrant himſelfe from his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Muſtapha</hi> (of whom he had great miſtruſt) fearing that he would make himſelfe Lord and maſter of his Empire. But all theſe perſwaſions and intreaties were of no force to keep him there: for that thoſe reaſons which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> vſed, thinking thereby to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> hinder him from going, did alſo ſerue him to haſten his departure, as he did at the end of eight daies, all his Caualarie following him, not any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting all the proteſtations which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> could vſe, to diſſwade him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> determination was not to remoue out of the field, neither to depart, before he had heard certaine newes that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21983:128"/>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> was paſſed Tibiſcus and Danubius, becauſe that ſince the raiſing of his ſiege from before Agria, he had aduertiſement that he vſed long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> iourneys to paſſe them. And expecting this iſſue, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> endured great diſcommodities, and extreame colds, for the high and deepe ſnowes which daily fell in great abundance, which made the ſouldiours paſſionate, and ſpecially for that they were not payed. Being then largely certified that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was entirely out of that part of Hungarie, he preſently licenſed all the ſouldiours of the kingdome to depart, and lodged the Germanes and Spaniards by Sibinio, and reenforced the garriſon of Deua, ſending thither a certaine number of Aiduchs to bee mingled amongſt the Germanes, and with the Caualarie that was therein, to the end that the one for the loue of the other ſhould bee more vigilant and carefull for the defence thereof, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he gaue the commaund of all the horſe to <hi>Iohn Turky,</hi> and the gouernment of the towne and foote to <hi>Paul Banchy.</hi> Hee alſo ſent certaine horſe to Branchich, and commaunded that Deua ſhould be wholly enuironed with a wall made of earth and wood mingled together by equall diſtances, to the end that the Caualarie ſhould not ſo eaſily approach thereunto, and that the Infantrie ſhould not offend them.</p>
            <p>Now he ſeeing that all the people of Tranſiluania began greatly to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur for the taxes which they daily paied to maintaine the burthen and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the warre (and both that he might giue time to his people to fortifie themſelues, and to reſiſt ſuch tumults, and alſo that he might certainly know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whether the Turke would enterpriſe the warre of Perſia) cauſed (the better to temper and mollifie the hearts of euery one) to bee publiſhed, that all the principall Peeres of the countrie ſhould aſſemble at Waſrael, to attend there the anſwer of <hi>Solyman,</hi> and to know if he would be content to accept (with the foreſaid conditions) the yeerely tribute of 20000. Duckets, and ſo to <note place="margin">Tribute which was payed to the Turke by the Hungars.</note> make truce with them, which he did thinke would be more expedient and behoouefull for <hi>Ferdinands</hi> affayres, then for the benefit of that people, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being full of ſtirres and doubtfulnes, and ſpecially for that he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe disfurniſhed of men and money, and out of hope to haue any ſuccours; further conſidering, that though the ſame would not ſerue to any other end, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but to bring with it a great commoditie of gaining time, that in the meane while he might cauſe to be aduanced and finiſhed the fortifications begun about the townes; yet neuertheleſſe it would be a ſpeciall cauſe of great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as well to accommodate and negotiate his matters in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, as alſo to demaund ayde both of men and money, and likewiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie the great neceſſities which then were diſperſed through all the parts of that Prouince, which now tended rather to reuolt, then maintaine obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and former faith giuen to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> According to theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he by the meanes of ſundrie perſons ſolicited, that this buſines might take effect, yet he would not be openly ſeene therein himſelfe, for feare leaſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Turke ſhould conceiue in him ſome relenting, and ſhould ſee the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities which enuironed him on all ſides. But on the contrarie he made an outward ſemblance, as though he no whit at all feared his enemie, vſing this courſe, to the end that the Turke fearing they would ſpoyle the countrie,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:21983:129"/>
whileſt he ſhould bee buſied in the Perſian warre, which was farre from this countrie, he would the more willingly bee inclined vnto peace. After this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> publication he went and lodged at Albe-iula, from whence he might more commodiouſly prouide for all places, hauing for his guard 500. Spaniſh Harquebuziers, and one companie of 200. Aiduchs, to put into garriſon in that towne.</p>
            <p>At this very ſame time there was brought to Rome the proceedings ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">The Popes abſolution in fauour of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand for the murther of George.</note> touching Frier <hi>George</hi> his death, and vpon the continuall ſoliciting of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Ambaſſadours, the Cardinals (appointed for that purpoſe) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to giue a finall ſentence of this fact, this cauſe being alreadie very grieuous in the Court of Rome: and notwithſtanding that they found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> things and allegations worthie of good oppoſitions, yet neuertheleſſe not to ingender more grieuous inconuenience, and for many other reaſons beſides, which I will not write of, they ceaſed not (conſidering it was a deed which could be no otherwiſe then done) to abſolue <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> with all the conſpirators, adding notwithſtanding this clauſe in their ſentence; that if the defences and allegations propounded by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> were true. Which the ſoliciters of his Maieſtie liked not of, who ſo much importuned the Pope, that in the end they had it abſolute without limit of any condition. And although the Pope refuſed to abſolue the complices of this death, yet in the end at the earneſt intreaties of the ſaid Ambaſſadours, this matter was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and the abſolution for them all was ſent to Vienna. Which was not performed but with <hi>Ferdinands</hi> great content, who vntill then was prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to heare Maſſe, and all other diuine ſeruice, yea and he was forbidden to enter into the Church.</p>
            <p>During this ſeaſon there happened a thing, which I will not forget to make recitall of, although it doth ſomewhat eſtrange it ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſubiect of this my diſcourſe. It happened in former time that one <hi>Raoul,</hi> a gentleman of Tranſalpinia, was diſpoſſeſſed from the Vayuodſhip of the Tranſalpinians, <note place="margin">Raoul expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his Vayuodſhip of Tranſalpinia by Mirce: he recouereth it, and diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Mirce.</note> which before his time was maintained and kept by his father, and which by right of ſucceſſion the office belonged to him. This man ſeeing himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> expulſed by force and treacherie from that kingdome, by the crueltie and wickednes of <hi>Marc</hi> (which in their language is called <hi>Mirce)</hi> an arrogant and proud tyrant, who had made himſelfe Vayuode, and who had conſtrained <hi>Raoul</hi> ſhamefully to flie away, and to ſeeke elſewhere how he might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his life, leauing his houſe and poſſeſſions vnder the commaund of his mortalleſt enemies: and thinking in himſelfe many thoughts concerning this his miſerable fortune, and apprehending a thouſand deliberations in his minde, that he might bee able to reenter againe into his poſſeſſions, and imagining that there was not any of ſufficient ſtrength to ayde him thereto; in the end he reſolued to preuaile (if he could) by the meanes and fauour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> to whom he was alreadie retired, and had ſerued him during the paſſed warres, with fiue or ſixe ſeruants onely, and ſome few horſes: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was held in good regard, and entertained as well as might be, yet was it nothing in compariſon of his paſſed greatnes, being reſpected and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houred as a King; ſo that he eſteemed of this ſmall entertainment, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21983:129"/>
then of a certaine miſerie: which cauſed a great commiſeration among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all the nations, ſeeing a man that had gouerned and managed a kingdome, euen as his owne, to bee brought (by the crueltie of wicked Fortune) into ſuch extreame pouertie, as to haue ſo few ſeruants, to whom oftentimes he could doe no more but prouide them foode. And euery man ſeeing this his miſerie to continue ſo long, they eſteemed him a man of ſmall reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch an one as could not haue in himſelfe any aſpiring thoughts. But in the end, feeling himſelfe ſpurred on with ſuch a ſhame, and he being informed of the good ſucceſſe happened to <hi>Stephen,</hi> Vayuode of Moldauia, tooke courage by this preſident, and began to thinke how he could make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his enemie: and intreating <hi>Caſtalde</hi> for a certaine number of footmen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and horſe, and that he would further him with his meanes in the enterpriſe which hee would execute touching the death of <hi>Mirce,</hi> not being able any longer to tolerate this pouertie, which by hard fortune he was fallen into: and comming one day vnto him, he began in this ſort to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Sir, it is ſome yeeres ſince that I haue been out of my hereditarie eſtate, expulſed from thence by the fraud and treaſon of that cruell and tyrannicall <hi>Mirce,</hi> who now by the ſupport and fauour of the Turkes poſſeſſeth it, daily vſing therein monſterous cruelties, farre vnfitting all humane proceedings, and which indeede farre exceed all barbarous cuſtome, hauing a while ſince (for feare I ſhould bee ayded to recouer that which I haue loſt) put to death by diuers torments, more then 3000. men, beſides an infinit company of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with moſt horrible crueltie, not minding euer to eate before he had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied his crueltie in cutting off the head of ſome great Lord. And with ſuch tyrannous behauiour he dominereth ouer that my poore and miſerable people, who for feare of loſing their liues, are conſtrained either to abandon their naturall homes, continually roming here and there, or elſe contrarie to their likings to doe that which he commaundeth them. Now conſidering theſe wicked and deteſtable actions, I not being able to containe my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer within the bounds of patience, I am determined to aſſaile my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which I truſt will yeeld me mine owne eſtate, or elſe I will depriue my bodie of this mortall life, which is not able any longer to tolerate this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And in regard thereof, I earneſtly entreate you by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt (according to which we liue, and in which my enemie beleeueth not, but rather vtterly deſpiſeth) that you would not forſake me in this neceſſitie, but aſſiſt me with what ſuccours you can, to the end that by the meanes thereof I may be able to recouer my kingdome, and reuenge the blood ſhed of ſo many noble gentlemen, as for my ſake haue been moſt vily and againſt all equitie cruelly maſſacred. And if the victorie happely inclineth to my part, it ſhall be for the generall good of all Chriſtians, and ſpecially for <hi>Ferdinands</hi> ſeruice. And if it ſucceedeth otherwiſe (which God defend) I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had rather die fighting within mine owne countrie, then to liue in this exile, expulſed by the treacherie of this cruell monſter <hi>Mirce.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> comforting and exhorting him to purſue this enterpriſe, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that conſidering the iuſt cauſes which he alleadged, and of which he was ſufficiently informed, he need not to doubt to haue good iſſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21983:130"/>
by reaſon of the ſuccours which he promiſed him, and ſpecially by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Ieſus Chriſt, which was the moſt ſure and certaine helpe, becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he was worſhipped by him, and not by his enemie: and ſecondly, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which he might get by the force and vertue of his owne arme, and by the valiantnes of his combattants: and for the laſt, he offered him a good number of ſouldiours, and ſummes of money, exhorting him to haſten this expedition, whileſt the Turk was buſied in the Perſian affayres, and that he ſhould not loſe this occaſion which ſo fauourably preſented it ſelfe: for that before the Turke could come to giue any reliefe to <hi>Mirce,</hi> he ſhould bee more then a yeere ſetled and poſſeſſed of the Seigniorie, and ſhould haue the meanes ſo firmely to aſſure and reeſtabliſh his forces there, that he would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> bee well content to haue him for his friend. He gladly condiſcended to all that which he demaunded, and rather by reaſon of the compaſſion which he had of him, then that he thought he could become victorious in ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. Whereupon he gaue him 700. horſe, and 1500. Aiduchs, the beſt ſouldiours that he had, and who had very well witneſſed their valour during theſe warres, they being continually employed about Themeſuar, keeping <hi>Mahomets</hi> Campe ſtill in larums, and many times put them to ſhamefull foyles. The Captaine of which companie was named <hi>Nicholas,</hi> a moſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and reſolute man in fight, although very often he would bee drunke, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of thoſe nations. <hi>Raoul</hi> hauing obtained his deſire, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> tooke leaue of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> and with his ſouldiours, and others his confederates that were adhering to him, he reſolued either to conquer, or dye.</p>
            <p>As theſe marched on, <hi>Mirce</hi> had notice of the forces that <hi>Raoul</hi> leauied in all parts, and how he came to ſeeke him, and with what intention. Which being duly conſidered of, he preſently cauſed (by the meanes and aſſiſtance of his friends) to leauie as many men as he could, making an armie of 24000. men, with whom, and with 36. peeces of Artillerie, he went into the field, lodging about Tergouiſta, with reſolution there to attend his enemie, for that the place was moſt commodious to diſpoſe and range his people in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. <hi>Raoul</hi> on the other ſide, notwithſtanding all his attempts and diligence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> could leauy no more (euen with <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> people) then 12000. men, although he had many friends, and was generally the beſt liked of among all the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalpinians. For none durſt ſhew him any fauour, ſeeing he was of ſo weake a force, and his enemie ſo braue and gallant; euery one fearing that the iſſue of this enterpriſe would not ſucceede to his honour: and to fall into the danger of <hi>Mirces</hi> diſpleaſure, whoſe horrible and execrable crueltie euery one greatly feared. With theſe few men neuertheleſſe he deſiſted not from marching to incounter his enemie, who had for his Vauntgard 600. Turkes on horſebacke: and being reſolued to giue him battaile, and not to bee ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at any hand with the great preparation of his enemie, he being one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by dawning of the day arriued vpon certaine hils, was diſcouered by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the Sentinels of <hi>Mirce,</hi> who then ſuddenly cauſed his people to bee ranged <note place="margin">The battaile betweene Raoul and Mirce.</note> and ordered, ſeeing he could by no meanes refuſe the battaile, and knowing that his enemies were reſolutely determined to fight: and although it was ſo that he might haue auoyded it, yet would he not retire, although he had
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21983:130"/>
ſome doubt and ſuſpition to fight, being aduertiſed that <hi>Raoul</hi> brought with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him both Spaniards and Germanes which <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had giuen him, aſſuring himſelfe that thoſe few ſouldiours which were with him were moſt valiant and expert, and not eaſie to bee ouercome; yea and hee did alſo diſtruſt of ſome other ſuccours. While ſuch thoughts were in hammering, <hi>Raoul</hi> in the end made two ſquadrons of his armie, each ſquadron being of 5000. foote and 1000. horſe, the moſt part of which were Harquebuziers; and cauſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to march within harquebuze ſhot, they made a ſtand vpon a hill, cauſing them in ſuch ſort to be ſtretched out, that they made ſhew of 14. or 15000. men. Which being perceiued by <hi>Mirce,</hi> and eſteeming that number to bee greater then they ſhewed themſelues before, he began to diſtruſt himſelfe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſome deceit, and that he had not at the firſt certaine intelligence; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his people to ſtand more cloſe then ordinary, when the Harquebuziers of <hi>Raoul,</hi> more confuſedly then diſciplinarily, without expecting any other commaund or ſignall to fight, were reſolued (as before they promiſed) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ouercome, or die, and gaue ſo furious a charge vpon one of <hi>Mirces</hi> ſquadrons, as wolues vſually doe amongſt a thouſand flocke of ſheepe, and breaking the firſt rankes, and quaſhing many a Turke (who as the moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute men were in the fore rankes, and vpon whom <hi>Mirce</hi> repoſed his greateſt confidence) the others began preſently to recoyle, and in flying they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch diſorder, that there was none amongſt them who thought not flying to be his beſt ſafetie. <hi>Raoul</hi> on the other ſide at the ſame inſtant with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Infantrie and Caualarie, moſt fiercely entered into another ſquadron of his enemies horſe, with no leſſe courage then the ſaid Harquebuziers did, and breaking the firſt rankes, he forced the other to turne their backes, being on all ſides gaulled and pearced with the thicke haile of the Harquebuziers, who made not any ſhot in vaine. This flight was of ſo great efficacie for <hi>Raouls</hi> good, that <hi>Mirces</hi> ſquadron ſeeing theſe two thus quite defeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſt with feare, without further expectance of the enemie, bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed themſelues ſo to flight &amp; confuſion, that happie was he that could beſt <note place="margin">Mirce ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> flie, and he eſteemed himſelfe moſt fortunate, who ſuppoſed that he ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be ſaued rather then others: this ouerthrow thus happening, becauſe that the greateſt part of this armie was compoſed of men ſent by the townes and Lords of the countrie, who are rather fit to make a number and ſhadow, then to winne a victorie.</p>
            <p>Thus wee often ſee that multitudes of ſuch who are thus rawly ſent, are for the moſt part ouercome and ſubdued by a leſſer number of ſouldiours, well diſciplined and practiſed in warre, who to obtaine honour, refuſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perill of ſword, fire, nor yet death it ſelfe: and by this wee may iudge how dangerous and peſtilent, feare and cowardiſe is in an armie; and how much on the contrarie, vertue and valour, and the proweſſe of a noble and generous courage, ioyned with the force and dexteritie of the bodie, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by which commendable qualities, wee may auoyde the detraction and infamie of this world, and purchaſe this true glorie, which beautifieth and adorneth euery one, and which raiſed <hi>Raoul</hi> to the type of honour, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo eaſily thereby this victorie, that it ſeemed it was a true miracle of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

Chriſt, who to puniſh this tyrant (an enemie of his faith) iuſtly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this ruine to befall him.</p>
            <p>The ſouldiours of <hi>Raoul</hi> ſeeing then that <hi>Mirces</hi> armie was quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and that there were not now any who oppoſed themſelues againſt them, forbearing the execution and ſlaughter of their enemies, they began to ſearch and ranſacke thoſe who fell into their hands, and they performed ſo much for their owne profit, that euery one of them became very rich thereby. All thoſe of <hi>Mirces</hi> faction who were aliue, preſently ranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the Victors Enſigne: as it is alwaies the cuſtome of the vulgar ſort to follow new fortunes, and daily deſire new Lords. And making toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great army, they determined to purſue <hi>Mirce,</hi> who ſaued himſelfe with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the reſt of the 500. Turkes, which before is ſpoken of, and had now paſſed Danubius. There died in this battaile about 7. or 8000. men of <hi>Mirces</hi> part, and <hi>Raoul</hi> loſt about ſome 700. <hi>Raoul</hi> thus achieuing this notable victorie, he preſently got poſſeſſion of all the moueables of his enemie, which were ſaid to be more worth then 200000. Duckets, with which he bettered his former neceſſitie, and recouered all his kingdome: the principall Peeres thereof, with all his kindred and friends, came to receiue and acknowledge him for their true and liege Lord, and after that they conducted him with pompe to Tergouiſta, where friendly and willingly they all ſwore fidelitie to him, and <note place="margin">Tergouiſta the capitall towne of the Tranſalpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> did him all the honours as was fitting for them.</p>
            <p>Behold here the mutations and changes of fortune, with which ſhe exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and abaſeth whom it pleaſeth her, and giueth example to Potentates of the world, after what ſort they are to diſpoſe of their actions, and how little they ought to truſt in her; becauſe that throwing them to the ground, they cannot eſteeme any thing firme and ſtable. A Bugeron followed <hi>Mirce,</hi> and incountring with another Bugeron, who was well apparelled and richly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he killed him, verely beleeuing it had been <hi>Mirce</hi> himſelfe; and repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this newes, it cauſed generally euery one to reioyce. But preſently after it was knowne not to bee true, and that he was ſaued in manner as wee haue ſaid.</p>
            <p>Certaine daies after, <hi>Raoul</hi> hauing pacified all the troubles in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> diſpatched his Ambaſſadours to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> to giue him heartie thankes for all his former fauours hee had ſhewed him, and for the ayde that hee gaue him, with which hee wonne this victorie, which had yeelded him his kingdome, and preſerued his life: whereupon he entirely offered himſelfe vnto him, aſſuring him to bee alwaies readie vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer to accompanie him: and beſides, ſwearing to him all fidelitie, and that for his owne part and his countries, he would continually obſerue good peace and amitie with him.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he was in this diſpatch, there arriued at Waſrael the Chiauſs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> who ſhould negotiate this peace between <hi>Ferdinand, Solyman,</hi> and the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluanians, as a little before is recited. He being returned from Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, and come to this place, he found there aſſembled (according to the former order) moſt of all the principall States of that countrie, who attended him with great deſire and hope of peace. This negotiator was very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:21983:131"/>
entertained by them, and after he had repoſed himſelfe one day, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was conducted into the aſſemblie, where in ſtead of peace and truce, hee <note place="margin">The anſwer of Solyman to the requeſt that the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars made for peace.</note> brought ſuch feare and aſtoniſhment into the mindes of euery one, that it was an incredible thing: for that in ſtead of accepting the tribute, he ſpoke to them all in the name of <hi>Solyman,</hi> that his pleaſure was they ſhould receiue King <hi>Iohns</hi> ſonne and Queene <hi>Izabella</hi> his mother as their true and lawfull Lords, and ſhould expulſe <hi>Caſtalde</hi> out of Tranſiluania, and cut all the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in peeces which were payed by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and that then he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ordinarie tribute, and would eſteeme them worthie of his grace and fauour: and if they otherwiſe did, that hee would then cauſe them to know what his indignation would bee, and that his abilitie and Maieſtie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had the power to reuenge himſelfe againſt them all, putting all to fire and ſword, trampling and pacing his horſes ouer their bodies, reducing their countrie into a miſerable deſtruction. And hauing thus ſaid vnto them, he gaue them a letter written in Latin, directed to Vayuode <hi>Battor,</hi> and to all the other Lords and Peeres of the kingdome, which verbatim I haue truly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, without altering or corrupting any thing therein contained.

And if the Tranſiluanians (we affoording them our ayde) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> will not returne to their ancient obedience and loyaltie, they ſhall neuer be on any ſide ſure or ſafe, but ſhall endure through the world the iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they haue merited.

               <q>I know not (O you Lords and Peeres of Hungarie, Saxonie, and Sicilia) <note place="margin">The oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Caſtalde to thoſe of the Diet of Waſrael.</note> vpon what occaſion you are ſo ſuddenly aſtoniſhed, and ſo much amazed, that I cannot but extreamely maruaile thereat, ſeeing that if for ſuch vaine boaſting words, you are ſo diſcouraged, and in a manner halfe dead; what I ſhould thinke of you if it happened to come to deedes: for dread of which you can doe no worſe: and for feare of the miſchiefe which the Turk denounceth to you, you ſhould with ſuch cowardlines, yeeld your neckes ſubiect vnder the yoke of his tyrannicall Empire, minding vpon ſo light an occaſion to defraud your ſelues of this glorie, which partly hath been ſeene to bee achieued by you vntill this preſent, and which in many armies hath ſhined euery where: not conſidering that ſome will boldly ſay, that your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> feare hath been in part the cauſe, that ſuch iniurious writings and horrible menacies, ſhould haue the force with you to kill you, and cauſe you to dye, as men without ſeeing any ſword. But if it be your minde that men ſhould not ſo thinke of you, and that indeede you would not giue any occaſion thereof; why like women or children doe you ſuffer your ſelues to bee ſo amazed? Are you not men like vnto them? Haue you not the like equall courage, force, and vigour which they haue? Or what (I pray) haue they more then you? What maketh you thus ſo ſuddenly to feare, you whom in times paſt haue ſo many times beaten and ouerthrowne them? Doe you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not manage and beare the ſame armes? and ride you not on the ſame hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with which you haue often forſt them to many labours and toyles: ſo that they haue more occaſion to feare you, then you thus to loſe your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in reſpect of them? What blame and diſgrace will this be to you, I ſay, who ſo many times haue been victorious, and often haue defeated and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21983:134"/>
the Turke out of this kingdome, to agree now to him, by reaſon of the brauado of a ſimple vaine letter, which by force of armes you would neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> heretofore haue condiſcended vnto, and thus ſillily like ſimple lambes to throw your ſelues into the wolues mouth? Shall not this (trow you) bee a perpetuall diſhonor to you all? It behoueth you therefore to haue this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant opinion, that before you fall into this great indignitie and calamitie, that you expoſe your owne liues for your religion, countrie, children, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wiues, ſiſters, and kinſefolkes, rather then remaining aliue, you ſhould become a laughing ſtocke to all the world. For thoſe ſhall alwaies be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med glorious, and worthie of all praiſe, who fighting for the libertie of their countrie, and common good, ſhall not refuſe an honourable death, to auoyd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> a miſerable and diſhoneſt life. It is apparant to you that the Turke hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſounded all violent meanes, and not being able to ouercome you by force, he now goeth about by theſe his other ſubtelties to ſubdue and bring you vnder, to the end that you might proue by this his horrible crueltie, that which his owne naturall children are fallen into. And beleeue me, he that is cruell againſt his owne fleſh and blood, cannot bee milde and mercifull to others, as aſſuredly he will not be towards you at any hand: but he will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie himſelfe ſo (ſeeing the diſſentions of you all not very well accorded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your ſelues) as he and his predeceſſours behaued themſelues then, when they ſaw the diſſentions betweene the Chriſtian Princes, which haue thus increaſed this Empire vnto them, as with griefe too apparantly is ſeene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> at this day. And aſſure your ſelues he will doe with you, as he hath done in Greece, which for her laſt refuge took a like reſolution to this of yours, the end of which, ought to be more manifeſt and euident then euer heretofore, by reaſon of the experience you haue had of former miſerie. And on the contrarie, if you will conſorte in a good and friendly vnion, theſe loftie and furious ſpeeches cannot any way hurt you. For a generall vnion and ſetled concord, doth alwaies feare and terrifie the enemie; and on the contrarie, diſcord and diſſention giueth him hope to ouercome: whereas by the meanes of a mutuall vnderſtanding and amitie among your ſelues, you may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> bee aſſured he ſhall not haue the power to fleſh himſelfe in your blood, nor glut himſelfe amongſt you with all kinde of incontinencie, as his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors haue done in the principall houſes of Greece. Now, ſeeing it is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen to all, to be more inclined to chuſe of the worſt, rather then the beſt, I haue thought it fitting to aduertiſe you, with the beſt and pleaſingeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions that poſſibly I can, that you haue no need thus to neglect your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer force and vertue, for brauadoes which are but forged and full of winde. Conſidering in what repoſe and quiet you now are, enioying your full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and the ſame peaceably, and that vnder the wing and protection of your King, who is ſo milde and iuſt, that not any whoſoeuer may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him: and imagining on the contrarie, that you ſhall neuer finde reſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> or ſafetie vnder the gouernment of this cruell and barbarous Lord; holding it for moſt certaine, that it is a vaine conceit for ſtrangers (ſuch as you are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of him) once to thinke that they are able to finde any clemencie and pitie in him, who towards his owne naturall children hath manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21983:134"/>
moſt cruell. Therefore you ought to animate, defend, and ſupport your ſelues with a firme and ſtoute aſſurance, worthie of your former proweſſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> againſt theſe accidents of Fortune, that ſo you may gaine a glorious life: for things that haue bin done by like tyrants, ought to be tolerated as miſchiefes, which ſuddenly proceed from nature. And ſtay your ſelues vpon the King my Lord and maſter, who will neuer faile to ſend you what poſſible ayde he can, with which he is alreadie become maſter of Albe-iula, Ahnas, Engedin, and Lippa, &amp; hath forced the Turk to recoile &amp; raiſe his Campe from before Themeſuar, conſtraining him in great haſte to auoide this kingdome (which vndoubtedly hee meant then to haue reduced to a miſerable and perpetuall bondage) and preſeruing you in this liberty, in which through his grace and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fauour you liue, and for which both your ſelues and children ſhould be for euer bound to him. And conſidering the aduertiſement that ſhall be giuen to our King of all theſe affayres, expell and baniſh from your idle fancies theſe feares and momentarie conceits, and doe not any whit dread theſe theeues and robbers, which with ſo great furie they menace to ſend vnto you. Beleeue me their armies haue no wings to flie, neither can they ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſemble themſelues as they haue writ of. And as once (to our great glorie) wee haue chaſed them out of this Realme, with ſo great loſſe of his people, as cannot well be recounted: ſo I aſſuredly hope, that for the time to come we ſhall againe performe the like, and that with our farre greater praiſe and renowne; and then he in good earneſt taſting of your reſolution, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſtoutnes of courage, and inuincible vertue, he leauing you there in peace, will chaunge his intention like fortune, plainly knowing that he hath not to manage warre with effeminate or cowardly people, but with men experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as well in warre as in peace, and who through the world ſhall yeeld a deare account to him of their perſons, while they doe as reſolute mindes are wont to doe, who being vniuſtly iniuried, and feeling the outrage that they haue receiued, doe for peace willingly imbrace warre.</q>

            <p>All the Lords preſent being reanimated by theſe ſpeeches, ſent to tell the <note place="margin">The Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanians rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turkes.</note> great Turke, <hi>Achmeth</hi> Baſha, the Moldauian, and the Belerbey of Greece, that they ſhould come no further, becauſe that they were reſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to reſiſt them as much as they could, hauing determined together to die in battaile, rather then to liue vnder their lawes. They alſo anſwered the Chiauſs, that they were content to pay him the ordinarie tribute, if ſo it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Grand Seigniour to accept of ſuch as was offered him: which if he would not accept, that then he ſhould preſently depart.</p>
            <p>The Chiauſs receiuing this anſwer, and ſeeing he could then accompliſh no other thing, accepted of the ordinarie tribute, which was yeerely 20000. crownes, and ſo retired to Belgrade, and from thence to Conſtantinople, leauing the kingdome free of a great feare and ſuſpition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> hauing thus (though not altogether) gained the hearts of the Tranſiluanians, and confirmed them in the league and deuotion of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> retired againe to his accuſtomed aboade at Albe-iula: where he had not been long, but that he had newes how <hi>Achmeth</hi> (Baſha of Buda) writ
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21983:135"/>
a familiar letter full of a thouſand kind and liberall offers to <hi>Patocchy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> certaine hidden and ſecret words, as if there had been ſome great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and correſpondence betweene them two. Which the Baſha pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely practiſed, to the end that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſhould vpon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, iuſtly conceiue ſome miſtruſt againſt him. But his former procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings being ſufficiently iuſtified, hee was alwaies held and reputed by them very loyall and faithfull, and they committed vnto him the Caſtle of Iula, with the gouernment of the towne, that he might keepe it (as in former time hee had done) faithfully, and therein to remaine his wife and children.</p>
            <p>The Caſtles of Iula, Panchotto, Varadin, and others began to bee in ſome diſtreſſe for want of victuals, and it was moſt neceſſarie to make prouiſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for them: which was not done without great diſcommoditie, for that they were conſtrained to employ thereupon the money which was appointed for the muſters, and payment of the ſouldiours: ſo that the time to muſter being come, and this ſaid money ſpent in theſe affayres, it was not poſſible to recouer or get any more: and that was the cauſe (as hereafter we ſhall ſpeake) of great tumults, and ſpecially becauſe Vayuode <hi>Battor</hi> by his indiſpoſition, or for that it ſo pleaſed him, would no longer execute the office of Vayuod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and requeſted that they would prouide themſelues of another there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although <hi>Caſtalde</hi> inſtantly deſired him to continue in this office, which greatly troubled him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe troubles, letters came from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to begin a trial and proceed therein againſt <hi>Aldene</hi> the Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, <note place="margin">The purſuice againſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene.</note> who was ſtill priſoner, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> afterwards he ſhuld be ſent to him, with all the proceedings againſt him. <hi>Aldene</hi> reprouing (as ſuſpected) certaine of the Iudges, required his Maieſtie that his triall might bee referred to others: which being granted him, they began to examine many witneſſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his triall, by which in the end he was condemned to die, and euen by the depoſition of many who did proue againſt him the great treacherie and cowardlines which he vſed in abandoning Lippa, he being well able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, who alſo ſet open and declared the great loſſe and damage which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> had committed againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in cauſing the Caſtle and Artillerie and all the munition to bee conſumed with fire, which were the materiall cauſes that he was condemned to death for. His triall being thus fully concluded, he was ſent to Vienna with the ſentence of the Iudges: which being allowed by his Maieſtie, declared that he ſhould be ſent vnder a ſure guard, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, according to that commaund, was ſurely conducted in chaines to Vienna, where hee remained priſoner ſo long, that the continuance thereof in the end was the cauſe (as hereafter wee ſhall ſpeake) of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Queene Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into Tranſiluania.

            <p>In the meane while, Queene <hi>Izabella</hi> was not any thing idle, but practiſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> all the meanes ſhe could to reenter againe with her ſonne, greatly aſſiſting her ſelfe by the meanes and fauour of <hi>Peter Vicchy,</hi> and <hi>Chendy Ference,</hi> and other principall men, who ſecretly affected her cauſe. And although <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:21983:135"/>
writ to her, that he was readie at all times to performe that which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> promiſed her, and beſides to giue her the Dutchie of Monſterberg, yet ſhe would by no meanes accept any whit thereof, ſaying, that ſince within the preſixed time the premiſed bargaines and agreements were not of his part performed, ſhe for her part meant no leſſe to obſerue and keepe them, and that ſhe was determined againe to haue her owne. Vpon which, there was newes that the Sicilians intended ſome treacheries with the Turks in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and that they had ſent ſome priuately to her, to reſtore <hi>Iohn</hi> into his kingdome. By occaſion of theſe tumults there was a Diet aſſigned at Poſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, wherein the people of the kingdome of Tranſiluania greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained <note place="margin">Euill intreatie cauſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the Tranſiluania<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand.</note> of the griefes and wrongs which they daily endured, as wel by the warre and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fortifications, as alſo for the inſolencies which they receiued by <hi>Ferdinands</hi> ſouldiours, importuning to haue redreſſe thereof, and not to taske them with ſuch impoſitions; promiſing if he did ſo, not to faile his Maieſtie, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to take armes againſt the Turkes, and valiantly to defend themſelues againſt them, and ſincerely to maintaine the dutie and homage which they had ſworne to his Maieſtie. Vpon theſe complaints and demaunds, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> cauſed them to bee anſwered, that he would not faile as much as he could, to eaſe them of that burthen, and that he would cauſe it to appeare vnto them, that his pleaſure was no other but alwaies to ayde and defend them againſt the violence of the common enemie; againſt whom they ſhould not for all that faile to take armes, as he for his part would not bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wanting to ſend them forces, and to come in his owne perſon (if neceſſitie did ſo require it) for their deliuerie, or elſe to ſend them the King of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia his ſonne; that preſently he would giue order to all thoſe inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which they complained, and that in the meane time they ſhould not omit to perſiſt in the faith and deuotion wherein they had vntill then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and that there ſhould be no fault in him, but that he would vſe them as moſt loyall and faithfull ſubiects. Whereupon euery one held himſelfe well contented with theſe promiſes. Yet for all that, theſe humours ſlided not out of their braines, but increaſed more and more, ſpecially becauſe it was manifeſt that <hi>Bartholmew Coruatte</hi> (who had the guard of Iula with two Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> companies) badly behaued himſelfe in this towne, ſpoyling, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and killing the poore inhabitants thereof, preaching to them the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran religion, with which opinion he was infected. To remedie which, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi> was conſtrained to depute <hi>Paul Banchy</hi> in that quarter for Vice Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uode, and commaund <hi>Coruatte</hi> to depart out of Iula, and ſent him farre off, leauing the charge of this towne to <hi>Francis Patocchy,</hi> who bore himſelfe ſo familiarly amongſt the inhabitants, that they found themſelues greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced and comforted therewith.</p>
            <p>If on this ſide <hi>Ferdinands</hi> ſouldiours did miniſter exceeding griefe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> diſquiet to <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> they yet on the other ſide gaue him daily more and more for want of pay, he being greatly tormented by Duke <hi>Mauris</hi> for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſouldiours that was due to them, from the time that the ſiege was raiſed from before Agria, he neuer hauing receiued any ſeruice from
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21983:136"/>
them, but rather great damage and infinit ruine through the whole Realme. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> For the redreſſe and diſpatch of which (although the winter was come) he <note place="margin">Duke Mauris diſmiſſed.</note> meant indeede fully to content him, and to diſſolue his armie, which was diſmiſſed from Iauerin, and there was put therein another garriſon. This was the cauſe, that he being deſirous to keepe his word with this Duke, he could not then ſatisfie with pay his owne Campe which he had in Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania, of which, for that it was compoſed of the vaſſals and ſubiects of his king and that countrie, he had more aſſurance in their patience, then in the other which were ſtraungers and not ſubiect to him, who at their departure, although they were well payed, yet for all that they deſiſted not from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting great inormities. And although <hi>Caſtalde</hi> did what poſſibly he could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to keepe his ſouldiours in peace, prouiding them of good lodgings, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to bee diſtributed through the countrie ordinarie victuall, more then was ſufficient, yet could he not ſo farre preuaile with them, as to cauſe them to deſiſt from, or giue ouer their mutinies, conſpiracies, or other horrible miſchiefes, which did not onely hurt in particular, but alſo in generall: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the inhabitants of the countrie receiuing ſuch iniuries, hated and abhorred them greatly, and they ſpake of nothing elſe, but that occaſion would offer it ſelf for them to take armes, and giue them cauſe to vnderſtand their fault, by the maſſacring which in time they hoped to execute vpon them, all of them earneſtly deſiring (that they might the better wade out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of ſuch calamities) the returning of <hi>Iohn</hi> into his kingdome. By reaſon of ſuch miſchiefes, many Captaines and principals of the countrie, who in former time had been <hi>Ferdinands</hi> friends, became ſecretly his deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and raunged themſelues on Queene <hi>Izabellaes</hi> partie, not a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing her forces and faction, which procured to <hi>Caſtalde</hi> infinit diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>Now, as Fortune in this quarter managed the actions of mortall men, ſhe (in better manner then men could think for) diſpoſed of them about Deua, becauſe that thoſe who were in garriſon in this towne, hauing intelligence <note place="margin">The garriſon of Deua put in route ſome Turkiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</note> that by the commaund of <hi>Caſſombech,</hi> two companies of Turkiſh horſe were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> departed out of Lippa, to enter, harrie, and ſpoyle in Tranſiluania, they put themſelues in order for an ambuſcado, and to fight with them as they ſhould paſſe through difficult places. And hauing thus diſpoſed of their people, the Caualarie of <hi>Caſſombech</hi> preſented themſelues with a greedie deſire to pill and burne ſome neighbour places: and being now arriued at the paſſage, where they were expected, it was ſuddenly charged on all ſides, and they all fighting a certaine time, not knowing who ſhould haue the beſt, in the end the Turkes finding themſelues in the middeſt of the other ſouldiours (who vntill then kept themſelues cloſe) began to retire themſelues, and to leaue the victory to thoſe of Deua, who omitted not to purſue them euen within ſight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of Lippa, and ſlew of them 300. and tooke many priſoners. Our people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incouraged at this good fortune, and not ſatisfying themſelues with that which they ſo happely achieued, paſſed further with incurtions into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies countrie, ſacking ſome villages, &amp; pilling all which came to their hands,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21983:136"/>
performing ſuch warlike exploits, that beſides the conqueſt of the priſoners, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and bootie which was not ſmall, they put all that quarter in ſuch a dread, that the Turkes a long time after durſt not come to doe iniurie to the Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians: for that they ſtill diſtruſted themſelues of ſome intended ſtratagems. By this defeate (which was all the good that happened this yeere 1552.) the arrogancie and raſhnes of the enemy was bridled: but not that of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> ſouldiours, which daily increaſed, hauing no reſpect neither to Generall, Colonels, Captaines, nor any diuine or humane thing, minding by their diſloyaltie to make themſelues maſters of their phantaſies, and to goe euery where, without expecting the appointment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of his Maieſtie, or the leaue of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> as more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> amply we ſhall treate of in the ſucceſſes which happened in the yeere 1553.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Caſtalde</hi> being aduertiſed of all theſe deuiſes, that he might the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie them, and not ſuffer them to take further footing, appointed that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> principall Lords of the kingdome, ſhould vpon the 15. of March next, bee at the Diet of Coloſuar, to acquaint them with that which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them. Before the meeting of this Diet, <hi>Andrew Battor</hi> (who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine was confirmed in the eſtate of Vayuod, and withall was made Counte of Zalmar and Zalboc) hauing aſſembled a good troupe of men among the neighbour townes and Caſtles, and hauing vnderſtood that certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Turkiſh Caualarie made ſome incurtions, pilling and burning all the villages, and minding to expulſe them, hee cauſed his people to goe into the field, and to march towards the enemie. But in the end com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to handie ſtrokes, not farre from Agria, he was ſo hotly charged, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſome of his people quitted the place, and others remained there either ſlaine or taken priſoners: and amongſt others, ſome of his houſehold ſeruants and familiar fauourits were taken; to redeeme whom, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was forced to giue to the Baſha of Buda a Chiauſs, &amp; a Mahometaine Prieſt, who were taken at the death of Frier <hi>George,</hi> and detained priſoners in the Caſtle of Wiuar, and to exchange them (by <hi>Ferdinands</hi> commaund) with the ſaid fauourits, who by this meanes recouered their libertie.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of this diſorder, the Vayuod intreated <hi>Ferdinand</hi> that he would giue him the meanes and inable him to entertaine 1000. light horſe, of the number of thoſe which he payed in Tranſiluania: which was wholly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to him, and beſides 1000. foote, that ſo he might be the better able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Turkes forces in thoſe quarters. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> alſo gaue him charge to conclude an end of a diſcord among the people called Cumans, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been vnder the iuriſdiction of Zaluoch, would not (ſeeing that this

            <p>Now whileſt that the Turke was greatly buſied by the Sophy, and that he conuerted his forces for the defence of Amaſia, into which the Perſians were entered, they began againe (by the meanes and interpoſing of <hi>Haly</hi>

For they had aduertiſement how <hi>Caſſombech</hi> (at the inſtance of the Queene) had aſſembled about him many Sangiacchs, and that with the troupes which daily came to him, hee meant to march directly to Deua, to reuenge himſelfe of the loſſes which he had receiued of our people, and withall to make himſelfe maſter of that place, to the end that ſo he might not haue any impeachment that might croſſe his proceedings. Hereupon <hi>Caſtalde</hi> cauſed the Diet to be ſolicited, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perſwade all thoſe that ſhould be preſent thereat, to giue order that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould take armes, and ayde this towne and others, and ſpecially to march to the frontiers which diuide Polonia from Tranſiluania, where it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> was ſaid, that there were 12000. Pollacques well armed, whoſe enterpriſe was knowne to be no other, but onely that they were there for the ayde of Queene <hi>Izabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The appointed day then for the Diet being come, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was preſent at <note place="margin">A Diet at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſuar.</note> Coloſuar, where he found al thoſe who were called thither, except the Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uode, who in reſpect of his ſicknes was excuſed, and there (by the expreſſe commaund of <hi>Ferdinand)</hi> hee demaunded of the Tranſiluanians ayde of men, to ſuppreſſe all theſe tumults, which couertly were diſperſed in euery place, and to defend Deua and other places: he alſo demaunded money and victuals, to make at the leaſt a reaſonable armie, and ſuch, that with his people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which then he had, he might bee able in many places to reſiſt his enemies.

            <p>Vpon which demaunds, he was thus anſwered: that becauſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was by a long warre ſorely afflicted and diſtreſſed, and euery man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extreame miſerie, they could not ſuccour him with money, nor victuals, becauſe that in the laſt winter they were all ſpent and conſumed by the ſouldiours: and as for the ayde of men, they would aſſiſt him therewith as farre as they could; notwithſtanding it being neceſſarie that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſhould ſend ſome other ſuccours from Germanie or Hungarie to reſiſt the Turke: for that this Prouince was not of it ſelfe ſufficient to withſtand ſo great an aſſault, which on euery ſide would be giuen, and ſpecially towards Lippa, Braſſouia, and Hungarie, where in euery place it was very requiſit to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21983:138"/>
haue a great armie, infinit heapes of money, and great ſtore of victuals to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them: which by no meanes could not be found in this countrie, by reaſon of the extreame pouertie thereof, and ſpecially of labourers, which in regard of the continuall warres were either dead or fled. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which they were able to do, he well knew that all was in his power to commaund; they beſides not iudging it vnfit to giue ſome repoſe to this diſcontented people, to imbrace truce with the Turkes, whereto they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offered themſelues, and they promiſed on their parts to chuſe Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to treate thereof with the Grand Seigniour, by the meanes of the Vayuode of Tranſalpinia, who for the ſame effect had many times offered himſelfe to them. And as for the fortifications of thoſe places alreadie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they would ſpeake thereof to the Burgomaſters of thoſe townes, that they would do ſo much, that they ſhould ſend ſo many Pioners as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the finiſhing of them.</p>
            <p>With this reſolution this Diet ended, when the Spaniards for two payes which they ſhould haue receiued, were more moued and mutinous then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards mutinie.</note> and that in ſo ſtrange a manner as the like was neuer heard of. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the payment, and not minding to ſtay that they might bee ſatisfied in that kingdome for all that which was due to them, they tooke by force the Enſignes from thoſe who bore them, and with them took their way towards Vienna, paſſing through Hungarie, where they performed infinit euils, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the greateſt riot in the world. And although that <hi>Castalde</hi> (that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> might haue brought this warre to an end) was daily vpon his departure out of Tranſiluania, yet he neuer could, neither by entreaties, nor by offers, or perſwſions ſo farre preuaile with them, as that they would attend him but twentie daies, to the end that he might not leaue the kingdome vnprouided, and that for the time to come he might giue order to thoſe places which had neede of garriſons, and generally to doe before his departure, all whatſoeuer appertained to the preſeruation of that countrie.</p>
            <p>But without reſpect to their Generall they diſlodged, and paſſed by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſuar, threatning to ſacke this towne, who were greatly afeard thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was within it. And being arriued at the riuer of Marque, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was exceedingly offended thereat, and meant to ſend the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>Sforce Palauicin</hi> (who was alreadie redeemed from the Turkes for 15000.

            <p>A little before that <hi>Aldene</hi> was conducted to Vienna, and was impriſoned <note place="margin">Aldene brought to Vienna.</note> in a tower, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> minding that his condemnation ſhould not be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vntill <hi>Caſtaldes</hi> comming, to whom he had giuen licenſe to depart out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this Prouince, and to come from thence to Vienna, or to Sopronio.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21983:139"/>
what was paſſed, to their great content. And becauſe vertue and glorie haue alwaies enuie attending on them, ſome perſons bruited amongſt the greateſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Court, that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> had heaped together a great quantitie of <note place="margin">Caſtalde wrongfully accuſed.</note> gold and ſiluer, and that he was not a little inriched by Frier <hi>Georges</hi> treaſure, and by the preſents which the Tranſiluanians had beſtowed on him, and that he had ſent great ſtore thereof from him. This bruite did greatly grieue him, for that it was come to <hi>Ferdinands</hi> eares; and yet further for this, that ſome ſaid that he had detained and kept backe penſions and wages which his Maieſtie had granted to certaine that were his truſtie ſeruants, and who had faithfully ſerued him during this warre. Vpon this bad and falſe ſuggeſtion, there was added many other vile and infamous things.

Florins of gold of yeerely reuenew to him and his heires, with certaine conditions to call them backe vpon ſome reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſummes.</p>
            <p>Preſently after the departure of <hi>Caſtalde</hi> out of Tranſiluania, they had newes, that one <hi>Clement Athanaſe</hi> had (with a good troupe of men aſſotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him) by night taken the Caſtle of Tocchay (which by the ſituation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>

This man had great meanes, and vnder his colour many great matters were practiſed, which gaue ſufficient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> occaſion to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to thinke deeply thereof, who was ſufficiently infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med how all the Realme inclined to the Queenes part. The Saxons to haue ſome ſhadow to remoue their houſehold, cauſed to bee demaunded of his Maieſtie the Caſtle of Aluins, which, they ſaid, did (according to their priuiledges) belong to them, and they requeſted that it might be confirmed to them by him. That he might not diſcontent them in this their demaund, but rather to hold them aſſured to him in ſome ſound fidelitie, and that hee might not giue them occaſion to mutinie, he yeelded to their demaund; and preſently they of Iula, Agria, and other places were commaunded, that they ſhould be vigilant and carefull, and not ſleepie or ſlothfull, for feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly ſurpriſed by the Queenes partie, who ceaſed not to performe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> her vttermoſt endeuour, that euery one ſhould take armes againſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Gouernours, and Lieutenants of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe proceedings, it was ordained that the proceſſe of <hi>Aldene</hi>

if the accuſations were found true. This reuiuing being at a certaine day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the firſt ſentence, was by this ſecond confirmed, and by conſequence <hi>Aldene</hi> condemned to haue his head cut off. The preſcribed day being come to end his life, he was in the ſight of all Vienna led chained betweene two Friers (who did comfort him) to the place of iuſtice, hauing the executioner by, and was there vpon a ſcaffold to be beheaded. <hi>Mary</hi> Queene of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, and daughter of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. becauſe he was a Spaniard and ſubiect to her father, preuailed ſo much with the King her husband, that he requeſted pardon of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for him, with this condition neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that he ſhould alwaies remaine priſoner.

            <p>Now whileſt <hi>Caſtalde</hi> recreated himſelfe with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in hunting, ſometimes purſuing the Harts along Danubius, (which to ſaue themſelues from the dogges, tooke ſoyle therein) letters came to him from the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> by which he commaunded him, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tranſiluanian warres were ended, he ſhould preſently depart from Vienna, and iourney into Flanders (where he was greatly troubled by the people of King <hi>Henry</hi> of France) that ſo he might vſe him in this warre. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Emperour alſo writ to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> how he had taken Hedin from the French <note place="margin">Hedin taken by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Charles from the French.</note> King, which is a place ſituate vpon the confines of Artois in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, againſt which he had brought a puiſſant armie, and had enuironed it with his Campe, and battered it on all ſides, and that in the end he had taken it, notwithſtanding the marueilous defence of the aſſieged, making a great myne, wherein was buried <hi>Horatius Farneſe</hi> Duke of Caſtres, and that he had cauſed it to bee ruinated and defaced, euen to the foundations, there being priſoners with him the Duke of Bouillon Marſhall of France Lieutenant in the ſame for the King, the Lord of Riou Gouernour, the Counte of Villars, the Lord of Prye, the Baron of Culan, and many others; there being beſides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſlaine, the Lord of Magny, the Vicount of Martigues, the Lord of Monin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uille, the Lord of Cizieux, the Lord of Dampierre, the Seneſhal of Caſtres, and many others. For this newes, and the taking of Terouanne, which a little before was beſieged, were great fires of ſolemnitie made at Vienna, and many ſuch-like exhilerations: at the end whereof, <hi>Caſtalde</hi> (to obey the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) tooke leaue of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and after being greatly honoured by <note place="margin">Caſtalde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Emperour in Flanders.</note> him with many priuiledges, and inriched with many gifts, for the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which he had ſhewen in Tranſiluania againſt the Turkes, he trauailed towards Germanie, at the time that the warre of Sienna began to ceaſe, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> meanes of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3.</p>
            <p>In the Eaſterne parts <hi>Solyman</hi> was no leſſe inflamed to the warre, then was <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. againſt France.

This infant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departed from Conſtantinople, and arriued in this Prouince, the Grand Seigniour began to be enamoured of another of his Slaues, named <hi>Roſſa,</hi> ſo <note place="margin">Roſſa beloued of Solyman.</note> hotly, that with the daily conuerſation he had with her, he ſaw by her foure children, the one named <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had the Prouince of Carmania; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> other <hi>Baiazet,</hi> to whom was giuen Mechoreſia; the third <hi>Selim,</hi> who after the <note place="margin">Mahomet, Baiazet, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim, Zeangir, children of Solyman by Roſſa.</note> death of <hi>Mahomet</hi> had Carmania; and the fourth <hi>Zeangir,</hi> otherwiſe called crookbacke, by reaſon of two knobs he had vpon his ſhoulders and breaſt, and he was of an excellent ſpirit. He had alſo a daughter named <hi>Chameria,</hi> who was giuen in mariage to <hi>Roſtan</hi> Baſha, who after the death of <hi>Abraham</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chameria daughter of Solyman ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Roſtan Baſha.</note> Baſha was principall Viſir. This man made himſelfe very odious to all the world in this office, becauſe had cut off the pay of the Ianiſaries, the wages of the officers of the Grand Seigniours houſe, the charges of armies, and the eſtate of Sangiachs; all theſe charges being very burdenſome and exceſſiue. But in ſtead thereof he was very well liked of <hi>Solyman,</hi> and much in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for vſing ſuch frugalitie, and not in the fauour of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> of whom he did greatly diſtruſt himſelfe for the traine which he had, and for the loue which the ſouldiours bore him. This diſtruſt and feare were the cauſe that he enterpriſed a conſpiracie with <hi>Roſſa</hi> his mother in law againſt the life of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> by the deceit and treacherie which wee ſhall now ſpeake of. This <hi>Roſſa</hi> ſeeing how dearely ſhe was beloued of the great Turke, to aduance her children by a policie, and vnder a fained colour and zeale of religion, ſent to <hi>Muplety</hi> (properly called by the Turkes <hi>Muphty,</hi> who among the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes <note place="margin">Muplety an arch Presbiter of the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanes.</note> is, as the Pope is among the Chriſtians) to ſignifie to him, how ſhe had a marueilous deſire to cauſe a Temple to bee built, and an Hoſpitall alſo for the poore pilgrimes, to the honour of God and of their Prophet: but by no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> meanes ſhe would vndertake this worke, vnleſſe that firſt ſhe were aſſured <note place="margin">Gods reward for charitable workes done by Slaues, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to their maſters.</note> from him, that ſuch workes ſhould bee beneficiall for her ſoules health and agreeable to God. <hi>Muplety</hi> anſwered her, that this enterpriſe would bee well pleaſing to God, but not for her ſaluation, for that ſhe was a Slaue of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21983:140"/>
Grand Seighiour, who was maſter and Lord of all that ſhe had, and in regard of which his power, all whatſoeuer ſhe ſhould do in this, ſhuld ſucceed to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> good of him, and not of her. Vpon this anſwer ſhe ſeemed very penſiue, and to carrie in her heart extreame griefe, inſomuch, that (ſhe manifeſting in her minde to bee greatly afflicted) the Turke had notice thereof, who moued with the loue he bore her, and with the diſpleaſure of her griefe, ſent her word that ſhe ſhould be of good cheere, aſſuring her that within ſhortime he would giue her occaſion to comfort her ſelfe: whereupon cauſing a letter to bee written for her libertie, he ſent it to her. This ſubtile and craftie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Roſſa made free.</note> receiuing this gift, well knowing to take fit time and occaſion, gaue him many kinde thanks, and preſently employed workmen about her buildings, abſtaining her ſelfe from carnall copulation with him. While ſhe thus ſpent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the time, the Grand Seigniour had a great deſire to lie with her, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the night following ſhe ſhould prepare her ſelfe to lie with him. Whereupon ſhe cauſed word to be ſent to him, that though he were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord of her life, of her goods, and of her bodie, he ſhould yet looke well to this (ſeeing he had made her free) that he did not contradict the law, nor <note place="margin">To vſe a free woman is ſin.</note> commit a ſinne; it not being lawfull for him to vſe a free woman, as more at large he might know of <hi>Muplety.</hi> This anſwer was greatly offenſiue to the Grand Seigniour. For louing her extreamely, the more ſtrict the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, the more his deſire increaſed to be with her, and gnawing his heart with a thouſand imaginations, ſent to ſeeke <hi>Muplety,</hi> of whom he demanded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whither he might carnally vſe a Slaue that was made free. The other made anſwer, that he might not, except he would take her for his ſpouſe: for that doing otherwiſe he ſhould commit a great ſinne, by reaſon of the law, which willed it ſhould bee ſo. This difficultie yet further increaſed a deſire in the Turke to enioy his <hi>Roſſa.</hi> And by that meanes, not being able any long to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the paſſion which tormented him, he determined to ſatisfie, not his reaſon, but his appetites, and reſolued to take her for his ſpouſe, as publikely <note place="margin">Roſſa made the ſpouſe of Solyman.</note> he did, giuing her by the contract of mariage 5000. Duckets of yeerely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new for her dowrie, to the great maruaile of all, who knew that to be againſt the cuſtome of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> who becauſe they would neuer haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <note place="margin">The Turkiſh Emperours neuer marrie.</note> in the Empire, doe neuer marrie, but in place of a ſpouſe, they vſe women Slaues who are very fayre, which from all parts of the world were brought to them, and they are ſhut vp within the Seraile (according to the cuſtome of the Turkiſh Lords) where they were bountifully vſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in diuers vertuous things: and by theſe the Grand Seigniours haue their children, and thoſe by whom they once haue had children, are more honoured and better ſerued then the other, and afterwards are married to Grand Seigniours of their owne ſect and religion, as are the Baſhaes, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giachs, Belerbeys, and ſuch like. Now this <hi>Roſſa</hi> from a Slaue (by the fauour of heauen and the benefit of Fortune) being become the wife of ſo great a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> King, ſhe determined of no other thing, then to inuent the meanes that one of her ſonnes, after the death of <hi>Solyman,</hi> ſhould remaine inheritour and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The greatnes and valour of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was much oppoſit to her deſeignes,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21983:141"/>
and to abate this inconuenience, ſhe thought that it was needfull to aſſiſt her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſelfe by the helpe of <hi>Roſtan</hi> Baſha her ſonne in law, as of one that would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Roſſa practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the death of Muſtapha.</note> deſire that his brother in law might be Lord, then <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who bore him an euill grudge, for that he had cut off the reuenew which he was wont to haue out of his Prouince: by reaſon whereof he could not but doubt, that when the Turke dyed, and this man ſucceeding in his place, he would not onely depriue him from the dignitie of a Viſir, but alſo of his goods and life.</p>
            <p>Hauing then drawne him to her deuotion, and being accorded together, ſhe effected ſo much with the Grand Seigniour, that her ſonne in law had <note place="margin">Roſtan Baſha conſpireth with Roſſa, the death of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha.</note> the managing of all the affayres and expeditions of that Prouince where <hi>Muſtapha</hi> commanded, impreſſing afterward in the minde of <hi>Solyman,</hi> with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> a fit and ſubtell inuention, a great diſtruſt to loſe both his ſtate and life, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by reaſon of <hi>Muſtaphaes</hi> greatnes, &amp; the good wil which euery one did beare him. For confirmation of which, <hi>Roſtan</hi> commaunded all thoſe who were choſen to goe into the Prouinces, and ſpecially thoſe who went into Ionia, a neighbour Prouince to Amaſia, that for the contentment of the Grand Seigniour, they ſhould write and make knowne particularly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and his honours, to the end that he might take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein, and that they ſhould highly commend him in certifying all the good they could of him. Which they did (not knowing the deceit) very willingly and often alſo: ſo that by their letters they cleerely diſcerned the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> deſire which the ſouldiours had, that one day he might for his liberalitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Emperour. <hi>Roſtan</hi> after he had receiued ſuch letters, gaue them to <hi>Roſſa,</hi> to the end, that according to the oportunitie and occaſion of the time, ſhe might ſhew them to the Turke. She in ſhewing them theſe letters (as a ſubtell and malicious woman) made great ſhew to be exceedingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at the generoſitie and valiantnes of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and to be very reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of his life and health: and then on the other ſide, as being carefull of the preſeruation and puiſſance of her Lord and ſpouſe, by wilie and ſubtell meanes ſhe propounded to him the example of <hi>Selim,</hi> who by the like craft and induſtrie, depriued his father both of his Empire and life, deſiring him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to finde the meanes to diſcouer the deſeignes of <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> But for this time her deuices tooke no great effect in <hi>Solyman,</hi> and ſhe ſeeing that they came to nothing, thought to make him away by poyſon, and ſending him in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name certaine preſents, gaue charge to ſome to carrie them to him. But for that the houre of his death was not yet come, he would at no hand taſte thereof, vntill the bringer had firſt made an aſſay, who preſently fell downe ſtone dead: for which cauſe he made them to bee caſt away, and ſo eſcaped the death. This treacherie falling out contrarie to the deſire of <hi>Roſſa,</hi> yet for all that ſhe loſt no courage, but inuented another, deſiring her Lord that he would doe her this fauour, that ſometimes one, and ſometimes another of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> his children might come to the Court to ſee him, and after that returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into their gouernment, thereby the rather to continue a reciprocall amitie betweene him and his children. This deuice tended to this end, that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> comming thither, ſhould with better commoditie bee diſpatched
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:21983:141"/>
by ſome maner of meanes whatſoeuer, and not comming thither he ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be ſent for. For the eldeſt ſonnes of the Turkiſh Emperours are not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">The eldeſt ſonnes of the Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine not at the Court.</note> to depart out of their Prouinces to come to Conſtantinople, except they bee ſent for to bee made Emperours with a ſtrong and puiſſant armie: which they are not wont to doe, ſo long as the father liueth. Neuertheleſſe ſhe obtained that two of his children ſhould come thither: and thus alwaies was one or two with <hi>Solyman,</hi> either in the towne, or in the armie, or in ſome other place where hee was. <hi>Zeangir</hi> the crookbacke, was oftner there then any of them, for that he was pleaſant and merrie, and one that could fit all humours well, whereat the Grand Seigniour tooke great pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Now certaine yeeres after, Fortune (enuious of <hi>Muſtaphaes</hi> magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and fauouring the wickednes of this woman) cauſed a letter to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> brought from the Baſha the gouernour of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and of Amaſia; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſonnes.</note> the cuſtome, that when a ſonne of the Grand Seigniour goeth into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gouernment, to giue him a Baſha to inſtruct him in Militarie diſcipline, and a Doctor to teach him the liberall Arts, and other good erudiments. It was imported by this letter, that a mariage ſhould bee treated of betweene the ſaid <hi>Muſtapha</hi> and the daughter of the King of Perſia, whereof this Baſha did diligently aduertiſe the Court and the Grand Seigniour, to the end that not any thing ſhould be imputed to him, as if he had participated in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayre. This letter being come into the hands of <hi>Roſtan,</hi> eſteeming that this was a ſubiect very fit for him to ouerthrow <hi>Muſtapha</hi> withall, acquainted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <hi>Roſſa</hi> with all the matter, with whom he hauing conferred of that which they ſhould doe, they went both together to the Turke, ſhewing him the ambition of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and that he had a purpoſe to inueſt himſelfe in the Empire, and by the affinitie contained in this letter, to ioyne the Perſian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with his, that ſo he might the better expulſe him from Conſtantinople, adding at the end the little faith which was to be hoped of the Ianiſaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were corrupted by his great bountie. Theſe ſo euident reaſons were with words full of ſuch great efficacie pronounced by them, that they ſo moued <hi>Solyman,</hi> that to aſſure his kingdome and life, he determined to put his ſonne to death, and according to this reſolution he cauſed <hi>Roſtan</hi> Baſha <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to march before with a great armie towards Syria, with commaund and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge (vnder the colour to driue away the Perſians) to ſeaze vpon the perſon of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> by ſome ſubtell dexteritie, and to conduct him to him. <hi>Roſtan</hi> being come to the enterance of this Prouince, and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnderſtood of his comming, preſently marched towards him with 7000. of the valianteſt ſouldiours that he had. <hi>Roſtan</hi> ſeeing that then his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe could take no good iſſue, bruiting it abroad that he found all things in good tranquilitie, returned without any further expecting the comming of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> or without ſeeing the duſt of his ſouldiours, and returned from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thence to Conſtantinople with more then ordinarie ſpeede: where being arriued, he recited to the Grand Seigniour all that which was happened to him, and giuing colour to that which hee had alreadie practiſed with <hi>Roſſa,</hi> he cauſed him to redouble his feare, telling him, that hauing found the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie which he led with him into Syria moſt readie and willing, and at the

deuotion of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and they deſired no other thing, but only that he were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> abſolute Lord; he by this occaſion meant not to truſt them to giue him any battaile, nor hazard any thing, by reaſon of the incredible good will which all the Ianiſaries bore him, but that he thought it more expedient to returne from thence, and ſubmit all vnder the aduice and iudgement of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, as he did. Theſe ſpeeches ingendered in <hi>Solymans</hi> heart a moſt great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and were the cauſe to bring to end that treaſon thus wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this innocent yong man.</p>
            <p>This then being the yeere 1553. he commaunded that all the ſouldiours <note place="margin">Anno 1553.</note> ſhould aſſemble, and that <hi>Achmeth</hi> Baſha of Buda, with all the prouiſion of Hungarie, ſhould march towards Amaſia, to bring to end the Perſian warre, it being expreſſely euery where bruited abroad, that the Perſians were afreſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> entered into Syria, with many great troupes, <hi>Solyman</hi> ſet himſelfe onward on his iourney with all his armie: and being there arriued, he preſently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed letters to be writ to <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> that he ſhould come to him at Aleppo; and endeuouring to conceale the hate, which through others malignitie he bore to his ſonne, yet could he not ſo well diſſemble it, but that <hi>Achmeth</hi> Baſha, as of better iudgement then the other Baſhaes were, did perceiue it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing great diſpleaſure that the father ſhould be thus incenſed againſt his ſonne, becauſe he was too generous, ſecretly aduertiſed <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> that he ſhould looke well to himſelfe and his life, and not be too ſecure. This did greatly aſtoniſh the poore yong man, and the rather, conſidering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of his father with ſo puiſſant an armie into that countrie, without any reaſonable occaſion, the Perſians being then with them quiet and in peace; and he entering into great ſuſpition, was many daies greatly tormented: in the end, although he was extreamely troubled in his minde and bodie, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe vpon his innocencie, that he had neuer offended his father neither by deede, word, or thought, he was reſolued (although he knew his death very certaine) with all obedience to performe the commaund of his father, iudging his death would be more glorious and honourable, dying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, <note place="margin">The diuine reſolution of Muſtapha.</note> then ending his life in rebellion, and contrarie to him. And hauing thus determined with himſelfe, his Doctor being by him, after many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thoughts, he demaunded of him, which were beſt for a man to chuſe, either the Empire of the whole world, or a happie life. This Doctor anſwered him, that he who with an vpright eye could contemplate the Empire of the world, ſhould finde that it would bring with it no conſtant fidelitie, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaine ſhewes, and that hee ſhould continually liue therein with infinit trauaile and diſtruſt, and be conſtrained to commit diuers inſolencies, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deſtruction of townes and cities, and ruines of many miſerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for which miſchiefes a man ſhould loſe a happie life. But in chuſing a bleſſed life, a man ſhould auoide all theſe diſaſters, and to thoſe (who haue this grace to know humane frailtie, and the breuity of our life, in renouncing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the vanities of this world) God had prepared in heauen (as for his well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued) a ſweete and delectable place, full of all immortall ioy, where they ſhould remaine perpetually with the bleſſed.</p>
            <p>This anſwer greatly contented this yong man, and within a while after, in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21983:142"/>
great diligence he arriued where his father was, who was incamped three daies iourney from Aleppo, in a large field. By this ſo ſudden arriuall of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Solyman</hi> was the more perplexed, and had a greater diſtruſt, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would haue come ſo ſoone. <hi>Roſtan</hi> vpon this occaſion failed not againe, and commaunded by ſignes the principals of the armie, and the Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries to goe before <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and to doe him honour. Theſe men being (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">The Ianiſaries obeying the ſignes of then Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> to their cuſtome) well diſciplined, and obeying their Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, (by whoſe ſignes onely they are conducted and gouerned) went in troupes (thinking to doe that which would bee agreeable to the Turke) to ſalute <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and to doe him reuerence, and to performe this, all the Campe remoued. <hi>Roſtan</hi> ſeeming to bee greatly aſtoniſhed at this, went to <hi>Solyman,</hi> to aduertiſe him how all the Ianiſaries, and principals of his armie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> without his leaue, were gone to ſee <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and to receiue him, with great acclamations and exceſſiue ioyes, and that there reſted to him nothing elſe, but to be Lord; deſiring he would haue care of himſelfe. <hi>Solyman</hi> changing his colour, and becomming all pale, went out of his Pauilion, and apartly ſaw that to be true, which <hi>Roſtan</hi> had told him. Many ſay that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> three daies before his death, had in his ſleepe this viſion a little before the riſing of the Sunne: He thought that a Prophet, apparelled with habits ſhining as the <note place="margin">The viſion of Muſtapha prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his death.</note> Sunne beames, tooke him by the hand, and conducted him into a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightfull place, where was a rich and ſumptuous Palace, with a moſt faire garden, and that then that Prophet ſaid to him, that there they did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> remaine and perpetually inioy theſe delights, who were oppoſit to vices, had auoyded iniuſtice, and vertuouſly diſpoſed of all their actions: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turning him to another ſide, he thought that he ſhewed him two very great riuers, whoſe waters were of the colour of iron and pitch, and it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they boyled, within which there were an infinit companie of men which deſcended to the deepe, and after riſing againe, cried pardon, and that then he further ſaid to him, that there were thoſe puniſhed, who whileſt they were liuing, had alwaies vſed iniuſtice and fauoured the wicked, and that he ſhould know that thoſe which he had ſeene there, were Princes, Kings, and great Emperours. And this being ſaid, the viſion vaniſhed away. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that the Turkes are the moſt ſuperſtitious men in the world, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Muſulmans (who neuer drinke wine, and giue more credit to dreames, then other men doe) had interpreted by this viſion, that ſome great danger ſhould happen to <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> and he hauing imparted it to his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he ſaid to him, after that he well conſidered of the matter, that he greatly diſtruſted of his life, and that therefore he required him to looke well to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This yong man neuertheleſſe aſſured, made him anſwer: <q>Wherefore ſhould I ſuffer my ſelfe to be vanquiſhed by a vaine feare, and by the illuſion of a dreame, and not to goe to ſee my father, he hauing cauſed me to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto him with ſo great mildnes, and hauing had (as it is fitting, and as my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dutie requireth it) alwaies his Maieſtie in great reuerence, and neuer hauing turned my face, but to the part where his inclined, and neuer hauing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in any thing, nor aſpired to his Empire, but only when it ſhall pleaſe God to take him to himſelfe, and that the armie ſhall eſteeme me worthie
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21983:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereof, and capable to enioy his greatnes with my brothers in perpetuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> peace and euerlaſting concord, contenting my ſelfe, that though by this voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age I ſhould die, to end rather my daies by innocencie and martyrdome, then liuing many yeeres in the Empire, to remaine diſobedient to the will of my father; becauſe if I goe not to him, I ſhall by the enuious perſons of his Court bee condemned as a rebell, and by my enemies infinitly noted and marked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With this deliberation he arriued neere the Pauilions and Tents of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with his traine, and cauſed his people to ſtay there; and clothing himſelf in a new white habit, in token of true fidelitie, and hauing put into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome certaine letters and writings, and laying apart all manner of weapons from about him, that ſo he might take away all occaſion to vſe them againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> his father, he proceeded to goe and kiſſe his fathers hands; and entering into the firſt hall, he was very gratiouſly receiued by the Eunuches, &amp; not ſeeing therein but a place only dreſſed and prepared, he began to be pale and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and being a while in ſuſpence, demaunded where the Grand Seigniour was, and it was anſwered him, that he ſhould preſently ſee him.

And minding to flye thence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hee was as well by theſe Muets, as by the Eunuches, ſtaied without the Pauilion, and brought in againe, where the Muets put a cord of a Turkiſh bow about his necke to ſtrangle him: but he being very ſtout and ſtrong, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelfe as well as he could, in throwing ſometime one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time another behinde him, pitifully intreating them that they would ſuffer him to ſpeake but two words to his Lord and father. Whileſt that the one ſort endeuoured to take his life from him, and he on the other ſide aſſaied to defend himſelfe, the moſt cruel and abominable father (who was on the one ſide of the Pauilion, very attentiue to ſee the end of ſo horrible and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane a tragedie) putting forth his head, ſpake with choler to theſe executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
               <q>Haue you not yet taken away the life from this Traytor, who for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">The cruell words of a Tyrant.</note> yeeres together hath not ſuffered me to ſleepe in quiet?

            </p>
            <p>This cruell act being thus committed, the Turke cauſed preſently to bee taken the Baſha of Amaſia, and a Venetian, of the houſe of <hi>Michely,</hi> who was taken a child in the iourney of Preueſa, and who then with great credit bore the Colonels Enſigne, and preſently cauſed their heads to be publikely cut off, calling afterward to him <hi>Zeangir</hi> the crookbacke (who yet knew nothing

But in ſtead of thanking thoſe which brought him this meſſage, he ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them theſe words.</p>
            <p>O curſed treacherous dogge, not a father, but a moſt cruell Tyger, enioy thou rather the Treaſures, Moueables, Pauilions, and the Prouince of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha,</hi> ſeeing this is fallen into thy inraged heart to put to death ſo vertuous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a ſonne, and of ſo great hope, and ſuch a one as there was neuer his like, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet ſhall be in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> houſe, I pray God that I poore crookbacke liue not, that thou maiſt doe the like to me. Whereupon drawing a little poynard which he had by his ſide, he thruſt it into his owne breaſt, &amp; ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he died. The King vnderſtanding of this vnexpected newes, fell into extreame ſadnes. And this was the trueth of the crookbacks deed, although the world might not be filled with ſo vile an act, and for the reuerence of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> houſe, the Turkes ſay that he thus ſuddenly died of a Squinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Grand Seigniour hauing afterward commaunded that the Pauilions and moueables of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſhould bee carried with his, while they whom he had commaunded to doe it went about to execute it, many were moued and oppoſed themſelues againſt it, thinking that they meant to ſacke them, <note place="margin">A great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult in Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans armie.</note> theſe valiant ſouldiours not yet knowing what was happened to their Lord; and ſeeing a great number of men to come towards them, fearing ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den inſolencie, put themſelues in armes, repulſing thoſe backe who were the formoſt, not without great ſlaughter. Thoſe of the Kings Campe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the rumour which hourely increaſed, running to ſuccour their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and the other part doing alſo the like, both Camps reenforcing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, with a terrible bruite they put themſelues in armes, and gaue a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> aſſault, where remained ſlaine vpon the place more then 2000. men: and this skirmiſh had not thus ended, if <hi>Achmeth</hi> Baſha (a graue man, and of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, for his renowned vertue generally knowne, and greatly eſteemed among the ſouldiours) had not cauſed the Ianiſaries to retire; and if turning himſelfe towards the ſouldiours of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> he had not vſed to them ſuch like gentle ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What (my brethren and children) will you be of ſo bad a diſpoſition, and ſo bold to reſiſt the commaund of the Grand Seigniour, whoſe pleaſure is, that his ſonnes treaſure ſhould be taken out of his Pauilions, and carried to his? I cannot beleeue that you who ſo long haue knowne your ſelues to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the moſt valiant and good Muſulmans (as truly you are) would now ſhew your ſelues ſo inſolent and perfidious to our common Lord, hauing ſo long a time with ſuch fidelitie warred amongſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> armies, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtained or defiled of any infamie for his preſeruation, as by your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſpeeches of this couragious Baſha had ſuch force ouer them, that they were appeaſed, and as very obedient, they ſuffered to bee carried to the Turkes Tent all whatſoeuer was in <hi>Muſtaphaes.</hi> But his death being within a little while after knowne amongſt the Ianiſaries, and bruited through the Campe, the occaſion thereof, and the diſtruſt of him, and becauſe it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon him, they all tooke armes againe, and making a great tumult, mingled with infinit teares and weepings, they approached very nigh to the Grand Seigniours Pauilion. This ſecond commotion put him into ſuch a maze, that loſing his ſenſes, he would gladly haue fled: but being ſtayed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> his people, not without great daunger to bee maſſacred in this furie, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (conſtrained by neceſſitie) to doe that, which in an aſſured place hee would not haue done, and ſtanding at the entrance of his Pauilion, although he was greatly pale, yet he boldly ſpake to them. <q>Tell me (quoth he) what tumults are theſe here? What commotion is this? What inſolencies do you thus inconſideratiuely offer to me? Doe you not peraduenture know me? Am I not your Lord, and he that ought to rule and gouerne you?</q> Certaine of them anſwered him, that they well knew him to be ſuch a Lord, who had a long time been choſen by them, whom they had reuerenced, and whoſe Empire they had by their vertue ſo greatly inlarged; to this end notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that he ſhould rule ouer them with iuſtice, and not without occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo inconſideratiuely and cruelly ſhed the blood of the good, and cauſe the innocent to bee ſlaine, and that theſe armes were iuſtly by them taken, ſharply to reuenge the death of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and to purge themſelues from that treaſon which was imputed vpon them; and that they would neuer lay them downe, vntill the accuſers ſhould bee brought to iudgement, and he conuicted them to be culpable; and that then with all humilitie (if it ſo fell out) they promiſed (as worthie of ſeuere chaſtiſement) to ſubmit their liues to the moſt cruell and ſhamefulleſt death that could bee found, and that for a finall reſolution they meant that that ſhould bee auerred in the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> field.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpeaking ſo ſtoutly, by reaſon of the griefe which they felt, left not for all that to bathe their cheekes with bitter teares, and their friendly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionated mournings conſtrained the Grand Seigniour (who for the feare <note place="margin">Solyman in danger of his perſon.</note> which he had receiued, and for the horrour of the deede, was almoſt beſides himſelfe) to promiſe them with ſweet and inticing ſpeeches, that he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſatisfie whatſoeuer they would demaund, and by that meanes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great part of this tumult: neuertheleſſe, all the armie with weapons in their hands omitted not to keepe carefull watch, for feare he ſhould ſteale out of the Campe, and that they ſhould bee deceiued of his promiſe which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he had made them of a deſired iudgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſtan</hi> (after he had by the commaund of the great Turk committed the ſeale into the hands of <hi>Achmeth,</hi> and that himſelfe was depriued of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ſtate of Viſir) wholly poſſeſſed with feare for theſe tumults, fled to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:21983:144"/>
the Pauilion of <hi>Achmeth,</hi> deſiring him as his inward friend, and with great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> inſtance, that it would pleaſe him to aduiſe him what he thought fitting to doe in ſo ſudden a daunger. <hi>Achmeth</hi> anſwered him, that he ſhould take counſell of the Grand Seigniour, and follow his pleaſure, and not of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This pleaſed <hi>Roſtan,</hi> and ſuddenly by a ſufficient meſſage he executed the counſel of his faithfull friend: and receiuing anſwer from the Seigniour, who commaunded that preſently he ſhould retire himſelfe from him; he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine cauſed to bee told him, that he could not depart nor retire without his Pauilions, without commiſſion, and without money. The Turke cauſed to be replied, that the neceſſitie required neither Pauilions nor money. Vpon this reſolution hee mounted on horſebacke with eight of his faithfulleſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> friends, and in three daies he iournied ſo farre, as if in eight he could haue done by poſt, and retired to Conſtantinople, where he remained in great trouble and feare for theſe miſaduentures. The Grand Seigniour afterward endeuoured wiſely to appeaſe the cholor of his ſouldiours; and not being able to achieue the ſame by reaſon of their obſtinacie, and perceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe depriued of hope, and in doubt of his perſon, ſought three times with a few of his people to ſaue himſelfe from their hands. But it was not poſſible for him, but on the contrary with very great inſtance and inſolencie, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that their Lord ſhould ſhew himſelfe in this field, and that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be giuen, and iuſtice not delayed, and that they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſaue himſelfe either in townes or Fortreſſes, they not minding at any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hand to endure, that without cauſe they ſhould thus falſely maſſacre the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, imputing to them ſlanders, &amp; vniuſtly charging them with treaſon, whereof neither <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> nor they did euer ſo much as thinke: further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more obſtinately perſeuering in this, that they would not by any meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence, except they were reuenged for the innocent blood, and that they might haue iuſtice. The Grand Seigniour ſeeing that after he had publikly and ſecretly practiſed with them all kinde of experiments, yet could he not for all that content them; and that there were alreadie many dayes paſt; and knowing their mindes to be more kindled to reuenge then before; and ſeeing that by his authoritie he could doe no more, meant yet further to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> make triall of the graue wiſedome of <hi>Achmeth,</hi> who knew ſo aptly to handle them, that he ſo farre preuailed in paying daily 1000. Aſpres to euery ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour <note place="margin">Solyman eſcapeth from his mutinous ſouldiours.</note> for three dayes to 4000. ſouldiours of the Port, they were agreed to accompanie their Lord to Aleppo, which was three daies iourney from thence; the Turke notwithſtanding hauing giuen them his inuiolable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and faith to chaſtiſe the falſe accuſer, and to reuenge the innocent blood of <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> With theſe conditions he retired to Aleppo, cleering himſelfe from the hands of his ſouldiours, hauing before hee departed from his Campe, taken order for the bodies of his children, and commaunded they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhould be carried to Burſia, where are the ancient Tombes of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Burſia a towne where is the ſepulture of the Turkiſh Emperours.</note> Thoſe who had the charge thereof, vncloathing this miſerable <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> found the letters (which, as wee haue ſaid, he had put into his boſome, when he went from his Pauilion to go kiſſe his fathers hands) and preſenting them to the Grand Seigniour, he would not then open them. But after theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:21983:145"/>
were a little appeaſed, he cauſed them to bee brought vnto him, and read them, and found that from point to point were diſcouered therein, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

But that which he did not then, he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vntill another time: and ſince the fact was remedileſſe, he altered his minde to fauour and aduance <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> (which he had by a Ladie of Boſnia) of the age of 14. yeeres, who (during this tumult) was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> brought vp by the mother of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> in another countrie, fearing that the furie of the Grand Seigniour ſhould alſo fall vpon him. And he preſently recalled a certaine Captaine, whom he had alreadie diſpatched to goe and kill him, and he hauing found this childe, cauſed him to bee brought vnto him, he gaue him for his entertainment the Sangiachſhip of Burſia. After that he departed from thence and marched towards Hieruſalem, and being but foure daies iournie from thence, for ſome other accidents happened, he was conſtrained to returne to Aleppo, that he might prouide for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of Syria, and euen then it was that he was alreadie freed from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Roſſa.</hi>

            <p>About this time <hi>Peter Chendy</hi> was found culpable concerning the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">Chendy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Tranſiluania.</note> of the kingdome of Tranſiluania, as hauing put his hand thereto: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> minding to diſcharge himſelfe thereof, he writ to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> about it, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe, and aſſuring him that he neuer meant any ſuch matter. His excuſes (according to the neceſſitie of the time) were receiued. But within a while after the Queene deſirous to recouer that which of her owne will ſhe had left, effected her purpoſes ſo well, that cauſing a tumult among the people of the kingdome, within a ſhort time ſhe ſaw her ſelfe Ladie thereof, and chaſed from thence <hi>Ferdinands</hi> people; there increaſing at the ſame time ſo horrible a plague in this Prouince, that it continued vntill the yeere 1555. whereof died ſo many men, horſes, and other beaſts, that it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>

            <p>
               <q>My Lord Cardinall, ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to ſhew me ſo much grace at the end of my daies, as to graunt me reſt, by the truce which I haue made with the King of France, the fruite whereof I hope for a good peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſubiects both of the one part and other, I am reſolute to end the remainder of my yeeres with a life more ſweete and fuller of tranquilitie; by meane of which I may applie my ſelf to the contemplation of diuine things, from which (to my great ſorrow) I haue been more diſtracted then I would haue bin, by the affayres which I haue had vpon me euen from my youth in ſo great abundance, that if diuine clemencie had not aſſiſted and comforted me, I know it had been impoſſible for me to vnfold my ſelfe therefrom. The acknowledgement which I haue thereof, beſides other benefits receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> hath more excited me to make this retraict, then any other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could haue had: to which neuertheleſſe I had not permitted my ſelfe to goe, if I had ſeene that my preſence, and the adminiſtration committed into my hands, could yet haue brought any commoditie to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:21983:146"/>
But after ſo many victories which God (notwithſtanding I was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of them) gaue me, I more eſteeme this grace which he hath ſhewed me, to haue fauoured me ſo much as to cauſe me to ſee a peace, or at leaſt a generall truce, not onely among my ſubiects, and other Princes my friends and confederates: but alſo with thoſe who ſay themſelues to be my enemies, leauing now euery one in quiet, and in ſuch patience, that not any hath need of my helpe. Conſidering this great fauour of God, and the imbecilitie which old age hath brought vpon me, and iudging that both the one and the other doe eaſily exempt me any longer to gouerne the rudder of this Chriſtian Common-weale, I haue preſently reſolued with my ſelfe, vtterly alſo to forſake all other leſſer affayres and pleaſures of this world: and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy this little time, which yet I haue here vpon earth, in ſpirituall contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that ſo I may by the meanes thereof, wipe away the faults which (it may bee) I haue committed againſt and beſides the will of his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, euen as they who haue the like charge that wee haue, doe ſo much the more fully fall, as the burthen which they beare vpon their ſhoulders is great and weightie. I am not ignorant but that (as we are ſubiect to bee abuſed) I haue giuen occaſion to ſome to be diſcontented with me, inſomuch that this is not ſufficient for me that I am willing by my retraict to appeaſe the diuine anger, (which I haue drawne vpon my ſelfe) except on the other part I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to ſatisfie thoſe that might complaine of me. This my affection hath pricked me forward to condiſcend more eaſily to the accord, which I haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> made touching the conuentions ſet downe by the truce, by which I haue releaſed to the King of France, not onely more then he demaunded, but alſo more then he hoped for: and how alſo my Commiſſioners (by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund) haue done towards his Holines, minding thereby firſt to content ſtrangers, and after to haue regard of my ſubiects; whom the better to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie according to my abilitie, I haue ſent the moſt part of the Lords (who are now here with me) to giue them to vnderſtand this my good will, to the end that they not being ignorant thereof, might freely declare vnto me whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they eſteeme good for the accompliſhment thereof: hauing alſo ſent for my ſonne to execute in this countrie of Flanders and Bourgundie, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they ſhall diſcouer vnto me, for the comfort of my conſcience, whileſt that my ſelfe, after being arriued in Spaine (by Gods helpe) I hope to do the like there, and alſo in my other kingdomes. I ſhould bee very glad if I were able to come into Germanie, and at a Diet there my ſelfe to make this my declaration, for the honour which I owe to ſuch a Prouince. But the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which approacheth, hindereth me from going thither. And ſince neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraineth me, I deſire you to appoint the Diet to be held at Franckfort, and to call thither all the other Electors and Princes of the Empire: and you being there, to declare to them all (in my name) the indiſpoſition of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> time, which doth not permit me to execute that good will which I had to come and meete them there, that ſo I might againe thanke them for the honour that they, or their predeceſſors haue done to me, in electing me to bee their Emperour, and withall to ſet out the good affection which their forefathers haue alwaies ſhewed by effect to thoſe of our houſe, euen as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:21983:147"/>
I would they meant to continue it in the election which afterwards they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> made of my brother, conſtituting him K. of the Romanes, and which good affection I intreate them to maintaine. And alſo I would haue you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto them, that my intention is (ſince all things are now in peace) to commit into the hands of my brother (now King of the Romanes) the Crowne, and all the other Emperiall ornaments, to the end that he taking wholly vpon him the care and charge of the Empire, my abſence ſhould not be the cauſe that any trouble ſhould grow there, deſiring them all that they would aſſiſt him, and that they would liue peaceably with him, and as true naturall brethren. And further that you would giue them to vnderſtand, that this my departure from them (although it be farre off) yet is it not with intent to leaue or forſake them: but on the contrarie, they ſhall alwaies finde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> me furniſhed and prouided of ſo good an affection towards them, as euer I had. And if there be any ſubiect of the Empire, who can complaine that I haue vſed any iniuſtice againſt him, I haue deſired my brother to giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe thereunto, to whom for ſuch complaints euery man may repayre. And for the laſt care which here I can haue touching the good of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, I deſire you to perſwade them that they would accept of and ratifie the dimiſſion which I make, and that to bee ſhort, they would crowne for their Emperour him whom they haue alreadie choſen King of the Romanes, to the end that this great Prouince may ſee it ſelfe prouided of a head, who may haue an eye in euery place, as euery one hath alſo an eye vpon him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that by this meanes you may ſhut the Port againſt enterance of new enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, which may ariſe for want of the preſence of the head who may bee able to reſiſt them. Alſo further I deſire them, that they would not faile my ſaid brother of ſuccours, for the conſeruation of his kingdome of Hungarie, which is the Bulwarke of all Germanie againſt the common enemie. And in particular I deſire you (moſt reuerend Cardinall) to ſet your hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: as alſo more particularly I recommend vnto you (againſt ſome enuious perſons) the defence of all that which I haue done and negotiated amongſt the Electors, Princes, and Lords of the Empire, and Emperiall townes, knowing that you are not ignorant with what ſinceritie I haue behaued my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſelfe in my actions, whereof I will alwaies yeeld good account both before God and men: although I will not denie, but that there hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time mingled therewithall ſome things of humane frailtie, not minding to attribute to my ſelfe ſuch perfection, that I haue been exempted from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vice. But the one being ballanced with the other, I am aſſured that the wiſer ſort will not vſe any ſeuere iudgement againſt me: and commending to your wiſedome the vpholding of this my cauſe, I will not make to you any longer diſcourſe thereof. And to conclude this preſent matter, I deſire you to beleeue, that whereſoeuer I am, I will alwaies be mindfull and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to employ my ſelfe, and that towards my friends, in all that which I ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> know to be neceſſarie for you, whereof I deſire you not to feare to aduertiſe and ſolicite me. In the meane time I recommend my ſelfe to your good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and prayers, and humbly deſire God to keepe you my Lord Cardinall in long health and happie life.

Some ſay, that as ſoone as he ſet foote on land, he kneeled downe, thanking God for that in theſe laſt daies of his life he had ſhewed him this fauour to conduct him into this countrie, which aboue all others he held alwaies moſt deare, and by meanes whereof he was come to that high degree of the Empire, attributing to it (next to God) in a manneral his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and honours, vſing theſe words: <q>As naked I came out of my mothers wombe, ſo naked doe I returne to thee my ſecond mother, and in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of many merits which thou haſt vſed to me, I not being able for the preſent to beſtow any other thing on thee, I giue thee this my ſicke bodie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and theſe my feeble and weake bones.

acts being accompliſhed, his Maieſtie with all his Princes went to Aix, where he was crowned Emperour, notwithſtanding the refuſall, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4. made to ratifie this election; alleadging that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for that the Heretike Electors (as he ſo called them) intermedled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall. But this no otherwiſe proceeded not from his Holines, but by an occaſion of a certaine deuice betweene him, the King of France, and others, altogether againſt the houſe of Auſtria: according vnto which the Duke of Albe was euen now come to blowes with the Captaines of his Holines: and <note place="margin">The truce broken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene King Henry of France and Philip King of Spaine.</note> within a while after followed the breach of the foreſaid truce, vpon which occaſion happened to the French this great loſſe which they ſuſtained vpon S. <hi>Laurence</hi> his day, in the moneth of Auguſt, by the towne of Saint Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>

            <p>About this time the Grand Seigniour declared to the Queene of Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania, that he vnderſtood that certaine ſects were crept into the religion <note place="margin">Commaund from the Turk to Queene Izabella, to chaſe out of her kingdome the new ſects.</note> which ſhe held, which by no meanes he would ſhe ſhould tolerate, if ſhe would remaine in his fauour, knowing that ſuch nouelties would bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to her but tumult and loſſe of her kingdome, and to him much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: and for this cauſe he commaunded her vtterly to extirpite them who were authors thereof, and in ſuch manner to extinguiſh them, that there ſhould not be any mention of them.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> brother to the deceaſed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, about the very time &amp; the death of his brother, had aduertiſement that the Baſha of Buda and the Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauian, beyond all expectation, would come into the field, whileſt his Maieſtie held the Diet in the towne of Ausbourg, in which were preſent all the Electors, and almoſt all the Princes of the Empire, as well for his own <note place="margin">Ambaſſadours of France at the Diet of Ausbourg.</note> affayres, as to giue audience to an Ambaſſage ſent from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the King of France, of which were chiefe the Biſhop of Vienna named <hi>Marrillac,</hi> and the Lord of Bourdillon, which was vpon the 28. of March, the Emperour being in the great hall of Ausbourg in his Emperiall throne <note place="margin">The ſeate of the Emperour and Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the Diets.</note> vnder the cloth of Eſtate, hauing on his right hand the Biſhop of Mentz, the Ambaſſadour of the Biſhop of Coullin, the Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> the Biſhop of

Saltzbourg, the Grand Maſter of Pruſſia, with many other great Lords.

Before this great and renowned companie were honourably placed the Ambaſſadours of France. They offered in the name of their King all his abilitie and friendſhip for the ſeruie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and they ſought a perpetuall confederacie with him and the Electors. Anſwer was made them, that when they ſaw effects correſpondent to his words, by reſtitution of the towne of Mets, they would then aſſuredly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> thinke that their Maſter would bee their friend; and alſo that then they would be all readie to confirme good amitie him.</p>
            <p>This Diet ended, the Emperour for feare of the daunger which might happen in his kingdome of Hungarie, vpon the ſaid aduertiſement, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent recourſe to the ayde of his eſtates, and of the Empire. Bohemia, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, <note place="margin">Succours graunted to Ferdinand againſt the Turke.</note> Stiria, and Carinthia offered vpon euery thouſand crownes of value, twelue crownes to ſuccour his Maieſtie. And the Empire offered him men, horſes, and money, if in caſe the warre ſhould further proceede: and in the meane time while they could ſee what way theſe rumours would take, they yeelded to his Maieſtie 600000. Dollors for three moneths, to be employed where his Maieſtie thought good. Theſe rumours were not in vaine. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the warre betweene <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and King <hi>Iohn</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Stephen)</hi> was greatly inflamed: King <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing alreadie taken from the Emperour the ſtrong Caſtle of Tocchay, and many other, minding continually to aſſay the <note place="margin">Tocchay ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by K. Iohn from Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> recouerie of the ſurpluſage of his kingdome, and to reuenge himſelfe of the wrong which he thought he had receiued in this, that the Emperour held not promiſe with him touching the <hi>Infanta Ioane,</hi> whom he had promiſed vnto for ſpouſe, with a dowrie conuenient to her greatnes: and with ſuch reaſons, being fauoured of the Hungars, who complained themſelues to bee ſorely oppreſſed by the Emperour: and hauing by the ayde of the Turke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> a great armie, he poſſeſſed a large countrie, and had become maſter of all Hungarie, if the Emperour had not before ſent a ſufficient Campe to reſiſt and hinder them from further proceeding; notwithſtanding the forces of the Baſha of Buda, who was come into the field on his behalfe. But at the inſtance of the King of Polonia, &amp; other Princes, who offered themſelues to <note place="margin">Debatement of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene King Iohn and the Emperour Ferdinand.</note> be mediatours of ſome good accord, for the deſire which they had to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch that fire, for feare that the Turke vnder this occaſion ſhould not faſten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe further in this quarter, hee cauſed his armie to retire, as alſo King <hi>Iohn</hi> did, who by the aduice &amp; perſwaſion of the ſaid mediatours, was reduced to this point, that he would ſend Ambaſſadours to the Emperiall Maieſtie, to effect their accord, and to demaund one of his daughters in mariage, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he did: and his Ambaſſadours being arriued at Vienna, and audience being graunted them, being about to ſay that <hi>Iohn</hi> King of Hungarie and Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uania had ſent them vnto him; the Emperour would heare them no further, ſaying, that his Vayuode ought not to call himſelfe King of Hungarie, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21983:150"/>
kingdome being his inheritance, not vſurped, as it had been by the father of him who ſent them: and that if they would haue audience, they ſhould no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> more call <hi>Iohn</hi> King of Hungarie, nor Tranſiluania, but onely Vayuode of that Prouince. The Ambaſſadours not minding to accept of theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, preſently diſpatched Couriers into Poland and into Tranſiluania, to giue the King notice of all this. Vpon this difficultie, the K. of Poland was of opinion, that the King of Tranſiluania his nephew ſhuld not for that time name himſelfe K. of Hungarie, but only of that which he poſſeſſed: ſeeing it was not likely that he could iuſtly denie him the title of K. of Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, he being thereunto called by the conſent of all the people, and reinſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by force of his armes, after that he had not kept, nor obſerued the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and promiſes made as on his behalfe, betweene the Queene his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the Emperour, in the time that <hi>Caſtalde</hi> was there. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours following this aduice, alleadging the reaſons of the King of Poland, and ſpeaking of <hi>Caſtalde,</hi> they complained greatly of him, ſaying, that the Queene had been more deceiued by his perſwaſions and vaine ſpeeches, then had been the dead King her husband by thoſe who had crowned him K. of Hungarie, and thoſe who were reuolted againſt him. The Emperour not minding to agree to this title of K. of Tranſiluania, but only of Vayuod, receiued notwithſtanding thoſe Ambaſſadours, who, treating of their charge, were not much content. They demaunded, that the Emperour ſhould relinquiſh all that which he pretended in Tranſiluania, and that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhould make peace with their King, in giuing him his daughter in marriage with 100000. crownes, and vpon this condition, that all that which is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond Tibiſcus ſhould bee his, and that which was on this ſide ſhould remaine to his Maieſtie: and that in the warres which might be betweene him and the Turke, he ſhould be reputed neuter, not willing in this caſe to forſake the amitie of the Grand Seigniour, not to faile in the fidelitie and homage which he had done vnto him: neither was he willing to be bound to ioyne with his Maieſtie, whenſoeuer the Turke would make warre in Hungarie. They alſo further demaunded, that concerning that which the Emperour poſſeſſed of the reſt of Hungarie, he ſhould ſatisfie the dowrie and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> debts of Queene <hi>Izabella,</hi> which ſhe pretended from the time of the death of King <hi>Iohn</hi> her husband. To theſe demaunds the Emperour conſented in part, and in part alſo meant not to conſent to thoſe which moſt imported him, and ſpecially concerning the alliance, that he might not ſeeme thereby willing to yeeld vp his pretended right of Tranſiluania, and hoping that himſelfe or his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one day ſhould be able to recouer it: and he preuailed ſo farre, that the enterpriſe of the Poliſh Ambaſſadours, and of other Princes came to nothing: and by that meanes the Ambaſſadours of Tranſiluania re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without any reſolution. Which was a cauſe within a while after of great warre betweene him and the King of Tranſiluania, vnder the fauour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Turke: vpon which occaſion he well knew what loſſe and damage it was to him, for that he would not then agree.</p>
            <p>A certaine time after the Vayuode of Valachia was aduertiſed, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vayuode went about to diſpoſſeſſe him of his eſtate, being aſſured of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21983:151"/>
ſuccours from <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and of the fauour of the nephew of that <hi>Lasky,</hi> who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
               <note place="margin">Albert Lasky.</note> laboured the friendſhip which was betweene <hi>Solyman</hi> and King <hi>Iohn.</hi> This nephew was alſo named <hi>Lasky.</hi> He for ſundrie matters whereof he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, was before conſtrained to forſake the kingdome of Polonia: vpon which occaſion he was retired vnder the protection of his vncle to the Turk, of whom he was ſo well receiued, that he was made a Colonell of certaine Turkiſh troupes of horſe and foote. But ſometimes after forgetting all theſe honours and fauours, he forſooke that part, and tooke that of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinands,</hi> in whoſe ſeruice he then was, when he practiſed this ſubteltie, and enterpriſed without the knowledge of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> againſt the Vayuode of Valachia, for the profit and commoditie of another, in whoſe fauour he had alreadie amaſſed 2000. horſe, which he ioyned with the armie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Vayuode, which was of 8000. footmen, and 4000. horſe. Theſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marched with great ſpeede, thinking to take the Vayuode vnprouided, and were alreadie arriued very neere him, attending the night which was fit to maſſacre them, and to ſeaze vpon his eſtate, in a pleaſant &amp; weake village, wherein for the preſent he then was. But the Vayuode being alreadie vpon his guard, &amp; according to the firſt aduertiſements, hauing aſſembled very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, to the number of 40000. men foote and horſe, attending the iſſue of this enterpriſe, being aduertiſed of the place where his enemies were lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he cauſed that night all his people to march with ſpeede, and in ſuch manner ſo ſurpriſed his enemie, that he had neither leiſure nor commoditie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to range himſelfe in battaile, ſeeing himſelfe aſſailed on all ſides ſo ſuddenly and furiouſly, that he was conſtrained with his friend <hi>Lasky,</hi> to flie to the confines of Polonia, and to leaue the victorie to the Valachians, who with little loſſe of theirs, and great of their enemies, inriched themſelus with the ſpoyle &amp; bootie of this man: <hi>Lasky</hi> afterwards remaining diſpoſſeſſed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny townes and Caſtles which he had by Caſſouia, being depriued of thoſe by meanes of the ſaid Vayuode. And by this ill fortune ſo inconſideratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened to him, falling into the indignation of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from his ſeruice, he retired into Moldauia, for that he would not fall into the hands of the King of Polonia, the Emperour, or of the Valachian; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> theſe Princes not minding by the ſuffering of ſuch an act, to draw vpon them any more the forces of <hi>Solyman,</hi> who neuertheleſſe on his ſide, was not to demaund of them therefore any greater ſatisfaction, he hauing then a great diſtruſt of the Gouernour of Egypt, againſt whom he had ſent a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ianiſaries and other ſouldiours of his Port, fearing ſome commotion in that Prouince: and from other places he had ſome aduertiſements of the enterpriſes of <hi>Baiazet</hi> his ſecond ſonne, who (ſome ſaid) meant to inuade Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, <note place="margin">Solyman in trouble and doubt by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iazet his ſon.</note> with the ſuccours and ayde of the Sophy, ſo that <hi>Solyman</hi> was againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſend new garriſons into that quarter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the occaſion of theſe troubles, he himſelfe had great deſire to ſeeke peace and truce with <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> although that his Lieutenants of Buda and of Boſſina, with the Vayuodes of Valachia, Moldauia, and of Tranſalpina, in fauour of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> brought great damage to the Emperour, harrying and ſpoyling Hungarie, bringing into their hands many places thereof, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21983:151"/>
not being able to draw any ſuccours from the Lords of that countrie, neither for the fortifications of the places, nor for the entertainment of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſouldiours: and if it had not been for the new garriſons which he put in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter places, by the ayde of his ſubiects of Auſtria, the loſſe had been farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that countrie. <hi>Solyman,</hi> notwithſtanding the gaine which his people had in Hungarie, conſidering the perill whereinto he might fall, if he at one time had to doe againſt ſo puiſſant enemies as the Emperour and the Sophy were, reſolued rather to ſeeke peace with the Chriſtians, then with his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>To this end (while they were at a Diet which was held at Franckfort, there <note place="margin">Maximillian ſonne of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen King of the Romanes.</note> was celebrated the ſolemnitie of the election, that the Electors had made of the perſon of <hi>Maximilian</hi> King of Bohemia, the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to bee King of the Romanes, and of his Coronation, after the accuſtomed promiſes by him made to be an obedient childe to the holy Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vſe of his predeceſſors) an Ambaſſadour ſent from <hi>Solyman</hi> was preſented in this great aſſemblie, who offered a preſent to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Solyman ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth peace with Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> rich habiliments, and of ſtraunge beaſts: and after hauing ended ſome differences with his Maieſtie, which imported Hungarie, the truce was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betweene them: and in conſideration thereof, this Ambaſſadour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee releaſed and ſet at libertie many priſoners taken in warre, who by no meanes before could be redeemed for any money, nor exchaunge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were vnder the power of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>After this truce, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> perceiuing himſelfe to grow old and vnweildy of his bodie, yeelded the kingdome of Hungarie to his ſonne <hi>Maximilian,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Maximilian made King of Hungarie.</note> with conſent of all the Barons and Lords of the countrie, in acknowledging of which, all the Lords were gratified by <hi>Maximilian</hi> in all that which hee could doe. Whereupon ſome little while after, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſurpriſed with a great ſicknes, ended his daies, hauing been a Prince of ſingular bountie and valour: and had not his example and wiſedome been, Germanie (which <note place="margin">The death of Ferdinand.</note> was greatly eſtranged from the Catholike Church) had been wholly diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the vnion of the faithfull, and Eccleſiaſticall ceremonies. This man although he was the ſonne of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Burgongne, Counte of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and Archduke of Auſtria, and of <hi>Ioane</hi> Queene of Spaine, and of other kingdomes: of al his fathers inheritance he had no more then the Archduke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Auſtria, with the Eſtates which are ſituated in Germanie: which was the ancient patrimonie of his houſe, the lawes of Spaine being of ſuch qualitie, that the eldeſt haue onely the entire ſucceſſion. Neuertheleſſe, by meanes of his vertue he increaſed the inheritance of his houſe, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia; augmenting by the addition of them, the greatnes of it farre more then it fell vnto him by his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. By theſe actions he alwaies made it apparant, that he was endued with great conſtancie, eſpecially towards religion, whereof he became protector, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in ſuch ſort, that laying aſide all his other particular intereſt, he had ſpeciall regard to the people which were committed to him, endeuouring himſelfe to preſerue them againſt hereſies: and indeede not omitting any occaſion or meanes to reduce thoſe to the true knowledge, who were ſtrayed from the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21983:152"/>
ancient Religion; his good diſpoſition was ſo great towards all the Princes of the Empire, that with a reciprocall amitie he was ſo well affected of them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that euen thoſe who had important buſines to negotiate with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> his brother, feared not to take him to arbitrate betweene his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and them: ſo greatly did diuine iuſtice ſhine in him, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth in it ſelfe all other vertues.</p>
            <p>Alſo, not without cauſe of his good deedes, as well in generall, as towards particular Princes the Electors of the Empire, continued their election in his familie from the father to the ſonne, almoſt making by this doing this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, not as election, but as it were hereditarie. It is not to be doubted, but that his deceaſe brought great griefe to the hearts of euery one, as it very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> appeared by the bewailing, which vniuerſally was made for his death.</p>
            <p>His ſonne <hi>Maximilian</hi> (who alreadie was choſen King of the Romanes) ſucceeded him in the Empire. This man after he had taken the Crowne, <note place="margin">Maximilian made Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> the Mantle, and other Emperiall ornaments, was confirmed Emperour by Pope <hi>Pius:</hi> and ſeeing himſelfe aduanced by this goodly and great dignitie, with augmentation of goods and meanes, hauing of a long time nouriſhed in himſelfe a mortall hatred againſt King <hi>Iohn</hi> of Tranſiluania, he meant ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to vndertake the reuenge of many wrongs and loſſes receiued from him: and to doe this, he reſolued to aſſaile him on a ſudden. And for this purpoſe hauing amaſſed a great number of footmen vnder the conduct of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 
               <note place="margin">Maximilian made warre vpon K. Iohn.</note> 
               <hi>Melchior Ballaſsi,</hi> and cauſing them ſpeedily to march towards Tranſiluania, he ſuddenly poſſeſſed certaine Fortreſſes. <hi>Iohn</hi> mightily prouoked at this, that againſt the compoſitions made with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he was ſo wronged by a new King, cauſed alſo his people very quickly to come into the field, and without delay, tooke the direct way againſt Sachmar, a ſtrong place belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Sachmar ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Iohn.</note> to <hi>Ballaſsi,</hi> who had not well prouided for it, miſtruſting rather any other enterpriſe then this. This place was taken by a ſtratagem: <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all his people nigh to it about night in an Ambuſcado ſo couert, that without being perceiued, they had commoditie to place themſelues at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Port, as they opened it to receiue in the Heardſmen, who from the fieldes brought their heards of beaſts into this towne. <hi>Ballaſsi</hi> vexed at ſuch a loſſe, went from thence and put himſelfe into a great towne (yet not very ſtrong) named Debrezen, in which ordinarily aſſembled many Marchants of diuers countries, and thereunto hauing put fire, he ſpoyled all there about. <note place="margin">Debrezen burned by the Emperials.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time, the King of Tranſiluania hauing reenforced his army with 4000. Turkes, that the Baſha of Buda ſent him by the commaund of <hi>Solyman,</hi> came to force the towne of Hadao, and by compoſition he alſo made himſelfe maſter of Atauiar: and leading about many priſoners, went <note place="margin">Hadao and Atauiar taken by Iohn.</note> and beſieged the place of Vngar. The Emperour not ignorant of this that his enemie was ſuddenly fortified, with the ayde which was ſent him from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Buda, had alſo diſpatched a great number of Lanſquenets, and ſome Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie, vnder the charge of <hi>Purchaſtaler,</hi> Captaine and Gouernour of Vngar.

a time, that the enemie (notwithſtanding all his endeuour) was forced to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> raiſe his ſiege, hauing loſt there 4000. men at one charge, which <hi>Purchaſtaler</hi> came and gaue him, while he was not attentiue to any thing, but to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged: this Captaine hauing vſed this policie, that planting his Cannon vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flanke of the enemy, &amp; couering it with his people, becauſe he would not haue it diſcouered when they came to hand-ſtrokes: at the firſt ſignall his people (as it were flying) retired themſelues from before their Artillerie, which then being fitly diſcharged, made a great butcherie of his enemies, and put them into ſuch diſorder, that the Germanes had a great hand of thoſe who were come out of the trenches of the Campe to fight with them. All this ſerued to no other end, but the more to kindle the fire betweene theſe two Princes, both the one and the other being willing to reuenge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> themſelues, whileſt <hi>Iohn</hi> being ſuccoured by the Turkes, who liked it better to haue a weake neighbour for their friend, then a neighbour who was ſtrong and puiſſant. <hi>Maximilian</hi> alſo thinking, that thereby he loſt much of his honour at the beginning of his Empire, did daily make new leauies of ſouldiours: and ſeeing he had to doe with a partie more ſtrong then he thought for, made <hi>Lazare Schuendy</hi> (an ancient and very expert Captaine) his <note place="margin">Lazare Schu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endy Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall in Hungarie for Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</note> Lieutenant in this warre, and one who had attained great experience by the paſſed warres vnder the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in the ſame countrie of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, as wee before haue written. For the reſt of the yeere, <hi>Schuendy</hi> could not enterpriſe any thing vpon Tranſiluania, becauſe that he was come too <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> late into this armie, winter being alreadie come vpon them: ſo that the cold conſtrained him to lodge his people in garriſons vntill the Spring time, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing himſelfe in the meane while with neceſſarie things for the next warre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of Polonia, vncle to <hi>Iohn,</hi> by reaſon of his ſiſter, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſuch preparations would bring but a deſolation to Chriſtendome, and deſiring (for the auoyding of this euill) to pacifie theſe two Princes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed himſelfe to treate of an accord betweene them two: and for this effect ſending his Ambaſſadours both to the one and other, he laboured his beſt to reduce them to a peace: but they being both greatly moued, he could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> effect nothing. Therefore the Spring approaching, <hi>Schuendy</hi> (Lieutenant generall for the Emperour) drew his people out of garriſon, and came into the field with an army, drawing towards Tranſiluania, to the end to aſſay the taking of the Caſtle of Tocchay, which is a Fortreſſe very renowned, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the frontire of Hungarie, betweene the riuers Thiſſa and Wodrog, which could not bee very eaſily beſieged, except theſe two riuers were fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, as then they were. This place was before taken by <hi>Cazzianet</hi> for the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who at the perſwaſion of ſome, had giuen it then to a Hungarian Baron of the familie of <hi>Scheredy,</hi> for recompence of certaine good and great ſeruices which he had done his Maieſtie. This Lord being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> deceaſed left one ſonne, who for that he was of yong yeeres, was kept in this Caſtle vnder the gouernment of <hi>Francis Nemethy,</hi> who of a Tutor became a <note place="margin">Nemethy a Tutor ſpoileth his pupil of Tocchay.</note> Tyrant; and vſurping the place for himſelfe, forſooke <hi>Maximilians</hi> part, and adhered to <hi>Iohn.</hi> This man being well aſcertained that they would come
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21983:153"/>
and beſiege it, before the enemie preſented himſelfe, he cauſed to bee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> all his moueables, his wife, and pupil, giuing order to that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed for the defence of this Fortreſſe. This is built after the manner of the greateſt number of thoſe of Hungarie, not hauing for all the Courtaines <note place="margin">The ſiege of Tocchay by the Emperials.</note> but one long rampier of earth flanked with certaine towers, with a good and large Ditch full of water, which then (and for the ruine of the place) was all frozen, and with ſo thicke an ice, that vpon it they might march to the aſſault as vpon plaine ground, and winter being not altogether paſſed, but hauing then his courſe yet very vehement, by reaſon that this countrie is of cold temperature: and when <hi>Schuendy</hi> made his approaches it was the 4. of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie. He had ſuch ſtore of Cannon, that therewith he ſo made his batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that on all ſides the towne was battered. But this furie had not any force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> againſt the ground, ſo that he was forced vpon the ice to come to the ſap. Whileſt this continued, the aſſieged ſallied forth, and they ſo couragiouſly charged their enemies, that they laid 100. of them dead vpon the ground. But the great number ſurpaſſing their courage, they were conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: and ſeeing their rampiers broken, &amp; the feare to loſe them, cauſed them to parley &amp; promiſe to yeeld themſelues vpon ſome conditions, which (for that they were too much profitable for them) <hi>Schuendy</hi> would not agree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but cauſed to reare the ladders, by meanes whereof the rampier was wonne, and the towne forced: and with great celeritie the Caſtle was aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Nemethy</hi> not forgetting any thing which might bee for the defence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the place (as he was a braue ſouldiour, and a valiant and couragious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) by his valour maintained a long time the violence of his enemies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that going and comming here and there, to incourage his people, he was ſhot with a Harquebuze, which threw him dead to the ground. This death cauſed <note place="margin">Nemethy ſlaine.</note> preſently his ſouldiours to loſe their courage, who yeelded vpon this agreement, that euery one of them ſhould haue his ſword, and one ſuite of apparell. The Emperials being entered into this place, inriched themſelues <note place="margin">Tocchay yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> with good bootie, and there they found a quantitie of good and delicate wine. <hi>Schuendy</hi> ſent the bodie of <hi>Nemethy</hi> to his wife, who was retired to a Caſtle of his, named Serentſchin, which without any ſtroke giuen, became <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> vnder the Emperours puiſſance. Within a while after, the Emperials of the garriſon of Agria being aduertiſed that the Turks were gone out of Zolnok, (which was not farre from the Campe) prepared for them a baite and an Ambuſcado, which came ſo well to effect, that 300. Turkes remained there priſoners. On the other ſide, the garriſon of Iauerin being abroad, cut as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in peeces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeing how all ſucceeded to the aduancement of his enemie, and that not any profit or commoditie could come to him in retaining the Caſtle of Sachmar (which alreadie had been taken and retaken twice) commaunded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 
               <note place="margin">Sachmar bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> thoſe within to fire it, and to retire themſelues by priuate and ſecret waies, while <hi>Schuendy</hi> paſſed Thiſſa (otherwiſe Tibiſcus) with his armie. This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage did ſo much aſtoniſh thoſe who kept the Fortreſſe of Eiden, that being <note place="margin">Eiden yeelded to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.</note> only beſieged by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of one day, they yeelded without any defence, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> hauing in former time vſed al his force to get it, by reaſon of the great
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21983:153"/>
reuenewes and profits which come thereof. This good fortune of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was greatly fauoured by the inundations and ouerflowings of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius, and of other riuers of Hungarie, and by the rigour of the winter, which in that yeere was ſo vehement, that the birds were found dead vpon <note place="margin">A great win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> the ground through cold, and the peaſants were taken lying vpon dunghils in great number halfe dead, who being brought to the fire, recouered their naturall ſpirits. And at the end the raines were ſo abundant, that the ice mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, all the countrie was in a manner drowned, in ſuch ſort, that on all ſides, except the hils, one could ſee nothing but water, and the earth ſeemed to be conuerted to the great Ocean ſea. Theſe marueilous accidents were greatly incommodious for the enterpriſes of <hi>Iohn,</hi> becauſe that the ſuccours, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> on all ſides were readie vpon the borders of the Turkes prouinces, and of thoſe of his tributaries in the towne of Buda for him, were greatly ſlackened by theſe inconueniences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solyman,</hi> who was determined to ſuccour and ayde <hi>Iohn,</hi> both with men and money, and euen with his owne perſon; neuertheleſſe vpon theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities willing to entertaine <hi>Maximilian,</hi> ſent to him an Ambaſſadour named <hi>Marc Libinieſa,</hi> a Tranſiluanian reneged Chriſtian, who before time had been at Vienna in the ſame dignitie. His charge was openly to exhort <note place="margin">Debatement of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian, Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Iohn, &amp; Sigiſmond.</note> the Emperour, to preſerue the pactions and agreements of the peace ſworne by his father. He had alſo there with him for the ſame effect <hi>George Bathor</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Iohn:</hi> and for the ſame occaſion the King of Polonia had alſo ſent thither his Ambaſſadour.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, <hi>Schuendy</hi> vpon theſe Ambaſſages, more then once, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed the Emperor, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould well aduiſe with himſelfe before he made any concluſion tending to an agreement, for feare of being deceiued by the Turkes, vnder a pretence of an accord. <hi>Maximilian</hi> himſelfe doubted the ſleights of the Turke, knowing that it was but ſome policie to deceiue him. Neuertheleſſe, that he might not ſeeme to haue a minde to diſturbe this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of peace, he commanded that the frontier garriſons of Hungarie ſhould not moleſt the Turkes, although that of their part ſuch patience were not vſed, as it was not. For whileſt that at Vienna they treated of pacifying the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> differences, and aſſaied to grow to ſome reaſonable agreement, the Turkes greatly endamaged Slauonia, and in Hungarie towards Iula, they made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny incurſions, being in the field with the Gouernour of Themeſuar, who had with him 6000. men, two great peeces of Altillerie, and eight Faulcons: he ſpoyling all the countrie thereabouts. With theſe peeces this Gouernour battered and tooke the Caſtle of Pancor, alſo making himſelfe maſter of two other named Seua and Deonec, ſituated by Iula, minding by thoſe to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſiege, with which he pretended to enuiron the ſaid place of Iula, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which were marched 8000. Turkes by another way. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe treaties at Vienna, it happened that the ſouldiours of the garriſon of Sighet went foorth vpon 200. Rhatians, which they put to the ſword, and tooke two Agaes their Captaines: and as they returned to their garriſon with their priſoners, there ſet vpon them 200. horſe, who enuironed and charged them in ſuch ſort that they brake them, and purſued them ſo
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21983:154"/>
fiercely, that of 600. which they were, there was no more but 200. ſaued. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> This happened in the abſence of Captaine <hi>Nicholas Eſdrim</hi> Counte of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, <note place="margin">Nicholas Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim Counte of Serin.</note> who then was gone to the Court about ſome vrgent affayres of his own: and it is to be thought that his preſence would haue hindered ſuch diſtaſter. As for Sachmar, which was halfe burned, and altogether abandoned by the <note place="margin">Sachmar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed.</note> Tranſiluanians, <hi>Schuendy</hi> cauſed it to bee repayred, iudging that that place would bring him ſome commoditie for many conſiderations. In the meane time, whileſt his ſouldiours did daily labour to make it defencible, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies came towards that quarter to take a Caſtle thereby, and which was a very fit place greatly to annoy thoſe of Sachmar. Againſt thoſe, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes of the ſaid place of Sachmar going forth with great ſilence, ſuddenly charged their enemies, and they tooke from them 7. Enſignes, after they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> maſſacred the greateſt part of them, and the reſt being almoſt drowned in the riuer, into the which they threw themſelues headlong inconſideratiuely by heapes to ſaue themſelues.</p>
            <p>Sachmar being reeſtabliſhed, and <hi>Eraſmus Meiger</hi> left there within to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, <hi>Schuendy</hi> tooke the way to Caſſouia, hauing ſome diſtruſt that the Turkes would come thither to beſiege it, as there was ſome apparance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and ſeeing that the forces of the Turke daily increaſed, he importunately ſolicited the Emperour to ſend him new ſuccours, not finding himſelfe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of that which was needfull for him to the entertainment of ſuch a warre, and againſt ſo puiſſant an enemie. The Emperour ſent him fiue En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of footmen, of whom was Colonell <hi>Iohn Bernard Rothman,</hi> with fiue peeces of Artillerie, all the horſes being marked with the letter <hi>M.</hi> to the end <note place="margin">A complot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors of the Artillerie.</note> that the waggoners &amp; conductors thereof ſhould not by deceit (as it is their cuſtome) ſell the good ones, or to vſe them to ſome other purpoſe. In the meane time, the Turkes (who ouerranne all the countrie, and made there great ſpoyle) determined to take the Fort of Erdeu, neere to Sachmar, which then was in the commaund of <hi>Schuendy:</hi> and there hauing placed their ſiege <note place="margin">Erdeu beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Turkes.</note> in the beginning of Iune, they made there many a ſhot againſt it, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they reared the ladders to enter by force. The aſſieged defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues valiantly, and often repulſing their enemies, they killed more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 800. of them: and fiercely ſallying forth vpon them, they brought away two peeces of their Artillerie. Neuertheleſſe, the Turks not any thing aſtoniſhed thereat, but continuing the batterie more obſtinately, in ſuch ſort that before the powder failed them, they made a great breach in the wall. Captaine <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemberg,</hi> who commaunded in this place, ſeeing the obſtinacie of the Turks, ſent many times to demaund ſuccour of <hi>Schuendy.</hi> He diſpatched towards him 300. ſouldiours: and conſidering it was not poſſibly that they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without great daunger, willing neuertheleſſe to aſſay ſome meanes which he had inuented to put them in, at what price ſoeuer, he commaunded them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to march all the night ſpeedily and without noyſe vnto a forreſt, which was not farre from Erdeu, and where were placed the guards of the Turkiſh Campe: and as for himſelfe, marching with the like diligence, he came to another quarter, from whence ſuddenly he gaue the alarme to the enemies Campe, who preſently were frighted at this vnlooked for comming: and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21983:154"/>
vpon this rumour the Turkes failed not readily to raunge themſelues vnder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their Enſignes, drawing all to that place from whence came the noyſe of the enemies Drummes and Trumpets: and in the meane time by this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, the ſuccour which was vpon their watch, had commoditie to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place. This ſuccour being entered, the aſſieged were more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and regarded nothing, although that the ſiege continued more then a moneth. The Turkes notwithſtanding hotly purſuing the ſiege, procured much trauaile to the aſſieged, and there amongſt others was wounded <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemberg.</hi> A little before there entered a valiant and very expert Captaine named <hi>Weller,</hi> to ſecond <hi>Laubemberg,</hi> and to commaund in his place, if any miſhap ſhould befall him. With <hi>Weller</hi> there was alſo entered Captaine <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> who, in fighting valiantly there dyed. Theſe couragiouſly defending themſelues, maintained it a long time againſt the enemie, who alſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſiege with a like courage, daily came to the walls to giue aſſaults: and hauing one night filled the Ditch with faggots, vpon the day following to mount more eaſily to the breach, the aſſieged did carefully lay good ſtore of Cannon powder vpon and vnder the wood. The morning being come, the Turkes comming into the Ditch, with a hope to carrie the place at that time, and the fire alſo ſuddenly taking hold of theſe faggots, by the meanes of certaine ſulphured Darts and burning Lances amongſt the powder, with which this wood was ſeaſoned, preſently was ſeene in the ayre a great flame, which wholly broke the enemies enterpriſe, thoſe remaining there burnt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> who thought to haue gotten the firſt honour, or beſt bootie, and were come thither too ſoone for themſelues. The others retired to their Trenches, but not from the ſiege: but on the contrarie they were ſo ſelfe-willed, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their batterie to continue day and night, the Fortreſſe was ſeene all open without any defence, although the aſſieged did all their endeuour. In fine, theſe ſeeing themſelues a pray, and certainly iudging that there was no more hope to maintaine themſelues, as well for want of victuals, as men, as alſo by reaſon of the infection and horrible ſtinke which proceeded from the fleſh of the Turkes dead bodies that remained in the Ditch, they came to parley, and the 4. of Auguſt they yeelded to the enemies, the Captaines remaining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> priſoners, who alſo preſently were conducted to Buda, and from thence to <note place="margin">Erdeu yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Turkes by compoſition.</note> Conſtantinople. Captaine <hi>Weller</hi> ſeeing they ſpake to yeeld, choſe rather to dye fighting, then to come vnder the puiſſance and diſcretion of the Turks: this his reſolution was followed by many other ſouldiours. The Emperour hauing had newes of this loſſe, and ſeeing that the treatie of peace which was on foote produced not any good, commanded <hi>Schuendy</hi> that he ſhould well munition all the places, for feare of being ſurpriſed. And for this effect his Maieſtie ſent him other troupes, as well Caualarie as Infantrie, while in the meane time at Vienna, he cauſed to be celebrated the funerall pomps in honour of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his father, where was the Duke <hi>Alphonſe</hi> of Ferrara. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> After which, he cauſed to bee throwne amongſt the people certaine peeces of ſiluer, and other things of value, in token of largeſſe, vſing many other cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies to the people.</p>
            <p>And his Maieſtie being now diſcharged from theſe ceremonies, his mind
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21983:155"/>
was altogether attentiue to the warre which the Tranſiluanian made againſt him, being furthered and ſuccoured by the forces of the Turkes: and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it, he cauſed then to be aſſembled all his men of warre, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Caualarie at Theſchin, cauſing them to march from thence to <hi>Schuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> whom he found at that time buſied againſt the inhabitants of Debrezen the Emperour ſubiects, being greatly moued againſt thoſe, becauſe that for feare of the Turke they had many times giuen victuals to the enemies. To chaſtiſe them from ſuch cowardlines, without giuing notice thereof vnto <note place="margin">Debrezen burned by the Emperials.</note> them, he marched towards them with his armie: and hauing ſurpriſed them, he firſt cauſed the towne to be ſacked, and after that he fiered it, reducing all into aſhes. The veſſels and ornaments were carried to Tocchay, from thence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> he tooke his way towards Moncat, belonging to <hi>Iohn.</hi> About this place the Emperours armie many times was badly intreated, the garriſon therof bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeazing vpon the Sutlers of the armie, whom they pilled, robbed, and lead away. <hi>Schuendy</hi> to reuenge himſelfe vpon them, laid an Ambuſcado, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faining a skirmiſh, drew them to the fight, and by little and little retiring thence, he cauſed them to fall into the place where he deſired they might be, and by this meanes he had ſome reuenge of them, the moſt part of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining dead in the field, the leſſer part being ſaued by flight. <hi>Schuendy</hi> vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious with the ſpoyles of his enemies, retired to Sachmar. In which place, by reaſon of diuers accidens, there happened ſo many maladies among the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſouldiours and inhabitants, that daily increaſing, they were conſtrained to goe into the fields and forſake the towne. Vpon this occaſion <hi>Schuendy</hi> went and incamped by Tibiſcus, fortifying himſelfe with many Trenches. But he was not long in this lodging, before he was ſurpriſed with a very ſore fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which tormented him many moneths, not without great diſquietnes to the Emperour, who greatly loued him, hauing iuſt cauſe ſo to doe, repoſing himſelfe wholly vpon him, for the experience which he knew to be in him for the affayres of warre.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding that in Tranſiluania the warre proceeded on in this ſort, the treatie of peace was alwaies managed at Conſtanſtinople. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the Emperour well foreſeeing that this negotiation was but onely to hold him in ſuſpence, while the Grand Seigniour in other places diſpoſed his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres: and being further aſcertained by <hi>Cornouuicchy</hi> (who was but come from the Turkes Court, that gentleman alſo aſſuring that they ſhould not hope for any peace, although that after his departure there was giuen him ſome hope thereof) his Maieſtie commaunded that his armie might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and appointed that 5. Enſignes of Germane Infantrie ſhould muſter at Lepanto, and 300. Vallachians at Poſſon, and 300. Hungariſh horſe about Iauerin. All theſe companies were newly leauied. Theſe (after muſter was taken of them) were charged to march into the field: to which did alſo goe Captaine <hi>Adam Iula,</hi> and <hi>Romer</hi> a Knight of Malta, with fiue other Enſignes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of foote. To theſe ioyned foure Enſignes of Germane horſe, and Captaine <hi>Derſsi</hi> with 300. other ſouldiours. With this ſupplie was furniſhed all the principal places.

But he hauing notice of this attempt, prepared for them an Ambuſcado, which was lodged ſo ſecretly in a forreſt by, that the Turks not doubting any thing thereof, came iuſt vpon it, and being ſuddenly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they preſently put themſelues in route, there remaining notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the place no leſſe then 4000. not without daunger alſo that all had been loſt there, if the night had not fauoured the ſlight of thoſe who were beſt mounted, as alſo it greatly ſerued to the Emperials to make their retraict ſafe and ſound into their Campe, after ſuch a checke giuen.</p>
            <p>The Turkiſh Caualarie paſſed further, and preſented themſelues before the walls of Iauerin, and for that it was yet night, it was not permitted to thoſe within to goe forth: but the day being come, and the garriſon ſallying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> out of their ports, the Turkes preſently retired. While theſe skirmiſhes and enterpriſes were attempted one againſt another, <hi>Graſſuen</hi> (a Captaine of 100. Hungariſh horſe) encountring 1000. Turks, and both the one and the other betaking themſelues to their hands, 200. Turkes loſt there their liues, among which was the Gouernour of Lippa, called in their language Beg. Thoſe who were wounded with the ſhot of the Harquebuze, being conducted to the Campe, could not auoyde death, for that the bullets were beſmeared <note place="margin">Bullets an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with fat cauſe death.</note> with larde. In the meane while the Saxon ſouldiours hearing this skirmiſh, were deſirous to goe forth: but their Generall would not permit them, but hindered them with much adoe. Theſe were onely arriued at the Campe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> well armed, vnder Colonell <hi>Henry Glaſenthal,</hi> who had for his companion <hi>Don Sibotendorf,</hi> both men of valour and incomparable boldnes. Betweene them there were 1026. horſe, which were payed by the Elector of Saxonie for fiue moneths. To theſe were ioyned 350. horſe, who followed the Camp at their owne charges. The two armies were incamped no further one from another then a mile, the Emperials being lodged vpon Tibiſcus by a village named Kizar, ſituated vpon the ſhore of the riuer, in the houſes wherof were lodged the principals of the Campe, the whole being fortified with ſtrong Trenches. That of the Turkes was planted beneath the ſaid riuer, and they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had made a bridge vpon the riuer Somos.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Charles</hi> the Archduke of Auſtria being in Stiria, had his people in the field againſt the enemie, who had committed great ſpoyle in the countrie, if that Prince had not remedied it. On the other ſide, the Baſha of Boſſina, the Gouernour of Boſchegne, and the Berbatberg being one day
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21983:156"/>
aſſembled to ouerrunne Slauonia, and to carrie away the countrie people, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hauing encountred <hi>Peter Eborce Ban,</hi> which ſignifieth Gouernour, the charge was ſo hot, that the Turkes were put to ſlight with great ſlaughter of them, which was ſaid to haue been 5000. and the Berbatberg was there ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>In another place 320. Turkes minding in the night to aſſaile Thrin, the Caualarie of <hi>Iaques Sach,</hi> with certaine Hungariſh footmen, being gone forth to meete them, killed vpon the place 60. of them, and tooke 65. others of them priſoners.</p>
            <p>During theſe rough skirmiſhes, on the other ſide they treated of peace at <note place="margin">A continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the treatie of peace.</note> Vienna, there being yet the foreſaid Ambaſſadours. And the Emperour cauſed to be called thither the gentlemen of Hungarie, to conſult with them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vpon the points of agreement which were propounded. And whereas <hi>Schuendy</hi> could not be rid of his ſicknes, the Emperour ſent to him <hi>Paul Veid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> a Doctor of Phiſicke, an excellent man in his profeſſion. This man of a <note place="margin">Paul Veidner a Phiſition, of a Iew became a Chriſtian.</note> Iew became a Chriſtian. <hi>Schuendy</hi> notwithſtanding his want of health, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got nothing of that which appertained for the entertainment of his armie, ſeeing that the Turkes deſiſted not from their courſes, and to prouoke ours to fight with new iniuries. The Emperials on their behalfe did no leſſe. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion there was betweene them and vs a fierce encounter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were many Turkes ſlaine, and of the principall of the enemies, of whom the bodies were fauourably rendered by <hi>Schuendy</hi> to thoſe who to demaund <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> them, were ſent to him by the enemie.</p>
            <p>At another time, as certaine ſouldiours were gone with waggons to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to bring ſtraw and oates, they were taken by certaine Turkes who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred them. This robberie was then done, when a Chiauſs was arriued at the Campe, who was ſent by the Turke to continue the treatie of peace begun. <hi>Schuendy</hi> requeſted him that he ſhould procure to be rendered vnto him his ſouldiours and baggage which the Turkes had taken, telling him further, that this kinde of dealing did not manifeſt any ſignes nor effects of peace. The Chiauſs anſwered him, that he ſhould preſently ſend ſome troupes after to recouer that which was taken, it being not the intention of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> his Prince to breake the agreements of peace. Vpon this anſwer, <hi>Schuendy</hi> cauſed preſently to mount on horſebacke Captaine <hi>Ruebert</hi> with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of light horſe, to buſie and entertaine the Turkes, and to doe ſo much, that they might not retire vntill he were ſeconded by others which ſhould follow him. The diligence was ſo great both of the one and of the other, that hauing ouertaken the enemies, they had all their waggons which were on this ſide the bridge: but thoſe who had alreadie paſſed the bridge, ended their voyage in ſafetie. This recouerie ſo braue and ſuddenly executed, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Turkes to remoue their Campe, which was neere to the Emperials, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> who alſo did the like, marching towards Caſſouia, that they might more commodiouſly haue victuals, which began to faile in their Campe: beſides that, the ſouldiours were greatly troubled by diuers ſickneſſes: and amongſt other, with bloodie fluxes and peſtilent feauers. A little before the Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanian alſo was retired, and hauing put his people to winter in garriſons, he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:21983:156"/>
retired into his kingdome, where hauing found that ſome of his ſubiects <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and inhabitants ſecretly fauoured <hi>Maximilian,</hi> he cauſed them all to bee hanged.</p>
            <p>At that time was releaſed from Vienna his Ambaſſadour (who was retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Ambaſſadours are not to be retained for and in place of priſoners taken in the warre.</note> there longer then he was willing) at the inſtance of <hi>Ballaſsi,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually importuned the Emperor not to ſuffer him to depart vntil he had his wife and children, who were carried away at the taking of Sachmar. But this Ambaſſadour complaining of his detaining, his Maieſtie meant not that he ſhould be any longer detained againſt his liking, ſaying, that that would be a breach and violence offered againſt the law of nations, it being not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to vſe ſuch reuenge for priſoners taken by the right of warre. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the ſame conſideration was alſo ſent backe <hi>Alexander Kendy</hi> Secretarie to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who iournying towards his maſters Ambaſſadour, was taken in a skirmiſh made againſt certaine Tranſiluanians, who conducted him and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to bring him into ſome place of ſuretie, and who being thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, had been led to Vienna by <hi>Iohn Wolgazen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time, <hi>Schuendy</hi> vigilant in his charge, did not ceaſe to ſolicite the Emperour to this, that it would pleaſe him to appoint new companies and ſupplies, although the enemie laboured peace, ſhewing him by liuely reaſons that the practiſes of the Turke were onely but in appearance, and to couer his enterpriſes and deſeignes, knowing that he daily made new lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies of men, to aſſaile the armie of his Maieſtie with the greateſt force hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> could. The Commaunders of the Turkiſh armie knowing the diſtruſt that this great Captaine had of their ſubtelties, writ to him a letter, by which they ſent him word, that they greatly marueiled at him that he would trouble the peace, which was treated of betweene theſe two moſt puiſſant Emperours, which would bring to them both great commoditie. But <hi>Schuendy</hi> alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as little credit to their words as to their ſubtelties, ceaſed not (with the principals of the armie) to embrace all the occaſions that might be offered, for the ſeruice of his Prince.</p>
            <p>Vpon this reſolution, Counte <hi>Ecchia</hi> of Salm (a moſt renowned Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) ſeeing himſelfe to haue command ouer a good number of ſouldiours, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was departed from Iauerin the 12. of October, and tooke the way to Albere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis, <note place="margin">Counte Salm enterpriſeth vpon Albere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis.</note> named in the language of that countrie Stulweijſſuburg, diſtant eight Germane miles from the place from whence he came, being certainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed that in this towne there was few men for the defence thereof, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this want eaſily to take it. And as he was but three miles from thence, came a Courier ſent from the Emperour, bringing him expreſſe commaund to returne with his people to Iauerin. The Counte ſorie at the heart, left his voyage, with great diſcontentment of all thoſe who followed him, for the good opinion which they all had to ſee themſelues at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by reaſon of the few ſouldiours which they knew to be in this towne. A ſecret intelligence which the Counte had with the Iudge of this place, gaue them an aſſured hope of victorie, and the rather becauſe that the Iudge (for aſſurance of his faith) had giuen his wife and children in hoſtage, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen order that in the night one part of the Artillerie ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21983:157"/>
and the reſt choked, to the end that the Turkes ſhould not therewith at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> neede ſerue themſelues, and in the morning as they droue the cattell forth to paſture, the Counte with his people ſhould giue the aſſault to the ports of the towne, and if the Turks (who were but few in number) ſhould put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in defence, the citizens preſently ſhould bandie againſt them, and by that meanes the towne ſhould haue been taken without any great reſiſtance. This exployt being thus giuen ouer by the commaund of the Emperour, there was a good occaſion loſt to recouer this place, which was of ſo great importance. The Iudge ſaued himſelfe at Pallota, fearing his perſon, ſeeing the Emperials had failed in their practiſe. The Turkes hauing diſcouered this enterpriſe, cauſed 40. inhabitants of the towne to bee pitched vpon ſtakes, among which were compriſed many innocent of the fact. This exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> was hindred, becauſe that at that time was earneſtly treated the peace with the Ambaſſadours, who for that purpoſe were come to Vienna: and indeede his Maieſtie had ſent to the Grand Seigniour for Ambaſſadour <hi>George Hoſſute,</hi> Councellor of the King in the chamber of Hungarie, a man <note place="margin">George Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour for Maxilian to the Turke.</note> of good vnderſtanding, and conuerſant in the affayres of Princes. Vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion whereof, it ſeemed not good to the Emperour to raiſe any trouble, vntill it was ſeene what end theſe things would take, which euery one loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon in hope of agreement: and for the ſame conſideration, he had alſo commaunded that not any ſhould moleſt the Turkes, and that onely they ſhould reſt themſelues vpon their defence. This Ambaſſadour departing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> from the Court, led with him 20. Turkes of good regard, who had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the warre a little before, and were priſoners in the cuſtodie of diuers Hungariſh Lords. Being all arriued at Buda, the Baſha receiued them with much honour, and great ſports, and gaue them ſafe conduct. This negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace was the cauſe that <hi>Augustus</hi> the Elector and Duke of Saxonie countermaunded his Caualarie, ſince that vpon the firme hope which was had of the peace, he ſaw that it ſerued to no purpoſe in Hungarie. In like ſort many other Captaines and Germane ſouldiours were diſmiſſed by his Maieſtie, thinking that they ſhould not haue any more to doe. But within a while after ſuch companies were greatly deſired againe, the neceſſitie being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> come to make new leauies of men: for that the Turkes deſiſted not from their ordinarie courſes, and greatly to endamage the countrie, daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing new forces. A good part of theſe came and laid ſiege before Newſtat, <note place="margin">Newſtat taken by the Turks.</note> and incloſed thoſe who were within, in ſuch ſort, that the Captaine, named <hi>Gleſmuner,</hi> appointed for the guard of this place, ſeeing he could not defend it, did yeeld it to the enemie, departing foorth with his ſouldiours with a white ſtaffe in his hand. By and by after this place was regained againe by the Emperials, and againe loſt, and finally recouered: ſo that at this day it is in the Emperours commaund. The Turks of another part forraging euen to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Iauerin, led 800. head of cattell, which preſently was recouered by the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Dersfi</hi> (Gouernour of Nitria) ſeeing the Turks ouerrunning the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and to approach nigh him, went forth, and affronting the enemie, on a ſudden cut many of them in peeces, and led with him in his retraict two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaes priſoners, which are two of the principall Captaines of the Ianiſaries.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21983:157"/>
A little before was alſo taken a Turke by Sighet, who was come to ſpie this and other places of the countrie. This man being brought before the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <hi>Charles,</hi> among other things aſſured him, that his Lord would come in perſon into Hungarie, and that within a little time Sighet and Iula ſhould be by him beſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

Counte Salm had alſo taken cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other Spies, which aſſured him the like. Another Turke named <hi>Scafir Vayda,</hi> chiefe Councellor of the Baſha of Buda, and well knowne among all the Hungars to bee a man of ſingular vertue in the managing of warre, was taken, and diſcourſing with <hi>Francis Peſthy,</hi> had confirmed the ſpeech and confeſſion of the others: ſo that he ſaw not any more hope of peace or truce, but all appearance of warre.

And through all Auſtria he cauſed to be publiſhed, that not any ſhould ſell either wine or corne out of the countrie, and that which was alreadie ſold, and yet not being tranſported, ſhould be retained. He ſent to Sighet for the defence of that place certaine Bohemians and Hungars, with 600. ſouldiours, of whom were Captaines a Vicount of Millan, and a Germane Lord. He alſo diſpatched commiſſions to Captaines to leauie new companies of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours.

Conſtance is vnder the King of the Romanes, and many other vnder diuers Princes. All theſe Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and Secular Princes, and free townes, appeare at theſe Diets publiſhed by the Emperours commaund, who, in that he cannot abſolutely command them, procureth theſe aſſemblies, to the end that in them he might aduiſe what were profitable and beneficiall for all in generall. At theſe Diets as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> there is three Eſtates, who are there, ſo alſo doe they make three ſeuerall <note place="margin">The policie which is held at the Diets.</note> Councels. In the firſt come none but the ſixe Electors: into the other both the Eccleſiaſticall and Secular Princes: and into the third, among all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots of the Empire there entereth no more but two, and among all the Counts and Barons two others: and alſo there enter thereinto the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of the free townes. To all of them is propounded by the Emperour, or by the King of the Romanes, all that which he thinketh of to be decided: and euery Councel diuided and retired apart, determineth vpon that which hath been propounded. It is true that the townes ſpeake not their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but by the voyce of the Councell, not hauing any voyce for reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe States were thus aſſembled by <hi>Maximilian</hi> in the towne of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, to the end to draw from them in ſo great and vrgent occaſion, the ayde and ſuccours which hee thought neceſſarie for generall good, and as his predeceſſors had obtained and gotten in time paſt vpon like occurran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And to the end that by his example all the aſſembled ſhould vſe more diligence, he was the firſt that went to the Diet, well knowing that ſlacknes herein would bring imminent daunger, and that the Turk with great prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude prepared his forces to come and charge him. And although it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hardly to be beleeued that <hi>Solyman</hi> being ſo old and diſeaſed, would himſelf in perſon execute this enterpriſe: yet neuertheleſſe the great preparations which he made, were ſuch, that they gaue ſufficient occaſion to think that there was ſomething in hand. Therefore dutie and neceſſitie required, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſhould at leaſt be prepared to defend himſelfe from the violence
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21983:159"/>
of his enemie. Being then arriued at Ausbourg, he ſolicited the Electors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and other Princes and States of Germanie to make ſpeede to come thither. But at the beginning, theſe Princes alleadged ſome lets, which hindered and retained them backe. The principall excuſe was grounded vpon the warre which was betweene the Kings of Denmark and Sweden, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Kings of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</note> there were brewed in the confines of the territories and countries of the one and of the other, many practiſes. And it ſeemed that vpon this occaſion this Diet ſhould either be wholly diſſolued, or at the leaſt deferred vntill an other time, without ordaining any other thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe tumults of warre were a little before ſtirred vp betweene two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Dukes of Michelbourg in Saxonie for the towne of Roſtoch, which being poſſeſſed with great forces by the eldeſt ſonne, was beſieged by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> yonger. The one was fauoured by the King of Denmarke, for that he was of his alliance, and the other was ſuccoured by the King of Sweden, who with fayre promiſes and money entertained theſe Princes in warre, with policie alwaies to hold the Prouince in trouble. The Emperour ſeeing that theſe warres brought great hurt to his enterpriſes, and great preiudice to the Empire, ſent to theſe two Princes certaine Lords of his Court, to ſignifie to them that they ſhould grow to agreement. This negotiation was ſo well managed, that within a little time all was pacified, to the praiſe of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and to the good and quiet of the countrie. This accord ſucceeding thus to effect, the Emperour alſo purpoſed to accord theſe two Kings. He of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Sweden thanking his Maieſtie, for ſo good an affection which he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <note place="margin">The King of Sweden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Emperour Maximilian.</note> to the peace and vniuerſall tranquilitie, offered to ſubmit himſelfe to all honeſt and reaſonable conditions. And for this effect he diſpatched to the Emperour the Duke of Pomeraine, and Duke <hi>Iohn Frederic</hi> of Saxonie his vncle by the mothers ſide, to whom he committed all his rights and titles to decide them with <hi>Maximilian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other difficultie (which held certaine Princes Electors not to come to this Diet) was by reaſon of a certaine contention ſtirred vp betweene two other brothers Dukes of Viuaria, ſonnes in law to the Palatin, becauſe of the diuiſion of their ſtates and lands, and ſpecially for certaine ſtrong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which were in the gouernment of the eldeſt ſonne, with euident loſſe of the yonger: for that of three brothers the laſt being dead, the other two, which were <hi>Iohn Frederic,</hi> &amp; <hi>William,</hi> being accorded, now the eldeſt hauing begun to manage the eſtate of him that was dead one whole yeere toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one after another, and gouerned by the ſpace of the limited time, would not neuertheleſſe yeeld to his brother, being moued with the ſweetnes of commaund. The Elector Palatin was greatly buſied to accord them, as alſo was the Elector of Saxonie, who had been requeſted thereunto by the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin: and to accompliſh it, they did meete together at Lipſia, where the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> younger brother was preſent. And for that in their allegations there were ſhewed many difficulties, which could not eaſily be reſolued, the whole was remitted to the Diet. On the otherſide, <hi>Philip</hi> Lantgraue of Heſſe excuſed himſelfe that he could not be at this aſſemblie, becauſe of the nuptials of one of his ſonnes with the Duke of Wirtembergs daughter. This very ſubiect
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21983:159"/>
hindered 13. other Proteſtant Princes from being there, inſomuch that for this occaſion the beginning of this Diet was proroged. They celebrated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> theſe nuptials at Maſpurg, and by reaſon of the aſſembly of ſo many Princes, <note place="margin">Proteſtant Princes in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, for that he had changed his religion.</note> the Emperour was greatly troubled to know what diſcourſe they would vſe therein, fearing leaſt ſuch a reſort would bring ſome alteration in the affayres of religion, which would hinder his proceedings againſt the Turke. That which made his Maieſtie moſt of all to diſtruſt, was, that euery one knew wel enough that all theſe Princes had done their beſt endeuour to reduce the Count Palatin (who leauing the Confeſſion of Ausbourg, had taken the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Geneua) not preuailing any thing with him thereby. Theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were <hi>Philip</hi> Lantgraue of Heſſe, with <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> his children; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Duke of Hulſt; <hi>Herneſt</hi> Duke of Brunſwick; <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> Duke of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, father of the married, and two of his children, and two of the Count Palatin; <hi>Wolfang</hi> Palatin Duke of Bipont, with his ſonne; and <hi>Iohn George</hi> ſonne of the Marqueſſe of Brandeburg, who for the indiſpoſition and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his father returned preſently to him.</p>
            <p>Theſe affayres held the Emperours minde in great ſuſpence, in vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting theſe Princes at Ausbourg, hauing none with him but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, the Duke of Bauier with the Dutches, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her ſonne: and ſo much the more did it torment him, for that he daily heard the bruites to increaſe of <hi>Solymans</hi> preparation: and alſo he had certaine notice that the Tranſiluanian leauied men, in ſuch ſort that he was out of all doubt, but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the next yeere he ſhould haue all the warre vpon his ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>The Princes of Germanie vnderſtanding this newes, and ſeeing they could not be at the Diet ſo ſoone as their dutie required, ſent their Deligates to the Emperour, with entire authoritie to negotiate in their name, vntill they could finde the meanes to come themſelues in perſon to the Diet. But the Emperour would not begin any thing, deſiring the preſence of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſuch important affayres. For this cauſe he often ſent to them meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon meſſenger.</p>
            <p>They negotiated at the ſame time with his Maieſtie an alliance with the <note place="margin">A negotiation for the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Charles the 9. King of France.</note> King of France, and for the proſecuting of this, there came to the Court the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Biſhop of Remes, who hauing left there his Agent and Secretarie, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into France, with determination to returne very quickly.</p>
            <p>As the Emperour ſearched all the meanes to defend himſelfe from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of Polonia on the other ſide endeuoured to make an <note place="margin">Sigiſmond King of Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia hindered by the Duke of Muſcouia from making peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Emperour and King Iohn.</note> accord betweene him and King <hi>Iohn</hi> his nephew. But this good worke was diſſwaded and drawne backe, to the great damage of Chriſtendome, this Prince being conſtrained to employ all his thoughts for the defence of his countrie againſt the Duke of Muſcouia, who notwithſtanding the peace made betweene them, had taken away a part of Liuonia. The Bohemians and Hungars in the meane while by their King ſolicited the Emperour, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to ayde him in this warre, according to the neceſſitie and their abilities. As much alſo did the Kings of Denmarke and Sweden promiſe him, who had referred all their differences into his hands.</p>
            <p>By theſe practiſes his Maieſtie alwaies diſpatched ſomething tending to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:21983:160"/>
the end of his intention, expecting the execution of this Diet, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be confirmed by the preſence of all the Orders and States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> for which neuertheleſſe there was not any thing done of a long time; during which, Shrofetide was come. Many Lords of the Court (to make it appeare that they were not amazed for the newes which ranne of the Turks menaces) forgot not to ſolemnize this day (after the accuſtomed manner) with mummeries and pleaſant ſports. In the end, the Lords began to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Diet, and the firſt that came thither was the Marqueſſe of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debourg: but he againe falling ſicke by the way, was conſtrained to returne, <note place="margin">The Princes of the Empire arriued at the Diet.</note> and ſent thither his ſonne <hi>George,</hi> and his nephewes with 300. horſe, with commiſſion not to ſtirre from the Court, vntill ſome new commandement. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> There alſo arriued the Elector of Mentz, whom the Emperour went to meet halfe a mile out of the towne, and very curteouſly accompanied him euen <note place="margin">The Emperor went to meete the Elector of Mentz.</note> to his lodging. At the ſame time came thither Cardinall <hi>Commendon,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come thither in poſt ſent from the Pope: but in the ſtate of a priuate man at the firſt, vntill ſuch time as within a while after there came thither <hi>Iohn An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Calligny</hi> his Auditor, with the Croſſe, and authoritie of Legate. This man was very well receiued and entertained by the Emperour, there being no other in the Popes name of ſuch qualitie, although two other Cardinals were there preſent, to wit, he of Ausbourg, and he of Altemps, who were there as Princes of the Empire. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time the Emperour conſidering the importance of this warre, beſides the ſuccours which he hoped from the Empire, meant alſo to haue obtained ſome other of the Pope: and to accompliſh it, he gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion therefore to <hi>Rumiler</hi> his Chamberlaine, whom he ſent to Rome to congratulate with the Pope, who was newly come to the Pontificall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in like manner to require ayde and ſuccours for the warre of Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The Pope very willingly promiſed him all fauour, aſſigning him 50000. <note place="margin">Succours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope to the Emperor.</note> crownes by yeere, and then ſending him two payes, whereof the laſt was carried by the Lord of Billy, who went towards his Maieſtie, in the place of a Nuncio. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
            </p>
            <p>During this Lent, <hi>Maximilian</hi> often going to Sermons and Maſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of his predeceſſors, gaue proofe that he was very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. Going to theſe deuotions, the Proteſtants forebore not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie <note place="margin">The manner of Proteſtant Princes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Emperour to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church.</note> him, but at his entrie they retired apart, attending vntill Maſſe was ſaid, to conduct him againe in his Palace: in which he often feaſted them with royall banquets, there being aſſembled the Eccleſiaſticall and Secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and being there together, they were ſet euery one at the table accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their degrees and qualities.</p>
            <p>Seeing this falleth out ſo fitly to our purpoſe, it ſhall not bee a ſtrange, but rather a pleaſant thing for the beautifying of the hiſtorie, if I write the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">The place and office of the Electors in publike acts.</note> of the placing of theſe Electors at ſuch feaſts, and eſpecially in thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which are ſolemne, and doe depend of great Emperial ceremonies, in which the Emperour, or the King of the Romanes, ſolemnely holding their Court, the Princes Electors are to execute their offices and charges. In this caſe the order is thus. The Emperour, or King of the Romanes ſitting in his Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21983:160"/>
throne, the Duke of Saxonie beginneth firſt to execute his office in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſort. Before the erection of the Emperiall ſeate is laid a great heape of oates, of ſuch heigth that it may touch the breaſt of the horſe, vpon which the Duke ſhall be mounted, he holding in his hand a ſiluer ſtaffe, and alſo a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſiluer, they both weighing 12. markes, and vpon his horſe there is ſet (taken from this heape) a meaſure of oates, and is giuen to the chiefe groome of the ſtable, who muſt bee preſent: and that being done, and he fixing his ſtaffe within the heape, his Vicemarſhall of Papenhein (or ſome other exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this charge in his abſence) being Marſhall of the Court, diſtributeth the reſt of the oates. The Emperour, or the King being entered into his hall, and there ſet at the table, the Eccleſiaſticall Electors being ſomewhat below, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and ſtanding before it, with the other Prelates, muſt (according to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner) ſay grace, euery one according to his place: to wit, euery one according to the antiquitie of his conſecration in the Archiepiſcopall dignitie. One alone neuertheleſſe ſaieth grace for that day: &amp; the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if the ceremonie continueth) the ſecond that is conſecrated to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour doth it: and on the third day, the third bleſſeth the table. Grace being ended, theſe three Archbiſhop Electors take the Emperiall ſeales from the hand of the Chancellors of the Court: and he (in the Archchancellorſhip of whom this ceremonie and ſolemnitie is vſed) going in the middeſt, and the two other being of each hand, they all three raiſe with their hands a ſtaffe, at which are hanging the Seales, and in this ſort they reuerently carrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it before the Emperour, laying them vpon the table. The Emperour, or the King doe preſently redeliuer them to them againe, and he who then is in his Archchancellorie taketh the greateſt of theſe Seales, and keepeth it till din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be done, hanging it about his neck, vntill he returneth to his owne lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſtaffe with which they carrie theſe Seales is of ſiluer, and weigheth twelue markes. The price thereof, as well for the ſubſtance as for the faſhion of it, is at the charges of the three Archbiſhops, and is giuen within a while after by them with the Seales to the Chancellors of the Court, to doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with what they pleaſe. He of thoſe three that ſhall carrie to his lodging the great Seale hanging about his necke, ſhall preſently ſend it backe by one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his ſeruants to the Chancellor of the Court on horſeback, which horſe ſhall remaine to the ſaid Chancellor for a gift.</p>
            <p>After that, the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg (great Chamberlaine) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth riding, carrying in his hand ſiluer baſons weighing twelue markes, and water, with a fayre towell: and afterwards lighting from his horſe, he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Emperour or the King to waſh.</p>
            <p>Count Palatin of Rhein doth in like ſort enter on horſebacke, holding in his hand foure ſiluer diſhes, euery one weighing three marks, wherein there is meate, who being diſmounted, he ſetteth it vpon the table before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Afterwards alſo commeth on horſebacke the King of Bohemia the chiefe Taſter, carrying in his hand a napkin, and a ſiluer cup couered, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twelue markes, full of wine mixed with water: and after being deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his horſe, he preſenteth it to the Emperour to drinke. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all theſe ſiluer veſſels, the office being ended by theſe Secular Lords,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21983:161"/>
the Vicechamberlaine of Falkenſtein hath the Marqueſſes horſe and baſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which he preſents: the maſter of the kitchin of Noremberg hath the horſe and the diſhes of the Count: the Vicetaſter of Lymbourg hath to his vſe the horſe, and the cup of the King of Bohemia: the Vicemarſhall of Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hein hath the horſe, ſtaffe, and the meaſure of the Duke. The Emperiall table is raiſed higher by ſixe foote then the other: and thereat (during ſuch ſolemne daies) no man doth ſit but the Emperour. Neere his is that of the Empreſſe lower then the Emperours by three foote, and three foote higher then thoſe of the Electors, for which there is 7. cubbords, to wit, three on the right hand of the Emperours table, and three on the left hand, and the laſt is right againſt the Emperour. At thoſe alſo doe not any ſit but the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Electors: and euery one of thoſe ſtand before his owne table, vntill all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> haue accompliſhed that which they ought to doe by their office, as we haue ſet downe, and then afterwards euery one ſitteth downe at his owne table. The Archbiſhop of Treuers hath for his table that which is before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. The firſt table on the right ſide is for one of the two other Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, in whoſe Archchancellorie this ſolemnitie is performed. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the ſame ſide is for the King of Bohemia: and the third is for the Count Palatin. The firſt of the other ranke (which is on the left hand) is for the other Archbiſhop: the ſecond is for the Duke of Saxonie: and the third and laſt belongeth to the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg. And although it bee lawfull for one of the Electors that is kept backe by ſicknes, or ſome other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> lawfull inconuenience, to ſend an Ambaſſadour, with full commiſſion in ſuch ſolemnities and aſſemblies, neuertheleſſe he who is ſent doth not ſit in the ſeate, nor in the place of his Maſter. Theſe ſolemnities ended, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Court hath for his part all the building and preparations of wood, which hath been erected for the Emperiall ſeate. Dinner being ended, and graces ſaid by him who bleſſed the table, and all theſe Princes riſing vp to conduct the Emperiall Maieſtie, the Archbiſhop of Treuers goeth alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour, and between him and the Emperour the Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie holdeth his place. On the right hand of the Duke is Count Palatin, and on the left is the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg. Of the two other Archbiſhops <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> he which is in his Archchancellorie, is placed on the rightſide of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the other is placed on the left: and behind the Emperour imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly goeth the King of Bohemia. This manner of going amongſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, is onely when in ſuch ſolemnities the Secular carrie the markes and Emperiall Enſignes, to wit, the Duke of Saxonie the Emperiall or royall Sword: Count Palatin the Globe: and the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg the Scepter. But when theſe Emperiall Enſignes are not borne, the Duke of Saxonie goeth not betweene the Emperour and the Archbiſhop of Treuers, who then immediatly preceadeth and goeth alone before his Maieſtie. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> in this caſe the other Seculars go in the ſame order which we haue ſet downe in their place. This order of placing them is ordinarily kept at the feaſts and banquets which <hi>Maximilian</hi> made to the Electors and other Princes of the Empire: but not the foreſaid ceremonies. And this order is ſo exactly obſerued, that what King ſoeuer ſhould happen to arriue in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21983:161"/>
Court, he ſhall in no ſort be permitted to goe before the King of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

            <p>Now to returne to this Diet of Ausbourg: After the Archbiſhop of Mentz, there came thither he of Colon, and alſo preſently after he of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. The Duke of Cleueland came after, and the Archbiſhop of Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, and certaine other Princes. After theſe followed the Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, who arriued honourably accompanied. After came the King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes ſonne, the Dukes of Holſtain, and Litters, with about 900. horſe. Then came thither <hi>George Frederic</hi> of Eniſpach, followed with a goodly troupe of horſe, euen then when the Emperour, at the inſtance of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Saxonie, cauſed to be impriſoned <hi>Albert Roſemberg,</hi> a ſeditious man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and a companion of <hi>Grompach,</hi> who was baniſhed the Empire.

            <p>They thus all appearing in this Diet conformable to his deſire, his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie the 26. of March cauſed them to aſſemble, and expoſed to them the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie which conſtrained him to arme himſelfe againſt the Turke, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great preparation of all ſorts of ſouldiours, was determined to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hungarie with the greateſt armie they had yet euer ſeene, with intention to beſiege Vienna, for which (becauſe it was the Emperiall ſeate, and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great importance to all the Empire and Germanie) it behoued him neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to prouide: becauſe that beſides the damage which might thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, and would proue ineuitable to euery one, they ſhould receiue infinit ſhame, when this ſhould bee deliuered vnto poſteritie, that Germanie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> being ſo puiſſant, did not in ſo imminent a daunger employ it ſelfe to giue remedie thereto in ſeaſon, and before the time of the ruine thereof. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie which, his Maieſtie had cauſed all them to bee called at this preſent in a generall aſſemblie. And for this cauſe he exhorted them to lay apart all paſſions, and onely attend to the preſent neceſſitie, and to giue a briefe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution vpon this point, which now preſſed them more then any other. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Duke of Bauier (in the name of the Emperour) propounded to the Electors and other Princes the articles which here follow.</p>
            <p>That they ſhould treate of the meanes which they ſhould keepe to chaſe <note place="margin">Demaunds of the Emperour in the Diet.</note> out the hereſies not compriſed in the peace of the Religion, and which by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it had been prohibited. That the ſuccours demaunded againſt the Turkes aſſaults ſhould be 8000. horſe, and 40000. footmen, payed for 8. moneths; and that the halfe of them ſhould be payed afterwards for 6. whole yeeres: but the whole ſhould be disburſed in money, that it might be employed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21983:162"/>
according to the vrgent affayres of the warre. That they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> touching the reformation of the Emperiall Chamber, which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed at Spire, and to cauſe to be wholly obſerued all that which ſhould be there reſolued vpon. That they ſhould procure the entertainment of peace, and the impoſitions of money, and to accord the differences which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene certaine Princes concerning their places: and beſides, that they ſhould cauſe to be brought to effect the commaund giuen in the name of the Emperour to his ſubiects, that they ſhould vtterly lay aſide their armes: and for execution thereof, there ſhould bee ſent to them one of his Maieſties Councellors, with the Captaine of Trent. This laſt article was openly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and according thereunto they diſpatched Doctor <hi>Parthin</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to the Emperour. Of all the ſaid articles, the moſt important and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> moſt neceſſarie, was that of ſuccours againſt the Turke. To this demaund it was thought, that of all the Princes there preſent, Count Palatin Elector <note place="margin">Offers of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours made to the Emperour by the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> would moſt oppoſe himſelfe for certaine conſiderations, depending vpon the end which might bee concluded touching the firſt propoſed article, which expreſſely touched him very nigh, by reaſon of the change which he had made in his religion. But euery one found himſelfe deceiued in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For this Prince was ſo readie to conſent to theſe ſuccours, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he made offer of all his power and meanes. According to his example many promiſed to march in perſon to this warre: and all the Princes made anſwer vpon this article, that they would graunt the Emperour for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> three Romane ſuccours for eight moneths: to wit, 12000. horſe. The Emperour contenting himſelfe with this offer, required onely that in ſtead of the laſt ſuccours for two yeeres and a halfe, he might haue them for three yeeres, taking eight moneths for euery yeere; deſiring them to graunt the halfe of three ſuccours before the time came. This was very willingly graunted to his Maieſtie: for which he greatly thanked all theſe Princes, and promiſed them alwaies to remember their kindnes. The other articles were alſo concluded on, and there reſted nothing elſe, but to treate of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But conſidering the time and the neceſſitie of the Empire, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to deferre this article vntill another time more commodious.</p>
            <p>After that, they ſpake of the agreements of the Kings of Sweden and Denmarke, and commaundement was giuen to them both vnder grieuous <note place="margin">Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Emperour to the Kings of Sweden and Denmarke.</note> penaltie to lay aſide armes, and it was alſo ordained that not any other Prince of the Empire ſhould giue them ſuccours. Vpon this ordinance the King of Sweden (who ſo willingly had promiſed to obey the Emperour) went back from the accord, they both preparing more egerly then before for new warre.</p>
            <p>There was alſo foure Ambaſſadours who came thither on the behalfe of the 13. Cantons of Switzes, and of thoſe foure 3. were Catholikes, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The Switzes ſend to the Diet of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> was of the countrie of the Griſons, ſent by the towne of Coire, who was in contention with the Biſhop of the ſaid place. The ſubiects of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of Final were in like ſort heard, who endeuoured that the Marqueſſe might be depriued of his Marqueſſhip. The Duke of Mantoa alſo required the Emperour that he would end a controuerſie which he had with the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21983:162"/>
Duke of Sauoy, by reaſon of Caſal ſituated within the Marqueſſhip of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Montferat. All theſe controuerſies partly ended, his Maieſtie ſolemnely gaue to certaine Princes the inueſtitures of their fees or ſeruices, as by them he was required. The Cardinall of Conſtance was one of them, and the <note place="margin">Inueſtiture is giuen by the Emperour, and of that which is due for it.</note> Lantgraue of Heſſe, who receiued them by their Deligates. The Abbot of Kempt being there preſent, receiued them from his Maieſtie in his owne perſon: as alſo did the Marqueſſe <hi>Iohn Frederic</hi> of Eniſpach, and the Prince of Anhalt. The Duke of Saxonie alſo tooke his with the accuſtomed cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, making a magnificall and ſtately ſhew, being accompanied with 1500. horſe, well prepared and richly furniſhed, cauſing to be borne 13. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. Count Palatin Elector (with many other Lords) receiued the like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> inueſtitures, as alſo did the Ambaſſadour of the Duke of Viuaria in the name of his Princes: they all taking by this meanes confirmation of their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Thoſe who take ſuch inueſtitures, if they bee Electors, they ſhould pay nothing to the officers: but if they be others, they ought euery one to pay 63. markes of ſiluer, which are diſtributed by the Comptroller of the Court to the officers, in this ſort: He firſt retaineth for himſelfe 10. markes, and after that giueth 10. others to the Chancellor of the Emperiall Court; to the Maſters, Notaries, and Doctors, 3. markes; to the Taſter of Limbourg 10. markes; to the Maſter of the Kitchin of Noremberg 10. markes; to the Vicemarſhall of Papenhein 10. markes; and to the Chamberlaine of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenſtein 10. other markes: prouided that ſuch officers be then preſent at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Court executing their charges: and in their abſence thoſe which doe their office take this profit. The horſe, or ſome other beaſt vpon which he is mounted who requireth his inueſtiture, is due to the Duke of Saxonie, if he be preſent, or to the Vicemarſhall, if he be there: and in abſence both of the one and other, it is due to him who then doth execute their office. All theſe things being diſpatched in this Diet, the Emperor gaue order at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end thereof, that all that which had been determined vpon for the warre, ſhould preſently be in a readines. And after hauing diſmiſſed euery one, and taken leaue of all, he went to Vienna, where he appointed a Diet to the ſubiects of his other Eſtates to bee held the 23. of Aprill. In it, his Maieſtie being there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> preſent, it was ordained that euery houſe ſhould pay a florin: that a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Ordinances made in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria to draw ſuccours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turkes.</note> who had more then 100. florins of reuenew by the yeere, ſhould keepe a good horſe readie at his owne coſts and charges: that the peaſants ſhould bee ſent by certaine bands and daies to Vienna to fortifie it: that not any ſhould receiue a ſeruant without teſtimonie of his life, and that from his laſt maſter: that for euery houſe, the 5. the 10. the 30. (if there were ſo many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) ſhould be inioyned to go to the warre: that throughout the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Auſtria, Morauia, and the confines of Hungarie, all ſhould be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to take pay of the enemie: and that all the citizens and inhabitants of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Vienna, ſhould prouide themſelues of victuals for one yeere, and that he who had not the meanes ſhould depart the countrie.</p>
            <p>The Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> brother to the Emperour, for the ſame occaſion aſſembled another Diet at Poſon in Hungarie, in which he found all the Hungarian Barons and Lords ſo diſpoſed, that they offered him all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21983:163"/>
which he demaunded, and promiſed to march all in perſon to this warre, when the Emperour, or any of his brothers ſhould there bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p>We haue before written that Count Palatin the Elector was thought to be of opinion, that very hardly he would accord to the great ſuccours which <hi>Maximilian</hi> demaunded. The intereſt which he might haue to this, that ſuch <note place="margin">Occaſion which might cauſe Count Palatin to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt ſo great a preparation for warre.</note> forces ſhould not bee vnited together by the conſent of all the States of the Empire, was as in regard of his own particular fact, he fearing leaſt this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of Princes, and this armie might bee to his preiudice, vnder colour and falſe newes of the Turks enterpriſes: or that he changing his determination, becauſe he ſaw himſelf hindered by the Sophy, or from ſome other place, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> by the meanes of ſome peace or truce made with the Emperour, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe from aſſailing Hungarie, he ſaw then all theſe forces might turne vpon himſelfe, becauſe that he againe had changed his religion, which was conformable to the Confeſſion of Ausbourg, and had taken that which followed the opinion of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Caluin:</hi> which was an act formally contrarie to that which was before ordained and concluded on in the yeere 1555. in the towne of Ausbourg by the States of the Empire, in the preſence of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the laſt deceaſed Emperour, who then was there aſſiſtant, as King of the Romanes, and as Lieutenant of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note place="margin">Ordinance made in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie vpon the diuerſitie of religion.</note> This ordinance was made the 24. of September: and the tenour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> is this.</p>
            <p>The Emperour and King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by reaſon of the doctrine, religion, and faith, depending on the Confeſſion of Ausbourg, and the other Princes and Eſtates, ſhall not conſtraine nor force any ſubiect of the Empire to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their religion, their ceremonies, and lawes, which in their territories they haue alreadie inſtituted, or ſhall hereafter inſtitute, being aſſociated to that Confeſſion: and by any commaunds, or other way not to force them to doe it, and not in any thing to contemne them. But ſhall freely permit them this religion, with their goods, faculties, tributes, tols, poſſeſſions, and rights, in ſuch ſort that they may enioy them peaceably. The controuerſie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which is for religion, ſhall be compoſed with milde, amiable, and peaceable reaſons. Thoſe who follow the ſaid Confeſſion, ſhall in like ſort beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues towards the Emperour, King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and other Princes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates (confederated together in the ancient religion) as well Eccleſiaſticals as Seculars, and towards all the other Eccleſiaſticals, and their Coleages, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what part ſoeuer they are gone to make their abode: ſo that they well and duly procure the miniſtrie therof, as afterwards it ſhall be ſet down. To theſe ſhall they permit in all libertie their religion, ceremonies, lawes, poſſeſſions, tributes, and al other rites: and by any meanes ſhall not hinder them, but that they may enioy them peaceably. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
            </p>
            <p>All the ſuites, differences, and quarels which might riſe betweene the one and other, ſhould be ended, according to the vſe, cuſtome, and lawes of the Empire. Thoſe who are not either of the one or other religion, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in this peace. This reſtraint was made to withſtand new troubles, which eaſily enſue vpon the introduction of a new religion. That neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:21983:163"/>
of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> being fuller of libertie, and further from the ancient faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was afterwards more imbraced: and notwithſtanding this ordinance, it hath found place in the countries and territories of the Palatin Elector, as alſo it hath done in Polonia, in Switzerland, in England, in Scotland, and in France: although that the ceremonies thereof are not in all alike, and that there is diuers opinions amongſt the Doctors of it. And although that in Spaine there is great ſeueritie vſed for the preſeruation of the ancient faith, yet neuertheleſſe ſo it is, that about this time in this Prouince certaine were apprehended, who were conuicted by their Confeſſion to hold and follow <note place="margin">The opinion of Zwinglius or Caluin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulged in Spaine, and the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſome Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof.</note> this new doctrine of <hi>Zwinglius:</hi> and the puniſhment which was inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, being accompanied with great ceremonies that they adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for a greater terror to the aſſiſtances. I am willing to write the order thereof, although it be from the diſcourſe of this hiſtorie: but ſeeing it falleth out ſo fit to our purpoſe, and that in another place (it may be) I ſhall not haue the like commoditie nor occaſion to ſet it downe in writing I deſire the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take this in good part, and to thinke that I adde, and ſometimes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe ſtrange diſcourſes, the rather to recreate his minde, then to content my ſelfe, euen as the eye doth more delight it ſelfe to ſee in a fayre medow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of flowers, then one onely kinde of colour in a corne field.</p>
            <p>This exemplar puniſhment was performed in the towne of Valladolid, in which for it there is appointed a great Scaffold by the Councell houſe, <note place="margin">The notable ceremonie touching the execution which is done in Spaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</note> and another adioyning thereto, wherein the Princes muſt be. About this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> place were alſo raiſed other Scaffolds, vpon which muſt bee preſent the Councellors and perſons of qualitie, officers of iuſtice, and Gentlemen not onely of the towne, but almoſt of all the realme. The abundance of people that was there was ſo great, that in mans memorie the like was not heard of. About ten of the clocke the 21. day of May, the Princeſſe <hi>Ioane,</hi> Gouerneſſe of Spaine, and the Prince Don <hi>Charles</hi> went forth of the Palace, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Archbiſhop of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> the great Conſtable and Admirall of Caſtile, the Marqueſſe of Aſtorgne, of Denigne, and of Sarmia Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Princeſſes houſe, and the Counts of Miranda, of Orſen, of Nieua, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Modecgne, of Sardeigne, of Zibadea, of Andrade, of Don <hi>Garzia</hi> of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo Gouernour of the Prince, and of many other great perſons. Before them marched two Vſhers with their Maces, two Heraulds with the armes of Spaine, &amp; the Count of Bondie carrying the Sword in his hand: and all this companie conducted the Princes to the lodging which was prepared, adioyning to the ſaid great Scaffold. Vpon the Scaffolds were alreadie the Archbiſhop of Siuill, generall Inquiſitor with thoſe who were of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Inquiſition, <hi>Roderic</hi> Biſhop of Ciuidad, the royall Councell, the Inquiſitors, the Biſhop of Oran, and the Biſhop of Palence. The Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at the windowes of their lodgings, they began to carrie a Croſſe couered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with blacke, with the Enſigne of the Office of the Inquiſition: and after marched the Clergie, and priſoners who had bin receiued to penance: and after them thoſe who were condemned to death. This proceſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Inquiſition houſe by a high raiſed way made of purpoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto the ſaid Scaffold: where being all arriued, and euery one ſet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21983:164"/>
Frier <hi>Melchior,</hi> who afterward was Biſhop of Canaria, being of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Iacobins Order, began a Sermon: and that ended, the Archbiſhop of Siuill riſing vp, went to the Princeſſe and Prince, and cauſed them to make vpon a Croſſe ſuch an oth as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It being ordained by the Apoſtolicall decrees, and by the holy Canons, that the Kings ought to ſweare to carrie all fauour to the Catholike faith and Chriſtian religion, you conforming your ſelues to this holy ordinance, your Highneſſes ſweare in the name <hi>God,</hi> in the name of S. <hi>Marie,</hi> and by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Euangeliſts, &amp; by the ſigne of the Croſſe, vpon which you haue put your hands, to yeeld all fauour, and giue all neceſſarie helpe to the holy office of the Inquiſition and miniſters of the ſame, againſt Heretikes and Apoſtataes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and againſt all thoſe who fauour and defend them, and againſt all manner of perſons who directly or indirectly hinder the progreſſe of this holy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and to conſtraine all your ſubiects to obey and obſerue the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Apoſtolike letters, giuen and publiſhed for the ſafetie and defence of our holy Catholike faith, againſt Heretikes, and againſt thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, receiue, or defend them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon theſe ſpeeches the two Princes made anſwer, that ſo they would ſweare. And the Archbiſhop added theſe words. <q>Becauſe of your holy oth, our Lord proſper your royall perſons, and the Eſtates of your Highneſſes for many and long yeeres.</q> By and by after one of the Regiſters, who is there preſent, demaunded of the companie whether they did not ſweare the like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> oth. They all made anſwere, I. Then they began to reade the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and iudgements giuen againſt them all, and eſpecially againſt thoſe who were condemned to the fire. And theſe were, Doctor <hi>Auguſtine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zagia,</hi> his Maieſties Chaplaine and Preacher, <hi>Francis d'Viuero,</hi> Dame <hi>Betrix d' Viuero,</hi> Dame <hi>Elenor de Viuero, Alonſo Perez</hi> a Prieſt, <hi>Antonio Herrezuolo</hi> a bachelor, <hi>Chriſtopher de Occampo</hi> a Licentiate, <hi>Francis de Herrera</hi> a Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, <hi>Iohn Garzia, Chriſtopher de Padillia, Izabella de Straba, Ioane Velaſques Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zala Vaes</hi> a Portugall, <hi>Catherin Roman,</hi> and Dame <hi>Catherin d'Ortegua.</hi> Theſe, aſſoone as their iudgement was read, were throwne into the fire. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The forme of the Spaniſh Inquiſition.</note> not poſſible but that ſome would deſire to know what manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> this Inquiſition is, I (minding therein to ſatisfie euery one, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in that which may bring ſome vtilitie with delight to the reader) will here write of it as it is practiſed in Spaine, ſeeing it is leſſe knowne then the name thereof in other kingdomes.</p>
            <p>This office was firſt inuented by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Aragon, who after he had chaſed, or at leaſt ſubdued the kingdome of Granado, which (as almoſt all the reſt of the kingdomes of Spaine) was for many yeeres in the hands of the Mores or Sarazins, who had tamed Spaine from the time that Count <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> called them thither to reuenge himſelf of the rape and forcement, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> K. <hi>Roderic</hi> of Spaine (of the Gothiſh religion) had vſed againſt his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Cana.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:21983:164"/>
religion, by the frequent fellowſhip that theſe inhabitants ſhould haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with his other ſubiects, reſolued himſelfe intirely to purge this kingdome ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by preachings, or force. Some of them chuſed rather to paſſe the ſea and retire into Africke, then to chaunge their religion. Others by effectuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or elſe preferring their ſafetie before their religion, were baptized. This charge to conuert them was giuen to the Iacobins. Theſe imployed their time therein with great care. But ſeeing that their paines ſeemed vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to many, they found a way to ſearch out the meanes, hoping that by feare they ſhould keep them in the obſeruation of the Chriſtian faith, which otherwiſe they did not greatly regard. This way was authoriſed by the King, and confirmed by Pope <hi>Sixtus.</hi> After that the King himſelfe hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vnderſtood that theſe Friers vſed too ſeuere rigour, and that they indeede committed a great abuſe therein. This finding them out, otherwiſe called an Inquiſition, comming of this word <hi>enquire,</hi> was taken from them, and committed into the hands of the moſt ſufficient Eccleſiaſticall Seculars. To theſe if any be preſented as thinking ill of the faith, he is preſently ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Sergeant, whom they call a Familier: and appearing at the day, (whereof he muſt not faile) if he auoucheth nothing of that whereof he is accuſed, he is ſent backe againe: but there is charge ſecretly giuen to a Spye to haue an eye of him, and to note his doings, and know what talke he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in companie. If there be diſcouered againſt him any thing of euill, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the report thereof is made to the Inquiſitors, who againe laie vpon him a new aſſignation. When he appeareth, the informour is hid behinde a tapiſtrie, to acknowledge whether he be the accuſed, and being acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whether he freely confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wherof he is accuſed, or whether by ſubtell interrogations ſomething is drawne from him: if he be a ſtraunger, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: but if he be of the countrie, he is often ſent back againe. After that, they call for the Curate, becauſe that they would not further enterpriſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſheepe without the knowledge of his Paſtour, to whom they ſhew the information. Vpon which, all, or at the leaſt three Inquiſitors, ordaine vnder their ſignes a <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi> If the accuſed flieth, there is ſent after him a Sergeant of the Inquiſition, to whom they deſcribe the age, ſtature, face, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> haire, and ſuch other circumſtances. This Sergeant, if the accuſed be of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, &amp; whoſe doctrine is feared, will follow him through euery place, and he will vſe ſuch diligence that he will attach him. Againſt the other the purſuit is not ſo hot. The accuſed being taken, he is preſently diſpoſſeſſed of his keyes, and they are giuen to a Sergeant and a Notarie, who goeth into his houſe to take an Inuentorie of all his moueables, papers, iewels, and ſuch other things, which they ſequeſter and commit it into the cuſtodie of one of their richeſt neighbours, to anſwere it at the end of the cauſe. All theſe moueables are confiſcated, if the accuſed bee conuicted. The Iaylor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> putting this poore infortunate perſon in priſon, ſearcheth whether there bee any thing about him, and taketh from him all but his outward garments. He remaineth there eight daies, and vntill that the Iaylor ſpeaking vnto him counſelleth him to demaund audience. Being before theſe Lords, he is by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21983:165"/>
them intreated to acknowledge his fact, to diſcharge his conſcience, and to confeſſe his wickednes, promiſing him all fauour, ſo that he doe repent. If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he confeſſeth, they forbeare not to proceede in proceſſe againſt him: if he ſaith nothing, he is returned to priſon, admoniſhing him to thinke well of his fact. There is giuen to him at his requeſt many ſuch audiences without other effect: neither doe they acquaint him with that whereof he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for that they had rather conuince him by his owne mouth, if by chance among ſo many interrogatories, it might fall out that he did diſcouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking thereupon ſome matter of his fact. If they can draw nothing from him by this meanes, he is called, &amp; they threaten him to ſend the Fiſcall to him (and this is he whom we call the Kings Attourney) to pleade againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> him, and that they will proceede againſt him by all direct courſes of law. Beſides theſe threatnings, they preſent to him the Crucifix, and a Miſſall, to cauſe him to ſweare thereupon. If he ſweareth not, he is conuicted: and if he ſweareth, then they demaund of him of what countrie he is, of his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and companions, and ſuch other things, from whence they thinke to draw ſome arguments and preſumptions. Thoſe that be moſt ſubtell, and know their manner to proceede, doe not anſwer but after they haue ſeene the information againſt them. In the end they communicate vnto him the accuſation to anſwer thereto; and he chuſeth a Proctor and an Aduocate to doe it, who taketh his defence in hand, and ſetteth it downe in writing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> thereto reaſons and teſtimonies of law: and after giueth them to the Inquiſitors, who peruſe them during three daies together, and afterward cauſe to come before them the accuſed, and the Aduocate who counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him to ſpeake the trueth. If he ſaith nothing, he is againe committed to priſon. Afterward at his requeſt is read to him the information: but it is without naming of any witneſſes, whom if he would take exceptions vnto, he muſt geſſe, if hee will except againſt them. In which often happeneth that which they ſeeke for: which is, that he minding to purge himſelfe he nameth and chargeth others, with whom he had communication of the faith. Thoſe of the wiſer ſort demaund a coppie of the information, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> time to anſwer thereto. Two eye witneſſes are ſufficient to conclude his death, and the Iaylor alone. One ſufficeth for torture, and euery one may accuſe him. The Kings Attourney is a partie, and the informers are witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Three daies after that he hath had a coppie of his information, he ſhall be called forth. His Aduocate diſcouereth to him the greateſt offences, the ſtrongeſt depoſitions, thoſe which agree, and thoſe which doe not: he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him that if he would take exceptions to his witneſſes, he muſt geſſe at them: whereupon they giue him certaine daies, during which he calleth to minde who are his enemies. Enmitie is receiued for ſufficient exception: and the contradiction which is betweene theſe witneſſes: and alſo if the partie accuſed proue, that hauing often reſiſted (ſpecially as in regard of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> deed whereof he is accuſed) the ſame thing againſt him, that hath accuſed him. Theſe daies being paſſed, he deſireth the Iudges to ſee if ſuch and ſuch his enemies are not thoſe who haue informed againſt him. If hee ſurmiſe
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:21983:165"/>
amiſſe, he is conuicted: but if he geſſe well, they will not allow it: his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> onely (who dareth not ſpeake to him but before them) will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of him what exceptions he can take againſt thoſe whom he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. The Aduocate ſhall ſet downe the exceptions in forme: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demaundeth of him whether he haue any meanes to purge himſelfe by contrarie proofes; as that he hath alwaies been a friend of the Churchmen, obſerued the ceremonies of the Church, heard Maſſes, to haue been at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, reuerenced the Croſſe and Images, and done ſuch other deedes. This proofe which is graunted to him, to wit, when he hath no ſtrong and concluding proofe againſt him, muſt bee made within nine daies: and his counterwitneſſes being heard, they conclude the triall after the Kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hath taken his concluſions, and before iudgement be giuen, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines (which in this reſpect examine very curiouſly the matter) muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the doctrine, and declare that the faith of the accuſed is conformable to the Catholike Church: and if the proofe be good, he is abſolued. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, for the ſuſpition (which cannot eaſily be taken away) they agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, or mitigate the iudgement according as it remaineth: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his abſolution, he is kept ſtill in priſon vntill after the act of the faith: and all this is done to the end that no man ſhould thinke that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Inquiſition had cauſed him to bee taken without occaſion. But if the accuſed doe not ſufficiently iuſtifie himſelfe, he is condemned to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> afterwards with his Curate or Viccar, they cauſe him to enter by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wickets into a certaine place vnder the ground, very obſcure and hidious, wherein he findeth the Iudges placed. There incontinently is preſent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, couered with a long blacke linnen robe very ſtraight, like a ſacke, hauing his head and face couered with a blacke hood, hauing but two holes before his eyes. This is done the more to amaze the patient, like as if a diuell ſhould preſent himſelfe to him for the puniſhment of his miſdeedes. Then theſe Iudges perſwade him to tell the trueth, otherwiſe they proteſt that if they breake him or diſioynt ſome member, or if his life yeeldeth to the violence of torments, that the fault thereof ſhall not redound but vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> That done, he is vnclothed all naked, except the priuie parts, and by ſignes the Iudges notifie to the executioner what torments he ſhould vſe. During theſe, he is often admoniſhed to ſpeake the trueth: and if he will confeſſe nothing, they ſometime martyr him more then two houres. In the end they carrie him to priſon againe, where they haue a Surgeon, who while he applieth phiſick to him, threatneth that he ſhall endure the next day farre greater paines. Oftentimes they put Spies with them in priſon to diſcouer their actions, and euen they enquire of other priſoners if the accuſed hath diſcouered nothing to them of that whereof he is accuſed, promiſing them in caſe they would declare it, that they ſhall not bee puniſhed for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for which they haue been committed priſoners. If this accuſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bee of qualitie and note, or that if he take vpon him to preach and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, or that he hath learning, theſe officers doe cauſe this bruite to be ſpread abroad, that he hath declared on the torture all his complices, and others
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:21983:166"/>
who hath conferred with him concerning the faith: yea they cauſe to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> witneſſed by the neighbours of the priſon, how they heard him crie in his torture. And vpon this deuice his confederates willing to preuent, and thinking to haue a more light puniſhment, (as the Inquiſitors promiſe to thoſe who voluntarily confeſſe their offence) come to accuſe themſelues. And while theſe priſoners are thus detained, if any among them fall ſicke, they carrie him to the Hoſpitall, which is appointed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where he is well vſed, vntill that afterwards hauing recouered his health, he is then brought backe againe to priſon. And for feare they ſhould bee wronged, the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors goe twice the moneth with the Iaylor and a Notarie, to viſit them in priſon, to informe themſelues of their vſage, and to ſupplie their neceſſities, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and doe puniſh the Iaylor if he ſtealeth from them their victuals, or if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber them in any thing. In the end the ſolemne day being come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they pronounce and execute their iudgements, naming this the Act of the faith, the night before they cauſe them who are repentant to be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, after that two daies before that they had declared vnto them what good things they haue in this world; and they cauſe to be clad at the dawning of the day appointed for the execution with the Sambenita thoſe which are to be put to death, which is a yellow robe without ſleeues, painted all ouer with blacke diuels, and vpon their heads they put a paper Miter made in forme of a tower, vpon which is figured a man burning, and diuels about him putting fire to him, and they gagge them with a pegge of wood to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> their ſpeech, and with a ſtrong corde they tye their necke and hands. Certaine amongſt them, although they are not of that number which are condemned to death, ceaſe not to weare the Sambenita according to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which ſometimes is vſed againſt them, only to ſhew that their life hath been ſubiect to the Inquiſition, and not to death. Theſe condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus apparelled, they are conducted into the place, as wee haue aboue ſaid. Theſe Iudges haue no other iudgements, but to pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of curſing and irregularitie. And for this cauſe after they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their iudgements, if it bee againſt a conuertite they adde theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> words; that for ſo much as they doubt that he for feare maketh a good ſhew, and that he is but faintly conuerted, fearing to leaue a wolfe vnder a ſheepes skinne, notwithſtanding his conuerſion they leaue him in the hands of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power, whom they pray to vſe mercie towards him, not to breake any member of him, neither to draw from him any one drop of blood. If it bee againſt an obſtinate perſon that they haue pronounced their ſentence, they ſay beſides that ſince it is thus, that their puniſhment hath not ſerued to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert him, they deliuer him vnto the Secular power to puniſh him according to law, whom they pray neuertheleſſe (if he acknowledge himſelfe) to bee mercifull to him. Theſe Iudges dare not appoint the torture againſt perſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of marke, and the King of Spaine ſheweth fauour to all puniſhments which are not vnto death.</p>
            <p>By this diſcourſe which I haue made you of this Inquiſition, ſome louing libertie aſwell in their actions, as in their ſpeeches, finde this manner ſtrange;

others would that it were yet more rigorous, deſirous that euery one ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be auſtere like themſelues. But if the one and the other would duly conſider the dangerous euents which further the ſubuerſion of an Eſtate, by the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of things eſtabliſhed for the maintenance of religion, (which ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth maſter and exceede all humane paſſions, and doe draw them vnto it with a marueilous vehemencie) they ſhould finde that it were moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for to keepe themſelues free from ſuch an Inquiſition, to be ſilent, and not to diſpute nor ſpeake by forme (no not ſo much as onely of talke) of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which wee ought to follow by commaundement: which the ancient Common-weales haue wel knowne to put in practiſe at Rome and Athens: and as it is yet obſerued vnder the dominion of the Grand Seigniour, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> without a great eſtabliſhment and maintaining of his Empire, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much as permitted in all his territories and Seigniories to any, bee he Turke, Chriſtian, or Iew, to preach or teach, but onely to liue in his law: as the Common-wealth of Venice by ſecret tradition doth keepe and obſerue.

            <p>
               <q>The moſt puiſſant Emperour of the Turkes our moſt mercifull benifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour hath commaunded vs by his letters, and by <hi>Zeuſic</hi> his Ambaſſadour,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:21983:167"/>
that we ſhould exhort al the eſtates of our Realmes and countrie to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vnto vs, and yeelde vs that obedience which they owe vs: he hauing certified vs that that would be to him verie pleaſant and agreeable, when he ſhould know the Hungars to imbrace one another with a ſincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to be deſierous amongſt them ſtrictly to preſerue it. Therefore if you feare to diſpleaſe him who with infinit puiſſance is able to chaſtice them who prouoke him: and if you haue in any regarde the fidelitie which you owe to vs, we would councell you all to acknowledge vs for your King and Lord. In doing this, it will be a meanes to preſerue and maintaine this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſo much afflicted, to reſtore vnto peace all the States thereof, and to giue particularly to euery one an aſſured aboade in his owne houſe: all of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vs cutting off the occaſion which ſo often moueth <hi>Solymon</hi> to bring an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into the fielde to ruinate them; and to come himſelfe in perſon to make this waſte with infinit coſt, without reſpecting paynefull, long, and tedious iourneyes which it behoueth him to doe.

            </p>
            <p>By theſe and many other reaſons, <hi>Iohn</hi> endeauored to ſtir vp the Hungars to follow his part, and to be himſelfe at the Diet which he had appoynted in the towne of Torde in the moneth of March, in which place ſhould aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the ſtates of his kingdome, to aduiſe together of that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the preſeruation of it.

He preſently fearing that theſe letters would alter the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome, and that the menaces of the Turkes greatnes compriſed in them, ſhould not poſſeſſe others with feare, cauſed theſe heere in his name to be publiſhed the fourth of March, directing them to the Barons and Lords of Hungarie.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords, there is ſent me from diuers parts the coppie of a letter diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnder the name of <hi>Iohn</hi> Vayuod of Tranſiluania, full of apparant cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and of notorious and euident deceites, with which hee endeauoreth to aſtoniſh the Emperours ſubiects, as if <hi>Solyman</hi> were very curious of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good and preſeruation of the Hungars, whom theſe 100. yeares together he and his prediceſſors haue labored with all their power wholly to ruinate, aſwell by their forces and armes, as by their deuiſions and ciuill warres which he entertaineth amongſt you. And although I make not any doubt but that by your fidelitie, wiſedome, and for the greatnes of the neere and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:21983:168"/>
imminent daunger, you cannot but conſider whereto tendeth ſuch ſubtilties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and deceites. Neuertheleſſe to lighten you the more therein, I could not but aduertiſe you, that the Emperour with all diligence and induſtrie hath ſought nothing more then peace with the Turkes and Prince of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania; of which he hoped for a good end, to the content of you all, if the negotiation thereof had not been hindred by the falſe reports and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall hatred of the Vayuod. And to make proofe thereof vnto you, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth you to remember that this laſt winter his Maieſtie commaunded that the truce ſhould be ſo exactly kept, that for to take away all breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he cauſed to rayſe the ſiege from before certaine Caſtles and Fortreſſes, which by our people were alreadie neerely driuen, and meant not that Tranſiluania ſhould be forced by our armes; all this he did for the repoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and good of this kingdome. Now though the peace which was yet treated of with the Turkes, could not be effected, you ought not for that inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to doubt, that the Emperour will not vndertake your defence, conſidering that the forces of the Empire, and of many other chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (zealous of your good) will not fayle him no more then, I beleeue, you would fayle to the obſeruance of that which dependeth on your fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie towards his Maieſtie, in whoſe name, you doing that which belongeth vnto you, I can aſſure you of a peace and future repoſe: deſiring and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting you rather to purſue that which is equall, then ſuffering your ſelues to follow (as little children doe) deceitfull amazements, you ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that which is built vpon a foundation erected againſt all right and reaſon: all of you ſetting before your eyes, that God in puniſhing the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, and fauoring the iuſt, will aſſiſt you, ſince that in this warre, beſides the maintenance of that which appertaineth by lawfull ſucceſſion to <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> it is alſo a queſtion for the entertayning of his religion, and of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, which we ſee to be aſſayled with ayde from the Turke, by thoſe who falſely would beare the name of Chriſtians, who repoſing themſelues hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therunto in their armes, ſhall finally haue a miſerable and tragike ende, according to their demerits. With theſe I pray you haue no communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea, I forbid you in the Emperours name to haue with them any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and not to ſend to the Diet which the Vayuod pretendeth to cauſe to beheld at Torde, vpon paine to incurre the puniſhment due to thoſe who ſhew themſelues rebellious to their Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About this time the Captaine of Ainathſchen being gone about his <note place="margin">Ainathſchen taken by the Turkes.</note> owne affayres in the towne of Agria, and hauing taken with him for guide the beſt ſouldiours of his garriſon, the neighbouring Turkes being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed thereof by their ſpies of the Captaines departure, the day following which was Saint <hi>George</hi> his day, by dawning of the day, they were with ladders vpon the wall, and entring by force into this Fortreſſe, killed all thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> whom they found within. At the ſame time the Turkes thinking that the Counte of Serin was alſo abſent from Sighet, came and laide ſiege to that place: but he being retourned from Vienna, whether he was gone to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with the Emperour of many things, concerning the fortification of this Fortreſſe, the Turkes found greater reſiſtance there, then they thought
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:21983:168"/>
for: and being come to handie ſtrokes, they weare ſo hotly repulſed, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with ſuch ſlaughter, that among them there remayned two wagons loaden with heades which weare carried to Sighet: and at the bruite of ſo fierce an incounter, thoſe who were at the 5. Churches vnderſtanding of the great loſſe happened to their partie, began to flie and forſake the place. Daylie the Turkes enterpriſed ſuch attempts now againſt Iula, then againſt Iauerin and other places of Hungarie, committing infinite euils.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Emperour had certaine aduertiſments that <hi>Solyman</hi> was departed from Conſtantinople to march in perſon to this warre, and <note place="margin">Solyman marcheth into Hungarie.</note> that in great iourneyes with 70000. men he was come to Sophia, and by Miſia into Bulgaria, cauſing <hi>Portau Baſha</hi> to march before with one part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Armie, and many Sangiacchs: and that further he had commaunded the Belerbey of Natolia to paſſe by Galipoli, and to come and ioyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with him: and that alreadie he was marched almoſt to Buda, where the King of Tranſiluania was gone to meete him with 50.

            <p>When <hi>Solyman</hi> arriued in Hungarie with this equipage, <hi>Schuendy</hi> held the Forte of Huſte beſieged, which he had ſtraightly ſhut vp, minding to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the Turkiſh endeauours; and on the other part in the moneth of Iune, the Baſha of Buda being in fielde with 8000. footemen, and 25. peeces of Artillerie went to be ſiege Pallotta, which is ſituated by Alberegalis 8. miles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from Ianerin. The batterie was ſo furious for the ſpace of 8. dayes, that all <note place="margin">Pallotta well defended by Tury againſt the Turkes.</note> the wals were throwen to the ground, the aſſieged remayning in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame perill. <hi>George Tury</hi> a couragious Captaine, and of ſingular proweſſe, Gouernour of this place, marching about it to repaire the breaches, and to giue ſuch order thereto as neede required, was ſtrooken on the ſide with a ſhiuer of a ſtone broken with a Cannon bullet: and the ſtroke was ſo violent that he there thought he ſhould loſe his life, whereof would haue been a great loſſe, he hauing many times ſuſtayned and repulſed the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the enemie, as a little before this ſiege he had done, when purſuing the Turkes of the garriſon of Alberegalis, together with the Beg, he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beaten them euen to their towne gates, and in ſuch ſort conſtrayned them, that the Gouernour thereof was forced to throw his Turbant away to ſaue himſelfe, he being ſcarcely knowen. Now although that the wound was daungerous, neuertheleſſe he was within a little while after cured thereof, and while this ſiege laſted he made many ſallies vpon the Turkes, who (after that they had giuen 6. aſſaultes) did nothing elſe but play with the Cannon: and they played ſo much with it while this ſiege laſted, that they gathered vp together within the towne 700. bullets. The Inhabitants were almoſt as a pray to the enemies, and whileſt they thought they could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no longer reſiſt, incontinently and as it were at an inſtant they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues deliuered from that daunger, by reaſon of 12. Enſignes of foote new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arriued at Iauerin vnder Collonel <hi>George</hi> of Helfenſtain, who the day after his arriuall, cauſing 90. wagons to goe forth, with 900. footemen marched to enter into this place. The vauntcourers of the Turkiſh Armie diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:21983:169"/>
this troupe, and iudging it to bee farre greater then it was, by reaſon of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> waggons which poſſeſſed a large roome among the ſouldiours, who coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and incloſed them, they ſent certaine amongſt them to aduertiſe the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha thereof. Theſe by their report making the daunger a great deale more then it was, preſently the Baſha taking an apprehenſion of feare, cauſed his people to retire, fearing to loſe his Cannon. Neuertheleſſe he left one crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and broken peece there with 40. barrels of powder, and 40. ſackes of meale. There alſo remained a great number of Tents and baggage. This was drawne into the towne. The breaches were ſo large, that ſcarcely a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze would ſhoote from one ſide to another. At the raiſing of this ſiege the Turkes incamped by Alberegalis, and in the meane time the ſuccours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> entered into the towne. To repayre the breaches thereof, and to aduiſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſequence, they ſent Ingenours thither to iudge of it, if it might be repayred, or whither it would be more expedient to forſake it, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to throw it all downe to the ground.</p>
            <p>Theſe accidents daily arriuing in Hungarie, cauſed the Emperour in the greateſt diligence he could to haſten all the preparations of warre, according to which, he had there for that purpoſe 5. Regiments of Launſquenets. The firſt was vnder the conduct of <hi>Remer:</hi> the ſecond was led by <hi>Balderdun: Claus</hi> of Hogaſt commaunded the third: the fourth was led by Count <hi>George</hi> of Helfenſtain: and the fifth marched vnder <hi>Polbel.</hi> He alſo had there 20000.

               <note place="margin">Succours come to the Emperour from forraine Princes.</note> from Sauoy to ſerue the Emperour in this warre: as alſo were thither come a great number of Lords and Knights from many places of Chriſtendome at their owne charges, and for the loue they bore to Chriſtian religion. His Maieſtie receiued them very curteouſly, and commaunded all his Barons and other Lords of his armie to vſe the like in their places, conſidering how all theſe (for the onely affection to doe him ſeruice) were come to ſeeke ſo farre countries, without any reſpect had to the charge and trauaile.</p>
            <p>Many Princes and Common-wealths of Italie ſent him ſuccours. The <note place="margin">Succours of Italie.</note> Duke of Mantua, Gennes, and Luca aſſiſted him with money.

But theſe bruites being found falſe, theſe Lords after they had ſeene Italie tooke their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hungarie, that they might bee in this warre, and ſalute his Maieſtie, who made them great demonſtration of the pleaſure which he receiued by their comming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> had prepared a nauall armie vpon Danubius of 12. Gallies, and 30. Nazadies, with other great boates, ſo well accommodated, that the <note place="margin">A nauall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vpon Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius.</note> ſouldiours who were within, might well warrant themſelues from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies arrowes. In theſe veſſels there was many peeces of great Artillerie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with neceſſarie powder and bullets, and 3000. men, the moſt part Italians. <hi>Blach Allemand</hi> a Kight of Malta a valiant man, and greatly experienced in ſea affayres, commaunded this armie. The land armie marched along Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius towards Iauerin, in which place the bodie of the whole armie ſhould ſtay to diuert the Turke from Tranſiluania, and to put him in doubt to loſe Strigonium and Buda.</p>
            <p>The Emperour at the ſame time commaunded all the Nobilitie of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria to mount on horſebacke, and to march to the warre at their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, preparing himſelfe in the meane time to be in perſon in his Campe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſince that <hi>Solyman</hi> (although he was old) was in his. As this great concourſe of men and of all munitions made, the Turkes who were in the field towards Alberegalis and Sighet, (where they expected the Beglerbey of Armenia, who ſhould come to beſiege this place, as afterwards he did) ouerran all the countrie. Againſt theſe went forth Count Salm, who commaunded Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, and with as many men as he was able to bring into the field, he went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Pallota: and hauing put thereinto victuals, and refreſhed the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he marched with a good troupe of Caualarie towards Veſprimia, which <note place="margin">Veſprimia ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Count Salm from the Turkes.</note> is a great towne, and not very ſtrong, two miles from Pallota, making great ſpoyle all about, not ſtaying any whit at all vpon any bootie, vntill his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> approached. The Turkes who were within, minding to prepare and defend themſelues, and for this effect readily giuing order to many things, as they diſplaced two Cannons to place them elſewhere in a more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious place, a pane of the wall fell to the ground. The Count being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereof, taking this for ſome good ſigne, and as if God ſhould open the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:21983:170"/>
paſſage to him, diligently prepared his people. Theſe arriued about night, and the batterie was deferred vntill the day following. In the meane time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Turkes laboured to repayre the happened ruine: and preſently when day light appeared, the Count hotly aſſailed the towne on all parts, putting fire to the ports, and ladders againſt the walls, by meanes whereof (in repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the enemie) they threw fire vpon the couerings of houſes, which for the moſt part are but of wood, according to the common manner of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: and ſome entring by the breach, and others boldly leaping from off the ladders, forced the enemies, and they cut the greateſt part of them in peeces; the principall amongſt them retiring into the Caſtle: but for all that they were no more warranted then the others were. For minding to parley, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> were ſuddenly forced and ſlaine. At this ſurpriſe was taken aliue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Alberegalis, who was ſent to the Caſtle of Poſon. There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken about this towne fiue Turkiſh Spies. This being done, the Count knowing that within Pallota were entered for the garriſon thereof certaine Germane companies, left in this to command therein <hi>George Tury,</hi> who had ſo well defended the other, giuing him a ſufficient companie of men to keep it: and afterwards he retired to Iauerin, while the Baſha of Buda departed from Alberegalis, and retired himſelfe to Buda to aduiſe of his affayres. On the other ſide, the ſouldiours who were in garriſon within Leuante (ſituated at the foote of the mountaines) going into the field to aſſaile the Turks, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> by them badly entreated, and there were many amongſt them who remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned priſoners there, and amongſt others was <hi>Bartholmew Horuatte,</hi> a man of great valour.</p>
            <p>Fiue miles from Iauerin, and two from Comar is the Fortreſſe of Tata. From thence the Emperiall ſouldiours, which were in the neighbouring places, daily receiued great loſſes, this place being wel munitioned and kept. Count Salm deſiring to raſe this Fort, departed with his people from Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin early in the morning the 21. of Iuly, and arriued about euening before Tata, with a reſolution not to depart from this enterpriſe without conqueſt <note place="margin">Tata taken by Count Salm from the Turkes.</note> thereof. Being there arriued, he ſent for to come before him (after faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> pledged) a Turke whom he knew. He (by the permiſſion of his Captaine) came to him, and the Count deſirous to perſwade him that all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſhould doe well to yeeld themſelues; promiſing ſafetie of life to all of them: this Turke anſwered, that they had rather a good deſire valiantly to defend themſelues, being otherwiſe aſſured that the Baſha of Buda would not faile to come and ſuccour them if neede were: that neuertheleſſe he thanked him of this friendly offer which he made him, whereof he would aduertiſe his companions, and promiſed him to returne within one houre, if they were determined to yeeld, deſiring him in the meane time not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any thing, aſſuring him that by thoſe of the towne he ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any damage. With this mutuall promiſe the Turke being returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the towne, and the houre being paſſed, the Count ſeeing not any perſon to come to him from thoſe of the towne, cauſed his Artillerie to be planted to begin his batterie, againſt which the Turks hauing 14. peeces of Cannon, ceaſed not to ſhoote one againſt another vntill night: and during this, the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:21983:170"/>
Count cauſed to be remoued ſixe peeces into a commodious place to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his breach, and betimes in the morning he cauſed them ſo furiouſly to play, that incontinently a gap was laid open in the wall. But the Turks with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diligence in ſuch ſort repayred the damage, that they gaue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to our people to come to the aſſault. Neuertheleſſe the Count ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Colonell <hi>Villardun</hi> with his companies to goe to the breach, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding all the reſt of the armie to raunge themſelues in battaile. A 1000. ſouldiours ſhould giue an aſſault with ladders in paſſing the water euen vnto the girdle, and 1000 others were appointed to goe to the breach, whileſt that altogether they boldly aſſayling it, the Count with other 2000. aſſayled the Caſtle gate. The Turkes going to the defences, as well at the breach, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thoſe who were in the ditch, valiantly for a time defended themſelues againſt them. But the port was battered downe, and the Count entering in by it, the Turkes performing the dutie that hardie and bold ſouldiours could doe in ſuch neceſſitie, were all by him cut in peeces, except 50. who being retired into a Tower, yeelded themſelues vnder certaine conditions. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe was the Captaine of Tata, and he who commaunded laſt at Veſprimia, and a kinſman of the Baſha of Buda, all three greatly eſteemed. Theſe were ſent to Vienna. This ſurpriſe and that of Veſprimia greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced the Emperour.</p>
            <p>The Count continuing in ſo fortunate ſucceſſe, cauſed his people (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſtaying in any place) to march to the Caſtle of Gheſtez, from whence <note place="margin">Gheſtez and Vithain taken from the Turkes.</note> the Turkes perceiuing the Vauntgard, they preſently fled, abandoning with the place all their munition and Artillerie. For the like feare, thoſe who were within the Caſtles of Vithain, Iſcholchin, and other villages, took their flight, and retired to Strigonium, after they had ſet fire on their munition, for feare the enemie ſhould preuaile thereby. The taking of theſe Caſtles, for that they were ſituated vpon the way which goeth from Comar to Strigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, brought great profit to <hi>Maximilians</hi> affayres, becauſe they might eaſily aduance themſelues euen to this towne, without leauing behinde any place which was in the enemies hands: and ſpecially becauſe that in theſe high ſituated places ordinarily retired a good number of Martelots, who are pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
               <note place="margin">Martelots wicked pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</note> theeues, and without faith, who by their robberies ruinated all that countrie: theſe people being of ſo ſtrong force, that in reſpect of their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage they care not for any paine, trauaile, or daunger.</p>
            <p>The Emperour (who yet was not gone into the field ſo ſoone as he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined) as well by reaſon of the preparations to which he daily gaue order, as for that the appointed troupes through all the Emperiall States were not yet arriued, and alſo for that he was afterward aſcertained that the Turk was not paſſed Belgrade, and that there he ſhould ſoiourne, attending the reſt of his armie, conſidering that the goodlieſt ordinances that might bee are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and that men trauaile in vaine to defend their townes, except God preſerued them; for this conſideration he ordained that they ſhould pray to God without any intermiſſion, commaunding vnder great penalties, that at certaine nominated houres at the ſound of a bell, euery one in Vienna ſhould kneele downe, and pray to God for the good and preſeruation of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:21983:171"/>
the publike weale, in ſuch ſort that all the Lords of what degree or qualitie they were of, ſhould not faile to deſcend from their horſes at the ſound of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the ſaid Bell if they were then in the towne. Beſides he cauſed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited all manner of ſports and pleaſant paſtimes; exhorting euery one to indeauour by good workes to appeaſe the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Emperials deſiering to execute the enterpriſe of Strigonia, and ſetting this matter before the Councell to be conſidered of, they ſent to <hi>Maximilian</hi> to know of him his aduiſe. The anſwer and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was, that he ſhould not prepare himſelfe with ſo ſmall an armie to a towne of ſo great importance, and which was no leſſe ſtrong and alſo well furniſhed then Buda. On the contrarie, the Emperour ſent to Count Salm, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that becauſe Tata was a place farre diſtant from Danubius, and not eaſily to be victualed, or to conduct victuals thither, he ſhould directly retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from thence, right ouer againſt Comer along the riuer, and there to expect him, hoping within a while to come and ioyne with him.</p>
            <p>The Turkes thinking on nothing elſe ranne ouer all the Countrie, and at Carpon (where was Captaine <hi>Bruſchitty)</hi> they tooke and led away 40. peiſants, who were reaping corne, and were taken by the Caſtle gate as they were drinking and taking their repaſt. The Captaine moued to ſee ſo bolde an act done before his eyes, preſently ſallied forth, and tooke three of thoſe Turkes, and had ſtayed the reſt if the ſouldiours would haue followed him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> But the loſſe which they receiued by the Counte of Serin without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon was farre otherwiſe. He hauing had aduertiſement by his ſpie, that <hi>Halla Sangiach,</hi> and the Gouernour of the 5. Churches were come neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sighet with their troupes, yet he not knowing their determination, and that there they were incamped, he preſently went into the fielde to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them: and finding them drowſie he aſſailed them on the ſuddaine, and the Turkes not being able ſo inſtantly to range themſelues in battaile, the greateſt part of them were taken priſoners, and the other throwen into the water, and of thoſe who were ſlaine, were caried to Sighet 94. heads, with 16000. Ducats, many faire harneſſes, many Camels, Mules, ſiluer veſſell, tents, and other ſpoyle. The Sangiach there valiantly defending himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> loſt one of his hands, and was conſtrained to yeeld himſelfe.</p>
            <p>In the end the Emperour hauing receiued the ſuccours which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, <note place="margin">Ferdinand Lieutenant General in the armie of the Emperour Maximilian his brother.</note> publiſhed <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (Arch Duke of Auſtria) his brother his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall in this Armie, to whom was Lieutenant Count of Schu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artzemburge: and committed the charge of the Artillerie to <hi>Paul</hi> of Zara; and the 12. of Auguſt his Maieſtie departed from Vienna with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Enſigne, which was commaunded by the Lord of Arach, hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him for his Lieutenant the Marſhall of Vnghemad, and the Guidon was caried by the Duke of Pomerania. His Maieſtie marched towards At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg diſtant two miles from Iauerin while al the horſe of Bohemia came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to Poſſon, which conſiſted of 7.

The Morauians, Sleſians, and Luſatians made beſides the reſt a good ſhew of horſe. <hi>Vratiſlauia</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:21983:171"/>
ſent 300. horſe. All theſe troupes with others who followed <hi>Maximilian,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> made to the number of 10000. horſe, beſides thoſe who alreadie were at Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerin, and at Comar. All the Armie being aſſembled at Altemburg, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour marched to Iauarin, there being at the ſame time arriued at Comar the Nauale Armie which came a long Danubius. Preſently there paſſed many skirmiſhes, in which for the moſt part the Emperials had the better. The more to ſtrengthen the Armie, his Maieſtie cauſed the other troupes to come which were at Comar, hoping to enterpriſe vpon Strigonium, and by the taking of this towne, to diuert the ſiege (which was feared ſhould be made by the enemie) before Sighet and Iula. For to giue battaile, (although neceſſitie ſeemed ſo to require) it was not requiſit, leaſt they might hazard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the whole eſtate of the Empire in one battaile, which is alwaies vncertaine and doubtfull: and on the other ſide, the Emperour had not ſuch forces that he could aſſure himſelfe of victorie. The enterpriſe neuertheleſſe of Strigonium was yet then deferred for ſome good reſpects.</p>
            <p>Vpon this, newes came that <hi>Solyman</hi> was paſſed the riuer of Tiſſa, and that <note place="margin">Solyman ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrie.</note> of Danubius, and that alreadie he was on this ſide Sighet, hauing with great diligence, cauſed to be made in this towne a bridge vpon Drauus for the paſſage of his Armie: for performing whereof, he ſent before 25000. men. This bridge was erected in 16. daies, although it was in length 5500. fathum, and 14. broade: and for the building whereof, they vſed an infinit companie of boates, bound with Iron chaynes in place of piles, which they could not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vſe by reaſon of the deepenes of the riuer. Certaine dayes before, <hi>Solyman</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Solymans ſiege before Sighet.</note> had giuen the charge of the ſiege of Sighet to the Baſha of Boſſina, and to him of Armenia: but hauing vnderſtood the loſſe of Tata, and of Veſprimia, he ſent them to the ſuccours of the Baſha of Buda, and gaue the conduct of this ſiege to the Beglerbey of Armenia. He readily marched thither, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped himſelfe within a mile of the Fortreſſe. <hi>Solyman</hi> within a while after came himſelfe. This towne is ſituated in Hungarie vpon the confines of Croatia, in the middeſt of waters and mariſhes, which enuiron it on three ſides for the ſpace of more then a mile, and on the ſide of the firme land it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hath but one entrance, which is defended with two great Bulwarkes made of earth and wood, well combined and bound together. It is compoſed of two townes made in frame of a Fortreſſe, with a Caſtle cloſed in with foure Courtaines in a ſquare forme. Betweene the one and other there are good deepe ditches full of running water. In this place commaunded for the Emperour <hi>Nicholas Eſdrin</hi> Count of Serin, of whom we haue often before <note place="margin">Nicholas Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin Count of Se-rin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded at Sighet.</note> ſpoken. He was Nephew to the Lord <hi>Torguat</hi> by reaſon of his ſiſter, and there was giuen vnto him the office of Banambt in the kingdomes of Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Dalmatia, and Sclauonia, which is as much as Bailife or Seneſhall: and beſides he was Mundſchencken of Hungarie, that is to ſay, great Butler: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Captaine generall for the Emperour about Danubius. He was preſent at the ſiege of Vienna, which heretofore we haue deſcribed in the former bookes: and for his valour which in this ſiege was knowen and obſerued by euery one, he was recompenced with a faire horſe and a chaine of golde. He was alſo ſufficiently made knowen at the ſiege of Peſthe and Buda. This
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:21983:172"/>
Captaine (a Hungar by birth) had in this place 1200. ſouldiours to defend it. The Turke (greatly to annoy <hi>Maximilian,</hi> beſides the beſieging of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> place) ſent 35000. men, as well Tartars as Turkes, to beſiege Iula. But the waters hindered them to doe it: and at their retraict thoſe within ſallied forth, and charged them behinde ſo hotly, that many of the enemies remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there.</p>
            <p>Certaine daies after, the Turks being returned thither, they beſieged this place very ſtraightly, battering the towne with great peeces: but they coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their fury, and ſeeming careleſſe, thoſe within ſeeing their countenance, in the night ſallied forth: and thus ſurpriſing the enemie, killed many of them, and cauſed the other to retire, in ſuch ſort, that they remained maſters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of their Artillerie, which they choked and rammed vp, the enemie not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to carrie it away. The Tartars (who at that time might eaſily haue aſſailed <hi>Schuendy,</hi> who then had not many people with him, and who for that occaſion daily importuned the Emperour to haue freſh ſuccours) hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſome countrie men, and knowing of them by ſuppoſed ſpeeches that <hi>Schuendy</hi> had with him 20000. men: vpon theſe words they were ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſuddenly they raiſed the ſiege: and ſpoyling the countrie all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, they fiered fiue villages, vſing a marueilous crueltie euery where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpecting any ſexe or condition, but following their barbarous cuſtome they put all to fire and ſword. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time the Turkes (after the batteries and breaches made at Sighet, by meanes of high Forts which <hi>Mahomet</hi> Baſha (commaunding all the armie) had cauſed to be raiſed) had giuen eight furious aſſaults: and the 29. of Auguſt they gaue thereto a generall aſſault, which continued 24. houres. But the beſieged defended themſelues ſo couragiouſly, that after they had killed a great number of the enemies, and taken the Captaine of the Ianiſaries, they alwaies valiantly repulſed them. The ſtinke of the dead bodies was ſo great, that <hi>Solyman</hi> was forced to recoyle foure miles off. <hi>Serin</hi> ſeeing he had loſt in theſe aſſaults many of his people, cauſed the towne to bee fiered, and retired himſelfe to two other Forts. This retraict gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to the Turkes to giue yet another aſſault vpon the day of the behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of S. <hi>Iohn, Solyman</hi> truſting in this day, which he eſteemed very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for him in all his battailes, hauing on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day obtained this notable and memorable victorie which he had againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> King of Hungarie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on the ſame day wonne the townes of Rhodes and Buda, and defeated in battaile the armie of the King of Perſia. This fortune neuertheleſſe failed the Turkes at this time, and they were yet valiantly repulſed. The day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which was the 30. of that moneth, they yet againe returned to the aſſault with greater furie, and with ſuch courage, that their Enſignes were ſeene vpon the Rampiars: but neuertheleſſe they were repulſed euen with great ſlaughter of them. <hi>Solyman</hi> conſidering the tediouſnes of this ſiege, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and the valiantnes of <hi>Serin,</hi> cauſed to bee offered to this Captaine a very good offer, if he would yeeld to him. But theſe offers could nothing moue the faith which the Count had ſworne to <hi>Maximilian.</hi> Notwithſtanding, if the Emperour had had good Spies who would haue informed him of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:21983:172"/>
trueth, or if at leaſt he had credited the reports which was made him, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> without all doubt that with proſperous ſucceſſe he ſhould haue finiſhed this warre: for that then was taken a Turke of good qualitie, who after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted libertie, ſwore and affirmed vpon his head that <hi>Solyman</hi> was dead: the which was confirmed by other demonſtrations. The Emperour not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding would not beleeue any thing hereof, iudging that if ſuch a thing were happened, it could not be poſſible that the Turkiſh armie ſhould bee in ſuch quiet, nor ſo well gouerned. But the prudence and marueilous induſtrie of <hi>Mehemet</hi> Baſha (a moſt wiſe Lord) knew ſo well to manage this matter, that not onely he concealed the death of his Lord: but yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſſured the Empire vnto him to whom it belonged: and (which is of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> no leſſe conſequence) contained ſo great an armie in militarie obedience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the furie and ſedition of the Ianiſaries, preſerued the treaſure, and obtained a notable victorie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solyman</hi> was come into Hungarie with a puiſſant armie of 150000. men, which he diuided into many parts, whereof one was towards Iula in the confines of Hungarie adioynant to Tranſiluania, and another towards Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>het vpon the marches of Croatia. In this was his greateſt force, and there was himſelfe in perſon, to the end that his preſence ſhould the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the ſouldiours to the taking of this towne. But being now of the age of 66. yeeres, and being crazed, in reſpect of the labours of ſo long a voyage, and perhaps hauing his courage abated to ſee his people in ſo many aſſaults <note place="margin">The death of Solyman.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> repulſed, with ſo great a butcherie of them: and it may bee this accuſtomed valour of minde being no longer in him, with which he before had happely brought to end ſo many goodly enterpriſes, the humours of his bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted, a bloody flux troubled him, which within few daies took him out of this world. And thus the prognoſtication (which in the moneth of May before going, had been made touching the anuall reuolution of this Prince, by thoſe that had been curious to know that which heauen did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe touching this warre) fell out to be true. This prognoſtication contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">The progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication of the death of Solyman.</note> that the Emperour of Turkes ſhould dye there, if peraduenture he was not ouerthrowne and defeated by the Chriſtians, notwithſtanding the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> leauie of people which he made againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mehemet</hi> Baſha ſeeing his Prince dead, and Sighet yet vntouched as it <note place="margin">The maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Baſha.</note> were, and in poſſeſſion of the Chriſtians, preſently thought that it was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to keepe this death ſecret, as well for the continuance of this ſiege and taking of the place, as for the preſeruation of the armie and treaſure; as alſo to inueſt the new <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> in the poſſeſſion of the Empire, to whom of right it belonged. Vpon this reſolution he readily diſpatched a meſſenger to the Baſha of Conſtantinople, to aduertiſe him of the fortune which was happened, and he ſent him word of that which was neceſſarie for him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> doe. Then with a ſingular ſubteltie, knowing that the ſouldious would bee offended if they ſaw not their Lord, he cauſed the bodie to be clothed with his accuſtomed habits, and ſetting him in a high place within his Pauilion, cauſed him a farre off to bee ſhewed to all, without that any of them could know that he was dead. This being thus well inuented, <hi>Mehemet</hi> went forth
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21983:173"/>
of the Pauilion, and taking occaſion thereupon began to encourage the Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries, exhorting them to performe their laſt endeuour to the aſſault of Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>het. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> But while he was ſpeaking, and calling to minde that his Lord was dead, he could not for the griefe which he felt in his minde refraine from wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. And as this paſſion was pricking, his wiſedome to couer it was alſo very readie, in ſuch ſort, that preſently remembring that his teares gaue to the ſouldiours ſome apprehenſion and aſſurance of the death of their prince, vpon ſome little bruite which alreadie was ſpread in the Camp, vſing a braue ſtratagem in wiſely diſſembling his inward griefe, added to his ſpeeches, that he wept not for the death of his Lord, as it ſeemed they iudged, who (thanks be to God) was liuing and out of all daunger. But that he wept for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and pitious condition of all the armie, for that their Prince had made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> an inuiolable oth, laying hand on his breaſt and head, that if within few daies Sighet were not taken, he would put them all to death without remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with a cruell and ſtrange kinde of death. <hi>Mehemet</hi> by theſe ſpeeches and many others, animating euery one, a ſingular deſire of fight, and alſo preſently to returne to the aſſault, poſſeſſed all the ſouldiours, and aboue all, the Ianiſaries being all obſtinate to performe therein their laſt endeuours, or elſe to end their liues there. Vpon this reſolution, after he had giuen order to that which appertained to ſuch an aſſault, all the ſouldiours running with great furie to the breach and skaladoe the 6. of September, they were neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe repulſed with great loſſe both of the one part and other. But the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hauing meanes to refreſh them, and continuing their blowes, came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for the laſt time the day following to the breach, with a marueilous fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and a greater force then they had yet euer made, and the one and other fighting betweene hope to ouercome and feare to dye, there was ſeene a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible conſlict now on this ſide, then on the other. Count <hi>Serin</hi> performing then the dutie of an aduiſed and moſt valiant Captaine, encouraging his people, ranne here and there, not being wanting either to himſelfe or to his ſouldiours, appeared greater then himſelfe. He ſeeing that the Artillerie of the enemie had ſet fire in the Fortreſſe, and being aſtoniſhed thereat, cauſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the port to bee opened, and hauing planted a Cannon (charged with many little bullets) at the enterance of it, and giuing fire thereto, more then 100. Turkes were layd on the ground by that ſhot, and preſently the Count ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced himſelfe vpon the bridge with his Courtlaſſe and Target, being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of his people, who of 1200. were reduced onely to 500. and they all thronging in amongſt the enemies fought valiantly. <hi>Serin</hi> would neuer yeeld himſelfe, although the Turks deſired him to doe it, willing to haue him aliue into their hands: but alwaies fighting couragiouſly in the middeſt of the enemies, increaſed in himſelfe an incredible valour: and thus managing his hands with extreame courage, was thruſt into the breaſt with a pike. But he fearing to abate the courage of his people, concealed this wound as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> much as he could, vntill in the end he was greatly wounded in the head with <note place="margin">The death of Count Serin.</note> a blow which killed him. And although that the ſouldiours deſiſted not, yet could they not make ſuch reſiſtance as they did before: ſo auaileable in ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours hearts is the Captaines preſence: from whence it happened that Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>het
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:21983:173"/>
was preſently taken, and all thoſe who were taken, within a few daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <note place="margin">Sighet taken by the Turks.</note> were all cruelly maſſacred by the Turkes. The head being cut from the bodie of this valiant Count, it was ſent by the Baſha of Buda to Count <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> of Salm, wrapped in a peece of blacke veluet, with letters, by which he declared vnto him, that hauing vnderſtood that this braue warrier who had ſo faithfully maintained the part of his Emperour, was his kinſman &amp; friend, he was willing to ſend him his head, to the end it ſhould bee a beginning of an obligation of mutuall friendſhip betweene them, ſending him word that he had cauſed his bodie to be honourably buried. Some beleeued that the Baſha did this more to poſſeſſe him with griefe and ſome aſtoniſhment, then for any office of humanitie or curteſie that was naturally in him. This head <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was carried by a peaſant to Comar, and from thence to Iauerin to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Campe: to whoſe Maieſtie then came one of the ſonnes of <hi>Serin,</hi> and proſtrated himſelfe at his feete, to deſire him that with his good fauour he might hold his fathers place, &amp; of all his familie. The Emperour raiſed him with his hands, and promiſed to be to him a good Tutor, and as a father to all his houſe. This ſonne after he had taken leaue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor, being followed with a good number of gentlemen, went to the Fortreſſe of Iskachaturn, and cauſing his fathers head to bee conducted thither, made it honourably to be buried with great pompe. The towne of Sighet came in this ſort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enemies hands, it being opened on all ſides by the violence of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The Emperour loſt there to the number of 100. peeces of Cannon, which <hi>Serin</hi> ſeeing that he had no more hope, cauſed them to bee charged euen to the mouth, and put fire thereto, ſo that they were all cleft and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. If this Count had had ſufficient of ſouldiours, he had neuer ſeene it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this point, hauing neither want of armes nor victuals. Of 1200. ſouldiours which he had at the beginning of the ſiege, there remained no more the 110. when he was wounded to death. By this loſſe the port was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Turkes to moleſt the reſt of Hungarie. For from this place they might runne without any impeachment vnto Sopron, called Odembourg, and euen to the walles of Poſon. Amongſt the moſt of marke who dyed in <note place="margin">Sopron called Odemburg.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this ſiege of the Turkes part, was noted <hi>Alipartu</hi> Baſha, who for Sea affayres was held to bee very expert, and for one of the valianteſt of all the Turkiſh Captaines.</p>
            <p>After the taking of this place, the Turkes diſperſed themſelues by incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions through all the countrie, and euen in ſight of the Emperour, who was greatly diſcontented for this loſſe, and the death of <hi>Serin.</hi> By theſe excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the countrie was greatly endamaged, Fortune being altogether ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable to the enemy, that ſhe not being content to haue brought him ſuch happie ſucceſſe, added yet thereto the winning of the towne and Fortreſſe of Iula, which in the ſame weeke was reduced vnder the Turks commaund, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> although this place was iudged inexpugnable. Captaine <hi>Ladiſlas Cheretsken</hi> commaunded there.

with his armes and baggage ſaued, with hoſtages for aſſurance of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> who ſhould accompanie him and his people vnto ſome place of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, <note place="margin">Giuſa taken by the Turks.</note> and that the Turkiſh Artillerie ſhould be diſplaced and turned into ſome place, where it could not endamage them. Vpon ſuch conditions the Captaine being come forth, he was lead before the Baſha, and in the meane time that the others marched, being not yet 1000. paces off, two great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Turkes aſſailed them. They ſeeing themſelues thus deceiued, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelues altogether within their waggons, and for a while valiantly defended themſelues, and ſpecially the Germanes who with their harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze ſhot killed many of the enemies. But in the end being ſurmounted with a great number, they were conſtrained to yeeld to the enemie who almoſt cut them all to peeces, except ſome who ſaued themſelues, amongſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> which was <hi>Bernard Rotenau</hi> a Germane Captaine, who afterward being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the Emperiall Maieſtie, accuſed <hi>Cheretsken</hi> of treaſon, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made an accorde without the knowledge of his companions. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe by the reporte of an Hungarian ſouldiour, who afterwards came to the Campe, they knew that the Captaine had conferred of this ſurrender with the Germanes, and that thoſe for certaine would not yeeld at the firſt: but that afterwards ouercome by the promiſes and great perſwaſions of the Turkes, they conſented thereto.</p>
            <p>Neere to Alberegalis there was 20000. Turkes incamped and fortified with good trenches, who made many attempts towards the Emperiall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Campe. The Emperour willing to ſuppreſſe this inſolencie, choſe out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his armie, and with a few of his ſouldiours ſent them to diſcouer. Afterward hauing firſt ſent to the Turkes certaine ſpies to know how the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie behaued themſelues there, they marching before, and meeting with thoſe who were of the guard, and ſeeing them well armed returned to make recital of that which they had ſeene, &amp; might diſcerne by the enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. The Emperials notwithſtanding all other difficultie, being gone forth, marched towards them, and going with good ſpeede they ſurpriſed them, and aſſayling them on the ſuddaine put them to flight, killing ſome of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them who were gone a forraging. This newes being carried to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Campe, the Hungars, Burgunnians, and Auſtrians, couragiouſly put themſelues into the field, and purſuing the Turks who fled, they killed ſome and tooke others. <hi>George Tury</hi> hauing knowne amongſt them the Sangiach of Alberegalis, a great Councellor of the Turkes, (whom he might verie well know, becauſe that while he was at Pallota he had been his neighbour, and had perſued him oftentimes to take him) he boldly thruſt himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middeſt of them all, &amp; followed him ſo neere, that although his horſe was ſlaine vnder him, yet being readily remounted vpon another, he tooke him a liue and brought him priſoner to the Emperour, at whoſe hand for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſo valerous an act he was knighted, and the Sangiach was conducted to Vienna, where he remained a long time priſoner.</p>
            <p>At another time 1500. horſe being, gone forth of the Campe to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certaine Turkes, they made forward as farre as Iſcocaky belonging to the enemies, two miles from Alberegalis. But they did not any exployt,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21983:174"/>
there paſſing nothing betweene the two Camps but light skirmiſhes, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which <hi>George Tury</hi> more then once gaue chaſe to the enemies, and brought from them good ſpoyle. At the ſame time, the Arch Duke <hi>Charles</hi> being at Bubolca, defeated a Baſha with 4000. horſe by the riuer of Sleuua, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he had taken him, if the armie that was at Sighet had not been ſo nigh, he retyring himſelfe to the Caſtle of Carotua, a very ſtrong place which is ſituated in an Iland which Drauus and Murus maketh.</p>
            <p>All theſe excurſions greatly increaſed from the time of the taking of Sighet, and the Turkes pilled, burned, and waſted all euen neere vnto Sabar, diſtant two miles from the Emperiall Campe. By theſe excurſions many Captaines experienced in the manner of the Turkiſh warre, beleeued that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>Solyman</hi> would retire to Conſtantinople, and that ſomuch the more, becauſe they vnderſtoode that in his armie was a great dearth of victuals, and that there was ſome taken from Buda and Alberegalis to ſend thither. Beſides they heard that <hi>Solyman</hi> was dead, and that the Baſha giuing this laſt ruine to the Countrie, would depart with his accompliſhed victorie. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it ſeemed that is would be a ſtrange thing, if there happened not ſome ſedition in this armie, knowing that in like caſes the Turkes are verie eaſily moued to mutine. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> entertained, and that with great care, theſe courſes to ſtay his owne armie and that of the enemies, he daylie expecting the comming of <hi>Selim</hi> their new Emperour, and <hi>Solymans</hi> ſonne, to whom he had ſent, that in the greateſt ſpeede he could, he ſhould depart from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> When <hi>Selim</hi> receiued the newes of his fathers death, he was in <note place="margin">Selim the ſonne and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman.</note> the plaine of Saraiſſa, three dayes iourney from Conſtantinople, in a place called Chiefredy, which belonged to <hi>Sinan</hi> Baſha.

And hauing offered there a great ſumme of monie, and ſaid his prayers, he returneth in great pompe and pleaſure to his Palace: from whence he departed the 26. of September to goe to his Campe, making great iournies, and without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any place at laſt he arriued at Belgarde hauing made this voyage in great ſpeed, and ſo ſecretly that the people marueiling to ſee him, knew not the occaſion of his comming but onely after his departure: which cauſed that not any tumult happened, whereof euery one greatly marueiled, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards how all was paſſed.

            <p>Thus his Maieſtie ſoiourned in that place, attending the Armie which was conducted by a deade bodie, carried in a cloſe couered Coach, euery one beleeuing that he was liuing: becauſe that he being in this his olde age for certaine yeares together ſubiect to the goute, he was accuſtomed to be carried into the fields in this ſorte.</p>

            <p>But now to returne to our diſcourſe: the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for certaine the death of <hi>Solyman,</hi> and coronation of <hi>Selim,</hi> (which was ſeuen weekes after) it being ſent to him from Venice by <hi>Guy</hi> of Noremberg his Ambaſſadour, reſident in the Seigniorie of Venice for his Maieſtie. All the Captaines were greatly aſtoniſhed thereat, conſidering how and with what prudence theſe barbarous people were able to keepe ſo ſecret ſuch a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> notable accident, in ſuch ſort that their owne armie neuer knew any thing thereof. Which thing (if it had been diſcouered) had without all doubt bin an occaſion that the ſouldiours mutining to ſacke the treaſure, had opened a way to the Emperour to attaine to a moſt euident and ſingular victorie. But Baſha <hi>Mehemet</hi> in his owne iudgement foreſeeing all the diſorder, and knowing that of his Lords life depended the good of all the armie, meant to prouide for it in time: and for this cauſe he concealed the death of <hi>Solyman,</hi> to the end that the armie ſhould not perceiue it ſelfe depriued of their Lord, and that in diuiding it ſelfe it ſhould not by that meanes open the way of a notable victorie to the enemie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>After then that the Turkiſh armie was departed out of Hungarie, there happened a new diſaſter at Iauerin, (where was the force of the Emperiall <note place="margin">Iauerin bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> Campe) there being the laſt of September fire ſet on the lodging of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian Lord, by negligence of his Cooke. This fire by little and little increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo farre, by meanes of a great winde which blew from the Weſt, that all

the houſes being made of wood (after the manner of that countrie) not any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> houſe was exempted from burning, except the Palace and Church which were built of ſtone, and about ſome 17. little houſes: and it was a great chance that this fire pearced not euen into the Church, wherein was all the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which if it had happened, it had brought a great misfortune, for that the towne (although it be litttle) was ſtored and filled with ſouldiours, and of all other ſorts of people who had followed this armie: and for feare of this inconuenience, the Emperour mounted preſently on horſebacke, and with great ſpeede retired farre from the towne. That which was not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the fire, ſerued as a pray to the ſouldiours, ſome of whom moſt wickedly put fire to certaine houſes, that they might more freely get pillage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> as they did. The Emperour was ſo ſad for this misfortune, that he neuer felt any ſuch griefe in all theſe warres, hauing alwaies reſerued this place for the ſuretie of his armies: and ſeeing that therein all the neighbours did vſually retire their goods and perſons, and ſpecially of all the countrie thereabouts, his Maieſtie commaunded that this place ſhould bee reeſtabliſhed by the ſouldiours and peaſants. And the winter being come, and the enemie reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">Maximilian diſmiſſeth his armie.</note> he diſmiſſed his armie, and moſt affectionatly he thanked all the Lords, who ſo willingly were come to ſuccour him: and this done, he retired to Vienna, leauing at Iauerin a good and ſtrong garriſon of the braueſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianteſt ſouldiours of the armie, as well foote as horſe vnder the charge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Count Salms. He preſently cauſed the place to be repayred, by the money which the Emperour had ſent him from Vienna. The troupes of Auſtria were ſent to Odemburg to reſiſt the ordinarie incurſions of the Turkes. In Caniſa (a Fortreſſe very nigh to Sighet) was ſent to commaund there Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Thay,</hi> with 1000. horſe, and as many footmen.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Emperour called the Eſtates of Auſtria into the towne of Vienna, to aduiſe of new preparations for the yeere following, as well in Hungarie as in Tranſiluania, where alwaies continued the warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and King <hi>Iohn,</hi> for whoſe ayde remained <hi>Portau</hi> Baſha with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tartars, who ſurpaſſing ours in multitude and crueltie, maſſacred all thoſe that they encountred, not pardoning any ſexe, and without any diſtinction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>

               <hi>Iohn</hi> being with his armie before Tocchay, where alreadie he had been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> eight daies, and hoping to come to the end of his enterpriſe, he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that 10000. Tartars, who warred with the Turkes in his fauour, being mutined and departed from the Campe, were diſperſed in his Prouince, committing infinite outrages, and burning many townes. <hi>Iohn</hi> vpon this newes raiſed his ſiege: and hauing ſent to theſe mutiners, that they ſhould <note place="margin">A mutinie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Tartars and King Iohn.</note> quietly retire themſelues, he vſed all the meanes not to meddle with them by fight. In the end, ſeeing that intreaties and all perſwaſions ſerued him to no purpoſe, and that continuing their crueltie, they would by no meanes deſiſt, moued by a iuſt choller he aſſailed them on the ſudden, and cut in peeces more then 6000. of them.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe <hi>Iohn</hi> fearing the worſt, and not willing to haue the reproach to be beſieged by ſuch raskalitie, ſecretly auoyded the towne, and retired to an other place of more ſtrength. There hauing gathered a greater armie he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine aſſailed them, and hauing made a great butcherie of them to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 20000. beſides the wounded who were in great number, he ſaued <note place="margin">Tartars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by King Iohn.</note> from their hands many thouſands of ſoules, who they led into miſerable ſeruitude. Among theſe were many gentlewomen, which they had taken from the Caſtle of Beregras, to which they were retired for the greater ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all that countrie remaining in the meane time (which is towards Caſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia) ſo deſolate, for the great and horrible cruelties which theſe people had vſed, that it was not poſſible to endure any more.</p>
            <p>During ſuch mutinies, 400. Ianiſaries paſſed very neere to Filech, a place neighbouring to Sepuſa, committing where they paſſed infinit outrages, and vſing acts altogether barbarous and cruell: and hauing taken out of the mountaines more then 8000. ſoules, they gaue a great amazement to all the neighbour people of Danubius, of Vagne, and of Arabon. The Turkes a little before had taken two Forts (ſuch as they were) named Comar and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambach, <note place="margin">Comar, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambach, Gheſtez, and Vitan taken by the Turks.</note> as alſo thoſe of the garriſon of Alberegalis had done the like, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> themſelues by forces of Gheſtez, and Vitan: and thus daily increaſing, there was at Palota, Veſprimia, and at Tata a great doubt of the enemie.

            <p>The Emperour being at the aſſemblie of his Eſtates of Auſtria, whom he <note place="margin">A Diet in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria, in which was granted ſuccours to Maximilian.</note> cauſed to bee called thither (as wee aboue haue written) propoſed to all the

Prelates and principall of the Nobilitie, what neede he had of ſuccours to withſtand the violence of the enemies. And for this effect he demaunded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of them the ſame ſuccours as was graunted the yeere before, which amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to little leſſe then 300000.

And becauſe that although his Maieſtie would march in perſon to the warre, he would not that the Nobilitie of the countrie ſhould goe thither with him, and in ſtead of ſuch a perſonall ſeruice, he demaunded of them that they would furniſh him with the pay of 1000. horſe, and 5. companies of foote.

This laſt offer was in ſtead of 1000. horſe, which he demaunded to ſerue him in place of the Nobilitie. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe accords, the Auſtrians minding to renew againe the article of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Confeſſion of Ausbourg, being not content with the deniall which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had made them thereof, meant againe to replie.

            <p>In the meane time, endeuouring himſelfe to aſſure his countries againſt the incurſions of the Turkes, who remained with the Tranſiluanian from the death of <hi>Solyman,</hi> he laboured nothing elſe but to make peace with the Turkes, knowing that <hi>Selim</hi> (after being come to the Empire) had confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med peace with the Venecians, who among ſo great warres which his father had, would neuer take armes againſt him, although they were often requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> thereunto.</p>

In the end he deſired all his friends to make ſuite for him to the Emperours Maieſtie, ſignifying that he might bee ſet at libertie ſo ſoone as the Sangiach ſhould be deliuered in exchange of him: and being at libertie, he offered to remaine in ſuch a priſon as it would pleaſe his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, there to attend the iudgement which ſhould be giuen vpon his cauſe, not perceiuing himſelfe culpable in any thing. <hi>Cheretsken</hi> writ to <hi>Hoſſute</hi> concerning all theſe things, to the end he ſhould report them to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time it was held for certaine in the Court, that the Lord of Arrach might ſet at libertie the Sangiach of Alberegalis, whom he held pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in one of his Fortreſſes named Zetipont, to redeeme <hi>Cheretsken,</hi> there hauing been made (before this bad fortune) a treatie of mariage betweene them, this Lord hauing promiſed to <hi>Cheretsken</hi> one of his daughters.

The Lord of Arrach receiued great diſpleaſure at this death, for that he could not relieue him, and within a while after he had 50000. crownes for a ranſome of the Sangiach: and although that he ſhould remaine debter of another great ſumme, the Emperour neuertheleſſe would that he ſhould be ſet at libertie. He being ſet on his way, accompanied with <hi>Iohn Suizen</hi> a Councellor of Hungarie: and being arriued on the frontier, <hi>Suizen</hi> at his returne reported marueilous things of ioy and mirth that the Turkes made for the returne of this Lord. Beſides the money by him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed, they gaue libertie to Captaine <hi>Gorger,</hi> who was taken at Iula, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> who for his ranſome was taxed at 40000. crownes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Schuendy</hi> being now growne to good health from ſo long a ſicknes, and receiuing good ſtrong troupes, went into the field with his people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the Caſtle of Zatmar, well furniſhed with all things, except men. This belonged to Bec the Emperours capitall enemie, and the principall author <note place="margin">Zarmar taken by Schuendy.</note> of the enmitie and diſcord which was nouriſhed betweene his Maieſtie and King <hi>Iohn.</hi> He ſeeing they came to beſiege him, he ſecretly departed from this Fortreſſe, which being out of hand ſtraightly beſieged, in the end the ſouldiours within yeelded, their liues and baggage ſaued. This taking was vpon the 14. of Ianuarie, and in that place was gotten great ſtore of bootie: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and <hi>Schuendy</hi> freely ſetting at libertie the Becs wife, with all his moueables, retained onely for himſelfe all the Artillerie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> was in the meane time to continue the Diets of his Eſtates, and hauing been alreadie at Bruna, and after at Troppa, to goe from thence to Prage in Bohemia, in which places he made his demaunds: and at Bruna it was concluded, that in ſtead of the Nobilitie they ſhould giue him 1200. horſe, which his Maieſtie ſhould ſend whither it pleaſed him: and beſides that, the Nobilitie ſhould be bound to keep the limits of the countrie, when there ſhould bee neede thereof. He being arriued at Prage, he made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie thereinto very ſolemnely, being receiued by the Citizens vnder a Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, with great pompe and magnificence. From thence he ſent the Duke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Bauier, and Doctor <hi>Inuch</hi> his Councellor, with certaine other, to the Diet of Ratisbon. The Bohemians at the Diet held at Prage, accorded that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours before graunted for three yeeres ſhould bee reduced into one onely <note place="margin">The Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Sle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauians doe graunt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to the Emperour.</note> payment, ſeeing that the appointed money for this effect ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cuſtodie into a certaine place, and that theſe ſhould not come into his Maieſties coffers, except they were imployed againſt the Turke. Beſides, all the Eſtates graunted during the ſpace of two yeeres the ſuccours which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: to wit, that all the houſes being vnder the precinct of fees belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Princes, Barons, and Gentlemen, as well Spirituals as fenditaries, ſhould pay for one yeere halfe a Dollor, except the publike Bathes, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of Paſtors, and the ſhops of Artiſans: that the towne of Prage, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubiects to the Emperour, and thoſe who make the third eſtate of the kingdome, ſhould pay three Dollors for euery houſe. All the cities, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, and villages euery one, gaue 100. Duckets, the labourers 9. the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21983:178"/>
and mercinaries a white groſhe: thoſe who put mony to intereſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſpirituall as ſecular, payed ſo much to his Maieſtie which the intereſt came vnto by their bargaines: but if the Emperour ſhould goe in perſon to the warre againſt the Turke, they ſhould be bound hauing 10000. dollors at intereſt, to entertaine in the warre a horſeman well armed for foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths: and that the poorer ſorte ſhould contribute rate for rate of their goods: and the ſame ſhould be practiſed if they had neede for the defence of the 15. Dukedomes of Bohemia; to wit, in entertayning one horſeman <note place="margin">15. Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia.</note> well armed for euery reuenew of 6000. dollers, and 10. footemen for a 100. ſubiects which ſhould be vnder his fee. By this meanes the Emperour was ſuccoured from all parts with men and monie, to preuent any more a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſurpriſall by the enemie, when at any time he would againe make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into Hungarie.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Schuendy</hi> after one ſiege, had yeelded vnto him by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <note place="margin">Mourach ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Schu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endy.</note> their liues and baggage ſaued, the Caſtle of Mourach ſituated in Tranſiluania. All theſe preparations, and this loſſe gaue the Tranſiluanian ſufficient matter to thinke of: for that this Fortres was of great importance to him, being on the way betwixt Polonia and Ruſſia, from whence by this occaſion he could not draw any more ſuccours, except with a long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe by Moldauia, which was a very teadious and daungerous iourney. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this taking, <hi>Schuendy</hi> went to beſige Huſt a place of no leſſe importance then the other. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe enterpriſes and executions gaue vehement ſuſpition, that betweene the Emperour and the Turke would neuer be any accord, although after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both the one part and other treated thereof: conſidering that in precedent yeares, by reaſon of the ſame place of Mourach, all the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of peace was broken betweene <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> it being verie likely that the Tranſiluanian for the loſſe of theſe two places, would declare to the Grand Seigniour the abſolute loſſe of all Tranſiluania, and with all excite him to giue him ayde, as it appeared incontinent. For the Baſha of Buda fayled not to ſend to the Emperour that he ſhould cauſe <hi>Schuendy</hi> to retire from Huſt, and in the meane time tooke councell with his people to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for needfull ayde for King <hi>Iohn,</hi> giuing order to the affaires of the warre.</p>
            <p>In this time <hi>Edward</hi> being in returne from Conſtantinople, who the Emperour had ſent thither to treate of a peace, brought newes that the Turke had geuen charge to <hi>Portau</hi> Baſha, and to the Belerbie of Greece to prepare themſelues to march into Hungarie: but the ſame Turke hauing vnderſtoode for certaine, that the Emperour would ſend his Ambaſſadours to negotiate with him, and to determine the peace, he had hope that theſe would not haſten their voyage. Theſe Ambaſſadours were <hi>Antonie Verance</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ambaſſadours of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to Selim for peace.</note>

Theſe with a great companie departed from the Court to goe to Conſtantinople, the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:21983:179"/>
Emperour not omitting for all that to continew his Diets, to the end that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he might alwaies hold himſelfe more readie for defence againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
            <p>Then was celebrated that of Poſon, in which after many complaints made by the Hungarian Barons againſt certaine Captaines of garriſons, in the end it was determined by common conſent, that for this yeare they ſhould pay the Emperour 150000. Crownes, which ſumme ſhould not be <note place="margin">Succours graunted by the Hungars to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> drawen from any others, but of the families of peaſants, in paying for euery one two Dollors: and beſides euery familie ſhould be bound to labour 12. dayes in the frontier places: but in the yeare when any Diet ſhould not be held, the taxe ſhould at leaſt be reduced to the halfe: that the Emperour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſhould ſend Comiſſaries, part whereof ſhould be Hungars, and part Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, on this ſide, and beyond Danubius, to informe him of the goods and poſſeſſions held by the Captaines and officers of the Emperour, to the end to reſtore them to their firſt poſſeſſors: that they ſhould chaſtice all thoſe who had committed robberies, and that they ſhould giue order that theſe robbers ſhould not any more moleſt the labourers, that they ſhould adnihilate the grieuous and extraordinarie impoſitions layd vpon them by <hi>Schuendy,</hi> aſwell of wine as of beaſtes: that the Hungars not being receiued into the Countrie of Auſtria, nor into the other prouinces, might redeeme the Caſtles and townes engaged before by the King of Hungarie: that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Emperour ſhould graunt the Prelateſhip, and other eccleſiaſticall dignities onely to Hungars, and other perſons capable: that if his Maieſtie would retaine to himſelfe the recouered goods from the poſſeſſion of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluanian, which before appertayned to the Hungars, he ſhould then giue in recompence thereof ſome others: that the gentleman who had 100. vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages vnder him, ſhould according to the ancient cuſtome, furniſh 10. horſes and 8. footemen, when the Emperour ſhould goe in perſon to the warre, and leſſe by halfe when he ſhould ſend thither his Lieutenant, all amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto 10000. horſe and 8000. footemen: but in time of peace they ſhould be bound to furniſh but three horſes for defence of the frontiers. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> All this was decreed in the Diet of Poſon, whereof the Emperour was verie well content. And to appeaſe euery one he maintayned Iuſtice in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and cauſed to be chaſtiſed many Captaines of garriſons who purloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the pay from the ſouldiours, and beſides ſhewed to all great demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of frendſhip: which greatly contented all the people, &amp; ſpecially for the affection which he cauſed to appeare by hauing a deſire to ſee them liue in peace, which he inſtantly purſued, hauing the better to attaine thereunto, ſent by the ſaid Ambaſſadours many goodly preſents to the principall of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymans</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ambaſſadours arriued at Conſtantinople the 22. of Auguſt, and within few daies after viſited the Baſhaes of the Port (which we aboue ſaid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> call amongſt vs Court) to wit, <hi>Mehemet, Portau, Pialy, Achmat,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet:</hi> and the fourth of ſeptember, (being againe gone to ſee <hi>Mahomet</hi> Baſha ſuperintendant of all the Empire) they went with him vnto Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onopoly, where then was the new Emperour. In this place the conditions

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ende it was concluded with the ſame conditions, with which before it had been decreed betweene <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Solyman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours being returned to Vienna, they releaſed and quitted many things both of the one part and other, and new borders were limited betweene the countrie of both parts. And vpon this deede the Emperour ſent <hi>Schuendy</hi> with many other deputed to ſee the differences which might be vpon thoſe limits; beſides giuing him charge to finde the meanes to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the incurſions and inſolencies which the Turkes made without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the truce lately decreed. <hi>George Tury</hi> Captaine for the Emperour prouoked with ſuch courſes, after he had made complaint to the Baſha of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Buda, in the end he twice put himſelfe into the fielde, once by Caniſa, and an other time by Iauarin, and in ſuch ſort aſſayled the Turkes, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing checked their fooliſh temeritie, they durſt no more trouble the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Emperour for ſome ſuſpitions conceiued againſt ſome of the principall of Hungarie, cauſed the Hungars to be required (to diuert the practiſes, which <hi>Iohn</hi> vſed in their behalfe to draw them to him) to this, that they would contribute to the pay of 5000. horſe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the countrie: but they expreſſely denied this contribution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued at this, that the vacant goods were no more ſolde amongſt them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but were giuen to their enemies and to ſtrangers, making inſtance that ſince he could not any more aſſiſt them in his owne perſon in all important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the kingdome, hee would nominate Lieutenant generall for his Maieſtie, the Palatin, and Archbiſhop of Strigonia Primate of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <note place="margin">The Arch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Strigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Primate of Hungarie.</note> The Emperour then for that time diſſolued this Diet, and retired vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till another time. On the other ſide the Tranſiluanian ſought to the Baſha of Buda, thinking to demaund ayde of him, and to haue of him meanes to recouer that which was taken from him by his enemies, of whom he then thought to haue better commoditie, for that they were buſied in the wars of Germanie, and deuided amongſt themſelues. The Baſha aunſwered him that he could not doe it without the expreſſe commaund of his Lord, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him in the meane time to remaine in peace. But <hi>Iohn</hi> continuing his determination recouered certaine Fortreſſes: and hauing drawen to him <hi>Guilaſſa</hi> a Hungarian Baron, who was malecontent with the Emperour, he had of him Huſt, a verie ſtrong Caſtle, ſituated amongſt the mountaines of Salem, not being able to induce the Turke to breake truce with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
            <p>His Maieſtie (hauing vnderſtood that <hi>Selim</hi> had ſent an armie towards Muſcouia, by Podolia, and Kiania (Prouinces of the kingdome of Polonia) againſt the Duke of Muſcouia, who hindered the cutting which the Turke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> would haue made in (the riuer of <note place="margin">Huſt yeelded to King Iohn.</note>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:21983:180"/>
to cenſure hardly of him, if he defended himſelfe, aſſuring him that though he had not giuen any conſentment to ſuch new enterpriſes, yet he had giuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſufficient order and as much as was needfull, for oppoſing himſelfe againſt <hi>Iohn:</hi> but if this enterpriſe was done with his conſent, he not knowing of his <note place="margin">Maximilian complaineth to Selim of King Iohn.</note> part any occaſion thereof, he deſired him that he would at one word tel him, to the end he might iuſtifie his cauſe, or elſe freely to accept of warre. <hi>Selim</hi> anſwered him, that he had neither aduiſed nor conſented thereto, neither for the one nor other; and promiſed him if the Tranſiluanian or Moldauian were in armes to offend or diſturbe him, that both the one and other ſhould be by him puniſhed.</p>
            <p>The Emperour ſatisfied by this anſwere, afterwards laboured to doe ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> much to effect this, that certaine of the principall of the Hungars (who were diſcontent with him, for that they were not in ſuch eſteeme with his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, as they thought they had well deſerued) ſhould not proceede any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in rebellion, which alreadie began to be on foote towards Caſſouia and Tocchay, theſe Lords being prouoked thereto by the Tranſiluanian (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was knowne) who did ſolicite them with fayre promiſes, making on his part great preparations, the better to ſeaze himſelfe of certaine other important places. But the Turke writ to him that he ſhould deſiſt, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Selim threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth K.

The Hungars being thus remoderated and pacified <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> with their King, gaue order to repayre their Fortreſſes.</p>
            <p>In this time the Emperour would neuer condiſcend to the perſwaſions of <note place="margin">Maximilian ſolicited by the Pope and Venecians to make warre vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turke.</note> the Venecians or Pope to make warre vpon the Turke, ſaying, he well knew that in time matters would bee pacified, and he alone ſhould remaine char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the burthen of the warre. The cauſe which moued the Venecians to ſtirre vp as well the Emperour as other Chriſtian Monarches, was, that they might preuaile againſt the Turke, who had ſent to them a Chiauſs to demaund the kingdome of Cypreſſe, as depending on the Eaſt Empire: and well knowing that they had not forces ſufficient to withſtand ſo great a Lord, they did ſolicite the Pope that he would giue them ayde, and in like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſort to employ his Holines to all the Princes for the ſame effect: for which, they had diſpatched to his Emperiall Maieſtie <hi>Iacques Soranze</hi> a Venecian, a man greatly eſteemed, with charge to goe further to the King of Polonia. But the goodly and apparant reaſons of this man could effect nothing with <hi>Maximilian,</hi> for the onely conſideration which we haue ſaid: and faining himſelfe ill at eaſe, diſmiſſed <hi>Soranze,</hi> breaking all hope to ioyne Germanie in this league. <hi>Selim</hi> on the other part hauing ſome doubt that the Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanian would accord with the Emperour, (although he was well aſſured of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> by reaſon of the truce and many other buſineſſes diſpatched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) cauſed the towne of Buda to bee fortified, and other his places of Hungarie. The Pope not minding to be directed with the firſt word, by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> declarations that <hi>Maximilian</hi> had made, to the diſcourſes and perſwaſions which his Nonce had vſed to his Maieſtie: the Emperour to pleaſe his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, cauſed a Diet to be called at Spire, where hauing cauſed very largely to bee layd out the demaunds of the Pope and Venecians, with many offers

made to his Maieſtie by the Leaguers: after many aduices, it was reſolued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that they would doe no other thing therein, although they had certaine knowledge of more then one perſon, that there were there many of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals of the aſſembled, who freely and liberally would accord to the Popes demaunds, they being aduiſed that it was an excellent occaſion to preſerue Chriſtendome, and ſpecially Germanie and Hungarie from ſo many immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perils as enuironed them.</p>
            <p>With this reſolution the Diet was diſſolued, in which no other thing was <note place="margin">Maximilian reſigneth the kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia to his ſonne Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph.</note> done, but the voluntarie yeelding that the Emperour made to his ſonne <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph</hi> of the kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia, with the conſent of the Lords of both the kingdomes: in regard of which, they made at Vienna and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Iſpurch great feaſts and triumphs.</p>
            <p>Within a while after <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of Polonia ſent his Ambaſſadours to the ſaid <hi>Rodolph,</hi> to congratulate with him for the honours which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of his father: and within a very little while after this King (who was of the ancient houſe of <hi>Iagellons)</hi> departed this world.

For default of iſſue begotten by him, the Princes, and Lords of the kingdome (who haue authoritie for the election of a new King) aſſembled themſelues to chuſe another, there being remaining of the <hi>Iagellons</hi> but one ſiſter of the laſt deceaſed, not yet maried. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of this kingdome doth not ordinarily fall to the kindred of the dead, but commeth ſometimes by election, for which is made a great aſſemblie, tearmed amongſt them and the Germanes a Diet. In this there are preſent <note place="margin">The manner of the election of a King of Polonia.</note> fifteene Prelates of the kingdome: to wit, the Archbiſhop of Gneſna chiefe of all, and Legat natus for the Pope in Poland, the Archbiſhop of Leopolde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Biſhop of Carcouia, he of Vratiſlauia, the Biſhops of Chelmen, Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen, Varnia, Clunem, Preſmilia, and of Cameneren, which ten Biſhops are of the kingdome.

            <p>As this man thought to braue this Prince, on the other ſide the Duke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Saxonie was aſtoniſhed at the comming of this new King paſſing through his countrie, ſeeing neere him the Polonians in armes. In the end, <hi>Henry</hi> at <note place="margin">Henry recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued King of Polonia.</note> the beginning of the yeere entered into his kingdome, he being receiued thereinto with great applauſe: and after hauing againe ſworne the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of the countrie lawes, he receiued the tokens and royall Enſignes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Almoſt about the ſame time, yet a little before <hi>Stephen,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Vayuode, and King of Tranſiluania, departed this world, without any lawfull iſſue. By reaſon of this deceaſe there began to <note place="margin">The death of Iohn King of Tranſiluania.</note> breake forth new troubles in Tranſiluania, becauſe that the Turke procured that this Prouince (which was commodious to him for the paſſage into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Hungarie) ſhould maintaine it ſelfe in league with him, and vnder the ſame confederacie which was betweene him and <hi>Iohn.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> aſpired to this kingdome, as well by the right and inheritance of his <note place="margin">Pretences of Maximilian to the kingdome of Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> deceaſed mother, who had ſucceeded King <hi>Lewis</hi> her brother, as alſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Stephens</hi> will and teſtament, who at his death had named him his heire, and ordained that this kingdome ſhould bee yeelded to him, pricked thereto perhaps by remorſe of conſcience, or elſe fearing that it ſhould fall into the Turkes hands, who made to him great ſuite therefore: which could not happen but to the great damage of all Chriſtendome. But the Barons of the countrie did not ſo preſently reſolue vpon that which they ſhould haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> done, becauſe that on the one ſide they ſeared the Turkes forces (who would not faile to endamage them) if they ſhould giue themſelues to the Emperour. On the other ſide they feared worſe, if they ſhould elect a King at his deuotion. Vpon ſuch feares many moneths paſſed without any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Certaine men of note fearing the iuſt anger of the Emperour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, becauſe (during the life of King <hi>Iohn)</hi> they banded againſt his Emperiall Maieſtie in manner of hoſtilitie, firmely reſiſted thoſe who fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Maximilians</hi> part, and who demaunded that the teſtament of the dead ſhould bee put in execution. Theſe feares engendred amongſt them great diuerſitie, which was an occaſion long to delay their laſt reſolution. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> within a few moneths after it was finally concluded amongſt them, that they ſhould particularly chuſe a King of their nation, minding thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their kingdome, and that they might remaine in peace with the Turke they would pay him the accuſtomed tribute, and that he who ſhould be
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:21983:182"/>
choſen King ſhould maintaine himſelfe in peace with the Emperour, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> all iudging thereby that the Turke would haue occaſion to content himſelfe with them, and that the Emperour ſhould not be ſo much offended againſt them. For this conſideration they choſe for their King <hi>Stephen Battor,</hi> the <note place="margin">Stephen Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor choſen King of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania.</note> principall Baron amongſt them.</p>
            <p>About this time the Emperour publiſhed the reſignation which he made of the kingdome of Hungarie to the profit of his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Rodolph,</hi> who the yeere before he cauſed to come out of Spaine, where he had ſoiourned a certaine time with the Catholike King his vncle. The crowning of him with many magnificent and ſumptuous ceremonies was made in the towne of Poſon. And for that ſuch things are notable and worthie to bee knowne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for thoſe who deſire to pleaſe themſelues in the knowledge of that which is <note place="margin">The crowning of a King of Hungarie.</note> ſtrange to them, I purpoſe to recite and write them in this hiſtorie.</p>
            <p>The place of Poſon (which anciently was called Piſonium, becauſe it was built by Piſo a Romane) being appointed for this pompe, all the States of <note place="margin">Poſon called Piſonium.</note> the countrie were called thither. Theſe being aſſembled, the day before their enterie into the towne, the Emperour and Empreſſe entered by night into the towne in their Coaches with many lights and torches, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Prince <hi>Mathias</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> their yonger ſonnes the 20. of September, not minding no more then did the other Lords of their Court, to enter therein publikely in the day time. The day following departed from Ambourg (otherwiſe called Sopron) <hi>Rodolph,</hi> accompanied with his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> brother <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> and many other Princes and Lords. Before him departed <note place="margin">Ambourg cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sopron.</note> out of the towne (a league off) his two other brothers <hi>Mathias</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> in whoſe companie was the Archbiſhop of Strigonium Primate of the kingdome, who had with him ſixe Biſhops followed of other Lords, of the Nobilitie and Caualarie of Hungarie. At the meeting, the Archbiſhop (to whom belonged this charge) with a briefe and elegant oration in Latin, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had prayed to God that it would pleaſe him to make this his entrance and comming proſperous and fortunate for the peace, and comfort of his ſubiects, he promiſed to him in the name of all the kingdome obedience and fidelitie. The Prince anſwered him with a modeſtie mixt with a ſweet kind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of grauitie, that he thanked the kingdome for ſo good an affection in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and that he prayed God that he would giue him that grace in ſuch ſort to beare this charge, that his diuine Maieſtie might be well ſerued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that it would pleaſe him to make him ſuch an one that all the Prouinces and people of the kingdome might neuer haue occaſion to repent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to haue obeyed him: but rather that they would bee very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his election, promiſing to employ all his forces to the good, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and augmentation of all the kingdome as well in generall as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. This ſaid, they began to proceede on towards Poſon with this pompe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the Hungariſh Caualarie marching before to the number of 3000. horſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided vnder 42. Enſignes, with ſo goodly an order and ſo well guarded, that it was a marueilous thing to ſee, becauſe that theſe ſouldiours did weare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads moſt goodly and gliſtering head-peeces inriched with gold, and fayre workes ingrauen vpon them, and vpon the front they had great
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21983:182"/>
plumes made of white Peacocks feathers, that couered all the bodie which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they had armed with bright Curaſſes, or Shirts of maile. Vpon the left arme they carried Targets after their manner, certaine whereof had about them three hemmes or borders of the ſame feathers, and in their hands and at the ſaddle bow they held Launces, Sables, Clubbes, and Maces of iron. They were all mounted vpon very good horſes, which made them the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee regarded, for ſo much as their harneſſes was inriched with gold, and their head-peeces furniſhed with great plumes, with many precious ſtones and pearles of great value, in ſuch ſort that it ſeemed that this people carried with them all their worth, which is a meanes to incourage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues more couragiouſly againſt the enemie. That which made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this Caualarie ſeeme yet more proud and gallant, were the skinnes of Beares and Tygers which the horſemen did weare vpon their ſhoulders, and mane of their horſes. After this ordinance marched all the gentlemen of the traine of the Princes, of Bauier, of the Archduke of Auſtria, of the two yonger ſons of the Emperour, and many other of his Maieſties houſe, ſo nobly apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and their horſes ſo trimly decked, that they made this pompe very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, they all hauing chaines of gold about their neckes. The Prince <hi>Maximilian</hi> marched after theſe, hauing on his left hand the Prince of Cleue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. After him marched Prince <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> who had his brother <hi>Mathias</hi> on his left hand, and Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of Bauier on his right. Behinde came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Prince <hi>Rodolph</hi> in the middeſt of the Archduke of Auſtria his vncle, and of Prince <hi>William</hi> of Bauier. After theſe Princes was to be ſeene the aforeſayd Archbiſhop with his Prelates in the middeſt of the Emperours guard. This new King with this pompe was receiued without the bridge by the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Infantrie, which was ranged in battaile to the number of 5000. and of others 500. ſouldiours who were for the guard of the Port, and in like ſort of all the people, who of all ſorts of age and condition were gathered together to ſee and receiue this new King with great applauſe, and to conduct him to the Archiepiſcopall palace which was prepared for him. He went about euening to kiſſe the hands of the Emperour and Empreſſe, who imbraced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him very louingly. The 25. of September the neceſſarie things for his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being prepared, the Emperour went to the Cathedrall Church in great pompe with his Emperiall habit, accompanied with his Heraulds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried in a chaire, by reaſon that then he was troubled with the gowte which did daily moleſt him. Before him marched the great Marſhall of the Empire, hauing in his hand the naked ſword. After followed the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Princes, and the gentlemen of his Court. His Maieſtie being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the top of the quire, where his ſiege was prepared vnder a Canapie and that of the Empreſſe: on his right hand ſat the Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince <hi>William</hi> of Bauier, Prince <hi>Erneſtus, Ferdinand</hi> of Bauier, <hi>Maximilian, Mathias,</hi> and the Prince of Cleue. On the left hand was placed <hi>Iohn Dolfin</hi> the Popes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Nuncio, the Ambaſſadour of the Catholike King, and he of Venice. After arriued the new King, accompanied with the Princes which wee haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and of all the Nobilitie of Bohemia and Hungarie. Theſe Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered into the Church, and hauing made reuerence to the Emperour,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:21983:183"/>
tooke their places appointed for them. But <hi>Rodolph</hi> entered into the Veſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> from whence he preſently after came out bare headed, being apparelled with a white robe, which they ſaid ſometime was belonging to S. <hi>Stephen</hi> the firſt King of Hungarie, and before him went tenne Hungarian Barons ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly apparelled, each one carrying a Standard in his hand, wherein were repreſented the tenne Prouinces ſubiect to this kingdome, although the moſt part of them are poſſeſſed at this day by the Turke. Theſe are they, Hungarie, Dalmatia, Croatia, Sclauonia, Seruia, Galiſia, Raſcia, Bulgaria, Boſnia, and Lodomiria. After theſe tenne followed fiue other Barons, the one of which carried a Relique in token of peace, ſet in a round forme of gold. The ſecond carried a Sword vndrawne in a crimoſin veluet ſcabbard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> trimmed with ſiluer. The third had the Scepter in his hand. The fourth held a little Globe of gold. And the laſt carried the Crowne. All theſe Iewels (as it is ſaid) belonged to the ſaid S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and are among the Hungars held in ſuch regard, that they eſteeme him not for lawfull King who enioyeth them not. Theſe fiue Barons were followed by the new King, who had vpon his right hand the Marſhall of the kingdome, who held in his hand the naked Sword. With this traine and companie the King comming to the quire, two Biſhops came before him into the middeſt of the Church, to wit, he of Agria, and Zagrabia, who after a few words conducted him (being in the middeſt of theſe two) before the Archbiſhop, who was ſolemnely apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. At the feete of him <hi>Rodolph</hi> kneeling, the Archbiſhop gaue him his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and annoynted him with the accuſtomed ceremonies. There the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle being ended, the Archbiſhop girded his Sword about him, cauſing him to draw it out of the ſcabbard, and to lift it vp on high three times, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating thereby that he ſhould be bound by armes to defend the faith of Ieſus Chriſt againſt Infidels and Heretikes. Then the Archbiſhop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded with a lowd voyce of the people (who are preſent at the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) if they would accept this Prince for their King. Then euery one with infinit acclamations cried, that they deſired and would haue him for their King. Vpon this the Archbiſhop taketh his oth, and putteth the Crowne vpon his head, and the Scepter in his hand. The King raiſing himſelfe, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> take the Sword from his ſide, which they giue to the Marſhall of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to carrie it alwaies before his Maieſtie. Then the Archbiſhop leadeth the King (wearing his Crowne on his head, and holding the Scepter in his hand) into his Throne. At all theſe ceremonies the Archbiſhop vſeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prayers and admonitions appointed for that purpoſe. After that the Archbiſhop ſitteth downe by the King while they ſing <hi>Te Deum:</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Archbiſhop returneth to the Aulter to end the Maſſe. That done, the King in the ſame habit goeth out of the Church, cauſing peeces of gold and ſiluer to be throwne to the people, and newly coyned vnder his name: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and from this Church with the ſame companie he went to the Cordiliers, in which he made many Knights as well Hungars as ſtrangers: and from thence he went mounted on horſebacke richly decked (although he did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly lament) two miles from the towne, to accompliſh certain ceremonies depending vpon the oth which the Kings ought to make in ſuch ſacred
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21983:183"/>
things. In the meane time the Emperour after he had moſt affectionatly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thanked the Ambaſſadours for their aſſiſtance, and had permitted them to depart, he was brought backe to the Caſtle. The Saterday following they made many feaſts; and vpon the Sunday 100. braue gentlemen performed an excellent Tourney. Amongſt theſe (according to the iudgement of the aſſiſtance) the two princes <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Mathias</hi> behaued themſelues valiantly; the one of them fought againſt a Spaniard the ſonne of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour, and the other againſt a Duke of Poland. At night the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour made a moſt rich and ſumptuous ſupper for all the Princes, who all for reuerence of the Emperour were bare headed, except the King and Archduke <hi>Charles,</hi> who went before the King being placed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Two dayes after they preſented an aſſault giuen againſt a towne made of wood, for defence of which were certaine Knights greatly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>This ſame yeare ended the truce betweene <hi>Selim</hi> and <hi>Maximilian.</hi> The <note place="margin">The truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Selim and Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an expired.</note> Emperour perceiuing no more ſtrength to bee in him, ſuch as before it was, and knowing his ſmall forces, or elſe for ſome other conſideration, <hi>Selim</hi> ſought to obtayne of him a prolonging of the truce. But <hi>Selim</hi> not ſo readily condiſcending as <hi>Maximilian</hi> deſired, the truce in that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: and preſently the Turkes of the next garriſons fayled not to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the field, and to harrie and aſſaile the frontiers, carying away with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them great ſtore of bootie. <hi>Rodolph,</hi> with <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Father, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to erect a Fort betweene Poſon and Alberegalis, to reſtraine ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions. The Turkes well foreſeeing that which might happen by ſuch a building, reſolued not to ſuffer to bee finiſhed before their eyes, a place which ſhould be to them of too great importance, and by the ſame meanes to hinder the deſeignes of <hi>Rodolph.</hi> For this end hauing amaſſed together their forces, which might amount vnto 20000. men, they ſuddenly aſſayled this Fort in a maner finiſhed: &amp; entering in by force, they killed the garriſon and all the labourers who worked there: and after they had reuerſed all that edifice, they lead with them from thence ſtore of artillerie and other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of warre. <hi>Rodolph</hi> ſent to Conſtantinople to complaine to <hi>Selim</hi> for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſuch an enterpriſe made by his people daring the time of the treaty of peace, and without there being of either partie any other former declaration of warre, redemaunding that which was taken from him at this Fort. But the aunſwere was a deniall of all that which his Maieſtie demaunded, and to which they added threats if he perſiſted in ſuch demaunds. The Emperour (notwithſtanding his voluntarie yeelding which he had made to his ſonne <hi>Rodolph</hi> of the Crowne of Hungarie) hauing no leſſe care of this kingdome then he had before, &amp; conſidering how greatly the loſſes which the people receiued by theſe incurſions were damageable, and that by this occaſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> neceſſitie conſtrayned him to take armes to defend it from the violence of his enemies, and to recouer that which they tooke from him, cauſed to be publiſhed a Diet at Iſpurch, calling thither all the Princes of Germanie; and there propoſing to them the perill imminent to all their nation, and how little they ought to truſt the promiſes of Infidels, exhorted them to take
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:21983:184"/>
armes with him for the defence of the whole nation. The Princes moued by his perſwaſions, concluded to vndertake this warre with him, they all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
               <note place="margin">Succours granted to the Emperour by the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> iudging that it was more expedient to make open warre, then to remaine alwaies in ſuſpence and doubt. And vpon this concluſion they gaue order for neceſſaries thereto.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Charles</hi> King of France a long time vexed with ſuch continuall troubles in his kingdome, or elſe becauſe he had vſed too much <note place="margin">The death of Charles King of France.</note> exceſſe in his ordinarie exerciſes, in which too violently he paſſed the time, or elſe by reaſon of ſome poyſon, as ſome ſaid, dyed within a few daies, euen then when his life was moſt neceſarie for France, not leauing after him but one legitimate daughter of him and his wife, named <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> daughter of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the Emperour <hi>Maximilian.

The Pollacques would not willingly graunt to him that which he demaunded: neuertheleſſe they aunſwered him that they would conſent thereunto, if ſo be that for that effect a Diet ſhould be aſſembled, without which they could graunt him nothing. In the meane time his Maieſtie gaue order to locke vp his beſt implements and Iewels, and to depart ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all ſpeed: and after he had ſent away before the Ambaſſadour of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> France, vnder coulour that his authoritie was expired by the deceaſe of his Maſter, and ſeeing that to attend any longer the reſolution of this Diet (which the Pollacques delayed from day to day of purpoſe to detaine him) and being reſolued to depart, he cauſed to be written in his name by the Lord of Pibrac a letter in Latin to the Senat of Poland, by which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie aduertiſed them, that the occaſion more then apparant, and the neede of France forced him to depart from their kingdome ſooner then hee thought for, without further expecting the iſſue of the Diet, he being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by meſſengers vpon meſſengers to doe it by the Princes and Lords of France, and eſpecially by the Queene his Mother, without further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the iſſue of the Diet. Hauing left theſe letters vpon his table, and as the ſaid Lord of Pibrac had ended them, his Maieſtie departed in the night from Cracouia out at a ſecret poſterne, of which he vſually had the keyes to goe on hunting: and being mounted on horſebacke, he made ſo good ſpeed, that within a ſhort time he was out of the limits of the kingdome of Poland: and being come to the confines of the Emperours territories, he was receiued by his Emperiall Maieſtie, and by his children with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of great amitie, and by them conducted to Vienna, where he was honored and vſed with all manner of honorable reſpects.

remaine without the preſence of a King. His Maieſtie deſired him to ſtay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this reſolution, promiſing him to returne within a ſhort time. From Turin within few daies he arriued in France, at the ſame time that the Hungars giuing order to their affayres, and fortifying their frontier places againſt the Turkes, prepared for the warre: and this they did ſo much the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that they already ſaw amongſt them many diſorders, and that in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluania there was declared King (by the commaund of the Turke) <hi>Stephen Battor,</hi> a man of great experience, of whom they had ſome feare, and not without cauſe. Vpon ſuch diſtruſts and with ſuch preparations they began both of the one part &amp; other greatly to be indamaged. But during ſuch feares as the Hungars had, by reaſon of the Turke, he alreadie preparing to deſtroy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all Chriſtians, and feeling himſelfe marueilouſly puffed vp with glorie, by reaſon of the happie ſucceſſes which betided him in Africa: and thinking to take away from the Venecians the Ile of Candie, as he had done that of Cypreſſe, he dyed within few daies after. He was a Prince aboue all other <note place="margin">The death of Selim.</note> of his time greatly periurious, barbarous, and wholly fraughted with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, he being not come to this Empire but by deceits and falſehoods, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing induced his father to cauſe all his brethren to be maſſacred, as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards auerred: and hauing thus filled his houſe with homicides and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he obſerued not any law or religion, but was drowned in all filthie and vilanous vices whatſoeuer. This death happened then when the Polonians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> (ſeeing that their King <hi>Henry</hi> was peaceably poſſeſſed of the Crowne of France, and that the time by him prefixed, was expired many moneths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie paſt) began to treate of the election of another King. <hi>Henry</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of their intention, deſired the Electors and Barons of the kingdome that they would attend vntill a certaine time, in which ſpace he promiſed to returne to them, or elſe that hee would ſend them full commiſſion to chuſe another, ſuch as they would think to be more commodious for them. To this requeſt (being ioyned the threats of <hi>Amurath</hi> the Turke) the Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians contented themſelues to ſtay vntill the prefixed time. This paſſed, and at the laſt expired, the Diet was appointed at Cracouia. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> after that he was aduertiſed that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Polonians was not to remaine without the preſence of a King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to negotiate with them to cauſe himſelfe to bee choſen King amongſt them. On the other ſide, <hi>Amurath</hi> (who ſucceeded <hi>Selim)</hi> hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">Amurath the ſonne of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim ſoliciteth the Polonians to chuſe Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for their King.</note> the ſuites which the Emperour made, ſent to the Pollacques, and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to doe nothing in that affayre which was diſliking to him, and that he would they ſhould chuſe for their King one amongſt them, or elſe <hi>Stephen Battor</hi> King of Tranſiluania. And the more to aſtoniſh this negotiation of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> he writ vnto him by a Chiauſs, that he and his brothers the Archdukes ſhould pay him tribute of all whatſoeuer they poſſeſſed, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that he would march into Hungarie and Auſtria with a puiſſant armie to put all to fire &amp; ſword; threatning him in the end, that if for him or any of his he ſhuld practiſe the getting of the kingdom of Polonia, he would make him repent it. Notwithſtanding theſe threats, the Emperour (by meanes of thoſe who were of his partie) was choſen K. of Poland, againſt the King of <note place="margin">Maximilian choſen King of Polonia.</note>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:21983:185"/>
Tranſiluania and Duke of Muſcouia, which two perceiuing themſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> greatly diſdained, determined to endamage with all their forces that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Maximilian</hi> being aduertiſed thereof, and foreſeeing that he ſhould draw vpon himſelfe ſo many and ſo puiſſant enemies, and conſidering that he had not ſufficient forces to oppoſe himſelfe againſt them, and eſpecially againſt the Turk (who prepared to thruſt himſelfe into Poland, being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this, that the Polonians had ſo ſlightly regarded his aduertiſements and meſſengers) fearing to trouble himſelfe in a warre too daungerous for him and his, from whence very hardly he could vntangle himſelfe, made no great ſhew of reioycing at this election: but laying aſide the care which he ought to haue had of it, fained as though he knew nothing thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> by that meanes the taking poſſeſſion of that kingdom, vnder a hope that after the firſt aſſaults of theſe Princes there would not thereby happen to him in the end any other thing. Neuertheleſſe the Polonians fearing the puiſſance of the Turke, who prepared himſelfe to armes, would not perſiſt in this election, vſing for their excuſe the long delay which <hi>Maximilian</hi> made. Thus the Biſhop of Cracouia, many Poliſh and Lituanian Lords fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Turke, and other Princes their neighbours, made choiſe of <hi>Stephen Battor</hi> for their King, hoping by this election to appeaſe the Turke, the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couite, and other Princes, who hated the greatnes of the Auſtrian houſe: <note place="margin">Battor choſen King of Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> and on the other ſide this <hi>Battor</hi> was a Prince of great valour. To this new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> election <hi>Albert Lasky</hi> Palatin would neuer conſent, nor performe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which he ought to this new King, and chuſing rather to abandon his countrie and goods, he retired out of the kingdome, with all thoſe who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the Emperiall partie.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Battor</hi> knowing that he was choſen, went from thence preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Battor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> to Polonia, and after he was crowned, he ſent into diuers Prouinces to noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his election, and namely to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> ſending him word that if in former time he had been to him a friend, and fauoured his actions, that for the time to come he would yet honour him more, and that he would reſpect him both as a friend and Emperour, and that he ſhould not take diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that this Crowne was fallen into his hands, who had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fauourable vnto him, deſiring that ſince through the diſſentions of the Barons and Electors of Poland, and by ſome wicked ſolicitations of ſome Princes (who enuied the greatnes of the houſe of Auſtria, and who by diuers meanes had hindered his election) he would bee contented that this kingdome was come to ſuch a perſon as reuerenced his Maieſtie, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued him, and ſpecially conſidering that this laſt election would bee the cauſe to quench many troubles, which might be an occaſion to ouerthrow the Eſtate of that kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> (for all theſe goodly reaſons and kinde offers) would not be appeaſed: but entering into choller, made ſufficient apparance that this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> greatly diſpleaſed him: adding, that he would make the Polonians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it. Vpon this diſpleaſure, the Muſcouit and Denmarke being ioyned <note place="margin">The King of Denmark and the Mulcouit make warre in Polonia.</note> together, with certaine of the Emperours forces, greatly endamaged by ſea the riuers of Liuonia, and hauing ſet foote on land at Pleſcouia, ranne very

farre into the countrie. <hi>Battor</hi> notwithſtanding being receiued and crowned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> King of Poland, cauſed to be publiſhed a Decree, by which he permitted all thoſe who were retired forth of the kingdome for fauouring the Emperours part, to returne home to the ſame Eſtates, dignities, and prerogatiues which before they had: and if in caſe they would not returne and ſweare ſuch oth of fealtie to him as they ought, they ſhould be proclaimed rebels to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and enemies to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>In this time of the election of <hi>Battor,</hi> the Emperour appointed a Diet at Ratisbone, to aduiſe of meanes by which they might hinder that his people ſhould not be thus daily expoſed to the mercie of the common enemie, who continually moleſted Hungarie. Afterwards his Maieſtie demonſtrated to <note place="margin">Maximilian demaundeth aide of the Germanes to make warre vpon the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Princes who were preſent therein, and to the Ambaſſadours of them who were abſent, that he was choſen King of Polonia, and that by that meanes Liuonia and Ruſſia were fallen vnder the Empire, and that the Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians for feare of the Turke had varied in their election, and afterwards cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen another, whereof he was exceeding heauie: further declaring to them that his intention was not to bee ſilent therein: and for this cauſe deſired them to aſſiſt him, to the end that by meanes thereof he might preſerue theſe two great countries to the Empire. And that he might the better obtaine their forces, he exhorted them all to maintaine themſelues in peace one with another, commaunding them that for the time to come they ſhould not any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> more ſuffer their ſubiects to goe and ſerue ſtraungers in their wars. This Diet <note place="margin">Succours granted to Maximilian.</note> was transferred to Ausbourg, in which he did ſo much, that the ordinarie ſuccours for warre was continued to him. The Bohemians offered him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ordinarie, 1500. horſe; and the Hungars 300. Piſtoliers, and 400. Harquebuziers on horſebacke: and the Sleſians 600. horſe, 100. Piſtoliers, and 800. Harquebuziers on horſebacke. To theſe ſuccours, offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the King of Denmarke, the Duke of Saxonie, Pomerania, and of Brandeburg. And in the end there was concluded a league betweene the Emperour, the Kings of Denmarke and Swethland, the Duke of Saxonie, <note place="margin">A league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians.</note> the Duke of Muſcouia, and the Dukes of Brandebourg and Pomerania, for defence of the Empire, and inuading of Polonia, all theſe complaining for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the election of <hi>Battor,</hi> who, that he might aſpire to the Crowne of Poland againſt them all, had preſumed ſo much vnder the protection of the Turke. Beſides, they feared that he in regarde of the bond which he had to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath,</hi> would take armes againſt the Emperour: who not content with this <note place="margin">Maximilian ſent to ſolicit the Sophy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.</note> league, ſent as well in his name, as in the name of the King of Spaine, his Ambaſſadours into Perſia, to excite the Sophy King of Perſia, to make war vpon the Turke. This word King is called in the Perſian language Scach, and the Turkes ſurname it Sophy, which we commonly thinke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of this Greeke word Sophia, which ſignifieth wiſdome, which in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Turkiſh language ſignifieth wooll. And the Turkes vſed this ſcoffe againſt <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> heretofore King of Perſia, for that he following his opinion or hereſie, would teach that he muſt couer his head with wooll, becauſe it was more vile and baſe then linnen, whereof the Turkes make their Turbans. <hi>Battor</hi> hauing diſcouered the voyage of theſe Ambaſſadours, cauſed them to be
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21983:186"/>
ſurpriſed in their iourney, and to be maſſacred: and ſent to <hi>Amurath</hi> their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> letters of credence and inſtructions, by which there were diſcouered vnto him the diſeignes of his enemies: which being reported to the Emperour, he was greatly diſpleaſed thereat, and cauſed the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Battor</hi> to be areſted, and many other Pollacques who then were in Germanie and at Vienna: and ſent to all the chriſtian Princes to require ayde of them, ſeeing the Proteſtants of Germanie denied him ſuch ayde as the imminent perill required, for that his Maieſtie would not condiſcend to the demaunds which they made to him for the affayres of Religion.</p>
            <p>In this Diet notwithſtanding the reclamation and hinderance of ſome Electors of the Empire, his Maieſtie cauſed to be declared his ſonne <hi>Rodolph</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> 
               <note place="margin">Rodolph the ſonne of Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilian decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red King of the Romans.</note> Emperour after him, and cauſed to be impoſed vpon him the title of King of the Romans. This was then when the Muſcouite Ambaſſadours arriued at the Court to confirme the league made with his Emperiall Maieſtie, their maſter being greatly incenſed againſt the Polonians, for that he was by them thus diſdained. Theſe hauing preſented to the Emperour many goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, offered in their maſters name to his Maieſtie, all his abilitie to ſubdue Polonia. <hi>Maximilian</hi> accepting theſe offers, thanked the Ambaſſadours for the good affection of their Prince, reſeruing power to vſe his ayde vntill time ſhould require it.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he was in prouiding for all that which concerned the eſtate of the next warre, (his Maieſtie being ſuddainly taken with a vehement trembling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> 
               <note place="margin">The death of Maximilian.</note> of his members, and with a great panting of his heart) he ended his dayes. He was a Prince who well knew to preſerue his Emperiall dignitie and the greatnes of his houſe. Hauing receiued the adminiſtration of the Empire, his father liuing, the care which he alwaies had in his minde, was to keepe Germanie in peace, and in ſuch ſort to effect it, that it ſhould not any more feele the former calamities whereinto it was fallen. For this cauſe ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Germanie in ſo great repoſe, had a ſiniſter opinion of him, as though he had too much fauored the Proteſtants. But theſe men did not conſider that amongſt ſo many diuiſions and hazards as were alreadie in France, Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; other countries, it was not profitable for the Catholike partie to adde Germanie thereto, for feare leaſt the reſt of the Catholikes might not be in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> like perill. This Prince in his young yeares was very hot of the warre. He greatly loued the profeſſours of the liberall arts, and eſpecially handicrafts men. Hee had a delight to pleaſe euery one. Hee ſpoke moſt familiarly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and diuers ſorts of languages, ſo that it ſeemed he was borne with them: and although he had a ſubtile and fine wit, oftentimes hauing an intention contrarie to his actions, yet neuertheleſſe he was indued with many other vertuous qualities.</p>
            <p>To this man ſucceeded in the Emperiall dignitie, <hi>Rodolph</hi> ſecond of that name his ſonne, King of Bohemia and Hungarie, a moſt Catholike and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Prince. He in the ſame Diet of Ausburg in which he was choſen King of the Romans was receiued for Emperour whileſt that the Diet continued. <note place="margin">Rodolph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> Preſently his Maieſtie commaunded (the better to take away all hopes of change from all his ſubiects in his hereditarie eſtates) that they ſhould liue

Catholikely: and cauſed to be made ſeuere executions againſt thoſe who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would vndertake to preach any other doctrine but Catholike, and by his example &amp; ſpeeches perſwaded all the Princes, Catholikes and Proteſtants, carefully to obſerue Gods commaundements. So ſoone as he was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Emperour, he cauſed the Poliſh Ambaſſadours to be releaſed, and ſent to <hi>Amurath</hi> to demaund truce, which without any great difficultie was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <note place="margin">Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph.</note> to him; becauſe that the Turke hauing had aduertiſement of the war which the King of Perſia prepared againſt him, and of the reſolution of the Germanes, who had made a great leauie of ſouldiers and money vpon euery eſtate of the Empire, to maintaine warre againſt him, could not any whit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe to be able to make reſiſtance in ſo many places, his Empire elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> being ſorely weakened by the iuſt puniſhment of God, with plague, war, and famine: in regard of which, he very eaſily granted the demaunds of <hi>Rodolph.</hi> At the ſame time all the Chriſtian Princes ſent to his Maieſtie to congratulate with him his new promotion in the Emperiall dignitie: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, <hi>Battor</hi> not long before choſen King of Poland alſo ſent his Ambaſſadours thither for the ſame effect, knowing the releaſe that <hi>Rodolph</hi> had made of his Ambaſſadours while he beſieged the rich town of Danzit, ſituated at the mouth of Viſtula vpon the ſea of Pruſia, being of the demains <note place="margin">Danzit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> of Polonia, which then held of <hi>Maximilians</hi> part, the inhabitants then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of his death: but as ſoone as they were aſſured thereof, they capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated with their new King and yeelded to him vnder condition, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> towne ſhould not be ſpoyled, and that the penaltie ſhould be conuerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to monie. They beſides gaue him 12. peeces of great Artillerie with other leſſer, and certaine amongſt themſelues for hoſtages, to the end the more to aſſure his Maieſtie of their fidellitie towards him. This done <hi>Battor</hi> preſently cauſed his Armie to make head againſt the Muſcouit, to recouer the places that the Duke had taken towards Liuonia.</p>
            <p>During this buſines he omitted not to ſend to the Pope to acknowledge him as ſoueraigne Prelat of the catholike Church: and by the ſame meanes <note place="margin">Battor ſent to acknowledge the Pope, and to ſeeke for learned men in Italie.</note> ſought through Italie for many Captaines of valour, and other men of knowledge, offering them great penſions and rich recompences, as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to many, who both of one and other vocation went to him: this Prince being as much giuen to armes as hee was indued with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of learning and ſciences, and eſpecially in diuinitie and hiſtories, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing paſſed his youth in the exerciſe of armes and learning in Germanie and Italie. Within a ſhort time hee recouered all that which the Muſcouits and Tartars had vſurped vpon him; and tooke many places from them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Battor bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couits and Tartars to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire peace.</note> ſo many times beaten them, that he conſtrayned them in the end to ſeeke peace of him, euen as <hi>Demetrius</hi> Duke of Muſcouia for this effect ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited thereto Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. of that name, vſing him as a meane to this Prince, to the end that he might obtaine it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p>The Hungars for all this were neuer a whit the more at reſt.

               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:21983:187"/>
willing to reuenge himſelf of this iniurie, commanded his people who were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in Hungarie, to make incurſions vpon the Turkes, and to enterpriſe ſome thing vpon ſome of their places in ſtead of two Forts that theſe had taken in Croatia. The Hungars deſirous to attempt ſomewhat vpon certaine Caſtles by Alberegalis, were in the way intrapped by the Turkes, and moſt of them cut in peeces. The Emperour conſidering that theſe skirmiſhes might in the end ingender a greater war, cauſed a Diet to be called in Bohemia, ſoliciting therein the Bohemians that they would ſuccour him againſt the Turkes, who, without regard of the truce, ran &amp; ſpoyled continually the frontiers of his countries. Theſe accorded to him a good ſumme of monie. For the ſame effect he alſo called the Hungars to Poſon, and not being able to be therein, for his indiſpoſition, he ſhewed to them by the Prince <hi>Erneſtus</hi> his brother, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the neceſſitie which conſtrayned him to ſolicite them to haue regard to the common defence againſt the Turkes, by whom daylie they receiued ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppreſſions.
