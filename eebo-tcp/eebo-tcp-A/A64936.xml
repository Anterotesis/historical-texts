            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH READER.</head>
            <p>AFTER so many excellent Discourses as have of late been publish'd by the Divines of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon almost all the Points in Controversy between <hi>Us</hi> and our Brethren of the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The design of this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</hi>
               </note> it might well be thought a very needless thing to call in this <hi>foreign Auxiliary,</hi> were it not hoped that those Reasons which usually are not so well received when coming from such as they esteem their Enemies, might possibly be allow'd the favour of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, being offer'd by one of their <hi>own Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may besides be perhaps no unseasonable design, especially at this time, to satisfy the World, that those things which we chiefly complain of in their <hi>Church,</hi> are after all no other, than what divers of those who have lived and died in it, have both confessed to be <hi>amiss,</hi> and earnestly wish'd they might see <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not unknown to any at this day,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by many of the Church of</hi> Rome.</note> what the Complaints have been of many the most considerable Persons of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the very beginning of our <hi>Reformation.</hi> How much they desired that something might be done to rectify what they could not deny to be amiss both in the <hi>Head</hi> and in the

               <hi>Members.</hi> Let the frequent Demands of the <hi>Emperor</hi> and other <hi>Catholick Princes;</hi> let the Acknowledgment of the <hi>Pope</hi> Himself, and the Proposals of the <hi>Colledg</hi> of <hi>Cardinals</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly set apart for this Consultation; let the Remonstrances that were made, and the Endeavours that were used, both by the <hi>French Legats,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish Bishops,</hi> even in the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> it self, suffice to shew, both that something was amiss, and that the <hi>Protestants</hi> tho they might perhaps be censured by them for not proceeding so regularly as they thought they should, yet could not be deny'd to have had just grounds in the bottom for their Complaints.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Testified in writing by some of their most eminent Authors.</hi>
               </note>And what was then more generally own'd as to these things, whilst as yet it was hoped that some redress might be had of them; many of the best <hi>Men</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> and who have made the most diligent and impartial Enquiries into the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between us, have not ceased, tho in a more private man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to confess since, and publish to the World their just Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it.</p>

                     <hi>That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Book was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The occasion of his first searching into the Truth of his Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note>It were infinite to insist upon all those that have done this: Something of that kind has been already offer'd to the World, and more perhaps may hereafter be done more fully to confirm it. In the mean time the <hi>Author</hi> here before us, and who lived and died in the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> sufficiently declares, that he was so far from esteeming that <hi>Church,</hi> which now pretends to so much <hi>Authority</hi> over all others, to be absolutely exempt from all possibility of erring, that on the contrary, he judged it to be <hi>actually involved in very great Errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot reasonably be doubted by those who know any thing at all of this <hi>Book,</hi> but that he who wrote it was truly a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> however dissatisfied with it in many of its pretences.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Preface</hi> will give a satisfactory account, how by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral decay of Piety that he met with in a place, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected should above all others have deserved the Name of the
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:40127:3"/>
               <hi>Holy City,</hi> he came first to search more fully into his <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and how the more he read the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and compared the Pretences of his <hi>Church</hi> with what he found in them; the more he still perceived it to have deviated from the <hi>Primitive Rule,</hi> and to have usurped upon the <hi>Consciences</hi> and <hi>Credulity</hi> of its Members.</p>
            <p>But tho by this means therefore he saw that in many of our Disputes we had Reason in our Arguments against them;<note place="margin">
                  <p>
                     <hi>That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to the last in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Protestants. Instances of it.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>That the Ch. of</hi> R. <hi>is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Ch. of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
               </note> yet in so many other Points he still defends their Errors, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew how far he was, at the time that he wrote this Book, from being a <hi>Deserter</hi> of his <hi>first Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that we sometimes find him arguing thus against our Religion. <q>That there being no <hi>visible Church</hi> of our Perswasion at the beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and yet it being confess'd by us, that there ought always to have been a <hi>visible Church</hi> of Christ in the World, we must confess that then ours is not the <hi>visible Church</hi> of Christ: and there being no other that can with so good reason pretend to it as the <hi>Roman,</hi> we ought to acknowledg that to be it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the holy <hi>Sacrament of the Eucharist,</hi> he seems to the last to have stuck to that Interpretation of Christ's words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2. Corporal Presence.</hi>
               </note> upon which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> so much insists against us. <q>That this Sacrament being the <hi>last Will</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> of our Blessed Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> pag. <hi>103.</hi>
                  </note> we ought to interpret it as all other things of that kind, <hi>according to the Letter:</hi> And cannot without Impiety believe, that our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the Institution of it should have made use of Words, either <hi>obscure</hi> or <hi>ambiguous.</hi> Besides, that it was never his custom to establish <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> upon <hi>Metaphorical Expressions.</hi>
               </q> In a word; tho for Peace sake indeed he seems to desire that no ones Conscience should be tied up to any determinate manner of <hi>Christ's Presence</hi> in this blessed <hi>Eucharist,</hi> yet he plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough declares that as for himself he thought him to be <hi>really,</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:40127:4"/>
nay <hi>corporally</hi> present there:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. <hi>105, 107.</hi>
               </note> And that the <hi>Calvinists</hi> were guilty of <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> in this matter, <hi>seeing</hi> (as he adds) <hi>all the Christians of</hi> Asia <hi>and</hi> Africk <hi>believe the</hi> Real Presence,<note place="margin">P. <hi>109.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and there are none but themselves that do deny it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this <hi>Error,</hi> he elsewhere argues in behalf of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>3. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind.</hi>
               </note> In which tho he confesses his <hi>Church</hi> to have departed from the <hi>Primitive Institution</hi> and therefore wishes is might be redressed; yet upon this Principle of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> he endeavours to shew that it is not so <hi>capital a Matter</hi> as we pretend,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. <hi>99, 100, 109, 110.</hi>
               </note> nor ought we from hence to conclude, that their <hi>Church</hi> which he calls the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is <hi>not the true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>4. Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints.</hi>

               </note> He proposes that we should first do Justice to one another, as to all those Points that we have falsly laid to each others Charge. That then we should <hi>reform</hi> on both sides whatever we could discover to need a <hi>Reformation.</hi> To this end he freely gives us up the <hi>Council of Trent;</hi> and indeed in effect, all the other <hi>Councils</hi> that have been held before it; <hi>the Infallibility of the Church,</hi> but especially <hi>the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pope,</hi> whom he proves, in what we here publish, to be an Vsurper, and wishes all Men to separate from him as such. He desires that the <hi>Cardinals</hi> might be reduced to their first Condition; that the number of <hi>Bishops</hi> might be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and their Diocesses no larger than what they could easily supervise. That the <hi>Monasteries</hi> might be retrenched, and the almost infinite number of the <hi>Clergy</hi> reduced to a juster proportion. That for all this, a <hi>free Council</hi> might be
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:40127:5"/>
assembled, in which the <hi>Laity</hi> as well as <hi>Clergy</hi> might be present, as being the more likely of the two to bring things to an <hi>Accommodation.</hi> That for those Points wherein we could not after all agree, some way should be found out to <hi>tollerate</hi> one another. As for instance, that in the matter of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> neither should those of the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome require us to receive their Doctrine, or to joyn in their <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> nor we them to renounce either: But that continuing on both sides as we are, we should nevertheless <hi>communicate</hi> together in the same posture of <hi>kneeling,</hi> as is now done in the <hi>Church of</hi> England. Finally, that for all this it were to be wish'd some great <hi>Prince</hi> would begin to set this matter on foot, for that without such a Concurrence, it will be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should ever be throughly effected.</p>
            <p>This is, as far as I can gather, the design of this <hi>Author;</hi> and which I have the rather put together here, because it is not so fully expressed in what is now publish'd, being only the <hi>first part</hi> of his Work, tho all that he lived to bring to perfection: For the rest, which we find in the <hi>French Edition,</hi> it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Materials</hi> for a <hi>second part,</hi> than any compleat Copy of what he had finish'd of it.</p>
            <p>I shall not here enter into any debate, either to vindicate or to censure this <hi>Project.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>No likelihood that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists will ever consent to it.</hi>
               </note> It will be time enough for us to deliberate on these things, when those of the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome will be content in good earnest to quit their pretences to that <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> they have so long usurped to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and over all others, and joyn in such a Christian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign as is here proposed with us.

            <p>THE Authority of the Pope hath taken such root by the ignorance of the Holy Scripture, by the multitude of <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> and by all the Temporal Benefices, whereof the Pope is looked upon as the Source, that a kind of Miracle seems necessary to destroy it, and to Reestablish the Church in that liberty which the Son of God hath purchased for it by his Blood. Besides, Impiety, Irreligion, Ambition and Dissoluteness have so seized upon the minds of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of Mankind, that a man cannot hope to be so much as heard when he speaks of Reforming the Church. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>tho I am very well satisfied of that, yet I think my self indispensibly obliged to represent the abuses of this Power and Authority which hath no just foundation; at least in this respect I shall in some measure justifie my self towards God in doing my Duty, I shall justifie my self to my own self, whom my Conscience hath long accused of a large and Criminal silence. I shall also justifie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks against the Hereticks, who will know by this, that we are not so blind as they imagin. And this will also serve to fortifie the Catholicks against all the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they may have of abandoning the Church, by freeing themselves from the Papacy; so that Renouncing the latter, they may always stand firm to the former, and also prepare themselves to fight couragiously against An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, who in all appearance is near at hand.</p>
            <p>I have a great while hoped that there would have been found among the great and learned men that we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, some one or other that would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to open mens eyes, and would have saved me a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therein. I could consult no body without manifest danger both to themselves and me, since it is a work that may equally displease both weak Catholicks and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, being obliged in regard of the first to disentangle
<pb facs="tcp:40127:7"/>
and separate truth from falshood, and a falshood more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by many Catholicks than the most Important truths. And in regard of the Hereticks, I know it is the way to undermine the foundation of their false Religions, tho without dispute, and indirectly, in abolishing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. In respect both of the one and of the other, the effects of this mischievous Authority are <hi>terrible</hi>; since it fills the Catholicks with ignorance, and gross and low Ideas of the Christian Religion; and mars the beauty of that as well as of the Church. The Hereticks are thereby scandalized, and harden themselves more and more in their obstinacy, perswading themselves that every thing in our Religion is false, seeing clearly that some <hi>part of it</hi> is so.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted but that many Catholicks of our time do see this evil, since in the preceding Ages ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have perceived it, and that the evil is come to so high a <hi>degree,</hi> that it is almost impossible not to take notice of it. And truly there have been some who could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear saying somewhat of it; but this hath been but very slightly and superficially. It seems as tho they were asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Jesus Christ and his Gospel, as the Scripture speaks.</p>
            <p>In truth, it is a deplorable thing that amongst the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of learned men professing the Christian Religion, and that employ themselves in writing, there cannot be found so much as one man of understanding touched with the miseries of the Church, and of such courage as to represent it to those who may and ought to remedy it, the Sacriledg daily committed in the Church under the very name of the Church, and under the pretence of Religion. Either the greatness of the evil must discourage them, and bereave them of all hopes, and not being able to cure the Ulcer, they had rather let it wholly alone; <hi>Omittere poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us praevalida &amp; Adulta vitia, quam hoc assequi ne palam fieret qualibus flagitiis Impares simus,</hi> Tac. Annal. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. or else it must be, that their own interest is concerned in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb facs="tcp:40127:7"/>
of this evil, or that they have no regard for the desolations of the Church; or lastly, they are afraid of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Catholick<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Religion in respect of weak Brethren, and for fear of giving occasion to the Hereticks, thereby to insult over it. If they had these last thoughts, it was for want of examining the thing; for it is certain that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy hath neither by nature nor Divine institution any connexion with the Christian Religion, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry its Principles are opposite, and tend to its destruction. It is also certain that those who have separated themselves from the Church, see very clearly the inconsistency of the Papacy with the Gospel, since there was nothing else that heretofore obliged the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and since the Protestants, to forsake the Church; so that no man can believe but that they see the thing very well, since it is the only place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they daily attack us with a mighty advantage; and tho it were not true that they knew it perfectly, we are howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver indispensibly obliged to oppose Errors (<hi>Mendacia nec te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt nec vulnerant</hi>) and not to palliate them; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not sincerely to acknowledg palpable gross abuses, is to betray Religion and the Church; for that makes men call in question the best establisht Truths, according to that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He that denies all things, grants all things: <hi>Qui en todo niga loda.</hi> And I have always observed, that a frank and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous acknowledgment when a man is in an error, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a very good effect upon all judicious and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons, and disposeth the Protestants with much more readiness to embrace the Catholick Verities.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I dare be bold to affirm, That one of the principal causes of the irreligion and impiety which reigns in the World, proceeds in great measure from the little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Wisdom wherewith this Primacy and Papal Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power is exercised, which converting all Religion to its Temporal Profit, makes the very Divinity of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion to be called in question. For as the World
<pb facs="tcp:40127:8"/>
goes, men will have all or nothing; So that having at first received the Article of the Papacy, as an Article of Faith, whilst they see the Popes, under colour of this Article, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and plundering the Church, they will perceive the Imposture, and believe at length, that the other Articles of Religion are no more Divine than that of the Papacy. So that if it pleased God, that this Tyranny were abolished in the Church, this villainous Mask taken off from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it would be incomparably more loved and respected, and the Impiety, Ambition, and Dissoluteness, wherewith the Papacy hath infected all things, would be banished from the Church, and we should see all the Schismaticks and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks range themselves under the Standard of the Church; and even the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the other Infidels, whose Princes are afraid of the Pride of <hi>Rome,</hi> that would make them her Subjects and Tributaries, and dispose of them and their States at her pleasure. By this means all hopes would be taken away from the Hereticks of ever seeing the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion ruined by it: for I know their Ministers have from hence all their hopes, and would be sorry to see the Papacy abolished without the Catholick Religion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is absolutely necessary to fortifie the Catholicks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this danger, and to teach them how to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wisdom of God, which they ought always to stand firm to, and the folly of men, which they ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to abhor; and that this last, whatever mixture it may seem to have with Truth, by the art of men, may never make them contemn the other; and that the Truth may never make them receive the Inventions of humane Wisdom, sharpened by Ambition and Avarice, how specious soever they may appear. I shall not be at all surprised, if some men think I say too much, and that there be many who will call me Extravagant; for I know how gross and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Ideas</hi> they who read not the Scripture have of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having been one of that number, who, as well as others, believed that the Church could not subsist without the
<pb facs="tcp:40127:8"/>
Pope, and that there ought to be a Universal and Visible Head of the whole Church: But I shall have reason to think it very strange, if people have not other Sentiments, after the reading of this work. All those who will pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and enter a little with me into the knowledg of the Disorders which that Authority causes among Christians, will find, that I have too much reason, and that I speak with a great deal of Moderation, if they have any zeal and love for the Church.</p>
            <p>For my part, I have been in three different tempers, in regard of the Papacy. When I first knew what it was, I did nothing but sigh, like another <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and afflict my self with grief for the Disorders that shook my Faith: After this, I fell into another frame, wherein, like <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> I did nothing but laugh at the folly and vanity of men, who under pretence of Religion, suffer'd themselves to be so imposed upon. Since that, as my Understanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, I again fell into the Condition of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> being more perswaded than I was of the Truths of Religion, and bearing a greater part in the calamities of the Church, and in the salvation of my neighbour, than before I did; and this it was that moved me to put these my thoughts in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. So go the thoughts of men, succeeding one another, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> according as they are more enlightned.</p>
            <p>Here I think it proper to represent by what Degrees I came to know the Imposture.</p>
            <p>It is now more than 30. years since I was first at <hi>Rome.</hi> There I began to perceive that there was nothing at all in what people had made me believe of the Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. I did never believe that every thing that was told me of them was true; for people would have perswaded me, that the Pope received news every 24. hours from Paradise, and that he sent whomsoever he pleased to Heaven or Hell. But what I believed of him, was his great Sanctity, Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, and Impeccability in every thing he said (as indeed
<pb facs="tcp:40127:9"/>
it seems necessary it should be so, if it be true, that Christ hath given him the Employ that he pretends to), a vast and almost infinite Knowledge, a perfect abstraction from all frail and earthly things, with a continual application for the salvation of all mankind: And I believed as much in proportion of the Cardinals. I found that to be very true which <hi>Tacitus</hi> says, <hi>Major e longinquo Reverentia:</hi> You must not come near a thing to have a value for it. I had the leisure to consider the Maxims and Conduct of these people, which I soon found to be contrary to all the <hi>Ideas</hi> I had formed to my self of them, and I wanted but very little of running stark mad. I was as full of indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those who gave me these impressions, as against those who scandalized me: I saw nothing throughout, but an horrible Licentiousness both in the Court and in the Town, without any appearance of the true Worship of God, as I had observed in many honest people of <hi>France.</hi> I heard of nothing any where, but <hi>Horrors</hi> and Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all kinds; comparing this with the Sentiments that had been instilled into me in <hi>France,</hi> I often cried out, <hi>O quantum est in Rebus Inane!</hi> O how the World is abused! The mind of man is but vanity; and I wished with all my heart, that our poor <hi>French-men</hi> had but seen it, that so they might be undeceived. The greatest part of the men here, pass half the day in the Churches to hear the Musick, and the other half among the Curtesans; and that was it which they at first commended to me, the fine Churches, and the fine Curtesans. This Nation as well as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hath found the secret of Associating their Devotion with a <hi>habit</hi> of the most enormous vices. In one hand they shall hold a long <hi>Bead-roll,</hi> and stick a Dagger into a mans body with the other, or else commit the most horrible Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; nor is there any justice for this, nor for Sodomy, which is more common there than simple Fornication in our Country; nor for poysoning. And from all these things
<pb facs="tcp:40127:9"/>
the Cardinals, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> are no more free than others; For the Popes, their Age ordinarily frees them from these things. I reasoned oftentimes thus with my self; <hi>Is it possible that this here should be the man whom they call His Holiness, who gives Pardons and Indulgences to others, and who Canonizes Saints? Is it possible that these should be the men, and this the Court that gives Laws for Religion to the whole Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess, that my Respect for Religion sensibly diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day; that I was tempted to believe that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion was made only for them, and that I doubted of its Divinity, seeing and hearing nothing but inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Dissoluteness every where, even in the very Cloisters; an Ambition, and an excessive Vanity in all the Prelates, who were promoted for no other merit than that of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavillian</hi> Policy, wherein the Disciples out-do their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. I knew not where I was: Sometimes I cast my eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a person of Reputation and of Merit, as people told me, and I believed so, seeing his Air and his Behaviour: In a matter of 8 days I should hear the secret History of him, which was a horrible one. The <hi>Heros</hi> of this Court are, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> says of <hi>Mucian,</hi> people compounded of great Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and great Vices; <hi>Mucianus Luxuria, Arrogantia, Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, Industria, bonis malis<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> artibus mixtus.</hi> These are brave worldly men; but for Religion, most certainly they have none at all. I am of the Opinion, That staying in this place is very dangerous for an honest man; and people do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, both in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> that their young people that travel, come back from thence <hi>lost</hi> in Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Impiety. That which preserved me from the Contagion of this place, was, that I went with an honest and a simple mind, however, not very ignorant; for I had finished my studies. This it was that disgusted me at all the disorders and licentiousness I saw there, and gave me a <hi>horror</hi> for all their pleasures. Perhaps I should have done like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:40127:10"/>
people, if I had not been so stiff and resolute.</p>
            <p>To free my self from the perplexity I was in about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, through the disorder and irregularity of this Court, that is esteemed the Center of Religion, from whence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this supposition, there ought to shine forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sanctity, Purity, Humility, Charity, and Zeal for the salvation of men, Contempt of the Grandeurs and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the World, with a continual application to the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people; and where I saw nevertheless nothing in the stead of these Vertues but Licentiousness, Ambition and Superstition, with a horrible Ignorance in the people. I then formed a Design to instruct my self, and to know a little better the Principles of the Christian Religion: And I desired for that end a <hi>French</hi> Abbot, with whom I lodged, to lend me a <hi>Latin New Testament,</hi> which he had, and which he read but seldom. I read it with attention, twice over, from one end to the other, which set my mind in better condition than it was before. The more I read, the more I was inwardly comforted; but I was the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against what I saw, without being able to find the least solution to the impossibility that there appeared to me to be, in the Popes being the Universal Vicar of Jesus Christ upon Earth, and Head of the Church Catholick. I there quickly found the principal Articles of Religion establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many places, and often in express terms one only Head of the Church, Jesus Christ, of whom the Church is the Body, and Believers the Members; one only Spouse of the Church, one only Bishop of Bishops; but not one word, neither far nor near, of the Pope and Cardinals, nor any thing that had any relation to them. Besides, all places there were full of Examples and Exhortations to Humility, to Piety, to Chastity, and to Charity. The Master and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples there spoke continually of renouncing the World, its Grandeurs, Vanities, Pleasures, Riches, and above all, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit of <hi>Domination.</hi> But in the Popes, and in
<pb facs="tcp:40127:10"/>
their Court, I found Maxims that were quite contrary. I sometimes entertained the Abbot, who was an <hi>honest</hi> man, and very sociable, with the trouble that this Authority of the Popes gave me. He laughed at it, and gave me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Answers, owning one part of what I objected, and for the rest, he gave me Reasons, which to me were not very sufficient. One day when I pressed him a little more than ordinary, not knowing what to answer me, he told me, That if I would read <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> I should there find many Reasons that would resolve my Doubts. So that I hired one, which I read over and over upon this Subject, without finding any thing that gave me the least satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There were passages of Scripture wrested with great violence, which touched not the question, or else were contrary to it; and the forc'd sense that he gave them was always directly contrary to the Genius of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and opposite to other passages of Scripture, whereof I had made a great Collection, and agreed not at all with the Maxims, and with the Example of Jesus Christ, and of his Apostles. It is true, there were some Humane Reasons, which at first might seem plausible; but besides that they had not that weight which those had which the Scripture furnished with against him; they tended to establish a Worldly and Temporal Dominion in the Church, and renewed the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of those <hi>Jews</hi> who believed that the Reign of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> ought to be accompanied with worldly Pomp and Splendor, and to be exercised with great Authority and with fleshly Arms; for this was the Sum of what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove, That Monarchical Government is the most advantagious in the World, and by consequence, that the Church ought to be governed by the Soveraign Orders of only one man, who is the Pope, who hath the power to exterminate Kings, and all those who will not submit themselves to him. This confirmed me in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I had before, seeing that so subtil a Wit as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40127:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a man so well versed in Antiquity, and that had so much interest in the thing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> could find out nothing at all to maintain this Opinion.</p>
            <p>At length, I went into <hi>Germany,</hi> where, after Eight or Nine Months travelling, I came to <hi>Cologne,</hi> where I had a great desire to inform my self farther, and to know if the Papacy had a great while ruled in the Church, and how long since? Whether or no the Ancient Doctors of the Church had heard it spoken of, and what they thought of it? I applied my self then to examine some of the Fathers upon this Article; and that I might the sooner have done, I consulted them upon those places of Scripture which the Popes make use of, to see if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers understood them as they do. I found in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that they explained them in a manner quite contrary to the Pope's Pretensions. This made me cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that the Papacy must have been set up in the Church by some violent stroke, or else by small beginnings, and by degrees, as it ordinarily falls out in Usurpations, which are made either altogether by a greater force, or else by little and little; and that this Usurpation had been seconded and favoured by people, who saw there was not like to be any great resistance, and they made their advantage of it through mens igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>After that, another thing that gave me a great deal of trouble, was, how to separate the Article of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy from the Verities of the Catholick Faith, so that the Infallibility of the Church, as I understood it, might not be prejudiced. Thinking on this then, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in my unquiet mind, I resolved farther to consult the Scripture, and the Fathers, upon the passages ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily alledged to prove the Infallibility of the Church; and I found that they did not understand them as I did: But because I knew what made the Cardinals, and other
<pb facs="tcp:40127:11"/>
people, employ the utmost of their ingenuity in Defence of the Popes Authority, and that I saw not well what Advantage they could draw from the Infallibility of the Church, which they maintained with so much ardor, that doubled my attention, to sound the depth of the matter; and I found, that by the help of this Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they would conceal every thing, so as to save the Popes Authority, and all the Temporal Advantages which flow from it; and I made no further doubt of it, when I saw they applied it particularly to the Clergy, excluding all the people, and many men to the Pope alone, excluding all other Bishops.</p>
            <p>Since these Discoveries, I have always held it as a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, wherein I have never been deceived, which is, That when any practice or Custom in the Church brings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or honour to the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> I presently suspect and examine it.</p>
            <p>At length having a long time reflected upon all the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of this Papal Authority, and having observed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition to which it hath reduced the Christian Religion as well without as within the Church, and seeing it was that which having driven the <hi>Greeks</hi> and Protestants out of the Church, is still the cause why they return not again unto its Communion, and that it even draws strange Persecutions upon the Church from these scattered sheep, by reason of the attempts of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its favourers; I at last resolved to publish this little Treatise to disabuse mankind in respect of the unjust and criminal Devotion which they have for the Papacy, and also to purge the Church of it as well as of all other vices and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes it hath there caused; being perswaded that an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible fruit of this Reformation would be the Conversion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Protestants, Pagans, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans;</hi> not to mention the Honour it would do to all the Catholick Princes, whose Majesty and Greatness are vilified by this
<pb facs="tcp:40127:12"/>
shameful subjection to, and dependance on the Popes, which make them to be despised by other Princes who have freed themselves from their Tyranny. A Senator of <hi>Sweden</hi> told me one day a very good saying of <hi>Tacitus</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Viri muliebria patiuntur.</hi> Men act the parts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; which is as much as to say, they are the <hi>Catamites</hi> of the Popes.</p>
            <p>However, since it is in their power to treat those as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Enemies of the Church who oppose their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Interest, I prepare my self against it, and that doth not at all discourage me. It is more Honourable to be hated by such people than loved. <hi>Illi maledicent, at tu Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Benedices.</hi> I know the Reader will in this Work of mine presently look after the <hi>Caracters</hi> of either <hi>Jansenist, Calvinist,</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi>; or lastly, of a man who could not be promoted to Benefices, and many times he will think he hath found me. As for Benefices I might perhaps have had one if I had had a mind to it; but by the Grace of God, I will have none, nor have I need of any, nor was I ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for it. The <hi>Jansenists</hi> are as yet too much Papists to speak ill of the Papacy. As for the <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> I wish they could be brought to own the <hi>opinions</hi> which I do, and which I have no mind to betray in this my Book. It is true, they have both written often against this power, but not with design that the Catholick Religion should be the better for it, to which this Work wholly tends. Whatever men will judg, I think I ought not to renounce any truth because the Hereticks know it; nor to put my eyes out rather than see the Injustice of the Papacy, because the Hereticks see it. If I had not here drawn the Picture of the Jesuits Religion, it may be those they call the <hi>Jansenists</hi> would have suspected them to have been the authors of it as the present times go; and for the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> I am sure, that in many places they will say that I do but gild over the Pill, that they may the more easily swallow down the poyson, as some people have
<pb facs="tcp:40127:12"/>
said of the Book of <hi>Mr. de Condom;</hi> they may judg of it what they please, I have followed the sentiments which the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Scripture hath inspired me with, and in which I am confirmed the more by reading the Fathers, and the Ecclesiastical History, and by making reflection upon all that I have seen in foreign Countries, and upon what I see every day here.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Romanists</hi> hear this Work spoken of, they will say, without doubt, as heretofore at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when <hi>Mr. de Faber</hi> made Remonstrances on the Kings behalf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the disorders of the Church, <hi>Gallus Cantat,</hi> they cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have no better answer than what he made them, <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ad Galli cantum, Petrus resipisceret;</hi> let them come and renounce the Dominion and Tyranny they exercise over the Church, and over the World, and let our Bishops for time to come, behave themselves like worthy <hi>Successors</hi> of this Apostle.</p>
            <p>This Work shall be divided into Three Parts, which will contain so many Chapters. In the first I shall prove that the Papacy hath no foundation in the Word of God; and shall shew the vanity &amp; folly of those arguments which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to draw from the Gospel. In the second I shall make it appear that the Primitive Church never knew it, and that in the darkest Ages there were ever some who opposed it, and I shall confute many human reasons, which for want of the Scripture, and of the Fathers, are made use of for its defence. And in the third and last, I shall examine all the pretended advantages which this Authority procures to the Church, or to States, and I shall shew that 'tis so far from bringing any real good to the Church, or to Catholick States, that it is the cause of the Desolations of the Church, and of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the Disorders among all Christians, of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Heresies, Schisms and Irreligion that reign. No man ought to be surprised that I conceal who I am in so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse an age as we live in, where Truth and Honesty as well
<pb facs="tcp:40127:13"/>
as those who profess it, are exposed to cruel Persecutions, and wherein I shall have as many mortal enemies as there are worldly Catholicks and Papists, and people in possession of Benefices, without mentioning the Monks.</p>
            <p>I have no reason to flatter my self with any great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess this Book may have by reason of the extream disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and irreligion of the Age; and I do it more to discharge my self of the load lying upon me, and for the consolation of my own mind, than for any other thing, as heretofore <hi>Petrarch</hi> said upon a like occasion, <hi>Haec scribo, non tam Ã¹t sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo meo prosim, cujus tam desperata miseria est, quam ut me conceptis onerem &amp; Animum scriptis soler. I write these things not so much to profit the age I live in, whose misery is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate, as to unburthen my self of my own thoughts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh my spirit with writing I have written for my self. Haec mihi cecini &amp; Musis, &amp; si nemo Alius Audierit.</hi> I have sung these things to my self and the Muses, tho no body else should hear them.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>That the Papacy hath no Divine Title. The vanity and nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of those which it draws from the Gospel.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHosoever shall read the New Testament, will there find that Jesus Christ alone is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Head of the Church, and that it is not said of any other, that she should be his Body, or Believers his Members, that belonging to none but Jesus Christ, who is also the only Spouse of the Church, which would be adulterous should she sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to another; and this other could not be but an evil person, and a reprobate, since that in taking the quality of Spouse of the Church, he must renounce that of Son of the Church, and so could not have God for his Father, according to the Maxim, <hi>That he who hath not the Church for his Mother, hath not God for his Father.</hi> Now no one person can be the Head, the Spouse and Son of the Church at the same time. Nevertheless it is certain that the Popes do assume these Titles to themselves by a vanity which exceeds all folly, and without being able to produce any reason for it, Divine or Humane. But let us see what they say to maintain their pretensions.</p>
            <p>They say that among the <hi>Jews</hi> one man only, <hi>viz. Aaron,</hi> had the conduct of Divine Service, and was Head of the Levites, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40127:14"/>
that by consequence there ought to be in the Christian Church an Authority like unto this, Established over the whole Church; and that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> perform the Functions of this charge. Whereupon there are many things to be said: First of all, it was not difficult for <hi>Aaron</hi> to acquit himself of this in so little a State as <hi>Judea,</hi> and in one only City of this State, which was <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in one only T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>mple of that City; for it was not allowed to perform Divine Service, nor to Sacrifice elsewhere; whereas Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity is at this time spread over the whole world, and therefore one single person only cannot perform these Functions every where. It is as if a man should say, that because <hi>France</hi> is well governed by one King, he might as well govern all the States of the habitable Earth; and yet it would be much more easie for him to do it, than for one Bishop to govern the whole Church, because (as it is well known) the Ecclesiastical Ministry cannot inflict Corporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Delinquents as the Civil Government may and does. Besides, <hi>Aaron</hi> was no way the Figure of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>; for then the Type would have been more excellent than the Original; but he was the Figure of our Great and Soveraign High Priest Jesus Christ. Furthermore, <hi>Aaron</hi> was not the Monarch of the Levites, but as the <hi>Doge</hi> is at <hi>Venice</hi>; for according to all the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudists,</hi> he was subject to the Jurisdiction of the Great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and to their Censure; whereas the Popes pretend to be not only the Monarchs of the whole Earth, but particularly of all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. And besides all this, there was an express institution of God for this charge, and for the person of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and of his Successors. Whereas there is nothing like it for the Papacy, nor for the persons of those who exercise it. We see in the Old Testament the Institution of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Charge with many Ceremonies for his Installment, and for his anointing; many Ordinances for the Exercise of this Charge, and for the Succession; many Chapters which speak of the Subordination of Priests and Levites. But on the contrary we find not one word in the Gospel of this pretended charge of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Head of the Church, of Vicar-General of Jesus Christ, and Successor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any thing that hath any relation to it; and yet it ought to have been there clear and evident, since that this Ministry was to be of an extent a thousand times greater, and the thing in it self is prodigious, and appears quite contrary to the nature of the Messias his Kingdom, and to the Gospel. We see several Orders of Ministers of the Gospel, there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40127:14"/>
often spoken of; but not one word that can any ways relate to the Pope; when surely that was the place to have spoken of it, especially if it be necessary to Salvation to be subject to him, as they would have it, and if he hath the power as they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, as well over the Temporality as the Spirituality of the whole world; St. <hi>Paul</hi> who without question was of as great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as the Pope, was not of these peoples humour, who pretend to govern the whole Church; since he who had not the thousandth part of Christians to take care of, as the Pope would have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their supposition, declares that no Mortal man was sufficient to perform every thing that was necessary to be done in it, and that he was himself overwhelmed with the care he took for all the Churches. Nor had St. <hi>Peter</hi> the courage of our good Popes, who believe themselves capable of governing the whole Church, (and they might do it without difficulty after the method they take) since he agreed with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> should go toward the Gentiles, and he towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so they parted the Ministry between them. At least the Popes, after <hi>Aarons</hi> example, ought to meddle only in Ecclesiastical, and not in Secular affairs, as they do, pretending to Lord it over the whole world; for we see that <hi>Aaron</hi> applied himself only to the Functions of his Charge, and that in things Temporal and Civil he was subject to <hi>Moses,</hi> and left the Absolute direction of them to him.</p>
            <p>Instead of imitating <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Head of the Levites, in his Modesty, the Popes pretend to be Lords not only of the Temporality, but of the Spirituality, of all the States of the world, and will in this be Vicars of Jesus Christ, tho he declared that his Kingdom was not of this world, tho he taught his Disciples, that he among them who would be the first, should be the last, though he fled away when they would have made him a King, tho he payed Tribute to the Princes of the world, when he was himself Lord both of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; tho he expresly forbad his Disciples to bear rule over any one whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The Popes notwithstanding this, will govern, and pretend that our Saviour did amiss when he spoke thus, and that they know better than he how to improve the rights of his Prerogative. For my part, I believe that such a King as Jesus Christ who holds the Earth in his hand, according to the Prophet's expression, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all things by the power of his word, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, who knows the hearts of all men, and governs the motions of all the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40127:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
creatures; who is Almighty, who knows and sees every thing, without whom no man can have neither life, motion, nor being; such a King, I say, hath no need of a Vicar-General for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Government of the Church, because he is present in all places, no more than an Husband needs a Vicar for his Wife, or a living Father for his Children; and that he himself assureth us that where two or three are gathered together in his name, there will he be in the midst of them. If he hath a Vicar-General, he can be no other than the Holy Ghost. We also see that when he was upon the point of leaving his poor Disciples who were afflicted by reason of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching departure from them, he tells them not, <hi>I will leave you the Pope to guide and govern you,</hi> which had been but a poor consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But, <hi>I will send you the Comforter, who shall lead you in all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we consider in what the administration of this Spiritual Kingdom doth consist, we shall clearly see that no one mortal man can be the Vicar-General of it: Can one only man preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and administer the Sacraments all the world over? They tell you, that he will make it be done by others, (would to God the Popes would do so) but these Delegated Preachers would be thus the Popes Vicars, who pretends to be the Vicar of Jesus Christ, and sometimes of St. <hi>Peter</hi>; which cannot be according to all the Canonists, who maintain that one Vicar cannot make another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the Ecclesiastical Ministry, properly speaking, cannot be subdelegated to Vicars; for whosoever discharges it, ought always to perform it in Preaching, or Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rcising the other Episcopal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the name of Jesus Christ, and not in the name of any creature; and a man must be a fool or a seducer to do otherwise. A meer man, as the Pope is, can he fill the souls of men with peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, which is the Kingdom of Jesus Christ? Can he def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nd the Church against all its enemies, visible and invisible? Can he give the Crown of Righteousness to those who shall be victorious and faithful to God to the death? Can he raise them up again? These are Acts of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ over his Church. What relation hath the Dominion of the Pope to that of Jesus Christ? What resemblance between light and darkness? between Jesus Christ and <hi>Belial</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident that it is without any foundation that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome</hi> boast of being Vicars of Jesus Christ; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40127:15"/>
were not Vicars of Jesus Christ, but of the Church, as every Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is in his Parish, <hi>Pontifex Vicarius Ecclesiae, non Christi.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they maintain that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had this Employ of Universal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, that he was Head of the Apostles, and of the whole Church, Bishop of Bishops, Soveraign both of Spirituality and Temporality, Monarch of the Church, and of the World. In a word, that he had all the Prerogatives that the Popes at this present time enjoy, in quality of Successors of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And that, as I have said, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to produce so much as one word, of the Creation and Institution of this Charge so important to the Church, if you will believe them, nor of the Rights of this Charge, nor of the Succession, nor of the manner of the Election, nor how so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous a Charge ought to be Exercised, nor of the respect and obedience due to this Vicar, nor of the use of his Office. They affirm boldly that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was Bishop there, That he founded that Church, That he died there, and left a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, who was called <hi>Clement</hi> or <hi>Linus,</hi> or <hi>Anacletus</hi>; of which things, tho they make the Salvation of all men to depend upon them, they are not able to prove one tittle. And they do affirm that this Successor entered into the full possession of all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to which all the Bishops of that City have ever since equally succeeded, both good and bad, unto the present Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh.</p>
            <p>It must be readily acknowledged, that these Gentlemen must have very penetrating understandings to make these discoveries from the Gospel; for it is certain that they are wholly impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there; I have sometimes read it without ever finding any thing that was at all like it, and I think I saw clearly that St. <hi>Peter</hi> never knew he had this Authority, but that on the contrary he believed that no Christian whatever, much less a Bishop, ought to have it in the Church; nor did the other A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ostles know it any more than he, for somewhat of it would then appear; and they who protest they have made known to us the whole will of God, would have been extreamly to blame not only to have declared nothing of it to us, but also to have always spoken and acted with their Soveraign Head and Master, as with an Equal. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have lost all manner of respect for him when he so warmly reproved him. It seems probable also that our Saviour was obliged to have given them notice of it; for naturally they could not know it; and the Modesty, Charity, and Humility of St. <hi>Peter</hi> might have hindred
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40127:16"/>
him from declaring and exercising this Empire over them; yet it is certain that there is nothing like this to be found. Nevertheless this doth not hinder but that the Pope and Cardinals whose eyes their own interest opens, as it blinds other peoples, have in their own opinions found very strong proofs of it in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: They say for example, that our Saviour changed only St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s name; the reason as you see is without reply; for it follows very necessarily from thence, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Head and King of the Church. But unluckily he also changed the names of the Children of <hi>Zebedee.</hi> They say also that he is sometimes named the first; but if he be not so always, this will signifie nothing to them; but tho he had been always so, this would not prove that he had authority over the others as the Pope hath over the other Bishops. Amongst the Presidents, the first hath no power over the others; nor amongst the Electors of the Empire; the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who hath the first place, hath no authority over the other Electors; and so in all Societies the Primacy carries no dominion along with it: But besides, if that reason should take place, the Holy Virgin, who is sometimes named the last in Scripture, would be greatly degraded from the place that belongs to her. If St. <hi>Peter</hi> were always named the first, that might have been given to his Age, as the Fathers say; and in truth we ought to attribute it to this, that our Saviour spoke so often to him, as well as to the fervency of his zeal, which as we ought to admire and commend, so also may we say that it was owing to the eagerness of his temper, which being not always well regulated, made him commit greater faults than any others of the Apostl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s (except the perfidious <hi>Judas</hi>) which made him be called Satan by his good Master, which none of the other were. We ought also to attribute to this temper the blow he gave <hi>Malchus</hi> with the Sword, as well as that warmth that made him promise wonders of Fidelity to his Master, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to accompany him to the Emperors Court, where he denied his Saviour. So that it is with very little reason that they make an argument of this to prove his Royalty in the Church. In <hi>Spain,</hi> where the most Honourable walk the last, they will not fail to alledg places where St. <hi>Peter</hi> is named last, as in the passage where it is said, <hi>I am the Disciples of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Caephas,</hi> who is <hi>Peter.</hi> For I remember that at <hi>Paris,</hi> where they understand Divinity a little better than in <hi>Spain,</hi> a good Bishop and an Abbot did maintain to me, that the passage where it is said
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40127:16"/>
that <hi>James, Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are esteemed Pillars of the Church, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alledged against them another where he is named the first, they maintained to me I say, that this passage confirmed that which they alledged and proved very well the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> For said the Bishop, when three persons of worth are walking together, they always put the most Honourable in the middle. This is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common saying, That a Lawyer well paid shall always find the cause of his Client, good: His Benefices made him see clear in this passage.</p>
            <p>There are three other passages which the greatest part of our Doctors produce against our Adversaries with a little more colour, which are, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Feed my sheep.</hi> Which passages we shall examine one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to see if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had any priviledg above the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; they say, that in the first of these passages Jesus Christ doth establish the Church, found it, and built it upon St. <hi>Peter.</hi> I do not deny but that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was one of the Pillars of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is so called as well as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Nor can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that he was and is one of the foundations of the Church, since that he is not excepted out of the number of the Twelve, who in Scripture are called the Foundations of the New Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. But I maintain that the Church is no more founded upon him, than upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apostles. I would fain have these Gentlemen tell me, upon whom the Church was founded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi>? and why the Church changed its foundation, and upon whom <hi>Peter</hi> himself was founded? It was without doubt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jesus Christ, upon the Rock which is the <hi>Christ.</hi> And it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all question that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and we ought to have no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had, who says, <hi>That no man can lay any other foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</hi> Also we see in this passage, that it is upon the Rock, upon the Rock of Ages, that our Saviour builds his Church, and not upon St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The Holy Ghost would have changed neither name nor person, if he would have had us to have believed this of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> He would not have said, <hi>Super hanc Petram, sed super te Petrum. Vpon this Rock,</hi> but <hi>upon thee Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the end that no difficulty may remain, we must observe what goes before, and what follows after. Jesus Christ had deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all the Apostles together, whom they thought he was? <hi>Peter</hi> either as the eldest or most zealous answers for all, and says to him,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40127:17"/>
               <hi>Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God.</hi> Whereupon Jesus Christ says to him, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church, &amp;c.</hi> It is evident that as our Saviour's discourse was directed to all, and that <hi>Peter</hi> answered for all; the following part of our Saviours Discourse was directed also to them all, and related no more to <hi>Peter</hi> than to any other particular Apostle. And men must have lost their understandings to think, that Jesus Christ in this place founded his Church upon <hi>Peter,</hi> whom in the same Chapter he calls Satan. What Foundation would the Church have had, and what would have become of her when he deni'd his Saviour?</p>
            <p>It must then necessarily be acknowledged, that it is not the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church that is here spoken of, which they pretend St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Head of: But the Invisible, the Society of the Faithful, and the Elect. For the Gates of Hell would have prevailed against the Church, not only when St. <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Master, since that the foundation being run to decay, that which is built upon it falls to ruin: But since that time have they not very often prevailed against this Church which they would have the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Successors of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Heads of? For Example, when according to the Fathers the whole World was <hi>Arian</hi>

               </note>, the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and all their Flock; and so many other times as the Popes have been Magicians, Sodomites, Atheists, Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what would have become of the Church in the time of that great Schism that succeeded <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth, which lasted fifty years, when the <hi>French</hi> would not have an <hi>Italian</hi> Pope, nor the <hi>Italians</hi> a <hi>French</hi> one; and many Princes would have neither one nor other; to whom at length <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth joined himself for three years, and the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was very well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a Pope; and many other Princes for a longer season. And what shall we say of that great Schism which the Popes made and caused with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, by cutting them off, out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish pride, from the Communion of the Church, because they would not submit to their yoke, but demanded the observation of the Canons? What shall we say also of that great Apostacy that happened about 130 or 140 years since, or thereabout, when so many States separated themselves from the Church, by reason of the Impiety and Tyranny of the Popes? Doth not all this prove that Hell hath prevailed against this exterior and visible Church, which the Popes govern, and whereof St. <hi>Peter</hi> according to them was the Head? It is then the <hi>Invisible</hi> Church which is here spoken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40127:17"/>
of the Society of the Faithful, the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whereof Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is the principal Corner-stone, upon which St. <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self saith believers are built as living stones. He says not it is on himself that they are built, but on the contrary, he pretends himself as well as others, to be one of these living stones which are built upon the Corner-stone, which is Christ. It is then upon the Rock confessed by <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> or upon his Confession that the Church is founded; on that which he declared that Jesus Christ was the true Messias, the Son of the Living God. And the Fathers understood it no otherwise. I do not pretend here to relate all that they have said upon this subject, but only some clear passages: <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40127:18"/>
Prerogative above the other Apostles; and here a Reflection may be made, which I think necessary to prevent the Cheat which may be put upon us in this matter, by producing some passages of the Fathers falsified or maimed, or else some Testimonies of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the later times, who have been for the most part vile slaves to the Popes and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be considered that when upon such a subject as this, a man shall pretend to alledg any thing of Antiquity, which seems to favour the opinion of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Primacy, that cannot counter-ballance what I have produced in short against that Primacy, not only because I can produce an hundred places against one which they shall alledg; but principally for this reason, that it is never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable for any man to oppose the Institutions of God, nor to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand, deny, change, or diminish them. So that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had had the Authority over the Apostles, and over the whole Church, which they pretend, and which the Popes at this time do exercise over Bishops, Kings, and the whole Church, the Fathers never could deny it without a crime; nor could they ever equal him to the other Apostles without being guilty of Heresie, and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence against God. Whereas we may very lawfully speak advantageously of the Ordinances and Institutions of God, of Holy things, and every thing that conduceth to the true Worship of God, and consequently of the Holy Apostles also, who were the admirable Organs of his Grace for the conversion of the World. We may, I say, speak of them with praise and with wonder, with respect and veneration, and even attribute to them sometimes names and degrees of excellency, which do not belong to them without any prejudice to Piety, provided they are not attributes nor honours which are appropriated only to the Divine Being, for then it would be Idolatry, as it is to attribute that to the Pope which belongs only to <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> For example, in reference to the great men of this world, it is very allowable to speak to the advantage of a Minister of State, to whom a great King shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a part of his Authority for his service: It is very fit to commend him, and to extoll him even above his merit, by reason of the good qualities which appear in him, or the favours which he receives from the King; provided that the respect and obedience due to the King be inviolably kept; but it would be a crime to lessen or contemn him, especially when the prosperity, tranquillity and safety of the State depends upon him. So I maintain, that tho

the Fathers had said a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h excess of extravagancy as to think that one simple man could be the Head of the Universal Church. Whereas if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been instituted by God in that quality, to deny it, would look like resisting God, destroying the Church, which would be established upon him, and dethroning J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It must then be agreed to, whatever the Doctors of the Age say, that the Church is built upon Jesus Christ, and not upon a man; and we may say with <hi>David,</hi> That the stone which the builders refused, is in spight of them become the Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the Church.</p>

That is to say, That the power of the Keys was given also to all the Apostles; and not only to them, but to all Bishops; and that it was not without design that our Lord committed to one what he intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all: For thereby the example of <hi>Peter</hi> is proposed to all them who have a share in the Government of the Church.

            <p>I think these Evidences are sufficient to shew the injustice of the Popes, who attribute to St. <hi>Peter</hi> alone those things which he had in common with all the other Apostles, and all good Pastors, and that to usurp an authority which neither St. <hi>Peter</hi> nor any other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40127:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Creature ever could have; and though it were possible that St. <hi>Peter</hi> or any other might have had it, the Popes have less right to pretend to it than any other Priest, because that they are but Temporal Princes; For under the Gospel men derogate both from Episcopacy and Priesthood, when they become Temporal Princes; and it is certain that according to the Scripture and the Holy Canons, these two things are inconsistent. They ought to consider which they will stand to: I am perswaded they would not contradict themselves in the matter, but would always hold to the Temporal, which they call the <hi>solid</hi> thing, as Cardinal <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavicini</hi>

                  <hi>Palavicini</hi> lib 4. c. 6.</note> very well observes, that they desire the Popedom only for the vast quantities of Money which they get by it, with the means of Obliging and doing Courtesies; <hi>Due beni per cui soli appar Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable il Pontificato, il Principiato dell Oro e del Obligo.</hi> And in the Age we live in, they would be in danger of not making so much of their Episcopacy as <hi>Boniface</hi> the third did by <hi>Phocas</hi>; and if they should let their Beast but once get loose, they would find it a hard matter to get up again.</p>
            <p>But besides, I think I ought here to put you in mind of one thing, which is, that the power of binding and loosing is not what the Popes and many evil minded Priests would make us believe; for I do maintain, not only that the Pope cannot free a man from the guilt of his Crimes, and from the punishment due to them, no more than the meanest Priest, as <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Marsilius</hi> Patav. p. 2, c. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Marsilius</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> heretofore said; but also, that neither one nor other of them hath any power of pardoning Sins, but as far as it doth appear to them that God doth pardon them, and that properly it belongs not to them but to God. I shall be asked how the Priest or the Pope knows when God pardons any mans Sins: And I ask them, by what Authority they can dispence with the punishments a man hath deserved for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended God, without there be some appearance of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Man? I know very well there are many who affirm that the Pope can do it, and others who pretend that <hi>attrition</hi> is sufficient; but it will be no hard matter for me to prove that these Opinions are both foolish and Impious: It is God only that can truly pardon Sins, and he never does it but to the Contrite Heart, that is to say, to those who have a real sorrow within themselves for having offended so good and so merciful a God; and who make a firm Resolution to forsake their Sins, and to punish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40127:21"/>
by Repentance, and by the Mortification of their Flesh, and of their Passions, and who will as much as in them lies in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to men, repair their crimes by making Satisfaction to all those they have wronged: and Lastly, who have made a Vow to endeavour all their Life-time to root up all their evil habits. When these Dispositions do not appear in a Penitent, the Pastor cannot pardon his Sins; and when they do appear, he cannot refuse to give him Absolution. The Holy Scripture mentions no other power of binding and loosing Sinners, but doth detest the use which the Popes make of it, who Excommunicated whomsoever they please, even Kings themselves, and whole Nations for no other reason that their Fantasy, <note n="â€¡" place="margin">

Would the Pope endure this from the Bishops, or from any other?

               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Corin. chap. 11. v. 5.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> says expresly, that he was not inferior to the greatest of the Apostles: In St.<note n="â€ " place="margin">Math. 28. v. 20.</note>

            <p>If St. <hi>Peter</hi> had known that he had been the Head of the Church, he would not in all likelihood have suffered, that his Ministry should have been thus limited, or that the Ministry or Power of St. <hi>Paul</hi> should have been of an extent an hundred times greater than his, especially if he had been of the humour of our good Popes.

St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> looks upon him as the first of all the Saints; and if there had been any Preheminence among the Apostles, he should have been preferred before any other.

            <p>Thus we see that in the Holy Scripture there is not one word that can in the least authorize the Popes Supremacy.

of the Church, Religion it self, and the Salvation of all Christians to depend, being not to be found in Scripture, cannot be but false. For though it be true that there are some Customs and Ceremonies in the Church which are not to be found in Scripture, and which the Protestants are greatly in the wrong, obstinately to reject, because that Tradition, and the use or practise of the Church, have so long since given them sufficient Authority, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves acknowledg; yet that cannot be said of this Article, which according to the Popes, and the greatest part of the Doctors, is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital; and so Capital they would willingly perswade us, that without it the rest signifies nothing. It was very impiously said of Cardinal <hi>Palavicim</hi> in his Third Book of his History of the Council of <hi>Trent, Chap.</hi> the 15. <hi>That the Christian Religion hath no more sure and immediate certainty than the Popes Authority.

            </argument>
            <p>LET us now see if the Primitive Church did acknowledg a power in the Church like to that of the Popes. Altho that which hath been already alledged from the Holy Fathers proves sufficiently, that they knew not the Papacy, let us however exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the thing a little more particularly. We are told then that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Head of the Church, that he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was a Bishop there, that he died there, that he resigned that Charge of Head of the Church, and of Bishop, but not that of an Apostle to a Successor; which Successor he either chose, or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did it after his death, by the power which he had given her; which things are all of them very difficult to prove, and certainly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40127:23"/>
very false; for a thing of this consequence ought not to be founded upon conjectures of meer probabilities, but we ought to have as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and as exact a knowledg of it as of any other Article of our Religion. And yet we see that they who have spoken of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and of his Death there, have said it upon such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable grounds, and say so many contradictory things as well of it as of his pretended Successor, that there is nothing more uncertain in all Antiquity. But besides this, none of them ever believed, no nor so much as suspected that St. <hi>Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> was Head of the Universal Church. And the contradiction and little certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is in these Authors, shews sufficiently that in the Primitive times it was not believed that this was necessary to be known; nor did they in the least suspect that ever any body would endeavour to lay upon it the foundation of that horrible Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ity which the Popes do Exercise.</p>
            <p>To give you some Instances of their Contradictions, I need only to shew you that some say it was <hi>Linus</hi> who succeeded <hi>Peter</hi>; others <hi>Clement</hi>; and lastly, others say it was <hi>Anacletus</hi>; some will have it that St. <hi>Peter</hi> founded this Church, and was the first that Preached at <hi>Rome.</hi> Others maintain, namely <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> that it was <hi>Barnabas.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> shews us clearly that it was he himself who founded that Church; for he complains that coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he found that the Jews there, who had embraced Christianity, were but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle instructed in the Doctrine of the Christian Religion. Who can believe that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been there, and had founded this Church, he would not have instructed them better? And what is yet more, St. <hi>Paul</hi> says expresly in another pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re others had preached before him; because he would not build upon the Foundation of others. As for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Death, some say he was Crucified with St. <hi>Paul</hi>; Others, that he was beheaded, and <hi>Linus</hi> the pretended successor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who writes the History of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Death, says not one word of St. <hi>Peters.</hi> St. <note n="â€¡" place="margin">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40127:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and said, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi>? It was, because they did not examine the thing, believing it useless; and they did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see the dreadful Consequences that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> would draw from it: They grounded it upon that place of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, where it is said, <hi>the Church which is at</hi> Babylon, <hi>saluteth you</hi>; Interpreting <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Babylon,</hi> without any reason; because there were two other <hi>Babylons,</hi> the one in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> where <hi>Bagdet</hi> is; and the other in <hi>Aegypt</hi> near <hi>Memphis,</hi> where it is certain there were many <hi>Jews</hi> who were under St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ministry. As for the pretended combat between St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the Learned acknowledg that it was but a fiction.</p>
            <p>But put the case St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> what advantage can the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> make of it? That he had left at <hi>Rome</hi> his Charge of Universal Vicar of Jesus Christ? But on what do they found this pretence? If he had done it, it would plainly have been united to his Apostleship, rather than to the quality of a Bishop; and so by consequence could not have been communicated to any other than an Apostle, and so St. <hi>James,</hi> or St. <hi>John,</hi> who continued alive long time after him, should have inherited it, and not <hi>Linus</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and they would have transported it to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> which were their Churches, if the Town of <hi>Rome</hi> had not had some particular priviledges (which no man knows) that affixed this Dignity to that City, in which case one of these two Apostles ought to have come and resided there. However it is likely that St. <hi>James</hi> or St. <hi>John,</hi> who without all controversie lived a great while after him, should rather have succeeded him in this admirable Charge than a simple Priest or Bishop, as <hi>Linus.</hi> If the City of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to derive this Prerogative from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s having been there, and Preached the Gospel, (which cannot be proved) the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ought to be preferred before it, for it is certain both by the Scriptures and by the Fathers, that he was there, and Preached there before it was possible for him to do it at <hi>Rome.</hi> And upon this it was that they built that Revelation of the See of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s being removed from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> which you find in the Decrees of <hi>Gratian,</hi> in the Epistle of Pope <hi>Marcellus</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Caus. 84. q. 5.

Besides, if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had had a Successor in this pretended Charge, how comes it to pass that the Primitive Church that compiled the Canon of Books, which ought to regulate the Faith of the Church, hath not comprehended
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40127:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therein the Works of <hi>Linus,</hi> or of <hi>Clement,</hi> who wrote enough, and yet hath inserted those of St. <hi>James,</hi> and of St. <hi>John,</hi> who ought to be much inferior in Infallibility, and in Sanctity to the Vicar-General of Jesus Christ upon Earth, and who ought to have been his Subjects, and to have taken the Oath of Fidelity to him as they do at this day to his Holiness?

That Article doth it self sufficiently exclude all dependance upon any particular See. And the other, <hi>I believe the Communion of Saints,</hi> doth also establish Jesus Christ the only Head of the Church, and condemns its being subject to an humane Head.

Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> also Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of these pretended Priviledges of his Bishoprick; for he acknowledges in his Register to <hi>Eulogius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that the Bishops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and of <hi>Antioch,</hi> are Successors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that they sit in the Chair of <hi>Peter</hi> as well as the Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor was <hi>Irenaeus</hi> any more perswaded that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> alone had this advantage, when having reproved <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by a ridiculous rashness had Excommunicated for a matter of small importance all the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> (which was concerning the difference of the day whereon <hi>Easter</hi> was to be kept) he says to him <note n="(b)" place="margin">

            <p>But let us here observe by the by, how much the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> are degenerated from that Piety and Love for the Liberty which Jesus Christ hath acquired for his Church.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that Bishops were always equal in the first Ages of the Church: It was some time after the Death of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> before they thought of establishing in every Province one Bishop above the rest: They thought it would be advantagious for removing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order that sprung up sometimes among them for concurrence and presidency. He resided in the Capital City, and was called the Metropolitan. At first he had no Authority over the others, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the place; but afterwards they conferred upon them the power of consecrating Bishops of the Province, because they dwelt in the Capital Ciiy, where every body came about their Affairs. And it is from thence that Bishops became subject to their Metropolitans, and have been distinguished from them by the Ordination which they receive from them. These Metropolitans were called in the West <hi>Arch-bishops</hi>; After this there was given them the power of calling Provincial Synods, who for that Reason were assembled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Capital City. That was brought in at first only as a Custom, and because it looked as though the state of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment did require it. But at length this Custom was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and became a Law. After that, for the maintenance of Unity among the Churches of divers Provinces, it was further thought requisite to establish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, or Primates over these Arch-bishops, according to the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Civil Government. These Primates were the Bishops of the chief City of some great Province, or of a Diocess that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended many Provinces. At first they acknowledged no Superior, but by little and little, they of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and lastly, he of <hi>Rome,</hi> did first attempt their Rights; and after came the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> who established over these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans four Patriarchs, of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to whom afterwards he of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was also add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Honour of that City; but he lasted not long. The two principal were he of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> because those were two Seats of the Empire, and at last they took upon them the Quality of Oecumenical Bishops against all Reason, Divine, or Humane, and against the Decrees of many Councils.

that if they did it, it would bring an eternal shame upon them. It is true, the Cardinal did corrupt the Arch-bishop, who received the <hi>Roman</hi> Service; but the Clergy and the People soon shook off the Yoke, till <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh's time, who by cunning practices, and by cruelty, oppressed them. <note n="*" place="margin">Vasaeus in Chronico Hisp Anno Christi 717, Rodericus Arch.

Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi> also resisted for some time couragiously, because they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted somewhat of their Spiritual, as well as of their Temporal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.

See Cardinal <hi>D' Ailly,</hi> in his book of the Reformation. <hi>Guicciardin</hi> also confirms it: <hi>The Church of</hi> Ravenna, says he, <hi>disputed with</hi> Rome <hi>for the Primacy, because the Seat of Religion hath been accustomed to follow the Power of the Empire and its Arms</hi>; which, by the way, also proves the Usurpations of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome. Durand</hi> also tells us, That <hi>Charlemayne</hi> was intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> to abolish the <hi>Ambrosian</hi> Service throughout all <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and that he found great resistance, as against an unheard of Tyranny. <hi>The Emperor,</hi> says he, <hi>did compel all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks, both by Threats and Punishments, to burn the Books of the</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosian <hi>Service. He could not force the Men of</hi> Milan <hi>to it, who yet kept it near</hi> 300. <hi>years.</hi> And we see in the 6<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the Capitularies of <hi>Charlemayne,</hi> that this Emperour made this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Year 806, that the Service should be sung in Churches, according to the Use and Custom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. These Villains, who owe so much to this Emperour, make but very little acknowledgment, and have shewed but small consideration to his descendants.</p>
            <p>I do not think it necessary to prove, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> presided in the Councils, no more than other Bishops; that it was the Emperours who called the Councils, that were to approve, and make them to be observed. There is no man but knows that our Kings have assembled many, and have presided in them, even when the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had a Deputy, or Legate present. We have a remarkable Example in the History of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Councils, <hi>which it were to be wished, that our great King would follow</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">Historia Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40127:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Council of <hi>Leptine,</hi> assembled in the Name of <hi>Carloman,</hi> Duke and Prince of the <hi>Francks,</hi> under <hi>Chilperie</hi> the third. First of all, you there see that it was <hi>Carloman</hi> who presided, though the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had his Deputy there present. See how he there speaks: <hi>In the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, I</hi> Carloman, <hi>Duke and Prince of the</hi> Francks, <hi>in the Year from the Incarnation</hi> 742, <hi>the Second of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of</hi> May, <hi>have assembled a Council, by the advice of the Servants of God, and the Lords of our Court, that is to say,</hi> Boniface, <hi>and</hi> Burchard, <hi>Bishops, with their Clergy, to advise concerning means whereby the Law of God, and the Ecclesiastical Religion, which is fallen to decay in these latter Ages, may be re-established, and how Christian People may attain to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Souls, and not be destroyed by the deceits of false Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a true <hi>Idea</hi> of the present State of the Church; but with this difference, that the disorder is now much greater; and would it would please God to touch the heart of some great Prince in our days, to do as <hi>Carloman</hi> did. Under the same King <hi>Chilperie, Pepin,</hi> who was yet only Duke of the <hi>Francks,</hi> called also another Council at <hi>Soissons,</hi> where he also presided: The Preface begins thus, <hi>I Pepin:</hi> And at the end it is said, <hi>Whosoever shall contradict these Decrees, Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by</hi> 23. <hi>Bishops, and other Servants of God, by and with the consent of Prince</hi> Pepin, <hi>and of the Lords of</hi> France, <hi>shall be judged either by the Prince, or by the Bishops:</hi> And the Council is signed, <hi>Pepin.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> is no more mentioned in all this, than the <hi>Mufti,</hi> though they were already arrived to a great height, because it was near two hundred years since they had been declared Heads of the Church by the Emperor <hi>Phocas.</hi> The first who took upon him this Quality, was one <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="â€–" place="margin">Platina.</note> relates. In the year 654, the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> bound the Pope <hi>Martin</hi> in Chains, and sent him away in Exile to <hi>Chersona,</hi> where he died. In the year 963, the Emperor <hi>Otbo</hi> deposed Pope <hi>John</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> In the the year 1007, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second deposed Three Popes, <hi>Benet</hi> the Ninth, <hi>Sylvester</hi> the Third, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Sixth.

            <p>Why is it not so now? It is because the Popes have by a thousand Cheats ruined the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and are become more mighty then they, as well by the desolation of the Empire, which they have rent in pieces, as by the Conquests which they have made in <hi>Italy,</hi> and by the Usurpations which they yet make upon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to the Emperor, in debauching part of his Subjects, who swear Fidelity and Obedience to them, even against the Emperor himself, and by holding in Captivity their Consciences, by means of the Monks, to make them do what they please in favour of the Pope; not to mention how they drain his Country, as well as others, trafficking with Princes and their Subjects, in almost the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is usual with some people of the <hi>Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ror <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berossa</hi> wrote in the year 1150. to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> which saith expresly, That the Popes being increased in Wealth and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by means of him and his Predecessors, apply themselves with all diligence to dethrone Kings and Princes, and cannot suffer an Equal: That they were busied both Night and Day, not so much to destroy him, as the Sacred Empire. After they had oppressed the Head of it, they affect not only Domination, but Divinity it self, and will not be feared and adored less than God: And that the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath no greater Enemies than they.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40127:31"/>But he who of all the Popes gave the most mortal blow to the Church, and to the Authority of Christian Princes, was <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, and that by three Devilish means: First of all by Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, which caused the ruin of the Western Empire; for since that time it hath been torn into many little States, and weak Principalities, which the Popes have play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with at their pleasure, as well in <hi>Germ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ny,</hi> as in <hi>Italy.</hi> Only our Country of <hi>France</hi> hath maintained it self against all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, without being divided, and hath still kept some small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Liberty, which they daily attempt to rob us of. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond device was to engage Princes, and great men, and those who were very rich, in the Croisadoes and Expeditions of the Holy Land, and to make them take the Cross; which besides the vast Treasures which the Popes got by it, augmented greatly their Authority; for from hence they invented Indulgences, from whence the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath drawn unspeakable Advantages as well in Riches, as in Authority. The third was by introducing neatly under the pretence of ignorance, and the weakness of Princes, the use of Cardinals of divers Nations, in the Election of the Pope; for by this these Nations are for the Spiritual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>me,</hi> as well as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, have lost the Right of Electing the Bishop. All these States have thought that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was greater than another Bishop, and that they had great Interest in his Election; and the Popes have gotten many Creatures in all these States. It is true, that at this time they are almost all <hi>Italians,</hi> because they have of late so well bridled all these Countries by the Infinite number of their Monks, and by many other Inventions that they now fear not their casting off the yoke.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth had been Deposed, and the Right of Investing Bishops taken from him, the Successors of this <hi>Gregory</hi> pretended that the Ecclesiasticks were exempt from all Jurisdiction and power of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ecular Princes, even in Civil Affairs. And besides that, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> could D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pose Kings, if they did not submit to all his Orders; and to fortifie this, came forth the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of many Popes, of which these people at last made so good use to compose their Bull <hi>de Caena Domini,</hi> and the Directory of the Inquisitors.</p>
            <p>But, say they, all this does not hinder the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> from being Head of the Church, for we see that the Laws and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40127:32"/>
Rules, and <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline, have been followed by the other Churches. It is true, that in the West, as there was no other Patriarchal See, and as in most places thee Christian Faith had been received by means of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As in <hi>France</hi> we always consult the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of Religion; not that for this reason the other Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities or Churches depend upon it. But it is false, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or the greatest part of them have received the Rules and Discipline of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Churches never owned them, nor any of those who are in <hi>Asia,</hi> or in <hi>Africa,</hi> as the <hi>Armenian,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> and others. And what we have already alledged from many of the Fathers and Councils, from the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> from the Churches of <hi>Ravenna, Milan</hi> and <hi>Toledo,</hi> who with so much difficulty received the <hi>Roman</hi> Office, even in the Eleventh Century, shews sufficiently that they had no dependance on the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> I could bring a thousand other proofs did I not fear being too tedious to the Reader. <note n="*" place="margin">Avent.

               <hi>Aventin</hi> relates that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sent one <hi>Winefred</hi> towards the Countries lying upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> to reform the Churches there, and to set them on the <hi>Roman</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; but that they vigorously opposed him and many Bishops, called him the Author of Lyes, and corrupter of the Christian Faith. <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Tom. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliorum.</note> In the first Tome of the Councils we have a Letter of <hi>Damasus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Hierome</hi> a Priest, where we find these words, which do sufficiently confute the pretences of our people: <hi>I intreat, Brother, thy charity to send us the Greek Psalter, with the Notes by which they sing them.</hi> These are the words, <hi>Peto charitatem tuam ut Graecorum Psallentiam ad nos dirigere tua Fraternitas delectetur. For,</hi> adds he, <hi>we are so simple that upon Festival days we do nothing but read a Chapter in the Epistles, or in the Gospel, and we have no custom of singing Psalms, nor is the Grace and Glory of Hymns to be found in our mouths.</hi> Observe these words, <hi>Charitas tua,</hi> and <hi>Fraternitas tua,</hi> from a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi> to a Priest, and how far they were from endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make other Churches subject to their Laws, since that on the contrary they did correct their own faults by the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others. <note n="â€–" place="margin">At the end of St. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Works.</note> We find also at the end of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Works, that about the year 593, he sent a Monk called <hi>Austin</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> who passing through <hi>France,</hi> was surprized to see there another manner of Divine Service than he had seen in <hi>Italy,</hi> with Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies quite different; that when he wrote to <hi>Gregory,</hi> he asked

him how it came to pass that since there was but one Faith, the customs of Churches were so different, and that the custom and manner of Masses was not the same at <hi>Rome</hi> as in <hi>France?</hi> To which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> answered, <hi>You know, Brother, what is the custom of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, wherein you have been educated.

But it is certain, that the other Bishops who teach the Doctrine of the Apostles, and imitate their example, are more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick than they.

            <p>I foresee that it will be said, that though this Authority of the Pope was not Instituted by Jesus Christ, that the Church for the first five Centuries knew it not, that it hath been since opposed from time to time by many people, perhaps of a turbulent or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented mind; yet it must be believed that the Church which did establish it since, did it for good Reasons; that Jesus Christ and his Apostles have not so precisely Regulated every thing that concerns the Discipline of the Church, but that she may according to her own Prudence alter some things according to the times and places; or as others say, that every time hath its customs; or as Cardinal <hi>Palavicini,</hi>

            <p>Although that, I say, were true, it would not be less necessary to abolish this power, which is the cause of so many disorders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church in those days might have created it for the good of the Church, as she then thought: And having found out that it is to her ruine, she ought to destroy it; for the Chair of <hi>Peter</hi> is for the Church, and not the Church for the Chair of <hi>Peter: Petri Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra propter Ecclesiam, non Ecclesia propter Petri Cathedram.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40127:36"/>
of Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> who says, That it is necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to submit to the Pope. And if the Church, according to these People, dared to change the Aristocratical Government, instituted by Jesus Christ, under which the Kingdom of God spread it self so far, Piety flourished, Idolatry was confounded; shall it not be allowable for the Church, and for Princes, who are its natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, to redeem it out of that Slavery into which the Enemy of Mankind hath reduced it, to its first Purity and Simplicity? Methinks if Men had any sense of Religion, they ought to sigh continually, for the deplorable condition of the Church, and of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and Protestants, whom we have cast headlong into the Evil they now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under.</p>
            <p>Some people will have it, That because the <hi>Greek</hi> Patriarchs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves hold that Place which the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> gave to all Patriarchs, he of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had the first Place, ought still to keep it; and as in Place he was the first Bishop, and the only Patriarch in the <hi>West,</hi> he ought still to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy these Prerogatives. But first of all, none of the <hi>Greek</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, unless it were that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> against whom St. <hi>Gregory</hi> wrote so vehemently, ever pretended to bear Rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the other Bishops, nor over the Church, much less over Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, as the Popes do; and the Patriarch of <hi>Rome</hi> for above Three Hundred Years after his Institution, never attempted it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Place which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> held, was <hi>Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Principalitatem Vrbis,</hi> in regard of the Dignity of the City, which now hath no weight at all, <hi>Rome</hi> being no longer the Seat of the Empire, but the Sink and Common-shore of all filthy Iniquity, a Den of Thieves, and a Nest of Satan, <hi>Nido di Satanazzo,</hi> and the very Habitation of Sloth, Laziness and Beggary. <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> do at this time deserve this Honour a thousand times better. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it was in a time when there were but very few Christians in the <hi>West</hi>; These great States were not yet converted to the Faith: <hi>France, Germany, Poland,</hi> part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the <hi>Northern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, knew not what Christianity was; so that one Patriarch might more easily have the inspection of this small number of Christians who resorted also to <hi>Rome</hi> for their civil Affairs, as to the capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where the Emperor resided. How are they now able to govern all the Churches, they who cannot govern that at <hi>Rome,</hi> and, which is worse, that trouble not their Heads about it? Add to this a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40127:36"/>
fourth Reason, which is, That in those days they were not Temporal Princes, as they are become since; and had not innumerable Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Monks and Beneficiaries at their command, as now they have, which renders this Power the most formidable of any upon Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Catholicks.</p>
            <p>If because <hi>Rome</hi> had heretofore the first Place for the Spirituality before other Cities, she should pretend still to have it, it will thence follow, that she hath it for the Temporality over these same Cities, since the Spiritual Authority of this City, as I have already proved, was founded upon the Temporal and Civil, which she enjoyed as the Seat of the Empire; and so in pretending to the Regency of Religion in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> and other Catholick Countries, they pretend also to have a Right of treating these States as they please; and they have effectually made them their Subjects and Tributaries, even to the disposing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> the Crowns of Kings, as their fancy leads them.</p>
            <p>There are others who believe they have hit on the right, when they say, that the Pope is <hi>Primus inter Pares,</hi> and that so he is the first of all Bishops. But I ask by what Authority? It is true, he was so among the Patriarchs, whilst that <hi>Rome,</hi> as I have said already, was the Seat of the Empire; but now I maintain, that he is <hi>Vltimus inter Pares,</hi> and unworthy of the Name of either Priest or Bishop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tyrant of the Church, and of Christian Princes, and a Temporal Prince himself. Were he not a Temporal Prince, all he could lawfully pretend to, would be to be the first Bishop of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it will be said, That I ask too much to obtain any thing; and I know that it will be neither better nor worse; but I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my mind, and tell the Truth. God Almighty may raise up Princes when he pleases, who may restore that happy Equality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Bishops, under which the Church was heretofore so flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and Christianity made so great Progress; which would also re-establish Peace among all Christians, much better than the Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Turkish</hi> Politicks, of which they say, <hi>Ittichat Khoga Kopatmas: Equality produceth no Wars:</hi> They mean, the Equality of <hi>Poverty</hi>; that is to say, that great men are not to be suffered in a Nation; and that being all miserable, they would make no commotions: Whereas the Equality which I speak of, would produce not only a firm and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Peace, but also the abundance of all Spiritual and Temporal Goods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:40127:37"/>There are also some People who pretended, that if we acknowledg a necessity of having Arch-bishops and Primates, who take their Places above Bishops instituted by Jesus Christ, tho the Dignity of Arch-bishops or Primates is not so; in like manner, for <hi>Orders</hi> sake we may have a Pope. That might pass, if the Popes did not pretend to be of another Order; if they exercised no Authority over their fellow-brethren; if they were not Temporal and Mighty Princes; if the Clergy did not absolutely depend upon them; if they had nothing but a Pre-eminence of Place over the other Bishops in Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and in Councils; if there were One of them in every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an State, who should solicite the Prince for the assembling of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synods every year, to whom he should be subject, as the other Bishops, and should entertain Communion with the other Patriarchs, or Catholick Popes, and with whom he should keep Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they might altogether, by the Consent of their Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Princes, cause General Councils to be assembled, when they should be necessary, which should be held sometimes in one State, and sometimes in another, and wherein should preside men of the greatest Understanding, and the greatest Merit, without exception of Persons; or else every Patriarch in his turn.</p>
            <p>Thus was the Church anciently governed without Tyranny; by this means did Religion spread it self abroad with great success in all Countries, and not by a pretended Bishop, who is a Worldly Prince, and hath ruined the Church. We see, that heretofore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Pagans,</hi> Kings have been Sacrificers and Ministers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> also, at the beginning, we find, that the Heads of Families, who were Soveraigns, did take upon them the offering of Sacrifices, and performed Divine Service; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these latter times, which is the Sink of all Ages, it was never seen, that Priests plaid the Princes, and that People who ought to employ themselves only in Prayers, and Sacrifices, and whom Jesus Christ, and all the most pure Canons of the Church, do forbid to meddle in Secular Affairs, should compare themselves with, and raise themselves above Kings.</p>
            <p>Is it not a comely sight to behold a Temporal Prince wearing Three Crowns one above the other, sitting in a throne covered with Gold and precious Stones, having the Arms both of Sea and Land, many Attendants following him, who are equal to other Princes: Such a Prince as this, I say, to be the Vicar of Jesus Christ! He is then a Carnal Messias, and such a one as the <hi>Jews</hi> do at this day
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40127:37"/>
look for: He is then a King of Concupiscence and of Iniquity. If it be so, the <hi>Jews</hi> had reason to accuse him for endeavouring to supplant <hi>Caesar</hi>; the <hi>Romans</hi> would have been in the right to put him to Death; and so he would not have been the Redeemer of Mankind.</p>
            <p>This Pretension of the Popes, as we see, is a horrible Blasphemy, and which yields the Cause over to the <hi>Jews</hi> against us, and tends to justifie every thing they did against our Lord Jesus, and utterly to overturn Christianity. The pretence also which they have, that Ecclesiasticks ought not to be subject to their Natural Prince, and are freed from Obedience to him by Jesus Christ; This is to renew against our great Saviour the impious Accusation which the <hi>Jews</hi> brought against him, That he would have made himself a King, and perswaded others to Rebellion.</p>
            <p>There are others who pretend that the evil is not so great that there is a Pope, as that General Councils are no more assembled; and so they say, that we should rather speak of assembling a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, than talk of exterminating the Papacy; because they think that a Council would limit the Pope, and hold the Reins shorter over him: But this Papacy subsisting, how shall a General Council be called, but that they'le have a hand in't? And if they have, what will this Council tend to? The End of it will be like that of <hi>Trent,</hi> sad and miserable. And put the case there might be found a Prince zealous, strong, and prudent enough to cause a General Council to be assembled by an agreement of other Christian Princes, in spight of the Pope; what would this Council do against the Pope, who would have all the Bishops for him, both by the Oath which they have taken to him, and by Twenty Millions of Revenue which he hath, and which he would employ to corrupt all the World? What would you do with the Monks, who would be all for him, it being their Interest to maintain the Authority and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Pope, because the Priviledges which he hath given to many of them, which are as ancient as their first Institution, are not confirmed by any Lawful Council, and so are null? And how long should the good condition of this Prince's Affairs last, or his good Correspondence with other Princes, to make the Laws of this Council be obeyed; and that the Pope, who will be all, or nothing, shall not hinder the Execution of his Decrees, and continue his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny? And how will you in the mean time keep the Papacy with its hands tied, and what will this signifie? It is certainly better to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40127:38"/>
cast off the Yoke all at once, than to let it continue without being sure that it shall do no more mischief. <hi>Tutius est perire non posse quam juxta periculum non periisse,</hi> says a certain Author.</p>
            <p>We have the sad Example of the Councils of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Constance</hi>; from that of <hi>Trent</hi> we could not hope for any great matters; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that of <hi>Constance,</hi> which seemed well inclined to a Reformation, as well as that of <hi>Basil,</hi> found such horrible resistance in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and among the Ecclesiasticks, that it never could re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the ancient Discipline. And that shews us, that we must wholly eradicate this Papacy, and that it is not enough to assemble a free Oecumenical Council, but that it must be some powerful, zealous, and resolute Prince, who fears nothing but God, and not the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who must begin, continue, and vigorously end the thing, without hearkening to pretended moderate Councils, which tend only to the Churches ruin. The Proverb here signifies nothing, That it is better to preserve the Commonwealth as it is, than to have none at all: For I maintain that here is no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but a perfect Anarchy; and that the Church, instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governed, is devoured by a Faction of Villains, who eat the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God like bread.</p>
            <p>But say they, you speak of abolishing the Primacy in the Church; and nevertheless there is no Society, no Families, no Colledge but hath it: Without it these Societies cannot subsist. It is not so much the Primacy which I condemn, as the Tyranny which hath been joined to it. The Primacy of Place might yet be suffered, although Jesus Christ hath not instituted it in the Church; but that of <hi>Pope,</hi> is a Primacy of Jurisdiction, to which the Universal Church, and the whole World is subject, as they pretend. I condemn the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of a Bishop who is a Worldly Prince, who hath more than Twenty Millions of Rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I wish nothing more, than to see re-established in the Church that Primacy which Jesus Christ hath there instituted; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that of Councils, and that they should be often assembled, as they were in the Primitive Church; for it is the want of these Councils which hath undone the Church. We see in the Preface of the Eleventh Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> that the Fathers say, That having wanted the Light of Councils for the space of Ten Years, the whole World went astray, and the Church fell into disorder and confusion. How
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40127:38"/>
much more reason have we now to complain of that, we who for above these Hundred Years have seen none, and which is more, can never hope to see a Lawful one, whilst the Papacy shall subsist? <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracta Luce Conciliorum integro decennie, Matrem Omnium Errorum igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiam, otiosas Mentes occupasse, adeo ut Babylonicae Confusionis olla suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censa purpuratae Meretricis incrementa Sacerdotes sequerentur, quia Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stici Convenius non aderat Disciplina, nec erat qui Errantium Corrigeret partes, cum Sermo Divinus haberetur Extorris.</hi>

            <p>Is not this the cause of so many Superstitions, of so many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Schisms, and Licentiousness, which we see in the Clergy? Is it not a ridiculous thing, that no more Councils shall be called, whilst we see the Monks, both <hi>Capucins, Carthusians</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> often assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Congregations for the augmentation of their Societies? It is no wonder if the Church daily runs to ruin, whilst these Societies fortifie themselves. Is it not clear as the day, that if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synods were called every year, National every three or four years, as heretofore they were under our great Kings; and Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Councils, at least, once in Ten years, that Remedies would be found out for the Calamities of the Church? Might not a Patriarch in every State, aided by the Secular Power, excute the Decrees of the Church with more facility, less jealousie, and more security for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and for the State, than a forreign Ambitious, and potent Prince, who resolves to take no care for Religion, but to model eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to his own Interest? If this Patriarch should neglect his Duty, or carry it like a Master, should not the Prince chastise him, nor depose him? Experience shews us, that the Church never flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished but when she was Aristocratically governed, and when there was no other Primacy in the Universal Church than that of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and all Primates and Patriarchs were subject to them: But since the Patriarch of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had the sole disposing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the <hi>West,</hi> we have seen nothing but Confusion, Anarchy, Schism, Heresies, Impiety, Atheism, Cruelty and Barbarity. <hi>Ipsa Ecclesia Vnus est Princeps, &amp; Vnitati fidelium, non singulis haec Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio a Domino conceditur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Quia Vnitas Ecclesiae multo major est at<expan>

            <p>Thus did the Holy Council of <hi>Basil</hi> answer the false Reasons of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> his Orators, who pretended, That the Unity of the Church was preserved much better by a Pope than by the Council.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:40127:39"/>There are others who would have the Pope's Authority confin'd within the bounds which the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and of <hi>Basil</hi> had marked out for it; but they never understood the Moral Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that there is, not only of making the Popes consent to it; but suppose they were constrained to consent to these Rules for a season, to make them observe them always, or for any long time. And Experience confirms what I say, with reference even to these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils which have put no stop at all to their career; for they live in contempt as well of these as of all other Lawful Councils. Have not they called others in <hi>Italy,</hi> who have destroyed whatever these had established, even to treat with the Name of Heresie this Holy Doctrine of the Superiority of the Council? Have not the Popes been sufficiently Sacrilegious to raze out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition of General Councils, the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> from among the Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councils? It is then impossible, that with the Impiety and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition wherewith the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is wholly made up, and with the enormous power which the Popes at this time have, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals that of the greatest Kings, that they should be reduced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to the Council of <hi>Constance.</hi> And even that would signifie nothing; for this Council gives them too much Authority; It gives them the power which belongs to the Emperors, of assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling General Councils, of presiding in them, and concluding, and of executing the Canons of Councils, in regard of particular Churches, and even of making Decrees, during the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Synods, and of being judged only by a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
            <p>They ought then to be deprived of this temporal power, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals to be abolished, and the Monks to be Enfranchised, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased from the rash Vows they have made to the Popes; the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the Palls of Archbishops ought to be taken from him, and the faculty of Investing Bishops, and of dispencing with them for holding so many Benefices; with all the other Simonical Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick which will still renders him the Tyrant of the Church, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all States, and the Devil the possessor of many souls. It is much more easie to restore all at once the ancient Discipline. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Paradox, but my reason is, that there will never be a good change, but it must happen after some strangely surprizing, or if I may so say, some violent manner, such violence as forces its way into the Kingdom of Heaven. Whilest we stand upon treating, the Popes shall maintain themselves always with the times, either by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40127:39"/>
Intriegues, or by some Devilish inventions, the most zealous shall grow cold upon the business, Ministers shall be corrupted either by money, or by Cardinals Caps, the Prince shall have other affairs found him to look after, or shall be killed by the hand of some Monk or other: All the Jesuits and the Monks shall be everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for the Papacy, whatever shew they at this time make. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> somewhere says that there will never be a Reformation if some zealous and resolute Pope doth not procure it by assembling a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council. For my part, I say, that if God doth not inspire some great Prince to do it, I say that a Reformation will come as soon by means of the Devil as the Pope. First of all, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> professeth an abhorrence of calling General Councils. <hi>Concilio sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aborrito da Pontefici,</hi> says <hi>Palavicini:</hi> Besides that, they have estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished this fundamental Maxim, That the Pope cannot divest himself of the least tittle of his Authority, no not for the salvation of the whole world; for the Pope, say they, is not the Master but only the Guardian of this Authority. Nay, they go so far as to maintain that the Church would commit Simony should she desire to divest the Pope of this Authority, or of his profits, for the Salvation of Souls. <hi>Primato Apostolico, di cui non era Signiore, ma custode,</hi> says Cardinal <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavicini,</hi> that he is not the Lord or Patron, but only the Guardian of the Apostolick Primacy. And in another place he says these words: <hi>Non Essendo egli arbitro e padrone della sua Maggoranza consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta da Christo, e pero non potendo farle alcun prejudicio.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Palav. lib. 3. cap. 12.</note> He can do no wrong to his Authority constituted by Jesus Christ, because he is not the Patron and disposer of it. And again, <hi>Far una specie di Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia vendendo al Papa la recuperatione dell' anime a prezzo d' entrate e di giuridizzioni ritolte della chieza.</hi> It would be a kind of Simony to sell the Redemption of Souls to the Pope at the price either of Estates, or Jurisdictions taken from the Church. If a Pope would really Reform the Church, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would murther him. But as <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Blois</hi> says, this is the Chair of Pestilence, wherein peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the greatest merit are presently corrupted. They no sooner ascend this proud Throne, but straightways they forget they are men, and are by a just judgment of God struck with stupidity. We have the example of one <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> who in the Council of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> was so zealous for the truth, and maintained so well the Interest of the Church against the Popes Tyranny; and nevertheless so soon as he was Elected Pope, he maintained that the Council was inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the Pope, and Excommunicated those who believed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

This Angel was no sooner raised to this mighty grandeur, but like <hi>Lucifer</hi> he became a Devil. <hi>Aristotle</hi> says in one place, that it sometimes falls out that a man loseth the habit of vertue by one only act of enormous wickedness; that there are men <hi>qui uno actu feritatis humanitatem exuunt,</hi> who lay aside all humanity all at once by one act of barbarousness and inhumanity. This befalls the Popes so soon as they are elected; they were sometime honest men before, but the Miter being fixed upon their head, they make themselves he adored by this Sirname of Most Holy, <hi>Collo pronome di sanctissimo,</hi> says Cardinal <hi>Palavicini</hi>; they are no more men, <hi>but the voice of God and not of men,</hi> as was said of <hi>Herod. Sixtus Quintus,</hi> who had been a Keeper of Swine, when he became Pope, Excommunicated King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth (of <hi>France.</hi>) This it was that made <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> the Second say, that he believed not that a <hi>Pope could be saved</hi>; and <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> that <hi>when he was a Monk he had pretty good hopes of his Salvation; that being a Cardinal he began much to fear it; but when he was Pope he absolutely despaired of it.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks of a certain young Consul at <hi>Rome</hi> who said, <hi>Facite me Vrbis Romanae Episcopum &amp; ero protinus Christianus, Make me Bishop of Rome, and I will be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian presently.</hi> We may say the contrary of those who for this long time have been made Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> That as soon as they have been so, they have ceased being Christians. The reason of that is not only this Tyranny which they exercise in the Church, and over the world in contempt of Jesus Christ, and of his Gospel, but also this Temporal greatness to which they are raised all at once, which turns their brain. We scarce see a man of a thousand <hi>Livres</hi> a year, whose reason is not blinded by his Estate, and he shall be puffed up with pride, even tho he were born to it; and we see but few rich men who are not insupportable either for their vanity, or for their vices; but few Princes who have any Religion, and in whom power hath not corrupted and defaced all the Idea's of Vertue and of Vice. How then shall a poor fellow behave himself, who is raised all at a clap to so high a Dignity that Emperors kiss his Slippers; and who so soon as he is chosen, is adored like God, even upon the Altars? This it is that brings down the curse of God upon all the Popes; and to speak of a good Pope, is like talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a good Devil. Observe this present Pope, who is a man the best inclined that we have had a long time; to what excess of pride is he arrived against our [<hi>French</hi>] King, whom he hath threatned to Excommunicate; tho St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> whose Disciple they say he is,

            <p>I knew a Prince in <hi>Germany,</hi> who was one of the most Catholick Princes in the world, who had abjured Heresie, and was really converted, having not done it for any carnal advantage, like many base people, who we see infect instead of edifying the Church. This most Catholick Prince abhorred the Papacy, and could not endure the Books of our Writers, when there was any thing in them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Popes Authority. Those who were a little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the late Duke of <hi>Hanouer,</hi> know whether I speak truth or no. We know that <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, by the advice of the Divines of the Faculty at <hi>Paris,</hi> made no difficulty of withdrawing himself and all his Subjects from the Communion of the Pope, which last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the Pontificat of <hi>John</hi> the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Benedict</hi> the 13<hi>th.</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> and even to give encouragement to all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to do as he had done; and he had much less cause to do it than we have at this time. You see his reasons in the Letters of the University of <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>Theodore a Nyem,</hi> which were, that they would not consent that the disorders of the Church should be regulated by a free Council, and that they would not submit themselves to the Decisions of the Church. Are not we now again just in the same condition since the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and of <hi>Basil?</hi> For those which have been Assembled since, deserve not the name of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, because there was no liberty in them, and every thing was there done by the Inspiration, not of God, but the Popes. <hi>France</hi> did but half free it self from this yoke, for quickly after we suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our selves to be drawn in, and have been like to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done many a time since by it,</p>

If this Unity be for doing what is evil, it is then but a conspiracy; and I do confess that in regard of wicked Clergy-men, who are the members of the Pope, he is the source of all their Impiety, Ambition, and Dissoluteness, and he is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Unity of these people, who belong all to him; and as for

If there be a Unity, how comes it to pass that it is said, and that with reason too, that the Pope hath a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent soul in every State where he governs? If there were a Unity, there would be but one Soul; they must have greater abilities than either St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who could not unite mens minds in the Churches of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and of <hi>Galatia,</hi> where we learn by the Gospel that many Errors were taught in these Apostles times.

Is it not a matter of great consolation for honest men to see in this Seat, Children, Magicians, Atheists, Adulterers, and Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, as History affirmeth, and not ten or twelve only in all, but fifty one after another? <hi>Baronius</hi> himself doth not deny it, if the Church had had such Heads as these, she would have been long since abolished upon Earth.

               </note> Besides these Subjects of Complaint, which are of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there is yet another, which cries more loud to God for Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is, That the Papacy is an Obstacle unto the Piety of those Christians who are subject to its Yoke. We are not of our own Nature virtuous; but on the contrary, we are born in sin, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40127:44"/>
without the particular Grace of God there is in us always a strong Disposition to do evil. If then men are not furnished with means to resist these ill Inclinations, it is evident, that they will let themselves be carried away by them: But if instead of furnishing them with these means, they have greater occasion given them to do evil, there is no doubt but we shall be so far from inspiring them with the love of Virtue, that we shall engage them in sin. Now the Papacy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the state wherein it now is, and for many Ages hath been, hath such ill qualities, that it takes away from Christians the Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of doing good, and offereth them others of doing evil. It is one of the Properties of our Mind to be led very much by Example, especially by those who make a figure in the World, and have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over others. Thus the behaviour of the Monks, and of the Priests, savouring scarce of any thing but Covetousness and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Natural Dispositions which we have to these Vices are by this means strengthned. I acknowledg, that Preachers do instruct the people, That to make themselves acceptable unto God, and to have a share in the Kingdom of Heaven, they must refrain from these evil Passions; and they build this Obligation upon the Precepts of the Gospel: but men acting exceedingly more by the hope and fear of present good or evil, than of that which is future, the efficacy of all the loveliness of a God, who gave this Precept, of the hope of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and fear of Hell, becomes extreamly weakened in them, by the ill Example of those who by their Habit and Condition, seem, and ought to make profession of a Life more pure and disengaged from the Interests of this World. For altho they embrace not formally this Opinion, That there is neither God, nor Heaven, nor Hell; and that on the contrary, they hold these Doctrines to be very true; yet nevertheless this ill Example makes them act as if they did wholly reject them; this damnable Example having so mortal a poison in it, that it makes them believe, that their Teachers, being able men, would themselves live conformable to these Instructions, if they thought them Divine; and they themselves leading not this life, 'tis probable that they do not believe what they preach and teach. The Scripture also in many places highly enveigheth against Pastors of an ill Life, the disorder of their manners being a stumbling-block to those whom they have the care of. But tho the Irregularities of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors did not make so ill an impression upon the minds of the people, whilst persons who desire to be saved, and are humbled when they perceive within themselves a repugnancy to follow those ways
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40127:45"/>
which the Gospel hath marked out, hear speak of able men, and of almost whole Orders, whom, for instance, the Gospel enjoyns to be charitable, know that no more is employed that way than what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to him who spares no cost to appear Great, and to keep up his Port, according to the Custom of the World, and other such like Interpretations of all the Precepts of Jesus Christ, do not they find themselves inclined to embrace these Explications, thereby satisfying their desires, and thinking to quiet their Consciences? Those who favour the Papacy shall tell you, That the Pope is so far from order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such pernicious Maxims to be taught, that he doth abhor them, and wish with all his heart, that they would teach and promote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ones.</p>
            <p>Besides, that many Popes have themselves entertained ill Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will grant it for the present; but the Pope, who pretendeth to be the only Head of the Church, and that it belongs to him alone to judge absolutely of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>clesiastical things and persons, not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them; nay, oftentimes shutting the mouths of those who would oppose them, who sow, and spread abroad such dangerous Maxims, doth uphold these pernicious Opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ons; which we have the greater reason to believe, because he withdraws the Monks, and many of the Clergy, from the Jurisdiction of the Bishops. If it be said, That he cannot silence them, by reason of their too great Authority; it is then manifest, that the Papacy, such as it is, doth suffer the ill Example, and these pernicious Opinions, and is not able to hinder them, unless it be in matters of very small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. And thus far it is an Obstacle unto Piety, since no body can apply a Remedy, whilst the Pope shall be acknowledged the Head and Master of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Second Argument, which sheweth, That the Papacy is an Obstacle unto true Virtue, is, that it makes use of such practices as promote a false, and only seeming, instead of true Piety. Some Catholicks do teach, That Contrition is necessary to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession valid. But this Doctrine is not much followed; That which hath the Vogue, and reigns most in the World, is, that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is sufficient, which is only a simple Sorrow for having sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that too occasioned but by the fear of Hell. The people who are instructed in this Opinion, believe readily, that it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter to be justified before God; and so think, that after having sinned a great while, they shall at their Death receive Absolution of their sins, by saying a <hi>Peccavi:</hi> For what man is there who is not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40127:45"/>
afraid of being Damned? The great multitude of Plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and others, which are as common as Water, doth also mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously contribute to the casting men into Impenitence, and to make them at the same time believe, that their Consciences are in safety, under pretence of observing those Exercises which pass for Pious, tho they are not so.</p>
            <p>I could produce many other Reasons, to demonstrate the Truth of what I say; but let these suffice.</p>
            <p>The Pope, pretending to be the only Soveraign Judge of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not silencing these false and pernicious Teachers; nay, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to do it, if he would; Is not then the Papacy an Obstacle unto true Piety, since it introduces a false one in its place? There are good people among the Catholicks, I confess; but the Papacy contributes nothing to that. On the contrary, those who believe, and live well, it is God, and not the Pope, who is the Author of their Piety, as well as of their Profession, which is rather destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than maintained by the usual Pride and Impiety of the Popes; from whence it comes, that no man now a days believes but what he will; so that the whole World is full of <hi>Deists, Socinians, Libertines,</hi> and impious persons.</p>

Yet I deny that; For what does it contribute to this outward Unity? But besides that, it serves only to cheat the World, whilst there is no inward Unity. If they mean the Unity in Ceremonies, First of all, this would be no great matter; for Ceremonies make not the Essence of Religion, but are only the out-side of it; and besides, they are very different, according to the several Countries; and the Popes are not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them: If they were, it were enough to condemn them. Besides all this, there are fewer Sects and Factions, less Divisions, and by consequence, more Unity among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have many Patriarchs, than among us.

But if it be their Conversion which they do heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, why do not they renounce the Authority which they have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40127:46"/>
in the Church and in the World? Why do not they re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish things in a Christian manner, in the same State they were in, in the days of the Apostles, and of the Primitive Church? Why do not they condemn the Blasphemies which are spoken in favour of their Government, and destroy the Maxims by which they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged themselves so long? They answer, That then their lives would be in danger, and that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would destroy them, as they did <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth, who thought to have reformed the Church; of whom <note n="â€–" place="margin">Palav. l. 2. cap. 3. &amp; 7.</note> Cardinal <hi>Palavicini</hi> gives this Account, That he was <hi>Ottimo Ecclesiastico, Pontefice Mediocre,</hi> a Good Priest, but an Indifferent Pope.</p>
            <p>But if the Popes cannot find a Remedy for the Disorders which are so prevalent, because, as they say, their Authority is not sufficient, what are they then good for, and why shall we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer suffer this Tyranny in the Church? If they can find a Remedy, and will not, they are then not only unprofitable, but detestable Creatures. It is certainly one or other, or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for we see, that every thing is overturned in the Church. And what? If they are the Vicars of Jesus Christ, and Successors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ought they not to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves happy, to die for the Glory of God, and Good of the Church? Is it better to be the Object of Mens Worship, to provoke the Jealousie of God, and to do so much mischief in the Church? Where is the Zeal of <hi>Moses,</hi> or of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who would have died for their Brethren, and have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven accursed; and of the first Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who suffered Martyrdom so Couragiously? They love rather to give them Money, and Benefices, because that thus they put out all to great Usury; they sow that they may reap; they give what is none of their own, or else what signifies nothing to them. If it be true, that they are careful of the Salvation of these People, why are they not so of their own? Why do they not labour for the Salvation of Catholicks? That would cost them no Money: There needs nothing but to allow the Reading of the Holy Scripture every where, and recommend it, as God hath recommended it to us; to suffer Divine Service to be read in a Language which every body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands; For it cannot be denied, but that the want of these things doth produce among us great Ignorance, with which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40127:46"/>
Piety is never to be found: But to give Money to convert People, it is the mark of a very prophane Spirit, and a very dishonest method, and an Example for <hi>Mahometans</hi> and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to make use of, even towards Christians. And to give Benefices, it is yet worse; for by this the Clergy is filled up more and more with Hypocrites, and People of no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who spend the Goods of the Poor upon Debauchery and Luxury, and most commonly are of no use at all to the Church.</p>
            <p>They say, That they make Religion to be respected: But how? Is it by their own Piety, or Sanctity, or that of their Court, or by their Humility? No truly, these Vertues are wholly there <note n="â€ " place="margin">

               </note> unknown, and the contrary Vices have ruled the Rost long since; but their fine Court, and the Greatness and Magnificence of the Cardinals, are the things we hear of. But are these the things that ought to make men love Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it Gold and Silver, costly Furniture, Riches, Carnal Pleasures, which the Prelates glut themselves withal? Is it their <hi>Cavalcades</hi> to <hi>Montecavallo,</hi> their Horse and Foot-Guards, their Armies and their Fleets, which make Religion to be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? If it be so, both Jesus Christ, and his Apostles, deserved to be despised, in comparison of their Vicars; and the Christian Religion also was very contemptible in their days. Is it to Excommunicate all the World when they please, without Authority, without Cause, and against the Nature of the Gospel, which is Charity it self? But wise men are so far from respecting them for this, that they look upon them as Fools. Is it to hold a Chappel, or Consistory, where they treat only of prophane things, and of promoting of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals? What doth this signifie, or what Relation hath it to the Glory of God, or the Salvation of Men? And what is there in all this, which the Patriarch of <hi>Venice,</hi> or the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> might not do as well as the Pope, if he had a mind to it? We must not dissemble. All the Respect which men have for the Papacy, at least, they who hope for no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it, comes only from the Respect, or from the Fear which they see Princes have of it. And this respect of Princes, if it be voluntary, proceedeth from great Ignorance of Religion, in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40127:47"/>
which they have been brought up for that purpose, or from the ill Council of some Ambitious Clergy-man, who compasses his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs at the Prince's Expence. If this Respect be forced, as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily it is, it is then out of the fear which men have of the Popes Power; whereby he rules the vast Numbers of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, and especially the Monks, who govern the meaner People; who, as <hi>Palavicini</hi> says, are the disposers of the Religion of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>It is said, That they have the Power of making the Laws of God to be observed. If so, they ought themselves to give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; they ought to apply to themselves what our Saviour said to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> not to draw his Sword. It is a thing both ridiculous and horrible, that these People should have Armies, and make War. They do it in <hi>Germany,</hi> after the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; But where is it that they make the Laws of God to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Is there any place where they are violated more than where they have most Authority? Is <hi>Rome</hi> at this day better than <hi>Sodom?</hi> Do not they on the contrary, favour, as much as in them lies, the very Crime, by the Example of their Court, by their Expences, by their pretending to exempt all Clergy-men from the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Civil Magistrate; that so they may commit all sorts of Crimes, and go unpunished? But they say furthermore, That they make <hi>Kings stand in Awe,</hi> and hinder them from professing, <hi>Heresie.</hi> On the contrary, it is they who made them become Hereticks, as in <hi>England, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and who by their Tyranny, hinder them from returning into the bosom of the Church.</p>
            <p>It is also pretended, That they are very useful for the composing of Differences between Princes, being looked upon as common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to them all.

               </note> The Advocates for the Papacy do alledg also, that 'tis a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that the Popes draw Revenues out of Catholick Countries, because they make a good use of them, and with this Mony they assist the Catholick Princes against the Turk, and employ it to many other good uses. For Example, They say, that the present Pope hath this Year given a great deal of Corn to the poor People at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Portions to marry off several poor young Maids. But what doth this signify, to prove that the Popes are universal Vicars of Jesus Christ upon Earth, and Heads of the Catholick Church? I do not say, that to be Pope, a Man must lay aside all Humanity, and become a Devil; that Opinion suits only with those who believe the Pope to be Antichrist. <note n="â€ " place="margin">Cicero <hi>l.</hi> 2. de Officiis.</note>

It is like those who commend the great Vertue of a Woman that does not prostitute her self to all the World, you would say that she might be dishonest for all that, and that for this there is no such great Commendation due to her: just so do People magnify the Pope, because they say he will give five hundred thousand <hi>Livers</hi> a Year to defend <hi>Poland</hi> against the Turks. But first of all, there is his own Interest in the case; for the Popes look upon themselves as chief Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> as well as of other Catholick Kingdoms, and they think they lose so much Land and so many Subjects as the Turks gain from the Catholicks; but what is such a Sum as this to a Priest whose Revenue amounts to twenty Millions; how doth he employ the rest of the Churches Blood? I dare be bold to say he doth every Year plunder <hi>Poland</hi> of more than this Sum. But now in a time that People begin a little to know the Papacy, we must not wonder they endeavour by some

good AAions to keep it from Contempt. As for the Corn which they give at <hi>Rome</hi> to the Poor, what a great matter that is? It is but just, that since the Papacy hath made them idle and lazy, it should maintain them. Was there ever yet a Tyrant who did not do some good? I do not inveigh against the Person of the present Pope, who, of all the Popes that have been in Possession of this See since <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, is certainly one of the least wicked. It is the Papacy only which I oppose, that extravagant Authority which they make Men to adore, that never yet did any thing but Mischief; and I make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction quite contrary to that which ignorant People make of it, who say, that the Popes as Men, may be wicked, but not as Popes; for I maintain that as Popes, since <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done any thing but ill; but as Men, they may sometimes do Actions that are morally good. If the Popes did their Duty as true Bishops, if they preached the word of God, if they instructed their Diocess in the knowledg of God, if they applied themselves to their Prayers, without being ambitious, without desiring Command and Authority, and playing the Princes at <hi>Rome,</hi> without abusing the World with their Dispensations, Induglences, false Reliques<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

If they contribute any thing towards them, it must be, as in all other things, for their own Interest. But there were Missions to the <hi>Indies</hi> before ever the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> undertook to govern the Church: those who are now sent thither go only for Gain and Traffick; and by the Relations we have of them, they are the strangest Conversions in the World; they take no care at all to instruct these poor People, nor to teach them any thing, they baptize them only, without explaining to them the Virtue of that Sacrament, or what it signifies; nay without turning them from their former Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.

They are contented instead of instructing them, to tell them that in worshipping their Idols, and doing all as they did before, it is sufficient if they direct the Intention to Jesus Christ, or to the Saints, and so they are no less Idolaters than they were before.

This is all but Farce. My Lord the new Bishop makes wry Faces, as if he were going to his pretended Diocess, where the People shall be Greeks, Pagans, or Mahometans, he prepares his Equipage to be gone, and whilst he is just ready to depart, his Holiness hath a tender Affection for his dear Son, commends his Zeal and his Piety, to go to hazard himself among the Infidels, dispences with him as to his Journey, and for a recompence of his Devotion, he gives him good Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Benefices, wherewith the good Prelate lives jollily at <hi>Rome</hi> in Pleasures and in Honours.

But there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for these never did usurp the Temporal Power of Princes like the Popes; they never exacted Oathes of Allegiance from their Clergy, nor pretended to a share of the Princes Authority, as the Popes do in Catholick Countries. The Ambition of the Popes will ever keep them back more than this Conformity will induce them to embrace Christianity. But Men must not form to themselves such car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ideas of the Religion of Jesus Christ, who is all Spirit, Truth, and Holiness; it is a sort of Idolatry to believe that Jesus Christ hath such

Vicars. It is to be wholly ignorant of God, and to make Jesus Christ the Minister of Sin.</p>
            <p>It may be yet said, that the Popes keep Princes and great Men in the Catholick Religion by the conveniency of <hi>Dispensations,</hi> which they many times gives them very opportunely, and such as they could not find in other Religions; <note n="*" place="margin">Palavicin<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

But these Dispensations are either against the Law of God, or they are not: If they are, then Princes are so much the more to be blamed to address themselves to the Pope; for this is manifestly to mock both God and Men. I know very well, as I have already observed, that there are some good People who maintain, that the Popes can make that a Sin which is not a Sin, and that not a Sin which is a Sin; but I do not think that any Prince was ever so simple as to believe so; thus the Action of a Prince who hath recourse to the Popes for Dispensations authorizeth this abominable Impiety, and by his Example, makes it pass for an Article of Faith, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the shameful Instrument to establish the most pernicious and the most infamous of all Impostures. If the thing be not contrary to the Law of God, there is no need of a Dispensation for any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. And furthermore, be they necessary or unnecessary, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Bishop hath as much right to grant them as the Pope, nay more, since that, as I have already said, the Popes being Temporal Princes can not be in the Christian Religion either Bishops or Priests; they have forfeited this Character, and have no calling under God, since God hath not instituted this monstrous Authority. Besides, these Dispensations are only for the Popes advantage; for by them he raiseth and maintains himself in Credit, not only other above Bishops his fellow Brethren, but even above God himself, abrogating his Laws, and fastning Princes with his whole Families indispensably more and more to their Service, it being their Interest to maintain this pretended Authority of the Pope, without which, their Actions would appear shameful and scandalous; and as many times it is for their Marriages which they are dispensed with, their Children would be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legimate, which would confound the order of the Succession. Thus does every thing turn to the Popes advantage, who are always of his opinion, who said in <hi>Epictetus</hi>

I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for my part, that People please themselves with fancying that God is like the Popes, and that they may come off easily with him in their Affairs. That which is as bad too as all the rest is, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably other Ecclesiasticks, at least many of them, do attribute to themselves some part of this Authority of the Popes, of dispencing against the Law of God, and that after the Popes Example, who have infected all the others. <note n="*" place="margin">Horace.</note>

of them, they raise their Almighty Power above Heaven it self. In the first they raise themselves above God, by dispencing with the Obedience to his Law, and by the other, they make that a Sin which is not so in its own nature, which belongs only to God; and so they put themselves in his place.

At length having thundred out a great many other Excommunications, they declare, that whosoever shall remain a whole Year in these sorts of Excommunications, shall for their Contumacy be declared Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Chap. <hi>Cum Contumacia de Hereticis in</hi> 6. and it is a favour too that they do not turn them into Hobgoblins. There is nothing in all this but what is sottish, horrible, and diabolical, yet there are People who at this day dare not publickly detest it. Nay, there are several in <hi>France,</hi> who shall maintain it at their utmost peril, and even die for it, as almost all the Monks and many others who for the sake of Jesus Christ himself would not lose this Point. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto this Tribunal of the Inquisition hath been abhorred in <hi>France,</hi> but no thanks to the Monks, but the Parliaments; they say, <hi>Ecclesia mavult suffundere sanguinem quam effundere.</hi> And during the Minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth all the Chairs of the Doctors and Preachers rung with this impious and abominable Doctrine, that the Pope was the Monarch of the Church could excommunicate, depose and put Kings to death. And to the end that these Holy Laws should be put in Execution, these infamous Creatures have wrote a Book, which they call the <hi>Directory</hi> of the Inquisitors in the the Year 1585. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they establish, that they are all impious Persons, and Enemies to the Church, who do not allow of the <hi>Extravagants</hi> of <hi>Boniface,</hi> and all the Decretals of the Popes who declare, that the Church hath the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40127:53"/>
Power of both Swords to destroy all those who will not submit to it. In the third part of this Directory, Commentary the thirteenth; there are three methods of proceeding against Hereticks, <hi>viz.</hi> by Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Delation, and by Inquisition. In Matters of Faith, Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not allowed of, because they say that it is very dangerous, and full of Contention; the Crime of Heresy must be proved Judicially, and Canonically, which cannot be done without some difficulty; so that the Treasurer of the Inquisition becomes the Accuser, for this reason, <hi>quia non est obnoxius poenae talionis,</hi> because he is not obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Punishment of Retaliation, <hi>neque aliis poenis quas falsi Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusatores pati solent,</hi> nor to any other Punishments which false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are wont to suffer. So that there is no other way but by Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inquisition; and let a Man but apply himself to the Syndic of the Inquisition, or to the Inquisitor to accuse any body and there's an end of him. In this third part of the Directory, Commentary the 28<hi>th,</hi> towards the latter end there are these words; <hi>In crimine Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reseos propter ejus Enormitatem omnia testimonia recipiuntur, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um<expan>

I do maintain that the Popes have ruined the Church in those Countries where their Inquisition hath been set up, more than all the Heresies in the World together ever could have done. We need not but consider the good Effects which it hath had in those Countries, where in truth there is no Religion, at least Christianity scarce there to be found; and how should it with that Ignorance which the Inquisition brings along with it, which hath produced nothing but Superstition, Impiety, Hypocrisy, dissembling of Opinions, a thousand Cruelties and Treacheries, and all sorts of abominable Vices, which are scarce known but in Countries of the

Compare the <hi>French</hi> Nation, <hi>Germany, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> with the other, Slaves to the Inquisition, and you will say that the latter are not worthy of the Name of Christians in comparison of the former. And for the Hereticks, I esteem and Heretick that is an honest Man, and that fears God, a hundred times more than a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick who lives disorderly, or that knows not what Religion is. I know no worse Heresy than to be without the knowledg of God; and how can He be known where the Holy Scripture is not allowed to be read, where the Clergy are wholly lost in most abominable Vices, and know nothing at all? where it is Crime enough to be burnt, to discourse about Religion? where Mens Minds are filled with a thousand Fooleries that have no relation at all to Piety? Set a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or an <hi>Italian,</hi> who hath gotten a little Sense, to discourse on Jesus Christ, and he shall not fail to tell you, that Jesus Christ was a great Politician; <hi>Christo era Grande Politico,</hi> because he sees that his Vicar under the pretence of Religion hath made so great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and subdued all Catholick Princes to himself. This is the Idea which they have of Jesus Christ, and which they form to themselves upon what they see in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the present State of the Church; for, as for the Holy Scripture they know less of it than of the Alcoran. And their Divines teach them, that the Church is the most happy Body Politick upon Earth, <hi>Corpo.

Nor do the <hi>Portuguees</hi> understand things better; they are more than half Jews, and yet know not what either Judaism or Christianity is. There are a great many of them who look for a sort of a Messias, who by his great Conquests ought to make them Masters of the World; this is one of their Kings named <hi>Sebastian,</hi> whom they have made a Saint, he was killed in the Battel of <hi>Alcazar</hi> going to assist one Moorish King against another, and because his Body was not found after the Battel, they pretend that he is not dead, but that he roams up and down the World, and that he will return suddenly again to conquer all the habitable Earth, and make it subject to the Portugal Nation. This is the Faith of the Christians in that Country, and they learn it insensibly of the Jews. It is not long since a Man might have borrowed a considerable Sum of Mony in <hi>Portugal</hi> payable at the return of St. <hi>Sebastian.</hi> That which doth produce this horrible Ignorance among these People is, not only that they read not the Holy Scriptures, but because the Inquisition suffers there no Religion but its own; for by this means, there is no body who can accuse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Inhumanity of the Inquisition, or the Vices and Incapacities of the Clergy. If some other Sect had liberty among them, the Contradiction of this Sect would oblige them to study, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct themselves, which would make the Study of Divinity and other Sciences flourish among them; and seeing every Man would have as many Censurers of his Religion and of his Manners, as there were Men of contrary Opinions, this would make Men take care of their Behaviour; that their Lives might be more conformable to true Christianity. Wickedness would be greatly abated, Men would be ashamed of those horrible Crimes which the <hi>Italians</hi> now make their diversion; there would be much more knowledg of God, more Industry and Perfection in the World. I know that this is not at all agreeable to the Humour of the Popes and their Clergy, who make their Markets better by Ignorance and the Inquisition. I know by my own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and what I have heard say by many good People in <hi>England,</hi> that the expulsion of Catholicks, would destroy amongst them all Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Religion, because they would have no Adversaries to awaken them, and to oblige them to take care of themselves; their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters would become ignorant and debauched, and so proportionably the People. But, say they, the Inquisition doth <hi>prohibit all ill Books</hi>; you must know too that the Word of God is of the number of these ill Books that are prohibited; and that there are many other Books forbidden, which have not only no ill in them, but which are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40127:56"/>
very excellent, only because they are contrary to the Ambition of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that there is an infinite number of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ones allowed of, which are fit for nothing but to be burnt as well as their Authors. By this same Principle they have razed out of the Bookes of the Fathers those Passages which were not for their purpose.</p>
            <p>They yet insist for the justifying of the Inquisition, That the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Religion is the Cause of Civil Wars in a Nation. But what Mischief doth not the Inquisition do? All Princes, in whose Countries it is, are Slaves to it. It is true, that among them there are no Civil Wars for Religion; but it is as true, that they must absolutely depend upon the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; otherwise if they pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their Orders, the Popes shall use them like Dogs. How many times hath the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> been like to be destroyed by these People, only because they had a mind to keep some Liberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and not to suffer certain Excesses of their Tyranny? And yet do they every day insult and attempt against all the Rights which God and Nature have given them.</p>
            <p>It is furthermore said in favour of the Papacy, That the World is greatly obliged to it for all the different Orders of Monks, and of Nuns, which are a great Ornament and Advantage to the Church. It is true, that the Popes have instituted almost all of them, and that it is no fault of theirs that there are not twenty times as many, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the States of other Princes; for by this means they erect <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> their own Empire in the Dominions of another, thereby gaining to themselves so many Subjects in all Catholick Countries, who are at all times ready to do any thing for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Now since there is nothing in it but this, all these Institutions of so many Sects of Monks ought to be suspected by us. Besides, it is not the Popes who have inspired these People with the thoughts of retreating, and of Severity to themselves, they knew only how to apply it to their own use and service. The Inclination which these Men have to this sort of Humour and Life is well enough known; and that in all times, and in all Countries, and in all Religions, there have been great numbers of Men who have embraced this sort of Life, pretending to live more austerely, and to avoid the trouble of worldly Business, affecting to be singular in their Clothes, their Diet, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping themselves, and other outward Mortifications of their Flesh. There were a great many of them among the Jews, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end, and when Religion fell most into decay; we
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40127:57"/>
see by their Authors, that besides the <hi>Pharisees</hi> there were the <hi>Essenes, Dositheens,</hi> and other Sects of Religious Jews. There were many of them among the ancient Romans; there is in <hi>Juvenal</hi> an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable description of their Manners and Customs. It is of them that he says, <hi>Fronti nulla Fides,</hi> and <hi>qui Curios simulant &amp; Bacchanalia vivunt</hi>; he represents them with short Hair, <hi>&amp; supercilio brevior coma,</hi> and with all he says, that they lived after a very licentious manner. There are also many of them at this day among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> there are great numbers of them to be found among the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Greeks, Nestorians, Eutychians, Maronites, Abyssins,</hi> and <hi>Cophties.</hi> The Popes then have made cunning use of the Humour of these People, whom they have supported as far forth as they could, and even canonized them to augment their own Power, by the Credit which they gave to these People, who became their Creatures, and who for their parts served the Pope with all the Power and Credit they had. People had them in great Veneration at <hi>Rome,</hi> this Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration spread it self every-where abroad, so that the World did almost adore them; every thing that they either said or did, was as highly esteemed, as what ever the Apostles themselves had said or done; and as time served them when they had sufficiently tried the Credulity and So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, there was sometimes as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them as to the Blood of Christ it self; whosoever took this Habit they said it was as much worth to him as a second Baptism; when any body was sick they desired to die in this Habit. These were People who did more good than God commanded; and we see that all these Impieties are yet vented by the Monks of our own time, who pretend that they do more Good than is necessary for their own Salvation, and that they can impart a share of their Merits, and Works of Supererogation to whomsoever they please<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> provided that they contribute somewh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:40127:57"/>The Heads of these Sects, as I have already said, were very useful to the Popes, and the Popes for their parts made them be esteemed by the People, and at length, by the Ignorance and Sloth of Princes, they exempted them from the Obedience due to their Soveraigns, to their Bishops, and to the Law of God it self, and so they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg none but the Pope. By little and little, making a great noise like the blind Men at <hi>Paris,</hi> many of these Sects got great Estates, others loved rather to beg, like those sturdy Vagrants, who prefer a begging and a lazy Life before any other. They who have any wit among them employ themselves in writing fabulous Legends of the Life of some or other of their Order, and in composing a great many wicked Books about Religion. They are all listed to the Pope, who pays them in Pardons, and Indulgences, and in Reliques, of which they make a good Market, in Canonizing people of their own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in exempting them from the Laws of their Prince and of their Bishops, so that there is Impunity for them for all sorts of Crimes, they are only forced to go out of the Province where they committed the Disorder into another. We may look upon every Convent of Monks, as so many Garrisons which the Pope hath in all Catholick Cities to keep them under the Yoke of his Obedience; and every diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Order, so many different Regiments clothed in different Fashions, and wearing different Liveries, who all live at the good Mans Expence, but cost the Pope not a Farthing, having found out many Secrets to pull off the Feathers without making the Fowl cry. They are certainly of great use to the Popes, but I demand what Good they do us? Are there not Clergy-men enough to perform the Service without them? Are there not People enough to be maintained who are really poor, without the begging Monks, who are the most ridiculous and the most vicious Wretches upon Earth? If they are necessary to the Church, as some say, how comes it to pass, that in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, where there was so much Piety, there were none of them? or at least very few, and they too quite of a contrary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to those now a days; but that now in this languishing State of the Church, every place swarms with them. How comes it to pass that their numbers are much less in <hi>France, Flanders, Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> where Christianity flourishes a thousand times more than in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> where it is almost extinguished? For tho there be Canonizations and Beatifications oftentimes performed for People of these Countries, it signifies nothing else, but that the Pope hath finger'd their Mony, or that these Saints were in their Life-time
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40127:58"/>
greatly devoted to the Holy See. This is done upon false-accounts given of the Lives of these Persons by some Monks of their Order, and it is very easy to impose upon People in these Countries, by reason of the extream Ignorance among them, and of the Inquisition which would burn those who should dare to contradict it. In <hi>France</hi> where People are much more understanding, and where there is greater Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is not so easy to impose upon and delude the World. Besides, the Protestants would not fail to discover the Cheat and to lay it open, from whence also it comes to pass that there are but very few Miracles wrought in <hi>France,</hi> and fewer at <hi>Paris</hi> than in any other City in the Kingdom, because People are not there so easy to be deceived. I do maintain, and every Man that hath observed it must agree with me that there is incomparably more Vertue and solid Piety in the honest People of the World than among the Monks. Converse with them, and you shall find nothing but Grimace and false appearances of a Devotion that signifies nothing, a base Devotion that hath nothing of true Piety, applying themselves to the outward parts of Religion, neglecting, or else not knowing the true form of Piety, and upon this they are puffed up with a value of themselves, they are presumptuous, full of Contempt one of another, ambitious, worldly and voluptuous, which we see in them where they have a little Liberty, as in <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> there is nothing so unruly as their Behaviour, their Lives are most licentious, there is no Villany nor Abomination which they do not commit. In <hi>France,</hi> our own Country, where they are Saints in comparison, there is no roguish Story of a Debauchery and Villany, but they are at one end of it. Compare them with our Fathers of the Oratory who are Seculars, and who yet trouble themselves with Secular Affairs less than they, and for Knowledg, for Humility, Purity, and lofty Sentiments of Religion, there is as great a difference as can be between a worthy and a judicious Person, and a superstitious soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated Fellow, or rather between an honest Woman and a Whore. I acknowledg that here and there you may find a Man of a great worth among the Monks, but it is one among ten thousand, and he must have a great deal of Strength and Courage to keep himself innocent in these places where there is so much Corruption. I believe that it is much more difficult to obtain Salvation there, than in the World, tho to those, who have not narrowly enquired into their Lives, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears otherwise. They among them who are ingenious do own it, tho they are ordinarily Hypocrites and would deceive and make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they all agree that Men must have extraordinary measures of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40127:58"/>
Grace, and would perswade the World that they themselves have them. The most unsufferable of them, as I have already said, are the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants,</hi> those <hi>Pharisees</hi> who act wholly contrary to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught and practised, who would have all Christians apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to labour, yet they pretend to be of a better sort than the others. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom St. <hi>Augustin</hi> calls the first of all Saints, says in the 20<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts, ver.</hi> 33. that he had coveted no Mans Silver, Gold, or Apparel, and that his Hands had ministred to his Necessities, and to those who were with him, and makes his Glory to consist in this, that he had been a charge to no Man: He, I say, orders all People to <hi>labour,</hi> and repeats what our Saviour had said, that it is <hi>better to give than to receive.</hi> Yet our lazy Monks have at this day Maxims that are quite contrary: They had rather have nothing at all of their own, that they may eat the Bread out of poor Peoples Mouths, upon whose Sweat and Blood they live and grow fat. Of all the Monks that ever I yet heard of, I have a value for no Order of them but those of <hi>La Trape,</hi> by the account the World gives of them. First, they are all kept to work, they trouble not themselves with Confessions, no more than the first Monks in the Primitive Times. They study, they haunt neither Courts nor Cities, they are not covetous of Legacies, nor do they pry into Peoples Wills, they are not Beggars, they sell not holy things, they live fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, upon a wholsom Diet to keep themselves in Health, which makes their Minds more fit for the Service of God, they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of News, nor of the Secrets of Families to make advantage by it, they read the word of God carefully, making holy things their ordinary Entertainment, and have no Commerce at all with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Provided that this could continue without Vanity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Discontent, it is a School of Holiness. For the others I find, that instead of being advantagious to the Church, they dishonour it, and give the Protestants just reason to despise us. With People that have any Understanding these Fellows Habits make so strongly against them, that Men are apt to believe that there is both extravagancy and weakness of Mind in those that wear them; these are marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, which shew them not to be French Men, but that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to another Prince; What good do these ridiculous Singularities do? If this Habit be necessary to make a Man really better, we ought all to take it; if not, they are to be laughed at thus that dress up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so much the more when they think they merit by it.

Their Principle of blind Obedience is both foolish and impious, which may cause, and many times hath been the occasion of horrible Disorders in the Estates and Families of our Kings. It is a Principle which makes the Pope, whom their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors implicitly obey, Master of our Lives and of the State; for these Superiors are always as ready to inspire the Monks with all sorts of Opinions, how horrible soever they be, provided they serve the Pope his Designs; for this reason I have often wondered that some Law hath not been made in the State against the perfidiousness of the Monks and Jesuits, from the example of two of our [French] Kings whom they have murthered; and that it hath not been declared, that if any such thing shall happen for time to come, all these People should be driven out of the Kingdom: There is no other means to hinder the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> from doing the same things hereafter. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> hath lately enacted somewhat like this to secure the Life of their King against the Monks. No Clergy-man ought to be received without subscribing the Condemnation of the impious Bull <hi>de CoenÃ¢ Domini,</hi> which is a bottomless Gulf of Impieties, Heresies,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40127:59"/>
and Inhumanities. And till the Monks and Jesuits shall solemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and condemn this accursed Bull, it will be no great Injustice done them, to accuse them of attempting against the Lives of Kings. If any Man did suspect me to be an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and I knew it, and could justify my self from such cursed Opinions, and did it not, the World would have reason to impute to me all the Consequences of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Heresy. It is well known that all the Monks, and particularly the Jesuits have by their fourth Vow obliged themselves to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this infernal Bull. It was the Monks, who, living in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, corrupted and falsified many Ecclesiastical Books, they have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited many other Books full of Lies, and set them out under the Names of good Authors. They are every where known for People who, by their Artifices under pretext of Religion, are the ruine of most Families, whose Substance they cunningly suck in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. It is they who have vilified and discredited the true Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Priests, drawing the People after themselves by false appearances of Mortifications. They are good for nothing but to move Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to bring People to Disobedienee, and when ever the Interest of their Monarch the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pe, is concerned, they think the Blood of their Enemies as meritorious as that <hi>of the Cross.</hi> The Humility they boast of is a very pleasant thing, when at the same time they take place of their Elders, and of People of Quality. They pretend to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Vanity more strictly than the Secular Priests, and yet these Asses are called <hi>Father, Father,</hi> as heretofore the Pharisees, <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> they cause themselves also to be stiled <hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi> and pretend to have Merit enough besides to obtain their own Salvation, and to impart the overplus to others. They call themselves <hi>Father Raphaels, Father Cherubims, and Father Seraphims,</hi> with such like Names, which are Marks of Vanity and Folly, with which there can be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Humility nor Piety. Their Generals also manage the matter fairly, to have the same Respect shewed them in the Courts of Princes as the Ambassadours of the greatest Kings. These Gentlemen are all sworn Enemies to the Holy Scripture as well as to the Court, and they do all they can to render the reading of it suspicious, they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did what they could to abolish it, because it made as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them as the Popes. In the Year 1192. they made a new Gospel upon the Dreams of a Carmelite named <hi>Cyrill,</hi> this was to suppress the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and their own they called the <hi>Eternal Gospel,</hi> wherein they taught that God the Father reigned under the Law, God the Son under Grace, and that the Holy Ghost
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40127:60"/>
was now going to reign by the Establishment of four Orders of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants,</hi> and that for the future Men could not be saved but by this Gospel, that that of Jesus Christ was imperfect, and that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were of no great use. This Gospel was preached almost all <hi>Europe</hi> over by the <hi>Jacobines</hi> and <hi>Franciscans,</hi> and it was very near being received in the University of <hi>Paris,</hi> but there remained yet some worthy Men who opposed and made it be condemned, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these new Evangelists had the favour of the Holy Father, the Doctors of the University were forced to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> where at length they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that this Book should be condemned and burned, but privately<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for fear of decrying the four Orders of <hi>Mendicants,</hi> and also that the Book of the University of <hi>Paris</hi> should be burned; much after the same manner as heretofore at <hi>Bezancon</hi> at the beginning of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Revolt, which drew many Towns after it, the Magistra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zancon</hi> fearing that this Fire should reach thither, forbad all sorts of People to speak of God either Good or Evil. And there falling out lately a Dispute between some Divines of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> some of whom do hold with the Jesuits, that we may be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loving God, and others on the contrary, that we ought to love God; whereupon both the one and the other were forbidden to speak of it so that the matter yet remains undecided, whither we ought to love God or no, or whither the Gospel of the Monks, or of Jesus Christ be the true one. The Author of the Book against this new Gospel is called <hi>William de St. Amour, de periculis novissimorum Temporum:</hi> See in <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. Par. in Hist. Angl. in <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. &amp; in lib. de Antichrist.</note>. At length the Monks had Credit enough, having procured several Bulls to be given out against the Book, to obtain one by which the Author was forbidden to set foot again in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> to receive him. <hi>Scilicet sic Petrus sactitabat, sic Paulus ludebat.</hi> The Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as the Monks, was mortally grieved that this new Gospel could not pass, and had it not been for the University at <hi>Paris,</hi> we should in all likelihood have never known what the Gospel of Jesus Christ was, and the Monks would have been our Saviours.</p>
            <p>I have heard say that in all the rich Convents there is a Father that keeps the Evidence-Office, whose whole Employ it is to find out good Titles when they want them, to joyn their Neighbours Field to their own<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and there is no harm in that, because it is for the Church. There are some of these Orders, the <hi>Benedictines</hi> for example, who have their Pensioners in the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> like the Excise-men in the Courts of <hi>Aydes</hi> to help them gain their Cause: From
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40127:60"/>
whence come all the Enterprises which they daily make upon their Neighbours Goods, stripping them as often as they can of them. People of very good Credit, and who know the thing very well, have assured me, that this one O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>der gave more than two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Livers a Year in Pensions to divers Officers of Parliament; judg then what Disorders that makes. I know not why the Monks have not been kept to read the Holy Scriptures, and to study Divinity and Morality, rather than so many ridiculous ways of Mortifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; if they studied or worked hard, they would need no other Mortification, but they have invented whipping since they have left off working, which is the most extravagant thing in the World. The reading of a Chapter of Scripture would be much better than that; as an excellent Man said, It is not the Severities of the Body, nor the Agitations of the Mind, but the good Motions of the Heart that are meritorious, which shall be excited much sooner by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word of God, than by all their Follies. Wherefore I have reason to ask what the Monks are good for? The poor Orders as they are also lazy, are a burthen to the State, they of them that are rich take no care of the poor, and both the one and the other are unprofitable, nay, prejudicial both to Church and State, they ought to do quite otherwise than to plunge themselves into Idleness, so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous both for their Souls and Bodies, and to be so chargeable to the Kingdom that keeps them and fats them up without receiving any Service from them; they are good for none but themselves and the Popes, whose Tyranny they support; thus the Popes in maintaining them do good only to themselves, when certainly the Monks at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent might easily spare the Popes. Wherefore I yet once more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what Service the Popes do to the World?</p>
            <p>As for the Nuns,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the Nuns.</hi>
               </note> tho there be not by much so great Disorders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them as amongst the Monks, because generally they have no share at all in the Affairs of a Civil Life, yet I think I may safely say it, That Fathers and Mothers who are desirous of their Childrens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought not to send them to such Houses, and that there is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Piety, Chastity, and Purity of Heart among Secular Women than among the Nuns, by reason of the little Liberty that is given them: All the good they can do there is by Force and by Constraint, it is a place of Slavery and of Torment. People imagine that in these Houses where they have so much time to employ in reading and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing themselves, they ought to be very knowing, yet they are more ignorant and superstitious than Women that live abroad in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40127:61"/>
World. Their Abbesses are ordinarily chosen for their Quality, not for their Merit, and are either covetous or extravagant, fantastical, without Humanity for these poor young Women, without Conduct, and almost always without Piety. I have known many of them in my time, but never saw any that was worthy of this Employment but <hi>Madam de Fontevrault,</hi> Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. In those Houses where the Superiours of the Nuns are Elective or Triennial, there are continual Factions and Intrigues, that the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may fall on her that every particular Woman likes. It would be very well that these Elections were abolished, provided that Persons of real worth were placed in their stead. The number of these Nuns is also too great as well as of the Monks, and they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, so that those who remain should have 200 Livers a Year for their Subsistance, and that the King should dispose of these places to whom he pleased, for the succour of many Families, and the over-plus of so many rich Convents Revenue might be employed in the building of many Hospitals. Nor should any young Woman be admitted to take the Vail till 25 Years old, for the Tyranny of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers, and the want of Consideration in young Girls throws a great many of them into Dispair. They ought also to be allowed sometimes to go home to their Fathers and Mothers when their Health requires it, and to refresh their Spirits which are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over-born with Grief and Vexation either by the Tyranny of their Superiours, or by their too long Confinement in this Prison; without this a Convent is a perfect Shambles both for the Body and Soul. It must be acknowledged that this sort of Relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ous Life is unproportionable to the weakness both of our Bodies and Minds, and is much less proper to produce true Piety than a Secular Life. Thus the Popes are so far from being Serviceable to Mankind, that they are matter of scandal to us, and stumbling Blocks to turn us out of the true way of Salvation. Of what use then are they to the World?</p>
            <p>An <hi>Italian</hi> will tell me that they are serviceable to <hi>Italy,</hi> by their inriching it. But it is at the Expence of other Countries which do this Honour to <hi>Italy</hi>; which, having now lost its Temporal Empire, hath by the Popes means raised a spiritual one to make amends for it; but still this is at our Expence.</p>
            <p>It is certain that all the <hi>Italians</hi> in general look upon themselves as having a share in the Glory of this Empire, and pretend that they have more Wit and Merit than other Nations<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which they have in this respect subdued, especially those of <hi>Rome,</hi> who for this reason give
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40127:61"/>
themselves the liberty of speaking contemptibly of Catholick Princes, whom they look upon as their Tributaries; the very Coblers come in for their share, and are mightily pleased that the Pope rules in all places. And I have observed, that they have more respect and value for those Princes that have shaken off the Popish Yoke, as if it had been the Effect of their Courage; nay, for the very Strangers of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as <hi>English, Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi> This may seem strange; for it is well known that otherwise they bitterly hate these Nations that no longer yeild them any thing.

            <p>This Council hath done the Church a thousand times more harm than good, for it hath given the Protestants plausible Reasons of Obduracy, and to us no greater assurance of the goodness of our Religion; for as they carried it, they made it a Work perfectly Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, Intrigue and Policy did all. The Pope was there a Party, and became himself the Judg. The Protestants could not be there, seeing the Pope was the manager both of the Convocation and of the Suffrages, which he got for Mony distributed about in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> before the Assembly began: And because he would be master, some good Bishops who knew not how to manage it so well, <hi>inesperti del maneggio,</hi> as Cardinal <hi>Palavicini</hi> says of them, offering to speak against the Popes Interest, were treated many times unworthily by the Legates, who gave no sort of Liberty. Christian Princes, as the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand, Charles</hi> the Ninth, and <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to whom they granted not one of their just Demands had no more reason to be satisfied. To convince the World that it was only the advantage of the Popes which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> sought after, and not the Glory of God, nor the Salvation of Men: It is not necessary to relate at large all the base Intrigues which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Legates, but only to consider the Decree which was there made against the reading of the Holy Scripture. By this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree all People were forbidden to read it without leave given them by their Ordinary, who was to allow it to none but Clergy-men; that is to say, the People who were in possession of Benefices, and whose Interest it was to maintain things in the same condition they were in. Thus did the Legates forbid what God had commanded generally to the whole World. And as Tyrants live in continual fear, they thought themselves not yet secure, but fearing that they had granted too much, they made another Decree whereby they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40127:63"/>
forbad all sorts of People to read it. All their fear was, that by the comparing the Papacy with the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, People should discover the Imposture which they have put upon the Church, whose Face they have disfigured and changed its very Nature, making the Government of the Church a piece of Knavery, and a Device to supplant all the Kings and Princes of the World, confounding Heaven with Earth, and destroying all Order both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane. The Hereticks make a more Christian Use of it; for tho they have been so inconsiderate as to reject many Books of the Old Testament, which are Canonical, as the <hi>Apocrypha</hi>; yet they do not only allow, but recommend the reading of them, and we find them bound up with their Bibles to be there read as well as the rest. I make no doubt but that if the Legates had dared to do it, they would have suppressed the Holy Books, or at least razed out, or changed all those places that were against them, as the Inquisition hath done by many of the Ancient Authors. How are they who are gone away from us scandalized at such Conduct as this? What shame hath it not brought upon our holy Religion? they cannot look upon us without abhorrence, because we suffer such Abominations. <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diret ut suspenderentur molae asinariae in collis eorum<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> ut non scandaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pusillos istos.

It was also the same Spirit that made them give up Religion wholly to the Popes Fancy which is evident by this, because that having made many Decrees, they say that they shall be of force without prejudice to the Authority of the Apostolick See, that is to say, that they shall have place no farther than the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pleaseth, whereby they make the Council subject to the Pope, which is a devilish Heresy, condemned by the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi> The Popes did in effect get by this Council as well as by the others dispencing both with them, and themselves when they pleased; as <hi>Palavicini</hi> says, that if the Pope should be bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Laws, the Fountain of his Beneficence would be half drawn dry. <note n="â€ " place="margin">Introduct. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note>

            <p>It is then clear by this account, that there is never any good to be expected from any Council which the Pope shall call together, or where he or his Creatures shall preside, or which shall be assembled in <hi>Italy</hi>; not only because of the multitude of <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops, who would spoil all, but because a Council of worthy Men would not be there in safety; for the <hi>Italians</hi> would run to all sorts of Excess and Violence, rather than suffer that the Spiritual Empire, which they claim over all other Nations, should be taken from them, because they come all in for a share of the Plunder: just as we see the Inhabitants of <hi>Barbary</hi> are concerned for the preservation of the Town and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Algier,</hi> because they taste of their Riches, and have all a share in their Robberies.</p>
            <p>The further insist for the Popes Advantage, that they have built a great many fine Churches at <hi>Rome,</hi> whose admirable Structure doth greatly edify Believers, and is of it self capable to convert the Infidel Princes, as <hi>Palavicini</hi> says, <note n="*" place="margin">Palav. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note>

more for me to prove, but that it is the indispensible Duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, who are the Protectors of the Faith, and to whom God hath committed the Defence of his Church, to deliver this same Church from the Papacy that destroys it. This is what they owe to God, to the Church, to their Subjects, to themselves, and also to HÃºman Society.</p>
            <p>In regard of GOD, we know that Princes were commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law to take care that nothing should be received against the pure Service of God, and we also see that good Kings, as <hi>Josias</hi> and <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> were so careful in this Point, as to depose the High-priests themselves, who were instituted by God, which the Popes are not. And now under the Gospel they are the Guardians of the two Tables of the Law, as the <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>As for the <hi>Church,</hi> if they are the Protectors of it, as they ought to be, and without doubt are; if the Church be trod under foot, if Ambition, Luxury, and Ignorance seize upon the Ecclesiastical Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, if the Bishops neglect their Duty, are incapable of teaching, and look after nothing but spoiling and turning all to their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Profit, if they will make the Church a Den of Thieves, if they sell Holy Things, and keep the Price to themselves, shall not Princes punish such Villanies? Shall they bear the Sword without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able, even for the Good of the Church, to make use of it against the Popes, who do all these things? <note n="â€ " place="margin">Aug. contra Crescon. Gram. <hi>lib.</hi> 3.</note> It is in this, says St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that Princes are well pleasing to God, in doing those things which none but Kings can do; <hi>In hoc ergo serviunt Domino Reges, cum ea faciunt ad serviendum illi quae non possunt facere nisi Reges.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this they did heretofore depose the Popes, they made them give an account of their Faith, they did assemble Councils, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise their Decrees, and made them be observed; and the Popes cannot alledg any Treaty made with Princes, nor any Prescription; for there
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40127:65"/>
is no Prescription against the Service which we owe to God, nor no Agreement which can bind the Hands of Princes when it is against the good of the Church; for if at any time they have surprised Princes, taking advantage of their Ignorance or Weakness, it is then a greater Crime to observe these Treaties which are against the Glory of God and the good of the Church, than it is to violate them. Here the saying is true, that <hi>interdum scelus est fides.</hi> No Man whatsoever ought to have his Hands tied by any Treaty from advancing the Glory of God as much as he is able by lawful means.</p>
            <p>Nor are Princes less obliged for their <hi>Subjects sake,</hi> to do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavour to extirpate the Papacy, for they are the Preservers both of Religious and Civil Society, being the Heads both of the one and the other in their own Dominions. It is on this account that they receive their Tribute, and for this end were they by God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that we might live in Peace and Quietness in all Godliness and Honesty. And there is no Subject but may demand it of his Prince, that he would enfranchise him from the Tyranny of the Pope, or else let him renounce the Right which God hath given him over him; for the Prince hath no Right to give his Subjects over to another, and at the same time to reserve his own Power over them upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatsoever, this is against Nature and the Law of Nations, but he ought to defend them against all Oppression, of either Foreign or Domestick Enemies. Now the whole World knows that the Popes for many Ages past have dealt unworthily, as well by the Subjects as the Persons of Princes they have smitten whole Kingdoms together with their <hi>Anathema's,</hi> they have drained them by their Indulgences, they plunder them by their Dispensations and by their Annates, they make them stoop to them by their Bulls, and oblige many of them to take Oath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this day the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have this Right as they pretend, to fling down Kings from their Thrones, as a Fowler shoots down a Bird from the branch of a Tree. They are Masters of all the Kingdoms of the World and can give them to whomsoever they please; they not only say so, but do it; they have done so by <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> they have done so by the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi> which they have shared between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Portugals,</hi> having outed the lawful Princes. They have dealt thus with many other States, and are still ready to do the same thing again. It is then the Interest of Princes for many respects that this Tyranny should be abolished; since as the Fathers say, they have none but God alone above them, they ought not to depend upon these Scoundrils. It is a thing unworthy of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and contrary to their Soveraignty to be under the Yoke of any Man living. It signifies nothing to say that they are so only for the spiritual part, for that is yet less to be allowed of. Jesus Christ hath reserved that to himself; and they suffer the Church to be undone by their Sluggishness and hinder those who are gone astray from it from being converted, nay, they destroy the very Popes who damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the foolish Opinion which they have of their Power; they must be cured of their Presumption, and have good done them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no, as we do to Children, <hi>a communi ed a fanciulli convien fare il loro bene senza lor voglia.

For my part, I wonder that those, who have heard of Jesus Christ and his Gospel, do not condemn this Pride to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40127:66"/>
the severest Punishments. No Man that had the least Fear of God would ever be Pope to act so horrible a part, not to mention the Disorders of the Church, and the destruction of so many Souls that shall be imputed to him. <note n="*" place="margin">

But besides all this, what can a Man think of these Men, who call themselves their <hi>Holinesses,</hi> which is a Title that belongs only to God, and is one of the most excellent of all his Attributes; who call themselves <hi>Vicars of Jesus Christ,</hi> to dethrone Jesus Christ from his Church and govern it at their own fantasy; who say that they are <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> and <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Councils,</hi> that they can open Heaven and shut up

I demand whether there be any thing like this in the Crimes of others the most vile and miserable Creatures, and that which is the most terrible of all, is, that the Popes do every day cast down many Millions of Souls headlong into Hell. Do not such things as these deserve the Vengeance of Princes here on Earth?

               <hi>Deorum injuriae diis curae</hi>; but here where they are robbed of their Majesty to dress up a pack of Rascals with it, where they are made Tributary, where their Authority is limited, where part of their Subjects are withdrawn from them by Exemptions and base Laws, which make them contemptible as well to those who thus plunder them, as to others who secure themselves under the Covert of this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; It is unconceiveable that Princes should have so much Patience; for tho the Primacy of St. <hi>Peter</hi> could be proved that he was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and left there his Succcessours either as he was an Apostle, or a Bishop, must, I say, such People as these be his Successours, and make all these Crimes their common Practise, and go still unpunished? They shall as soon make me worship the Devil as believe it. And I really believe, that it would be no hard matter to make them who adhere to the Papacy, both receive and serve him. They would soon relish the Reasons of the <hi>Manicheens,</hi> who said that there were two Principles, the one good and the other bad; or the Argument of those <hi>Indians,</hi> who believed they ought to worship the Devil, because he could do them hurt, and that God, being all good of himself, could do them none, and so it is not necessary to adore him. This now looks very amazing, but they who are so much in love with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy would soon receive it, if any Man of Sense would give a little colour to it, and there were good Benefices to be hoped for by it, which could not otherwise be obtained; if they might have fine Churches, and re-establish the fine Ceremonies of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> if their only care might be to divert the Eyes and Eares of the People with Musick and rare Shews, as heretofore they did to those miserable Jews, who brought their Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> and whilst they burned they played upon all sorts of Instruments, and entertained them with the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful

There would be in my Opinion greater reason to wonder if they should embrace the Catholick Religion whilst the Pope should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise this horrible Tyranny; for I do maintain that there is no Man of Honour, that hath any Modesty or Sense of Christianity, that can digest this Article of the Almighty Power of the Pope, if at least it hath not been riveted in him from his Childhood, and he been brought up in this Opinion all his Life-time without ever making any Reflection upon it. But for the Protestants, we must never pretend to make them believe that the Popes are Heads of the universal Church established by Jesus Christ to govern it as it is governed, there is no Man of Sense will ever be perswaded to believe this. But it may be said that the great Truths which the Cathol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ck Religion teaches, give us so great an advantage over the Hereticks, that they ought to make no difficulty of passing over such an Error as this to enter into the Communion of the Church. For my part, I am of Opinion, that a Man's Conversion is a work supernatural, and from the hand of God, who, filling the Heart of Man with Light and Courage, makes him overcome Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and his natural Weakness; and that a true Conversion is always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Zeal towards God, and Charity towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. This being supposed, I maintain that they who are converted by these Principles do in effect embrace with their whole Heart the Catholick Truths; but that their Charity and the Zeal towards God, which animates them, shall always make them resist and oppose to the utmost of their Power all Impostures and Falsities whatsoever, that they shall chearfully lose their Estates and Lives, to deliver the Church from so miserable a Slavery as the Papacy is. It is a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness that the Protestants have separated themselves not from the Pope, but from the Church, and that they have invented Novelties to fortify their Schism which at the beginning had no other Original than the Tyranny of the Pope; for without these Novelties the Church would in all likelihood have joyned with them, because that many People saw clearly the Cheat of the Papacy, and that it had no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, neither in the Scripture nor in Reason; but the Op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have not courage enough to get off this Abuse and to detest it as well as they, wherein we do great Prejudice to our selves, to Religion, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the Protestants whom we destroy by it; for they, seeing that they have Reason on their side in this Point, cannot believe that we have it in others, and so remain obstinante. For my part, as I am assured that their Religion is contrary to the Gospel, so I cannot but confess (and I think my self indispencibly bound in Conscience to do it) that concerning the Article of the Papacy, they have more Reason on their side than can be imagined.</p>
            <p>But if we find that we have too little Courage or Strength to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to abolish and utterly destroy this Monster, we ought at least to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to send him home to <hi>Rome, and secure our selves from all the Mischief he is able to do us, and not to endure any more his Approaches.</hi> I say this only to prevent the Objection which People make, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream difficult to bring about such an Enterprise; that this great Machine is so well joyned together, this <hi>Babel</hi> hath so many Props and Arches, that they who should undertake to pull it down would be in danger of being swallowed up in its Ruins. <hi>Mille annorum fortunÃ¢ disciplinÃ¢<expan>

But I do not think the danger so great as People imagine; for I am perswaded that this work doth not exceed the Strength of any great, vigorous and zealous Prince who would manage the thing with Prudence. I own that no Prince can undertake such a Work, who is not assured that his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours shall not oppose him, and that his Clergy and People shall not be against him: As for his Neighbours, he may easily know their Disposition both as to their Will, and the Means they have either to assist or hurt him. And for the Clergy, the Contrivance should be to let them peaceably enjoy their Benefices, and to make them understand their Rights; that according to the Gospel all Bishops are equal, and that they owe to the Pope no more than to any other of their fellow Brethren, that the Popes have usurped over them the Authority which they assume to themselves of giving Bulls, and the Oath of Fidelity which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act from them, and that these things overturn the Gospel; and that for the Oath, if they have taken it to the Pope, it is null in it self, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of God, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> says, <hi>si ad peccatum admittendum fides adhibeatur, mirum est si fides appelletur.</hi> And for the People, they must be gently used and made to understand, if they are capable of Reason, that all the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as other Bishops, have Authority only in their Diocess, according to the Gospel and ancient
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40127:68"/>
Canons; that the Authority which they exercise, serves for nothing else but to make them Masters of the whole Earth, and turns to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their particular Profit: They must also be shewed the Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which this Power hath caused both in the Church and in the World, as I have represented it in some places of this Work. If once the People were made to comprehend this, the Monks could never do any Mischief; for they are dangerous only among the People whom they govern, provided they do not come nigh Princes. This being done, a potent and prudent Prince would easily perswade other Princes all that I have said of the Papacy, of its uselesness, of the Mischiefs it hath caused in the Church and in the World, of the Shame which it draweth upon them by keeping them always under the Yoak, of the damage which it causeth to their Estates, of the Danger they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in depending upon the Popes Humour, who can excommunicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no Prince who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense, but would joyn with another truly Catholik Prince that would propose this; and by this means we should soon see the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Revelation</hi> fulfilled, <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 11.15.</note> which says, that <hi>the Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</hi> But, say they, the King and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have <note n="â€–" place="margin">

I have proved that the Papacy is a Mystery of Iniquity; and that so Princes as well as others would make themselves the Instruments of the Popes Crimes, of their Sin against God, and of the Ruine which they draw upon the Church. <hi>Seneca</hi> says very well, <hi>Si in omnibus obediendum est patri, in eo non est obediendum, in quo efficitur ne pater sit; Tho we ought in all things to obey our Father, yet he is not to be obeyed in those things wherein he ceaseth to be a Father.</hi> The reason then is much stronger, that we ought not to obey a common High-way-man, who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and seduced us to make us Complices of his Crimes.

So that there is no Oath, Treaty, nor Agreement, but ought to give place to the good and safety of the Church, and the Salvation of our Souls.

            <p>Thus there is no Reason Divine nor Humane, but doth indispencibly ingage Princes to renounce the Papacy, and to re-establish the Church in that Liberty which Jesus Christ hath left to it.
