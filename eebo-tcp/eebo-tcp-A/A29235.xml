            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O sooner was my <hi>Grate</hi> closed, than I from my <hi>Prospect</hi> barred; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring my self to my rest, which was as restlesse as my <hi>fortunes</hi> haplesse, my <hi>friends</hi> hopelesse and helplesse. Neither did <hi>this</hi> lessen, but heighten my misery, to have mine <hi>eye</hi> barred from liberty, by being shut from my <hi>Prospect</hi> of vanity: But beggars must be no choosers, nor prisoners disposers; with Patience I retired, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to enjoy <hi>my selfe,</hi> though of all outward joyes deprived and joy in the liberty of my <hi>minde,</hi> though of bodily freedom restrained. Neither indeed (to doe As surlie <hi>Cerberus</hi> right) was my <hi>Argus-eyed</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so relentlesse, as wholly to restrain mee; for his promise was unto mee, next morning betime to tender mee a courtesie, by giving mee free recourse to my <hi>Grate;</hi> where I resolved to spend the next day in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious survey of such passengers and passages as happily might encounter mee, and make themselves <hi>objects</hi> to an <hi>embleme</hi> of misery. But see how humane purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are diverted! implying, that nothing can bee by man, so long as hee is man, firmly resolved: For, next day, addressing my selfe to my old <hi>taske,</hi> I understood
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47239:24"/>
by <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Knights-ward,</hi> that divers broken and decayed <hi>Merchants,</hi> whose estate, howsoever it seeme to the eye of the world, razed, yet (so wise is humane policy) their <hi>supposed</hi> Heirs are to great fortunes rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; were inquisitive how they might procure a trustie and faithfull <hi>Retainer,</hi> who had knowledg in keeping of a booke, casting an account, and such necessary parte at properly concerned men of their ranke. Upon which enquiry, she whole <hi>House,</hi> to doe mee a courtesy, and add some small comfort to my present misery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preferred mee; knowing mee to have a little smattering in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,</hi> and in that respect fittest to bee imployed for such an instrument; since which time I have used all diligence to tender <hi>them</hi> all possible content; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have so far prevailed, as with the generall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of these decayed <hi>Magnificoes,</hi> it is lately conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if it come to passe (as much may bee) that they may eyther by meanes of <hi>Protection,</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enfranchisement to them granted, attaine to the honour of a <hi>Company,</hi> I shall forthwith bee made their <hi>Remembrancer;</hi> which place I shall right willingly accept, intending to <hi>remember</hi> them upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hence then appeareth the cause why I am from further <hi>survey</hi> restrained, being in affaires of higher consequence imployed; having no time to betake mee to writing or from wasting my <hi>Spleene</hi> with laughing; to see so many deluded <hi>Creditors</hi> bemoaning the fall of my politick <hi>Masters,</hi> whose well-cram'd coffers are so well stored, as they will feed the <hi>Breaker,</hi> though the <hi>Creditor</hi> bee starved.

First therefore to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to you and your brittle Corporation some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Remonstrances of my affection (yet not so

as my love should forget forme, or my Letter method;) my purpose is to reduce this schedule to you directed, to four main heads or principall points; where, in the first branch, I meane to make known what was objected against you; secondly, what was answered for you; thirdly, what was Enacted; and lastly, certain directions, by way of prevention proponnded, that the force or virtue of that Act might bee frustrated or diverted. For the first, divers Bills of complaint were preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, and with much heate prosecuted; sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry main objections pressed, the substance or effect whereof I have no lesse freely couched, then friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched, that in your memories they may bee the deeper imprinted. It was objected, and that with much vehemency, by a rawbone Knight, who, is it seemd, had been formerly conversant with men of your quality, which occasioned him to exasperate the businesse against you more feelingly. That if such as you were suffered to get mens estates into your hands under pretence of Commerce, and then fraudulently shut up shop, as if the light of you fortunes had received a Dampe, there would it time bee no Commerce in this I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>and, but an utter decay or decrease of all trades; the reason hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged was this, Because, said hee, every Profession by way of Commerce, useth to have dependence upon mens reputation or credit; now if this repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (the buttresse of every profession) faile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needs must all Commerce, relying upon mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47239:26"/>
fall. This objection was illustrated by divers apt similitudes, to add more lustre to his proposition, and detract the more from your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. The State, quoth hee, is a body politick, and may bee aptly compared to a body naturall and organicall; the Belly or Maw of this body is the Commonaltie, whereto other parts stand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to relieve her necessity; with these she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorteth and Commerceth, and on their engaged re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation shee relyeth: The eye promiseth to direct her; the hand to relieve her, and the foote to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her: If these infringe their promise shee of necessity must perish, because their mutuall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance requires a mutuall assistance; which neglected, the whole fabrick must be dissolved: so fares it with the body politick, where one veine drawes blood from another; if one veine grow too full the whole body suffers for it, which distemper admits no prevention but by Phlebotomy and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; Full bodies must bee purged; spungie and ranke Vines pruned; grounds overflowing drained, and impostum'd sores launced; much more this Gangrene of our State, which menaceth ruine to the whole body, if it be not prevented by a speedy remedy: For tell mee, shall these ulcerous <hi>Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> who feede on others fortunes, and fat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with others ruines, receive countenance from us, respect by us, or expect lesse then an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Censure of us?

to receive then requite, should suffer death. What Censure then should be pronounced on these, who receive more then is given them, retain more then is due unto them, and infringe their faith to such as repose trust in them? Violation, or breach of faith, was so odious and contemptible a thing to Heathen men, as they preferred a noble end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so ignoble a brand; their reputation was their glory, their honour was their prize, and their good name that precious odor which perfumed them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and embalm'd them dying. When a poore woman complained to <hi>Tamberlaine,</hi> That one of his Souldiers had drunke some of her milke, for which hee had not paid, he caused the Souldier whom the woman accused to bee brought forth, and for this pettie injury to bee ript up, that it might appeare whether her accusation were true or false; which if it had proved otherwise then shee affirmed, had been on her selfe inverted, by inflicting on this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the selfe same punishment which was practised on this Delinquent. If a Souldier, whose professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is commonly injurie and rapine, deserved so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy a Censure, for so light and veniall an error, what may hee seeme to deserve who professeth all urbani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, liveth in a State famous for civilitie, and whose very garbe is a complement of honestie?

ground of State-policie relies on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of these broken <hi>Merchants;</hi> whose suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion would bee an occasion of sundry maine incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences in the publick State; for, if prevention bee the life of policie, how so one would this life be extinguished; if it had no subjects of prevention whereby it might bee exercised? If there were no <hi>Breakers</hi> to circumvent, the <hi>Merchants</hi> needed no policie to prevent; which would in time inure them to securitie, and make them ignorant in the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of preventing policie. Yea, But it is objected, that these <hi>Bankrupt Merchants</hi> are profest enemies to all civill Commerce; Admit this were so, yet in some Cases it is as necessarie to have enemies as friends. <hi>Nasica,</hi> when the Roman Common-weal was supposed to bee in most secure estate, because free of their enemies, affirmed; That though the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were both brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of bondage, yet they were in most danger, because none were left whom they might eyther feare for danger, or who should keepe them in awe. The like course observed <hi>Oenomademus,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Chios,</hi> when hee counselled his fellowes, That they should not expell all their enemies, but still leave some in the City; lest (quoth hee) being void of all our enemies, we should begin to quarrel with our friends: Besides, if our wealthy Traders should not somtimes encounter with these rubs, their much prosperity would make them insolent, so as labouring with their owne burden, they would

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I can see no reason why these Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should preferre any such Bill of Complaynt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Bankrupts; seeing they confesse how much in their course of Trading they have gained by them, which will not only countervaile their losse, but might bee an inducement to qualifie their demands: Yea, suppose all were true as these Tradesmen affirme, and that these <hi>broken Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> were the utter ruine of their fortunes, who by getting commodities into their hand and so breaking, have diverted the current of all trading. Yet let these Tradesmen lay their hand on their heart, aud tell mee if they have not by times chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these Merchants Sonnes as often as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were ever cheated by their Fathers. All then that they can justly complain of, is but a little delay or drift of time, for when oportunity shal be offer'd I make little doubt, but these who were once del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At the end of which Act these two provisions were thought fit to bee annexed: Provided further, That no Purchasor, for good and valuable consideration shall bee impeached by virtue of this Act, or any Act heretofore made against Bankrupts, unlesse the Commission to prove him or her a Bankrupt, be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth against such Bankrupt within five yeers after hee or they shall become Bankrupt.

reduced all those particulars to one abstract, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually comprehending the substance of every branch contained in this Act. First, all such Laws and Statutes as were heretofore made against Bankrupts, and for reliefe of Creditors, are for the better reliefe and redresse of the said Creditors, largely and beneficially construed and expounded. Secondly, the qualitie, nature and condition of a Bankrupt is in his colours lively described, display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and discovered. Thirdly, the like Commissions, Orders, Benefits and Remedies which are, and bee provided &amp; limited by the said former Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> against any Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, shall bee prosecuted and expounded against such Bankrupts, as by their especiall, personall marks are herein declared or expressed. Fourthly, the same orders, benefits and remedies which are by this present Act provided and limited against any Bankrupt, shall henceforth be pursued &amp; expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against such person and persons as by the said former Acts of Parliaments are declared or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bee Bankrupts. Fiftly, the Commissioners power is illustrated; a doubt, touching examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bankrupts wives cleered, and the penalties whereto refractory women are incident, in cases of denying or refusing to be examined, fully expressed. Sixtly, what publick punishment shall be on such men or women inflicted, as upon examination shall be either found to have concealed the truth, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed such estates as were theirs, or to them upon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47239:36"/>
trust recommended. Seventhly, the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners authority is inlarged, and to the breaking open of the Bankrupts house, warehouse, chamber, shop, chest or trunck authorized. Eighthly, there is a course proposed, how division and distribution of the Bankrupts Lands and Goods, to the reliefe of the Creditor shall be disposed, and how to every one a ratable part is to be apportioned. Ninthly, if any Lands, Tenements, Goods, Chattels, Debts, or other estate of any Bankrupt chance to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under colour or pretence of being accomptant or any way indebted to our Soveraigne Lord, his heirs or successors; the said Commissioners are to examine upon Oath, whether the said Debt were due to the said debtor or accomptant: And if such bargaine or contract was originally made, the said Commissioners are to order and dispose of all such Lands, &amp;c. so extended, to the sole use of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, who seeke reliefe by the said Commission, and to whose behoofe they are to bee converted. Tenthly, if any Bankrupt shall with the consent and permission of the true owner and proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, have in their possession any goods or chattels, whereof they shall bee reputed owners, they shall be by the Commissioners power lawfully disposed, and to the Creditors reliefe converted, that Debts may be better discharged, and Bankrupts hereafter discouraged. Eleventhly, the time when this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or power should be to these Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners granted, in what manner exhibited, and in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47239:37"/>

Long I had not tempted the Maine, but a mercilesse Storme most uncivilly drave us upon the extremes of a more cruell Element. For, no sooner came wee neere the <hi>Gulph,</hi> but wee were grappled by four Turkish-Renegadoes, formerly Christians, and violently brought into the <hi>Straights,</hi> unto <hi>Banco,</hi> where I now remaine Captive. When first I entred this paragan Sconce, more pregnable then <hi>Lillo,</hi> but far more strong and unsavory: The grim Sarazin, with a starch't <hi>Cales</hi> beard, which kept the Port, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

mee a man of action, declared to mee the value of my Ransome: and so sorted mee with Rogues, that boasted more of prioritie, as being Slaves, then the welch- <hi>Cadwalladers</hi> doe their pedegree. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of many old Soldiers, had many severall tones and accents, but all directed to one sence; That they were very unfortunate, having beene laid out Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues vpon so many dangerous executions, yet not to come off with Credit. This <hi>Aegyptian</hi> house of bondage had all the Canels taken up but one; unto which, when night drew on, a fellow, (whose left hand grasp't many Candles, I mistooke for the dutch-Lyon on a double Stiver) by the feeble glowing of a farthing Light did convey mee. Seaven (according to the number of the wise-Masters) were the inhabitants of this pestred Mansion; all save one was coucht between bisket-bags, or courser napery, which once were whitish themselves, though covered with night, tobaccho and darke linnen, durst not discover there no shirts; But as I dranke to them, each contracted his sheet unto a Mandilion: and received his drinke. The Captive soule that was up, and as yet uncased, had a Monumentall Beaver on, which I presume was free of his Company, for it was throughly crak't; a <hi>quondam</hi> haughtie and lofty Crowne it had, but now depressed into halfe the value, flat as a Couchant, and shone like one; fat and tydie it was, and in far better case then his Master; whose meager body did shew through the grate of his garment, like a Pypers Timbrell. Whether hee had breeches or coats on, I still remaine doubtfull, for they were so
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47239:41"/>
tattered, that his lower parts seemed a Satyre, and his upper part no lesse fearfull. The more I surveyed him, the more my wonder increased, how Creditors could sit on's skirts, for he had none; flie out he could not, for he had no wings, for his doublet went out but that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to borrow three pence, and returned with a sleevelesse errand: and no wonder, for it was but one only rag of gentile sarsenet, torne slashes, which Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically hung like Needles on a Load-stone; and when the bleching sluce of his neighbours Lungs chanc't to open; the fellow (had his shirt beene cleane) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med like a March-pane hang'd with Streamers. To conclude; This poore penitent doublet, drench't with teares that had wept out the eye-balls of his buttons, seemed to be a sufficient punish't thing, both for his Masters Sinnes and Debts. This fellow I lay withall, and lost nothing by him; but in the morning, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan keeper <hi>Renaldo</hi> placed me in a more pallated Roome; where I lay at as brave a hanging Ward, as the <hi>Germaines</hi> Fencer, in the memorable bed of the late suspended Footeman, each houre suspecting my suspected delivery.</p>

                     <l>I'm wholy metamorphosed of late.</l>
                     <l>Before I could not brooke to have a moate.</l>
                     <l>(So briske and spruce I was) upon my coate:</l>
                     <l>Now earths affections are to mee so moving,</l>
                     <l>As I am grown a very arrant sloving.</l>
                     <l>Besides, I feele a <hi>misery</hi> in store,</l>
                     <l>For I am far more sparing then before.</l>
                     <l>My care of thriving makes mee one of those.</l>
                     <l>Who ride their Gelding barefoote to save shoes.</l>
                     <l>Nor can I be disswaded from the same,</l>
                     <l>Till under mee I feele my <hi>Palfrey</hi> lame.</l>
                     <l>The smallest trifle makes mee discontent,</l>
                     <l>And with my <hi>houshold</hi> so impatient,</l>
                     <l>As all the day I chafe, I fume, I fret,</l>
                     <l>And for no cause at all my <hi>servants</hi> beat.</l>
                     <l>If any Neighbours doe lesle then become them,</l>
                     <l>I presently commence a suite upon them;</l>
                     <l>And for a <hi>Goose-gate</hi> (that I more may spite them)</l>
                     <l>Of trespass at next <hi>Sessions</hi> I'le indite them;</l>

                     </l>

                     <l>It's very rare to finde one among ten.</l>
                     <l>For <hi>Symonie</hi> is such a common sin,</l>

                     <l>To wipe my mouth, and doe as others doe;</l>

                     <l>More then all this although I know no sorrow</l>
                     <l>May of more basenesse his beginning borrow,</l>
                     <l>Then to lament, as many worldlings doe,</l>
                     <l>The sudden losse of eyther Oxe or Cow;</l>
                     <l>I'm grown so tender hearted as I'le crye,</l>

                     <l>For ev'ry nislle, and distracted run,</l>
                     <l>As if my State were utterly undun.</l>
                     <l>So as I'm grosly pointed at by some,</l>

                     <l>But roving here and there, as one forlorne,</l>
                     <l>I wish the morn were night, the night were morne.</l>
                     <l>Early before 't be light I fetch the Statute,</l>

                     <l>For I doe wish a famine but to see,</l>

                     <l>For either want of bread will disestate him,</l>

                     <l>Lest they should surfeit, which were hard to doe,</l>

                     <l>Any amongst them all the least good word:</l>
                     <l>So tart he was and eager of his tongue,</l>
                     <l>As he would seldom speak, but he would wrong</l>
                     <l>Some in their name, fame, honour, or esteem;</l>
                     <l>And this his use and custom still had been.</l>
                     <l>Besides, on <hi>Palmestrie</hi> he was affected,</l>

                     <l>And in each Village made himself exprest.</l>
                     <l>Where he pretended rules <hi>Political,</hi>

                     <l>The <hi>Master</hi> of these <hi>Apes,</hi> me thought, came in;</l>
                     <l>At whose approach, submissively they bow them,</l>
                     <l>While I observ'd what he would doe unto them.</l>
                     <l>For, unto me, as one incens'd hee seem'd,</l>
                     <l>As if these <hi>Apes</hi> his pleasure had contemn'd,</l>
                     <l>Or plai'd some tricks which he did much dislike,</l>
                     <l>And therefore shewd as if he meant to strike.</l>
                     <l>At last, me thought, his Countenance grew smooth,</l>
                     <l>As surging Ocean after Tempests doth,</l>
                     <l>Causing them to be singled one by one,</l>
                     <l>While he, erected on a marble stone,</l>
                     <l>Used these words, as he their Weale did tender,</l>
                     <l>Which I, 'twixt sleep and wake doe well remember.

                     <l>I could not brook <hi>Corrivals;</hi> yea my heart</l>
                     <l>Did swell with grief to see men of desert</l>
                     <l>Respected where I sojourn'd, for I fear'd</l>
                     <l>My fortunes should be raz'd, if theirs were rear'd.</l>

                     <l>Their studie was but how to broach division,</l>
                     <l>And gain them titles suiting their ambition.</l>
                     <l>Or else, I made a shew of love unto them;</l>
                     <l>And told them, this retirement would undo them;</l>

                     <l>Now if they chanc't to follow my advice,</l>
                     <l>My <hi>taske</hi> was still to crosse their enterprize</l>
                     <l>By undervaluing what they had effected,</l>
                     <l>That by the State they might be lesse respected.</l>
                     <l>Thus did my <hi>Honour</hi> take more true delight</l>
                     <l>In thwarting of some rising <hi>Favorite,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Whose blooming hopes were now to ripenesse growing,</l>

                     <l>But now, secure of these, my <hi>Coach</hi> I took,</l>
                     <l>Where I perus'd a little Table-book,</l>

                     <l>For such commodities as I did want,</l>
                     <l>And these my <hi>Honour</hi> hugg'd, these did I hant.</l>
                     <l>Having now got my purpose, straight I'de flee them,</l>

                     <l>My <hi>Honour</hi> was my <hi>Sanctuary</hi> made,</l>
                     <l>And by <hi>Protection</hi> all my debts were paid.</l>
                     <l>For if I grant <hi>Protection</hi> to another</l>
                     <l>To Conicatch, or to defeat his brother,</l>
