            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

can her <hi>Romulus</hi> fear to call her Wife, and as such keep her here?
No, shou'd he bring a greater force than that which made the ten
years Seige at <hi>Troy,</hi> here she shoud live and Reign, secure, and
better guarded then their <hi>Palladium:</hi> And for the other Ladies,
(in all but thirty, and most Attendants to <hi>Hersilia</hi>) they have all

I in civility bid 'em remove, where their own choice and love
has made 'em settle; besides it were impertinent and base for us to
quit the love which they themselves have given, and make a new

you charge me with, and call a Rape, <hi>Hersilia's</hi> self, whose every

            <byline>Spoken by <hi>Tarpeia.</hi>
            </byline>
            <l>FAir Ladies, pitty an unhappy Maid,</l>
            <l>By Fortune, and by faithless Love betray'd.</l>
            <l>Innocent once — I scarce knew how to sin,</l>
            <l>Till that unlucky Devil entring in,</l>
            <l>Did all my Honour, all my Faith undo:</l>
            <l>Love! like <hi>Ambition,</hi> makes us Rebels too:</l>
            <l>And of all Treasons, mine was most accurst;</l>
            <l>Rebelling 'gainst a King and Father first.</l>
            <l>A Sin, which Heav'n nor Man can e're forgive;</l>
            <l>Nor could I <hi>Act</hi> it with the face to live.</l>
            <l>My Dagger did my Honours cause redress;</l>
            <l>But oh! my blushing Ghost must needs confess,</l>
            <l>Had my young Charming Lover faithful been,</l>
            <l>I fear I'd dy'd with unrepented Sin.</l>
            <l>There's nothing can my Reputation save</l>
            <l>With all the True, the Loyal and the Brave;</l>
            <l>Not my Remorse, or Death, can expiate</l>
            <l>With them a Treason 'gainst the <hi>KING</hi> and State.</l>
            <l>Some Love-sick Maid perhaps, now I am gone,</l>
            <l>(Raging with Love, and by that Love undone;)</l>
            <l>May form some little <hi>Argument</hi> for me,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>T' excuse m'</hi> Ingratitude <hi>and</hi> Treachery.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Some of the Sparks too, that infect the</hi> Pit,</l>
            <l>(Whose Honesty is equal to their Wit,</l>
            <l>And think <hi>Rebellion</hi> but a petty Crime,</l>
            <l>Can turn to all sides Int'rest does incline,)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>May cry</hi> "I gad I think the Wench is wise;</l>
            <l>"Had it prov'd Lucky, twas, the way to rise.</l>

            <l>"Dull Loyalty, and the yoke of Sovereigns.</l>
            <l>"A Pox of Fathers, and Reproach to come;</l>
            <l>"She was the first and Noblest <hi>Whig</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
