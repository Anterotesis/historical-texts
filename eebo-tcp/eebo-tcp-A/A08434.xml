            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Haue presumed (Right honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) vpon these three reasons to present this vnworthy pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet vnto your honors courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous view, and fauourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. The first is from your own noble wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, for that you are, and are so thought, the onely <hi>Hector</hi> of <hi>Albion</hi>: and therfore most worthy to protect <hi>Hector.</hi> The second, for that it was the wil and desire of the Ghost, of the woful Ghost of <hi>Ilion</hi>: that in hir teares you might behold the sorrows of your owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey whensoeuer iniurious fates shoulde cause you miscarrie. The third and last is (my good Lord) mine owne priuate affection, wherein I haue long honoured you, and hauing no place to make it knowne, haue long desired to finde some opportunitie to shew the same. I hope
<pb facs="tcp:10703:3"/>
your Lordship will pardon me, for that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a most veniall offence. And if heerein I doe not honour your Lordship so much as you are worthy, and I earnestlie wish, yet please it you to fauour and pardon this first, and as time and yeares shall enable me with a more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced iudgement and knowledge, I will studie and endeuour that, which shal be more worthy your honours fauourable protection. Please it you accept, and I am graced, and my labour richly rewarded. I cease to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship further at this time, I vow my selfe to your Lordships seruice, and so most humbly take my leaue.</p>

            <l>When eares were deafe and eyes could see no light,</l>

            <l>Saue onely that they softly draw a breath)</l>
            <l>Did come a Ghost, a ghost most gastly crying,</l>
            <l>Helpe me to death that haue so long beene dying.</l>
            <l>With that he wakened and with feare beholding,</l>
            <l>Saw hir lament, her armes togither folding,</l>
            <l>A pale-wan thing, and yet with wounds fresh bleeding</l>
            <l>Sodden in teares, in teares that were exceeding.</l>
            <l>He much afright began to shrinke for feare,</l>
            <l>She bad him feare not, but my story heare,</l>
            <l>I am <hi>Troys</hi> ghost that now appeares to thee,</l>
            <l>And well I know that thou hast heard of me.</l>

            <l>For what I was (alas) each one knowes wel.</l>
            <l>I come to thee to craue thy gentle ayde,</l>
            <l>To further her that hath so long beene staide</l>
            <l>From blissefull rest: because I haue not told</l>

            <l>IT fel about that time of the yeare,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Phoebus</hi> with his beamis cieer,</l>
            <l>Looked on <hi>Tellus</hi> with a pleasant face</l>
            <l>Almost from the top of the highest place</l>
            <l>Of his stately throne, where he in pompe rideth,</l>
            <l>And through the heauens (as him list glideth,</l>
            <l>Carried on Palfreis, whose wondrous swift pace</l>
            <l>Circuit the Welkin in a daies space,</l>
            <l>So fast they wend and neuer tyre.</l>
            <l>It pleasd him now with his temperate fire,</l>
            <l>To put iuice and moysture soot</l>
            <l>Both in the branch and also in the root,</l>
            <l>And with the countnance of his beamis sheen,</l>
            <l>To make the trees and the grasse greene:</l>
            <l>In the month that hight Flower of the Spring,</l>
            <l>Wherein birds sweetly tune and sing,</l>
            <l>And flowers are the ground embellishing</l>
            <l>By reason of this looke blandishing,</l>
            <l>When fishes in the brookes are playing,</l>
            <l>It was in May when they go a maying.</l>
            <l>¬∂Once on a morning in this goodly tide.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Aurora</hi> in the brightnesse of hir pride</l>

            <l>That euery man by himselfe, or with his fere,</l>
            <l>She doth inuite to walke abroad,</l>
            <l>And with hir in the fields to make some aboad,</l>
            <l>I walked forth my selfe alone,</l>

            <l>Where trees by trees so nigh stood,</l>
            <l>And their leaues are so togither gone,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Sol</hi> doth scarsely his light showne</l>
            <l>To them that thorough there passe.</l>

            <l>That breathed svveetly through leaues whistling</l>
            <l>Where birds on the boughs do chirpe and sing,</l>
            <l>Where pleasant fountaines sweetly are flowing,</l>
            <l>And on whose banks flowers dainty are growing like to a little Paradise.</l>
            <l>*Now in this stound busie were mine eies,</l>

            <l>Into which lesse wise then hardy</l>

            <l>Speciallie if Age be sitting therevnto,</l>

            <l>And meagre blunesse sit in his place,</l>
            <l>Such God wot was this old womans face,</l>
            <l>Which time and care had well furrowed,</l>
            <l>

            <l>With bitter teares and inward greeuance,</l>

            <l>Inly to shew sparkes of gentilitie,</l>

            <l>And after some words of course passing,</l>
            <l>She askt me how I was thither comming.</l>
            <l>Sithens (qd she) with vs it is not vsuall:</l>
            <l>That passengers do amongst vs fall,</l>

            <l>As they seldome admitte vs any feres</l>
            <l>To make recourse or to or fro.</l>
            <l>But since it was thy fortune so,</l>
            <l>To find this cell which none could euer</l>
            <l>Espie before since I came hether,</l>
            <l>I hold it done by the diuine influence,</l>
            <l>And that thou wert led by some great prouidence,</l>
            <l>Only that I might make relatiowne,</l>
            <l>Vnto thee of my state vvholly and condisiowne,</l>
            <l>Of my cares all and calamitie,</l>
            <l>And why I liue in this cell solitarie.</l>
            <l>Wherefore if thou list in good discretion,</l>

            <l>The mountaines sweld and brought forth a mouse.</l>
            <l>But yet the giuer made the gift great,</l>
            <l>And me thought it was then a rich banquet,</l>
            <l>The author made the gift so pretious.</l>
            <l>For who would be at such a time curious,</l>
            <l>Or fill his mind with disdaine? but rather requite,</l>
            <l>For the Widdow gaue much that gaue but a mite,</l>
            <l>Gifts are great as they are taken.</l>
            <l>But now to hir talke hath she hir betaken,</l>
            <l>The breakefast is done ne might it long dure,</l>

            <l>And then with a countnance sad &amp; words mildly spoken</l>
            <l>With teares blended, she hath with me broken.</l>
            <l>It is (saith she) no wonder in the course of Fortune,</l>
            <l>Though she do not in one thing long continue,</l>
            <l>She is aye so full of alteration,</l>
            <l>Of ficklenesse and variation:</l>
            <l>She is so brittle and so mutable,</l>

            <l>Red mixt with white, pleasing in fauour.</l>
            <l>Gracing with my lookes both in hall and bowre,</l>

            <l>The politicke Citizens do so prouide,</l>
            <l>That the yonger Sonnes shall not stand in neede</l>
            <l>Of the elder, though they giue him the land</l>
            <l>That they buie in the country through their industrious hand,</l>
            <l>Only our Gentlemen keepe this order,</l>
            <l>Whereby doth rise this great disorder,</l>
            <l>That many Clownes do here become gentlemen,</l>
            <l>Who scrape, and scratch for their Sonnes, and then</l>
            <l>Send them forsooth to an Inne of Court,</l>
            <l>Where the sonne of a Gentleman hath report,</l>
            <l>When his father (goodman) will driue the plow,</l>
            <l>And his mother milke and serue the Sow,</l>
            <l>Thus doth the franklin in <hi>England</hi> rise,</l>
            <l>And the base-borne Brat doth the gentleman despise,</l>
            <l>By reason their fathers leaue them so poore,</l>
            <l>And that is his shame that I tolde thee of afore,</l>
            <l>*But marke now and thou shalt see euen by my sonne</l>
            <l>What this vile custome in <hi>England</hi> hath donne,</l>
            <l>But in other countries they seeme more wise,</l>
            <l>The Hog in his owne dunglies,</l>
            <l>They keepe the Pesant vnder and the <hi>Kerne,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They do so well of their kinde discerne.</l>
            <l>The Bore puts not on a veluet skin,</l>
            <l>Neither in silke is the Borin,</l>
            <l>They may grow rich, but they keepe theyr place.</l>
            <l>And this to <hi>Ireland</hi> is a great grace,</l>
            <l>Which though some call it vnciuill and rude</l>
            <l>Yet (they say) they are with this vertue indude,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Kerne</hi> low borne shal neuer come a floate,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:10703:30"/>He shall not step into a gentlemans coate,</l>
            <l>As God and nature make them base,</l>
            <l>So shall they keepe still in their place.</l>
            <l>But this now to <hi>Albion</hi> is high disgrace,</l>
            <l>For here the Clowne riseth and Gentilitie put downe,</l>
            <l>Only by olde custome and vnkind fashion,</l>
            <l>We do not with the <hi>Danes</hi> vphold gentilitie</l>
            <l>But with the <hi>Swishers</hi> we cut off their dignitie,</l>
            <l>As now but list and I shall thee tell.</l>
            <l>For after all this hap that now me befell,</l>
            <l>That my husband was dead and my louing sonne</l>
            <l>After my foefment was by law away don,</l>
            <l>Being now left in all this mesery,</l>
            <l>My sonne <hi>Medalgo</hi> went into another country,</l>
            <l>In which place for what should I tarry?</l>
            <l>He lou'd a yong-woman and did hir marry.</l>
            <l>By whom God blest him with children many,</l>
            <l>For blessings they be though wealth he had not any,</l>
            <l>And ofte it falleth that the poore,</l>
            <l>When rich go without haue children store,</l>
            <l>Who wisheth ofte wanteth, who cares not to haue</l>
            <l>Shall neuer neede of fortune to craue,</l>
            <l>She is so blind she cannot well see,</l>
            <l>She lets the wise vnprouided be,</l>
            <l>And giueth to fooles with a liberall hand,</l>
            <l>Fortune fauours fooles, a prouerb often scand,</l>
            <l>And too too true may a number say.</l>
            <l>But now is <hi>Medalgo</hi> at a weake stay,</l>
            <l>Wealth he hath none and charge doth arise,</l>
            <l>Wherefore he`s forst of force to deuise</l>
            <l>To maintaine his children, himselfe, and his wife,</l>
            <l>By taking vpon him a labourers life,</l>
            <l>Where with his neighbours he is called good man,</l>
            <l>Now lost is the title of a Gentleman,</l>
            <l>Se now the fruit of this faire blossome</l>
            <l>Se the end of this custome,</l>
            <l>Now pouerty so hath shadowed his name,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:10703:30"/>As men in true view cannot see the same,</l>
            <l>Alas the commons cannot giue men their due.</l>
            <l>They cal him maister that makes a faire show</l>
            <l>In riches &amp; wealth, they know no difference,</l>
            <l>But who hath most gold him doe they reuerence</l>
            <l>And this is the fruit of that custome fond,</l>
            <l>Which now is installed in this lond,</l>

            <l>Bicause sometimes she doth fauour shevv</l>
            <l>To yonger brothers, and for she doth aduance</l>
            <l>Men by the svvord and also by the launce,</l>
            <l>Speciallie those that are of noble spright,</l>
            <l>In whom there is by Natures light,</l>
            <l>A kind of Nobles raisd from the common sort,</l>

            <l>And yet stil aspiring to higher honour,</l>
            <l>And yet not rising but by the step of fauour</l>
            <l>Purchased by vvorth, vvinning mens harts,</l>

            <l>They call him <hi>ver,</hi> which as I haue heard say,</l>

            <l>(Alas my deere sonne alas my good child)</l>
            <l>But death hath bereaued him of his life,</l>
            <l>Vntimelie did the sister cut with hir knife</l>

            <l>By want that great worker of confusion</l>
            <l>To many braue minds in conclusion.</l>
            <l>For when a man that is well borne,</l>
            <l>I meane of linage whom nature doth adorne</l>
            <l>Eyther with Noblesse or Gentilitie,</l>

            <l>Chusing rather so to be slaine</l>
            <l>Then to liue in miserie.</l>
            <l>And yet (God knowes) it is of certaintie</l>
            <l>That little here at home is their estimation,</l>
            <l>Though they venter nere so for reputation.</l>
            <l>"Peac-nuslings so little esteeme of valiancie,</l>

            <l>That many to their ends vntimelie are brought.</l>
            <l>For now did <hi>Iunio</hi> asvvell aspire,</l>
            <l>As could <hi>Maximio</hi> thogh in wealth he was hyer.</l>
            <l>Yet must their minds be equal in desire,</l>

            <l>And <hi>Anima ex traduce</hi> some do hold.</l>

            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:10703:32"/>Then <hi>Maximio,</hi> why should his mind be any whit lesse?</l>
            <l>Or why should his thoughts be of more basenes?</l>
            <l>Why should not ambition in him dwel,</l>
            <l>Seing he was a Gentleman aswell</l>

            <l>Beare as worthie a mind as he that hath won</l>
            <l>The wealth from them al? Alas it is not golde</l>
            <l>That nobleth the mind, though the mind it vphold.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Paris</hi> was poore amongst the shepheards knowne,</l>

            <l>To him that is heire to a crowne,</l>
            <l>Yet wil the mind neuer be put downe.</l>
            <l>She obscures the worth, yet the mind she cannot quel,</l>

            <l>That she wil abate euen a courage stout,</l>
            <l>For want hath no place to put their vertues out,</l>
            <l>As they that haue gold which giues them a count'nance</l>
            <l>The want whereof must needs be greeuance</l>
            <l>To a good mind, to see meaner gifts preferd</l>

            <l>Who should in Nature be their staie.</l>
            <l>For what is it but their destruction,</l>
            <l>Meerely their bane and confusion,</l>

            <l>Men in these times by their riches rise.</l>
            <l>For who so hath wealth that man is wise,</l>
            <l>His words are respected with good aduertence,</l>
            <l>He speakes not a tittle wherein is not sapience,</l>
