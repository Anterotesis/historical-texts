            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Prince of Orange HIS SPEECH In Defence of the Proteſtant Religion.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen, and Fellow Soldiers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not a little ſatisfaction to me, That having an Army compos'd of ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nations ; I do notwithſtanding find them unanimouſly bent to maintain and proſecute, to the utmoſt, the Cauſe I have now undertaken. And though by ſeveral Declarations, I have (as I believe) ſufficiently ſatisfied both you, and all <hi>England,</hi> of the Sincerity, as well as the neceſſity of theſe my Actions and Deſigns. I ſhall not, however, think it unneceſſary, or ſuperfluous, briefly to repeat and Summ up ſome things which may ſerve you for ſatisfaction, as to matters paſt, as well as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for the Future.</p>
            <p>That <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> are the Two main Pillars, whereon all the Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> ſeem to depend, is to us rather the Envy than the Doubt of our Adverſaries now at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and lately of <hi>England,</hi> not only to weaken, but wholly to root out even the Name of <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> each Man's private Diurnal, as well as our publick Annals, do ſufficiently Teſtifie ; nor is that Breach made by the reſtleſs Malice of our Enemies (urg'd by a late Opportunity) in the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe Kingdoms, ſo effectually made up as to free us from the Suſpicion and Fear of a more dangerous Relapſe. What therefore remains, but that we apply ſuch Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as ſhall not only for the preſent Eaſe us, but for the future Secure us. Lenitives have, to our coſt, been too long thrown away on the Canker'd Hearts of our Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Enemies. God's Providence, not our Swords, proving the only Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Poyſon. The preſent Perſecution of the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is but as a Prologue to their intended Miſeries, had it not by Providence been timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: nor did the Laws and Liberties of the People of <hi>England,</hi> ſeem a ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their Hungery Zeal for the preſent, unleſs by Methods as Sophiſtical as their Doctrine, they might bind and ſecure them to Poſterity. We have ſeen the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Judges (thoſe betrayers of their Country,) the Oppreſſion of the Biſhops (thoſe Pillars of the Church,) the Abuſes of moſt of the great Offices (Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,) private Cabals, and publick Grievances; and all to promote a Faction as uneaſie, as contrary to all Moral Converſation. Let us therefore, <hi>Gentlemen and Fellow Soldiers,</hi> with Courage and Conſtancy, Oppoſe and Diſarm theſe common Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Peace of Chriſtendome. If our Adverſaries boaſt of <hi>French</hi> Supplies, and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Succours (while you are reſolv'd and united in your Hearts :) I value them not; I fear not the Strength of the <hi>One</hi> ; and, I thank God, can Laugh at the Malice of the <hi>Other.</hi> Let us vigorouſly Tread that Path, which <hi>God</hi> Almighty ſeems to have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly mark'd out for us. If there be any of you that either diſtruſt your own Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, or are diſſatisfied with the Cauſe you have undertaken, I freely give you Liberty and ſafe Conduct to your ſeveral Abodes. I will <hi>My Self,</hi> be both the Spectator and Rewarder of all your Actions; reſolving to be the Perſonal Example of your Courage and Reſolution I Exhort and Command you to be Dutiful and Obedient to your ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſpective Commanders To forbear, on pain, of Death, all Fraud or Pillages on the Citizens; and to be careful and vigilant in your reſpective Poſts; and, as I believe, you are ſufficiently ſatisfied with the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of our <hi>Cauſe</hi> ; ſo, by the help of <hi>God,</hi> (which I chiefly Exhort you conſtantly to Pray for) I doubt not of a happy and ſpeedy Succeſs, as in other places, ſo in <hi>London.</hi>
