            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

obteining of ſuch vertues as be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for al thoſe that couet to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the true and euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, beſides this ſo great a
profite, which proceedeth neceſſarily
out of this moſte laudable exerciſe,
weigh wel, good Chriſtian Reader,
what other fruites, graces, and ſtore of
ſpiritual treaſure doo aſſociate this
holy meditation. Tel me, I pray thee,
what thing more ſweeter, and of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſolation may any man deſire,
that hath not wholly loſt his taſte,
then to meditate, diſcourſe, and think
vpon the wordes, workes, examples,
and life of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte?
Of whom we finde<note n="a" place="margin">Sap. 8. d.</note> written, <hi>That his
conuerſation was without al ſournes, and his
companie had no encombrance, but ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation:</hi>
What time maye we deeme
<pb facs="tcp:9279:7"/>
better ſpent, then that which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
in ſuch profitable meditation?
what exerciſe can there be more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
or acceptable to Chriſte,
then this, wherin the ſoule is buſied,
in performing Mary Magdalen that
moſt woorthy penitent her function
&amp; office, who<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 10. g Aug. 1. de Trinit. init ca. 10. to. 3.</note> chuſed the beſt part,
in ſitting her downe at our Lordes
feete, and liſtning to his wordes. The
like did our Souerain Lady the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
virgin Mary,<note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 2. g</note> marking wel, and
reuoluing the ſame wordes in her
heart: What thing may ther be more
valable to gain mercy, grace, and the
familiaritie of Ieſus Chriſte? what
more ſoueraine remedie to come by
litle and litle to the contemplation of
his infinite maieſtie, then is attentiue
and ſerious meditation? Seing the
ſame our Lorde aſſureth vs him-ſelfe
therof,<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 10. b</note> ſaying: <hi>If anye enter in by me
he shal-be ſaued, and shal finde moſt ſweete fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</hi>
In fine, what thing may ther be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9279:7"/>
more eaſie or more pleaſant for al
ſortes of people, then is this holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation?
ſith in meditating the life
of Chriſte, we muſt needes meditate
withal the life of his bleſſed mother,
as alſo cal the Apoſtles and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
Saintes to minde, that liued and
conuerſed with him: yea, al the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Angels too, who greatly delight
in this kinde of exerciſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
no doubt, but fauour greatly al
thoſe that vſe it. In ſuch wiſe, as if
thou wert not to receaue any other
guerdon, nor to reap any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
by this ſo holy an exerciſe,
yet ought this onely thing to allure,
yea, conſtraine thee, to frequent and
practiſe it; to wit, the pleaſure and
ſweetnes which thy ſoule ſhal feele,
in contemplating ſo holy a life, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
his ſo abſolute and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
workes, in beholding with the
eyes of thy ſoule ſo beautful<note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 44. a Sap. 13. a Bern. initio Ser. 2. de Epiph.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
a Lord aboue al the ſonnes of

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9279:8"/>
What thing can be more ſweete,
then to conſider his moſt holy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours?
howe humble he was in his
conuerſation; howe affable in his
wordes; howe milde in his anſweres;
howe feruent in his preaching; how
ſeuere in reprehending vice; howe
zealous in procuring diuine honour;
howe patient in putting vp iniuries;
how diligent in ſeeking the ſauegard
of ſoules; howe ful of compaſsion, in
bewailing others annoyes; how cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in receauing ſinners; how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
in pardoning offenders; how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
in graunting that which was
required him; howe mightie in his
miracles; howe modeſt in his going;
howe temperate in his eating; howe
great a louer of pouertie; how prone
to paines; how frequent in watching
and praying; how gratious and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
towardes al men: he deſpiſed
none, although a ſinner; he ſhunned
none, were he ſick or a lepre; he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9279:8"/>
not the riche, ne draue the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
out of his companie; he fledd al
worldly honours, and was not careful
for temporal treaſure; he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to al; and to<note n="a" place="margin">Sic Paul 1. Cor. 2. d.</note> win al, conuerſed
with al. Briefly, he was ſo delectable,
ſo ſweete, and ſo amiable, as it is not
poſsible to finde, wiſh, ne yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
a more gratious, exact, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
life then his was. What is he
therfore that wil-be ſo ſenſeleſſe, and
of ſo corrupt a taſte, as wil not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
therwith, and feele a ſinguler

a life?</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, thinke not, that in
ſaying, that the meditation of Chriſt
his life is of ſo great importance, I
meane to exclude his paſsion and
death, neither yet his Reſnrrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and

the toiles he endured in his

blows, nailes, with al the other
tormentes; and amongſt ſo manye
branches of this moſt ſweet-ſmelling

By which wordes this holy

to be conſidered.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:9279:9"/>
Howbeit, foraſmuch as it is not
long agone, that being commaunded
by my ſuperiors, I made a ſmal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
that was publiſhed abroade, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the matter of the Paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were certaine inſtructions and

principal pointes therof, and in what

mine intent was in this Treatiſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to haue principally intreated of ſuch
other miſteries of this moſt holy life,

I afterwardes had perceaued, how to
write al that might be gathered
out of the holy Goſpels touching the

with my ſelfe to write onely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of his incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

            <p>This is the thing therfore, my dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
beloued brother, which I here
preſent vnto thee; to wit, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the miſteries of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide
Roſarie, whereof eche one, (as
was done in the other meditations of

and deuotion of this number, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that eche one may meditate them

            <p>But becauſe the pointes which I
noted in the other meditations of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9279:10"/>
ſacred Paſsion were no whitt ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and dilated, but onely a bare text
ſet downe of the matters that were
to be meditated vpon (the which was
done, ſuppoſing that eche one would
them-ſelues, according to their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
haue dilated and amplified the
ſame) vnderſtanding ſince, that if
ſome doo make this diſcourſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
yet, al for lack of capacitie doo
it not; for this cauſe haue I done mine
indeuour in this booke, to content
both th'one and th'other; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
my ſelfe, as S. Paule<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. b.</note> ſaith,
to be indebted both to the learned
and the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For the lerned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I haue thought good, after a text
wiſe, firſt to ſet downe that which
they maye meditate vpon in euerye
miſterie, leauing eche one to pauſe
therein, and to dilate the ſame, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their capacitie and deuotion:
nowe for the ignorant, that knowe
not howe to doo this, without ſome
<pb facs="tcp:9279:11"/>
further helpe, I haue ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
maner, how to interteine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-ſelues,
and to diſcourſe vpon eche point,
which ſoeuer they may thinke good
to meditate vpon; out of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of amplification they may gather
theſe commodities folowing.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, they ſhal better vnderſtand
the hiſtorye of that point, whereon
they purpoſe to meditate.</p>
            <p>2. They maye conceaue the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or example, which ſome-times
is intermedled for their iuſtruction.</p>
            <p>3. They maye learne, howe other-whiles
to aske our Sauiour ſuche
thinges, as the point whereon they
meditate, may moſt fitly miniſter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of; other-whiles to yeeld thanks
for ſuch graces and mercies as they
maye be put in minde to haue beene
done vnto them, and to this purpoſe
may they apply the vocal prayer ſet
downe at the end of euery miſterye.</p>
            <p>4. They maye with the reading of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9279:11"/>
theſe amplifications, helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-ſelues
to auoide the diſtractions and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of minde, which other-whiles,
yea, eftſons, happeth in time of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
            <p>5. The Apoſtrophes and familier
ſpeeches which I haue nowe and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
intermedled in this methode and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of dilatation, may ſerue to excite
and kindle deuotion, being weake or
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, as happeth many times to be.</p>
            <p>6. After they haue read more then
once the foreſaid maner of amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vpon eche point, they ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
them-ſelues ſo ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
as that of them-ſelues they
may eyther altogether, or in part, be
able to amplifie ſuch articles as they
are minded to meditate vpon; and
when they found nothing ſuggeſted
of their owne brayne and peculier
deuotion, yet maye the readinge of
theſe points that are here propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with their amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wel and
<pb facs="tcp:9279:12"/>
leiſurly conſidered, ſerue for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
meditation, whiles nothing els
were graunted them. And of theſe,
and ſuch like fruites which the
ſimple ſort may ſuck and gather out
of the fore-ſaide amplifications, the
learned may in like wiſe helpe them
ſelues ther-withal at ſome times, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
beſt ſhal like them; ſo that, aſ-wel to
th'one as th'other they ſhal not be
vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, this maner of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
and entertaining a mans
ſelfe vpon euerie article, may ſerue
for al ſortes of people; for who ſo
mindeth to diſcourſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the three
pointes of the miſterie, whereon he
meditateth, wel may he ſo doo; and
who fancied not to pauſe in eche
point ſo long time, may make choiſe
of that point that ſhalt beſt like him;
ſeruing his turne, if he thinke good,
with the meditating of one onely
point, and the amplification therof,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9279:12"/>
if he liſt; which he may right eaſilye
finde out, ſeing euerye point is ſo
plainly diſtinguiſhed a-part, as one
hangeth not of an-other, but ech one
is abſolute in his owne concluſion. I
thinke it good beſides, to aduertiſe
thee in this place, that the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which I haue geuen thee in the
6. 8. and 11. Chapters of, The exerciſe
of a Chriſtian life; as alſo thoſe adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that I ſet thee downe in the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
I wrote of the meditation of the
Paſsion, at the ende of the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
may greatly helpe thee to the better
meditating of theſe miſteries; al the
which documentes I here omitt for
breuitie ſake, referring thee onely to
the foreſaide places in the bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
eſpecified.</p>
            <p>Finally, I thinke it meete to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
thee, that for-ſomuch as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Roſarie it is ordeined
that tenn <hi>Aue Maries</hi> and one <hi>Pater noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
be recited vppon euery miſterie,
<pb facs="tcp:9279:13"/>
theſe maye be ſaide in three ſundrye
maners. The firſt is, to recite them
before thou enter into thy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The ſecond is, to ſay them in the
very time of meditation. The third
is, to ſaye them after a man hath fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
his meditation. And this laſt
way is, in mine opinion, the beſt, ſith
the ſoule doth commonly after me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
finde it ſelf more ſupple, and
better diſpoſed to praye with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and deuotion. Yet meane I not
hereby to make a lawe, but that eche
one may ſay them, at ſuch time as beſt
ſhal like them.</p>
            <p>Theſe particularities haue I thought
good to touche, minding thereby to
helpe nouices, and ſuch as are ſmallye
acquainted with this exerciſe, a labor
that I haue willingly laide my handss
to, aſ-wel, for that it was appointed
me by thoſe that haue authoritie to

through the great deuotion, and

aboundance of deuout teares. Thus
paſſed ſhe on her moſt holy life with
a moſt zealous deſire which ſhe had
