            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SERMON
PREACHED at the
SPITTAL,
UPON
Wednesday in EASTER-WEEK,
Anno Domini 1671.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Psalm cxii. 9.</bibl>
               <q>He hath dispersed, he hath given
to the poor; his righteousness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever, his horn shall
be exalted with honour.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S this whole Psalm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have a double
intent; one to describe
the proper affections and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64458:5"/>
of a truly religious or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man,<note place="margin">Vers. 1.</note> (of a man <hi>who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Lord, and delighteth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his commandments</hi>) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to declare the happiness of
such a mans state, consequent
upon those his affections and
actions, whether in way of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
result, or of gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
from God: so doth
this Verse particularly contain
both a good part of a pious
mans character, and some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
instances of his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The first words, <hi>(He hath
dispersed, he hath given to the
poor)</hi> express part of his chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;
the latter, <hi>(His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
endureth for ever, his horn
shall be exalted with honour)</hi> assign
instances of his felicity. So that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64458:5"/>
our Text hath two parts, one
affording us good information
concerning our Duty, the other
yielding great encouragement
to the performance thereof;
for we are obliged to follow
the pious mans practice, and
so doing we shall assuredly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of his condition. These
parts we shall in order prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
endeavouring (by Gods
assistance) somewhat to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the words themselves, to
confirm the truths couched in
them, and to inculcate the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which they imply.</p>
            <p>For the first part, <hi>He hath
dispersed, he hath given to the poor;</hi>
these words in general do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the liberal bounty and
mercy, which a pious man is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64458:6"/>
wont to exercise; doing which,
doth in good part constitute
him pious, and signally decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
him such; is a necessary
ingredient of his piety, and a
conspicuous mark thereof: but
particularly they insinuate
some things concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the matter, the manner,
and the object of those acts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath dispersed, he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
Those words being put
indefinitely, or without deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
what is dispersed and
given by him, may be supposed
to imply a kind of universality
in the matter of his Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;
that he bestoweth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he hath within compass of
his possession, or his power;
his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 33.</note> (the things which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64458:6"/>
he hath) and his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 41.</note> (the
things which he may) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the prescriptions of our
Lord in the Gospel. Every
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (I say) which he hath
in substance, or can do by his
endeavour, that may conduce
to the support of the life, or the
health, or the welfare in any
kind of his Neighbour, to the
succour or relief of his indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to the removal or easement
of his affliction; he may well
here be understood to disperse
and give: feeding the hungry,
cloathing the naked, visiting the
sick, entertaining the stranger,
ransoming the captive, easing
the oppressed, comforting the
sorrowful, assisting the weak,
instructing or advising the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64458:7"/>
together with all such
kinds or instances of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
may be conceived either
meant directly as the matter of
the good mans dispersing and
giving, or by just analogy of
reason reducible thereto: sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
alms, as the most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and obvious matter of
bounty, was ('tis probable)
especially intended, but thence
no manner of expressing it is
to be excluded; for the same
reasons which oblige us, the
same affections which dispose
us to bestow our money, or
deal our bread, will equally
bind and move us to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
our endeavour and advice
for the sustenance and comfort
of our poor Neighbour. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64458:7"/>
our discourse will
more expresly regard the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
matter, liberal communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our goods; but it
may be referred to all sorts of
Beneficence.</p>
            <p>Farther, the word <hi>dispersed</hi>
intimateth the nature of his
bounty, in exclusion of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
different from it. He <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perseth,</hi>
and is therefore not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious;
doth not hoard up
his goods, or keep them close
to himself for the gratifying his
covetous humour, or nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his pride, or pampering his
sensuality, but sendeth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
for the use and benefit
of others. He <hi>disperseth</hi> his
goods, and therefore also doth
not fling them away altogether,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64458:8"/>
as if he were angry with them,
or weary of them, as if he loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or despised them; but fairly
and softly, with good conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
he disposeth of them
here and there, as reason and
need do require. He <hi>disperseth</hi>
them <hi>to the poor,</hi> not dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them among vain or lewd
persons in wanton or wicked
profusions, in riotous excesses,
in idle divertisements, in expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
curiosities, in hazardous
gamings; in any such courses,
which swallow whole all that
a man hath, or do so cripple
him, that he becomes unable
to disperse any thing: Our
good man is to be understood
wisely provident,<note place="margin">

also) denotes the extent of the
pious mans bounty, that it is
very large and diffusive, and in
a manner unrestrained; that it
reacheth to many places, and
is with-held from no persons
within the verge of his power,
and opportunity to do good.

Now, he that soweth,
having chosen a good soil, and
a fit season, doth not regard
one particular spot, but throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all about so much as his
hand can hold, so far as the
strength of his arm doth carry.
It is likewise called <hi>watering,
(He that watereth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 25.</note> saith Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>shall be watered himself;</hi>)
which expression also seemeth
to import a plentiful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous
effusion of good,
dropping in showres upon dry
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64458:9"/>
and parched places; that is,
upon persons dry for want, or
parched with affliction: So
the good man doth not plant
his bounty in one small hole,
or spout it on one narrow spot,
but with an open hand dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
it, with an impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
distils it all about: he stints
it not to his own family or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
to his neighbours, or
friends, or benefactours; to
those of his own sect and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or of his humour and
disposition; to such as serve
him, or oblige him, or please
him; whom some private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
tyes, or some particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
endears him to; but
scatters it indifferently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confinedly

need it; toward meer strangers,
yea toward known enemies;
toward such who never did

These words denote the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

the principal object
thereof: He not only lendeth

to do so,<note place="margin">Qui diviti do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, petit.</note> is but a cleanly way of

               <hi>All
the brethren of the poor do hate
him, how much more do his friends

in vulgar practise; but the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man is more judicious,
more just, and more generous
in the placing of his favours;
he is courteous to purpose, he
is good to those who need: He,
as such, doth not make large

of our Lord, <hi>When thou makest

the lame, the blind, and thou shalt
be blessed; for they cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64458:12"/>
thee; thou shalt be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the resurrection of the just.</hi>
Thus the pious man giveth,
that is, with a free heart and
pure intention bestoweth his
goods on the indigent, without
designing any benefit, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for any requital to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
except from God, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
respect and love to
whom he doth it.</p>
            <p>It may be also material to
observe the form of speech here
used, in reference to the time:
<hi>He hath dispersed, and he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
or, <hi>he doth disperse, he doth
give,</hi> (for in the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
the past and present times
are not distinguished:) which
manner of speaking may seem
to intimate the reality, or the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64458:13"/>
certainty, and the constancy of
his practise in this kind; for
what is past or present, we are
infallibly secure of; and in
Morals, what one is said to have
done, or to do, is always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
according to habit, or
custom. It is not, <hi>He will
disperse, he will give;</hi> that were
no fit description of a good
man; to pretend, would be no
argument of piety; those words
might import uncertainty, and
delay in his practice: He that
saith, <hi>I will give,</hi> may be falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in his professions, may be
inconsistent with his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
may wilfully or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
let slip the due season of
performing it. Our good man
is not a <hi>Doson</hi> or <hi>Will-give,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64458:13"/>
(like that King of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
who got that name from often
signifying an intention of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
but never giving in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;)
he not only purposes
well, and promises fairly for
the future, but he hath effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done it, and perseveres do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it upon every fit occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He puts not his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
into tedious expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor puts him off with fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
excuses, saying to him,
(as it is in the <hi>Proverbs) Go

               <hi>and the morrow

relief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath dispersed</hi> and <hi>given,</hi>
while he lives, not reserving the
disposal of all at once, upon his
death, or by his last Will; that
unwilling Will, whereby men
would seem to give somewhat,
when they can keep nothing;
drawing to themselves those
commendations and thanks,
which are only due to their
Mortality; when as were they
immortal, they would never be
liberal: No; it is <hi>he hath freely

moving him,
(when bodily temper or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

with the practice of others;
when he may thereby promote

is constant and uniform,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64458:15"/>
being drawn from steady prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and guided by certain
rules; proceeding from reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, and good will
toward man; following the
clear dictates, and the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Laws of Conscience. Thus
hath the pious man <hi>dispersed,</hi>
and <hi>given to the poor;</hi> and let
thus much suffice for explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
reflection upon the first
words.</p>
            <p>The main drift and purport
of which, is to represent the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
exercising of bounty and
mercy, to be the necessary duty,
the ordinary practise, and the
proper character of a truly pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man; so that performing
such acts, is a good sign of true
piety; and omitting them, is a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64458:15"/>
certain argument of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
for the demonstration of
which points, and for exciting
us to a practice answerable, I
shall propound several Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
whereby the plain
reasonableness, the great
weight, the high worth and
excellency of this duty, together
with its strict connexion with
other principal duties of piety,
will appear. And first, I will
shew with what advantage the
Holy Scripture represents it to
us, or presses it upon us.</p>
            <p>1. We may consider,<note place="margin">I. Head of discourse.</note> that
there is no sort of duties, which
God hath more expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
or more earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated,
than these of bounty
and mercy toward our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64458:16"/>
whence evidently the
great moment of them, and
their high value in Gods esteem
may be inferred. Even in the
ancient Law, we may observe
very careful provisions made
for engaging men to works of
this kind, and the performance
of them is with huge life and
urgency prescribed: <hi>Thou shalt
not harden thy heart, nor shut thine
hand from thy poor brother.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut 15 7, 10.</note>—
<hi>Thou shalt open thine hand wide
unto thy brother, unto thy poor, and
to thy needy in thy land:</hi> so did
<hi>Moses,</hi> in Gods Name, with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
very significant and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical,
enjoin to the children
of <hi>Israel.</hi> The holy Prophets also
do commonly with an especial
heat and vigour press these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64458:16"/>
most smartly reproving
the transgression or neglect of
them; especially when they
reclaim men from their wicked
courses, urging them seriously
to return unto God and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they propose this practise
as a singular instance most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
of their conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
most apt to appease Gods
wrath, most effectual to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his favour.<note place="margin">Esay 1. 16, 17, 18.</note>

So also when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would declare what those
acts are, which render peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

him, and most effectual, he
thus expresseth his mind:<note place="margin">Isai. 58. 6, 7.</note>

not to deal thy bread to the hungry,

so great consideration and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was this sort of duties,

compassion and benignity did
God exact even from that hard-hearted
and worldly people,
who were so little capable of
the best rules, and had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
in comparison so
mean, toward performances of
this nature. The same we may
well conceive, under the more

amity, of ingenuity, of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
grace and goodness, in a

and greater obligation to be

indeed it is; for those precepts

that as in every kind that which
is most excellent doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
assume to it self the
name of the whole kind; so
among the parts of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
(which word is used to
comprehend all vertue and

bounty and mercy is peculiarly
called <hi>righteousness;</hi> so that <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>

and rewards promised
to righteous persons, hard to
discern, whether the general

which manners of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
do argue the eminent
dignity of these performances.</p>
            <p>3. We may also consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mark, that in those places of
Scripture, where the Divine
Law is abridged, and Religion
summ'd up into a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of main importance, these
duties constantly make a part:
so when the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi>
briefly reckons up those things,
which are best in the Law, and
chiefly required by God, the
whole Catalogue of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
but of three particulars,
<hi>Mercy</hi> comes in for one:<note place="margin">Micah 6. 8.</note> 
               <hi>He
hath shewed thee, O man,</hi> (saith
he) <hi>what is good, and what doth
the Lord require of thee, but to

to walk humbly with thy God?</hi>
Likewise of those (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
those) more substantial and
<hi>weighty things of Gods Law,</hi> the
neglect of which our Saviour
objecteth as an argument of
impiety, and a cause of wo, to
those pretending Zealots, this
is one:<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes
and Pharisees, Hypocrites; for ye
pay tythe of Mint and Cumin, and

him impart to him that hath none;
and he that hath meat, let him do
likewise.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> his Systeme
of Religion is this:<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Pure and
undefiled Religion before God and

(that is, to comfort and
relieve all distressed and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
persons) <hi>and to keep himself
unspotted from the world.</hi> St <hi>Paul</hi>
seems to be yet more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and close:<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Bear ye</hi> (saith

4. It is in like manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
that in the general
descriptions of piety and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the practise of these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is specified, as a grand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
of them. In this <hi>Psalm,</hi>
where such a description is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
it is almost the only
particular instance; and it is
not only mentioned, but reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in divers forms of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
In the 37 Psalm it is
affirmed, and repeated, that
<hi>The righteous sheweth mercy;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 37. 21, 26.</note> 
               <hi>he
sheweth mercy, and giveth; he
sheweth mercy, and lendeth.</hi> In
the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 'tis a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the vertuous woman,
<hi>whose price is far above rubies,</hi>
that,<note place="margin">Prov. 31. 20.</note> 
               <hi>She stretcheth out her hand
to the poor, yea, stretcheth forth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64458:23"/>
both her hands to the needy.</hi> And
in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> (which is especially
remarkable) the 18 Chapter,
where the principal things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
a pious man are, more
than once, professedly enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
this among a very few
other particulars is expressed,
and taketh up much room in
the accompt; of such a person
(who <hi>shall surely live and not die;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ez<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k. 18. 7, 16.</note>
that is, who certainly shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in Gods favour, and enjoy
the happy consequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
it is supposed, that he—
<hi>neither hath oppressed any, nor hath
withholden the pledge, nor hath spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by violence; but hath given his
bread to the hungry, and hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the naked with a garment;
and hath taken off his hand from
the poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64458:23"/>
5. Also in the particular Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
of good men, this sort
of practise is specially taken
notice of, and expressed in their
characters. In the story of our
Father <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 2.</note> his benignity
to strangers, and hospitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is remarkable among all
his deeds of goodness, being
propounded to us as a pattern
and encouragement to the like
practice. In this the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>Job</hi> did solace it self,<note place="margin">Job 29. 11, &amp;c.</note> as
in a solid assurance of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity:
<hi>I delivered the poor that
cryed, and the fatherless, and him
that had none to help him: The
blessing of him that was ready to
perish came upon me, and I caused
the widows heart to sing:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 30 25.</note> 
               <hi>I was
eyes to the blind, and feet I was to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64458:24"/>
the lame; I was a father to the
poor. Did not I weep for him
that was in trouble? was not my
soul grieved for the poor?</hi> Hence
also did the good Publican re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
himself to the favour
and approbation of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
saying,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Behold,</hi> Lord, <hi>half
of my goods I give to the poor;</hi>
hence did <hi>salvation come to his
house;</hi> hence he is proclaimed,
<hi>a son of</hi> Abraham. Of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
that good woman, who
was so gracious and precious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Disciples, this is the
commendation and character;
<hi>She was full of good works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 36.</note> 
               <hi>and
alms-deeds which she did;</hi> such
practise made her capable of
that favour, so great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
the being restored to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64458:24"/>
life;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chrys. in Gem. Orat. 55.</note> at least in St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s
judgment: <hi>The force of her alms,</hi>
saith he, <hi>did conquer the tyranny
of death. Cornelius</hi> also, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
person, who was, though
a <hi>Gentile,</hi> so acceptable to God,
and had so extraordinary graces
conferred on him, is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented:<note place="margin">Act. 10. 2.</note>
               <hi>He was a devout
man, and one that feared God, with
all his house, who gave much alms
to the people; and prayed to God
alway.</hi> We may add, that to
be hospitable (one branch of
these duties, and inferring the
rest) is reckoned a qualification
of those,<note place="margin">1 Tim 3. 2.</note> who are to be the
Guides and Patterns of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto others:<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 6.</note> And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
one fit to be promoted
to a widows office in the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64458:25"/>
is thus described:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Well reported
of for good works; if she have
brought up children, if she have
lodged strangers; if she have wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the saints feet; if she have
relieved the afflicted; if she have
diligently followed every good
work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. So near to the heart of
Piety doth the holy Scripture
lay the practise of these duties;
and no wonder; for it often
expresly declares Charity to be
the fulfilling of Gods Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 14.</note> as
the best expression of all our
duty toward God,<note place="margin">Rom. 13 9, 10.</note> (of faith in
him,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5.</note> love and reverence of
him) and as either formally
containing,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12.</note> or naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
all our duty toward our
Neighbour. And of charity,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64458:25"/>
works of bounty and mercy are
both the chief instances, and
the plainest signs: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all charity doth consist either
in mental desire, or in verbal
signification, or in effectual
performance of good to our
Neighbour, this last is the end,
the completion,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Greg. Nyss. in Mat. 5. 7.</note> and the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the rest. Good will is
indeed the root of charity; but
that lies under-ground, and out
of sight; nor can we conclude
its being or life without visible
fruits of beneficence: Good
words are at best but fair leaves
thereof, such as may (and too
often do) proceed from a weak
and barren disposition of mind;
but these <hi>good works</hi> are <hi>real
fruits,</hi> (so St. <hi>Pauls</hi> calls them;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64458:26"/>
               <hi>Let ours also,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 14.</note> saith he,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 28.</note>

uses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that they be not unfruitful</hi>)
which declare a true life, and
a good strength of charity in
the bearer of them: by them
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the sincerity</hi> (or
genuineness) <hi>of our charity is
proved;</hi> for as no man ever
doth impress a false stamp on
the finest metal, so costly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is seldom counterfeit: it
is to decline spending their
goods, or their pains, that men
forge and feign; pretending to
make up in wishing well, the
defect of doing so; and paying
words in stead of things: but
he that freely imparts what he
hath, or can do for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
good, needs no other
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64458:26"/>
argument to evince that he loves
in good earnest, nor can indeed
well use any other: for words,
if actions are wanting, seem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busive;
and if actions are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
they are superfluous; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St. <hi>John</hi> thus advises:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>My
little children, let us not love in
word, or in tongue,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>but
in work and in truth;</hi> to love in
<hi>work,</hi> and to love in <hi>truth,</hi> he
signifies to be the same thing;
and to pretend love in speech,
without practising it in deed,
he implies not allowable. And
St. <hi>James</hi> in way of comparison
says, That as faith without
works is dead, so love without
beneficence is useless:<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 16.</note> for, <hi>If a
brother or sister be naked, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of daily food, and one of you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64458:27"/>
say unto him, Depart in peace, be
you warmed and filled, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
ye give them not those
things which are needful to the
body, what doth it profit? even so
faith without works is dead.</hi> Cold
wishes of good, working no
real benefit to our Neighbour,
and a faint assent unto truth,
producing no constant obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God, are things near of
kin, and of like value; both
of little worth or use. Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then being the main point
of Religion, mercy and bounty
being the chief parts of charity,
well may these duties be placed
in so high a rank, according to
the divine Heraldry of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>7. To enforce which Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64458:27"/>
and that we may be
farther certified about the
weight and worth of these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we may consider, that to
the observance of them most
ample and excellent rewards
are assigned; that in return for
what we bestow on our poor
brethren,<note place="margin">Psal. 63. 3.</note> God hath promised
all sorts of the best mercies and
blessings to us. The best of all
good things (that which in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
opinion was better than
life it self) the fountain of all
blessings (Gods love, and favour
or mercy) is procured thereby,
or is annexed to it:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 7.</note> for <hi>God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

performed in obedience to Gods

to God;</hi> and the Apostle
to the Hebrews seconds him:
<hi>To do good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13 8.</note> saith he, <hi>and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
forget not, for with
such sacrifices God is well-pleased;</hi>
by these, all other works, and
all enjoyments are sanctified;
for,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 41.</note> 
               <hi>Give alms</hi> (saith our Lord)
<hi>of what you have, and behold all
things are pure unto you.</hi> Such
charitable persons are therefore
frequently pronounced blessed,
that is in effect enstated in a
confluence of all good things:
<hi>Blessed is he that considereth the
poor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 41. 1.</note> says the Psalmist; and,
<hi>He that hath a bountiful eye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 9.</note> 
               <hi>is

and,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed are the merciful,</hi> saith
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64458:30"/>
our Lord himself; so in gross
and generally; particularly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and in retail the greatest
blessings are expresly allotted to
this practise: prosperity in all
our affairs is promised thereto;
<hi>Thou</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) shalt surely
give thy poor brother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and thine
heart shall not be grieved, that thou
givest unto him, because that for
this thing the Lord thy God shall
bless thee in all thy works, and in
all that thou puttest thine hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>
Stability in a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ordinarily consequent
thereon; so the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>
implies, when advising King
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to these works,
he adds,<note place="margin">Dan 4 17.</note> 
               <hi>If it may be a lengthning
of thy tranquillity:</hi> deliverance
from evil incumbent, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in imminent danger, and
support in afflictions, are the
sure rewards thereof; so the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> assures us:<note place="margin">Psal. 41. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Blessed</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is he that considereth the poor,
the Lord will deliver him in time
of trouble; the Lord will preserve
him and keep him alive, and he
shall be blessed upon earth; and
thou wilt not deliver him into the
will of his enemies; the Lord will
strengthen him upon the bed of
languishing, thou wilt make all his
bed in his sickness.</hi> Security from
all want, is likewise a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

that giveth to the poor, shall not

another special reward; for,
<hi>The liberal soul shall be made fat;</hi>

the same Author gives us his
word for it: even of the good
things here below to those, who
for his sake in this, or any other
way,<note place="margin">Mat. 19 29.</note> do <hi>let go houses or lands,</hi> our
Lord promiseth the return of <hi>a

in value. So great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are annexed to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
even in relation to the
concernments of this transitory
life; but to them beside God
hath destinated rewards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more considerable
and pretious; spiritual and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
rewards, treasures of
heavenly wealth, crowns of
endless glory,<note place="margin">Luke 14 13.</note> the perfection of

punishments are designed,

of these duties; the worst
of miseries is their portion and

do forfeit Gods love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
they lose his blessing and

            <p>9. It is indeed most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
that at the final rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
when all mens actions
shall be strictly scann'd, and
justly sentenced according to
their true desert, a special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
will be had to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
or neglect of these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64458:33"/>
It is the bountiful and
merciful persons, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
Christ in his poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and brethren, who in that

at the right hand; and shall
hear the good Shepherds voice
uttering those joyful words,

               <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the
world: for I was an hungred,
and ye gave me meat; I was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and ye gave me drink; I was
a stranger, and ye took me in; I
was naked, and ye cloathed me; I
was sick, and ye visited me; I was
in prison, and ye came unto me:</hi>
He doth not say, because ye
have made goodly professions,
because you have been Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64458:34"/>
in your opinions, because
you have frequented religious
Exercises, (have prayed often
and long, have kept many Fasts,
and heard many Sermons) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have been staunch in
your conversations, because you
have been punctual in your

maintained a specious guise of

indeed he that will
come off well at that great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
must be responsible, and able
to yield a good accompt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to all those particulars)
but because you have been cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
benign and helpful to
persons in need and distress;
therefore blessed are you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
enter into the Kingdom of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64458:34"/>
glorious bliss prepared for such
persons: this proceeding more
than intimates, that in the
judgment of our Lord no sort
of vertue or good practise is to
be preferred before that of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
bounty, or rather that
in his esteem none is equal
thereto; so that if the Question
were put to him, which is one
of them to <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athan. Tom. 2.</note> (in <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
his works) Which is the
most eminent Vertue? Our
Lord would resolve it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
than is done by that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
affirming, That Merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the Queen of Vertues;
for that at the final accompt,
the examination chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon that; it is made
the special Touchstone of Piety,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64458:35"/>
and the peculiar ground of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
On the other side, those
who have been deficient in
these performances, (unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and unmerciful persons)
will at the last Trial appear to
be the wretched Goats on the
left hand, unto whom this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable

having pillaged, or cozened
their Neighbour; for having
committed Adultery or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or any other thing prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
that these unhappy men
are said to be formally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,
and finally condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that miserable doom, but
for having been unkind and
unmerciful to their poor bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
this at that high Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
will pass for a most enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
crime, for the capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
for this it is, that they
shall be cursed, and cast down
into a wretched consortship
with those malicious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless
Fiends, unto whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:64458:36"/>
Thus it appears how mighty
a stress God in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth lay upon these duties,
so peremptorily commanding
them, so vehemently pressing
them, so highly commending
them, so graciously by promises
alluring us to the performance,
so dreadfully by threatnings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring
us from the neglect of
them: what an affront then
will it be to Gods Authority,
what a distrust to his Word,
what a contempt of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
his Justice, his Wisdom,
what a despight to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Mercy, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all these Declarations
of his will and purposes, we
shall presume to be uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this kind? There are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64458:36"/>
also Considerations (very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
very clear, and very strong)
which discover the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
and equity of these
Laws, with our indispensable
obligation to obey them; the
which indeed with greater force
do exact these duties from us,
and do more earnestly plead in
the poor mans behalf, than he
can beg or cry. If we either
look up unto God, or down
upon our poor Neighbour; if
we reflect upon our selves, or
consider our wealth it self, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where we may discern vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reasons obliging us, and
various motives inducing us
to the practise of these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:64458:37"/>
In regard to God,</p>
            <p>1. We may consider,<note place="margin">II. Head of Discourse.</note> that
by exercising of bounty and
mercy, we are kind and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
to God himself; by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
those duties, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
and rude to him: for that
what of good or evil is by us
done to the poor, God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
and accepts as done to
himself. The poor have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
relation to God; he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and frequently professeth
himself their especial Friend,
Patron and Protector; he is
much concerned in, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
chargeth his Providence
with their support: in effect
therefore they shall surely be
provided for one way or other,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64458:37"/>

to us, he chuseth (if it
may be, we freely concurring
therein) and best liketh, that
it should be done by our hands;
this conducing no less to our
benefit, than to theirs; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
having opportunity to shew
our respect to himself, and to
lay an engagement on him to
do us good. God therefore
lendeth the poor man his own
Name, and alloweth him to
crave our succour for his sake;
(when the poor man asketh us
in Gods Name, or for Gods
sake, he doth not usurp or forge,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64458:38"/>
he hath good authority, and a
true ground for doing so) God
gives him credit from himself
unto us for what he wants, and
bids us charge what he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on his own accompt; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
us to reckon him obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thereby, and to write him
our debtor; engaging his own
word and reputation duly to
repay,<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 17.</note> fully to satisfie us: <hi>He
that hath pity on the poor, lendeth
to the Lord, and that which he
hath given, will he pay him again,</hi>
saith the Wise-man;<note place="margin">Mat 25. 40, 45.</note> and, <hi>In as
much as ye have done it to the least
of my brethren, ye have done it
unto me,</hi> saith our Saviour: and,
<hi>God is not unrighteous to forget
your work and labour of love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 10.</note>
               <hi>which ye have shewed toward his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64458:38"/>
Name, in that ye have ministred
to the saints, and do minister,</hi>
saith the Apostle. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we give to the poor, God
accepteth as an expression of
kindness to himself, being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to one of his friends and
clients, in respect to him; he
regards it as a testimony of
friendly confidence in him, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
that we have a good
opinion of him, that we take
him for able and willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
a good turn, that we dare
take his word, and think our
goods safe enough in his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
But if we stop our ears,
or shut our hands from the
poor, God interprets it as a
harsh repulse, and a heinous
affront put upon himself; we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64458:39"/>
doing it to one, who bears his
Name, and wears his Livery,
(for the poor mans rags are
badges of his relation unto
God) He thereby judges, that
we have little good will, little
respect, little compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
himself, since we vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
not to grant him so mean a
favour, since we refuse at his
request, and (as it were) in
his need, to accommodate him
with a small sum, he justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
it as an argument of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
diffidence in him, that
we have sorry thoughts of him,
deeming him no good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent,
little valuing his
word, suspecting his goodness,
his truth, or his sufficiency.</p>
            <p>2. We by practising those
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64458:39"/>
duties are just, by omitting
them are very unjust toward
God. For our goods, our
wealth, and our estate, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
none of them simply or
properly our own, so that we
have an absolute property in
them, or an entire disposal of
them: no, we are utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of such a right unto them,
or power over them; God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
is the true and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Proprietary of them. They
are called the gifts of God,<note place="margin">Eccles 5. 19. 6. 2.</note> but
we must not understand that
God by giving them to us, hath
parted with his own right to
them; they are deposited with us
in trust, not alienated from him;
they are committed to us as
Stewards, not transferred upon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64458:40"/>
us as Masters: they are so ours,
that we have no authority to
use them according to our will
or fancy, but are obliged to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them according to Gods
direction and order. He by
right immutable is Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
of all his Creation; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing unalienably belongs
to him, upon many accompts:
He out of nothing made all
things at first, and to every
Creature through each moment
a new being is conferr'd by his
preservative influence; origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
therefore he is Lord of all
things, and continually a new
Title of Dominion over every
thing springeth up unto him:
it is his always, because he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
maketh it. We our selves
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64458:40"/>
are naturally meer Slaves and
Vassals to him: as we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be our own, (Masters of
our selves, of our lives, of our
liberties) so cannot we ever
properly be owners of any
thing; there are no possible
means by which we can acquire
any absolute Title to the least
mite; the principal right to
what we seem to get, according
to all Law and Reason, accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to our Master. All things
about us, by which we live,
with which we work and trade;
the Earth which supports and
feeds us, and furnisheth us with
all commodities;<note place="margin">Psal. 24. 1.</note> the Air we
breathe,<note place="margin">50. 12.</note> the Sun and Stars
which cherish our life,<note place="margin">89. 11.</note> are all
of them his,<note place="margin">95. 5.</note> his Productions,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64458:41"/>
and his Possessions, subsisting
by his pleasure, subject to his

but from basely keeping,
or vainly embezilling them,
they become not our possession
and enjoyment, but our theft
and our bane. (These things,
spoken after the holy Fathers,
wise Instructors in matters of
piety, are to be understood with
reasonable temperament, and
practised with honest pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
I cannot stand to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discuss

a pious Charity will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily

            <p>3. Shewing bounty and
mercy are the most proper and
the principal expressions of our
gratitude unto God; so that
in omitting them, we are not
only very unjust, but highly
ingrateful. Innumerable are
the benefits, favours and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
(both common and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)
which God hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on us, and doth continually

all that we have, all that we can
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64458:45"/>
hope for of good, is alone from
his free bounty; our beings and
lives, with all the conveniencies
and comforts of them, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
owe to him as to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
our Preserver, our constant
Benefactor: all the excellent
priviledges we enjoy, and all
the glorious hopes we have as
Christians, we also stand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
for purely to his unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
mercy and grace; and,
<hi>What shall we render unto the
Lord for all his benefits toward
us?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 12.</note> Shall we render him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
shall we refuse him any
thing? shall we boggle at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
returns so inconsiderable,
in regard to what he hath done
for us? What is a little Gold, or
Silver, or Brass perhaps, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64458:45"/>
our poor Neighbour craveth of
us, in comparison to our life,
our health, our reason, to all
accommodations of our body,
and all endowments of our
mind? What are all the goods
in the world to the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, to the pardon of
our sins, to the gifts of Gods
Spirit, to the dignity of being
the children of God, and heirs
of salvation; to the being freed
from extream miseries, and
made capable of eternal felicity?
And doth not this unexpressible
goodness, do not all these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
benefits require some
correspondent thankfulness?
Are we not obliged, shall we
not be willing to exhibit some
real testimony thereof? And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64458:46"/>
what other can we exhibit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
this? We cannot directly
or immediately requite God,
for he cannot so receive any
thing from us; he is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being himself enriched
or exalted, of being any wise
pleasured or bettered by us,
who is in himself infinitely suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
glorious, joyful and
happy:<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 2.</note>

for the capacity of giving to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
for that we are in the
number of those who can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
relief, and who need not

and prosperous state should not
seem to us so contemptible
things, that we should be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to render somewhat back
in grateful resentment for them:
the very act of giving is it self
no mean benefit,<note place="margin">Nec enim he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </note> (having so
much of honor in it, so much of
pleasure going with it, so much
of reward following it) we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
far more than we return
in giving; for which therefore
it is fit, that we should return
our gratitude, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we should perform these
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64458:47"/>
duties: for indeed without this
practise, no other expression of
gratitude can be true in it self,
or can be acceptable unto God:
We may seem abundantly to
thank him in words, but a
sparing hand gives the lye to the
fullest mouth; we may spare
our breath, if we keep back our
substance; for all our praising
God for his goodness, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him with our lips, if we
will do nothing for him, if we
will not part with any thing
for his sake, appears meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
is in truth plain moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery,
and vile hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>4. Yea, which we may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consider, all our devotion
severed from a disposition of
practising these duties, is no less
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64458:47"/>
such; cannot have any true
worth in it, shall not yield any
good effect from it. Our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
if we are uncharitably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
what are they other than
demonstrations of egregious
impudence and folly? For how
can we with any face presume
to ask any thing from God,
when we deny him requesting
a small matter from us? How
can we with any reason expect
any mercy from him, when we
vouchsafe not to shew any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for his sake? Can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that God will hearken
unto, or mind our petitions,
when we are deaf to his entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and regardless of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires?
No; 'tis his declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

petitioners,<note place="margin">Isai. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>When you spread

you; when you make many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
I will not hear:</hi> No im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
no frequency of

a case; the needy mans cries
and complaints will drown
their noise; his sighs and groans
will obstruct their passage,<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 4.</note> and
stop the ears of God against
them. Likewise all our sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of repentance, all our
corporal abstinencies &amp; auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
if a kind and merciful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
are wanting, what are
they truly but presumptuous
dallyings, or impertinent tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flings
with God? For do we
not grosly collude with sin,
when we restrain the sensual
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64458:48"/>
appetites of the body, but fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the souls more unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
desires? when we curb
our wanton flesh, and give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
to a base spirit? Do we
not palpably baffle, when in
respect to God, we pretend to
deny our selves, yet upon ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occasion allow him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
Do we not strangely
prevaricate, when we would
seem to appease Gods anger,
and purchase his favour by our
submissions, yet refuse to do
that, which he declares most
pleasing to him, and most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to those purposes? It
is an ordinary thing for men
thus to serve God, and thus to
delude themselves:<note place="margin">

5. The conscionable practise
of these duties, doth plainly
spring from those good disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of mind, regarding God,
which are the original grounds
and fountains of all true piety;
and the neglect of them issueth
from those vitious dispositions,
which have a peculiar incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
with piety, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
thereof in the very
foundation and root. Faith
in God is the Fundamental
Grace, upon which Piety is
grounded; Love and fear of
God, are the Radical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
from which it grows; all
which as the charitable man
discovers in his practise, so they
are apparently banished from
the heart of the illiberal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
person.</p>

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64458:50"/>
As for Faith, the good man
in shewing bounty, exerciseth
the chief acts thereof; he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parteth with his goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he trusteth on Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
more than them; and
believeth God more ready to
help him, than any Creature
can do, in his need; because
he is perswaded, that God is
most good and benign, so as
never to suffer him to be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with want; because he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
God to be just and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

him for what he
giveth to his poor Neighbour,
will not fail to make good his
word; because he thinks God
abundantly solvent, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
never the poorer for laying
out in his behalf; because, in
short, he is content to live in
a dependence upon God, and
at his disposal. It is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Apostle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note>
as a special instance of a
resolute and constant faith in
the first Christians, that <hi>they
took joyfully the spoiling of their
goods, knowing in themselves, that
they had in heaven a better and an
enduring substance:</hi> he that not
forcibly by the violent rapacity
of others, but voluntarily by
his own free resignation for the

service of God, delivereth them
up with the same alacrity, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and hope, thereby demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
the same faith. But the

God: He must be either a meer

of God; or an Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,
in his heart denying Gods

in such a neglect or defiance of
God?) Or he must be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
profane, entertaining most
dishonourable and injurious
apprehensions of God: He
cannot but imagine God very
unkind, not only in neglecting
men that want his help, but
in making them to suffer for
spending upon his accompt;
very unjust, in not repaying
what he borrows; very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful,
in breaking his word;
very deceitful, in gulling us of
our things by fair promises of
restitution and requital: Or
he must apprehend God forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of what we do, and himself
says; or that he is needy and
impotent, not having where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64458:52"/>
to make satisfaction, not
being able to make good what
he pretends. He must in his
conceit debase God even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the vilest Creatures,
thinking a senseless lump of
clay more apt in his need to
help him, than God can be with
all his power and care; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his money safer in his own
Coffers, than in Gods hands;
and that Iron Bars will guard
it more surely, than divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
esteeming his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Bond for much better
security than Gods Word; and
that a mortal man is far more
able or more true, than the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Lord. He certainly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think one word true, that
God says, being loath to trust
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64458:53"/>
him for a peny, for a piece of
bread, or for an old garment;
all Gods promises of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and threatnings of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
he takes for idle fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
Heaven and Hell are
but <hi>Vtopia</hi>'s in his conceit; the
joys of one, offered to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
person, are but pleasant
fancies; the torments of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
denounced to the uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
but fearful dreams:
all other things are but names,
money and lands are the only
real things unto him: all the
happiness he can conceive or
wish, is contained in bags and
barns; these are the sole points
of his Faith, and objects of his
confidence.<note place="margin">Habac. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>He makes gold his
hope, and saith to the fine gold,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64458:53"/>
Thou art my confidence: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces
because his wealth is great,
and because his hand hath gotten
much,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 31. 34.</note> (as <hi>Job</hi> speaketh, disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that practise in himself, and
tacitly charging it on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
we speak of.) He doth in
fine affect a total independency
upon God, and cares to have
no dealing with him; he would
trust to himself, and live on his
own estate: so gross infidelity,
and horrible profaneness of
mind, lie couched under this
sort of vices.</p>
            <p>As for the love of God, the
liberal man declares it, in that
for Gods sake he is willing to
part with any thing; that he
values Gods love and favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other goods; that he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64458:54"/>
deems himself rich and happy
enough in the enjoyment of
God.<note place="margin">1 Joh 3. 17.</note> But, <hi>Who hath this worlds
goods, and seeth his brother have
need, and shutteth up his bowels
from him, how dwelleth the love
of God in him?</hi> saith St. <hi>John;</hi>
that is, it is impossible he should
love God; 'tis a vain conceit
to think he does; 'tis a frivolous
thing for him to pretend it; for
how possibly can he bear in his
heart any affection to God, who
will not for his sake, and at his
instance, part with a little
worthless trash, and dirty pelf?
who prizes so inconsiderable
matters beyond Gods favour
and friendship? who prefers the
keeping of his wealth, before
the enjoyment of God; and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64458:54"/>
chuses rather certainly to quit
his whole interest in God, than
to adventure a small parcel of
his estate with God? His pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
indeed sufficiently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that his hard and stupid
heart is uncapable of any love,
except of a corrupt, inordinate
and fond love, or dotage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
himself, since so present &amp;
sensible objects cannot affect
him:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> 
               <hi>He that loveth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whom he hath seen, how can he
love God whom he hath not seen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of God, the liberal man
expresses it in submission to
Gods commands, although
with his own present seeming
diminution and loss; in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the discharging of his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64458:55"/>
Conscience before the retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Money; in casting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-board
his temporal goods,
that he may secure his spiritual
and eternal concernments: He
can say (his practise attesting
to his profession) with <hi>David,
I love thy commandments above
gold;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119 127, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

is dearer to me than thousands of
gold and silver;</hi> he shews, that
he <hi>is a man of truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note> 
               <hi>fearing God,
and hating covetousness;</hi> which
dispositions, as having much
affinity and connexion, are well
joined together by <hi>Jethro.</hi> But
the uncharitable man can have
little fear of God before his
eyes; since the commands of
God have no efficacy on his
Conscience; since he dreads not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64458:55"/>
the effects of divine power and
justice, provoked by his diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
since he deems an
imaginary danger of want from
giving, worse than a certain
commission of sin in withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and is more afraid of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury
here, than of damnation
hereafter.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the covetous or
illiberal man is therefore unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being truly pious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his heart is possessed with
vain devotion toward some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
beside God, which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is his sole Divinity:<note place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note> he is
justly stiled an Idolater,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 5.</note> for that
he directs and employs the chief
affections of his mind upon an
Idol of Clay, which he loves
with all his heart and all his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64458:56"/>
soul, which he entirely confides
in, which he esteems and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
above all things. It is
Mammon, which of all the
Competitors and Antagonists
of God, invading Gods right,
and usurping his place,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 24.</note> is (as
our Lord intimates) the most
dangerous, and desperately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant:
where he becomes
predominant, true Religion is
quite excluded, <hi>Ye cannot serve
God and Mammon.</hi> Other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
inclinations combat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and often baffle it, but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
so vanquish it, as that a
man doth approve or applaud
himself in his miscarriages; but
the covetous humour seizeth on
our reason it self, and seateth it
self therein; inducing it to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64458:56"/>
and countenance what is
done amiss: the voluptuous
man is swayed by the violence
of his appetite, but the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
is seduced by the dictate of
his judgment; he therefore
scrapes and hoards, and lets go
nothing, because he esteems
wealth the best thing in the
world, and then judges himself
most wise, when he is most
base:<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Labour not to be rich,
cease from thine own wisdom,</hi> saith
<hi>Salomon;</hi> intimating the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
such persons are wont to
make of their riches: whence
of all dispositions opposite to
piety, this is the most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But farther,</p>
            <p>6. Let us consider; That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more conformable to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64458:57"/>
Gods nature, or renders us more
like to him, than beneficence
and mercy; and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
nothing can be more
grateful to him; that nothing
is more disagreeable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the essential disposition
of God, than illiberality and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulness,
and therefore that
nothing can be more distastful
to him. What is any being in
the world, but an efflux of his
bounty, and an argument of
his liberality? Look every

the whole tenour of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64458:58"/>
hath always been the common
apprehension of men, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of all times sheweth, in
that men have been ever apt to
place their Benefactors among
their Gods, deferring that love
and veneration unto them in
degree, which in perfection do
appertain to the supreme Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 35, 36.</note>
               <hi>Be merciful, as your
heavenly Father is merciful;</hi> so
our Saviour proposeth Gods
mercy to us, both as a pattern
directing, and as an argument
inducing us to mercifulness;
implying it also to be a good
sign declaring us the children
of God; the genuine off-spring
of the all-good and all-merciful
Father; yea, that it even ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and constitutes us such, (we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64458:59"/>
thereby coming most truly
to represent, and most nearly
to resemble him.) Our Lord
farther teaches us,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44, 45.</note> saying, <hi>Love
your enemies, bless them that
curse you, do good to those that
hate you—that you may be the
sons of your Father which is in
heaven.</hi> And they who thus
are Gods children, must conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be very dear to him,
and most gracious in his sight;
he cannot but greatly like and
love himself (the best of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
in them; he cannot but
cherish and treat them well,
who are the fairest and truest
images of himself; no specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
can be so pleasant to him,
as to see us in our practise to
act himself, doing good to one

another;<note place="margin">Colos. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>as the elect of God,

of mind, meekness, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering;
forbearing one another,

as Christ forgave us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 1, 2.</note> being <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of God as dear children, and

side, there is not in Nature any
thing so remotely distant from
God, or so extreamly opposite
to him, as a greedy and griping
Niggard; Hell is scarce so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Heaven, as such a mans
disposition to the nature of
God; for 'tis <hi>goodness</hi> which
sits gloriously triumphant at
the top of Heaven; and <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness</hi>
lieth miserably gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64458:60"/>
under the bottom of
Hell: Heaven descends from
the one, as its principal cause;
Hell is built on the other, as its
main foundation: as the one
approximates the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to God, and beatifies them;
so the other removeth the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Fiends to such a distance
from God and happiness: not
to wish, not to do any good, is
that which renders them both
so bad, and so wretched; and
whoever in his conditions is so
like to them, and in his practise
so agrees with them, cannot
but also be very odious to God,
and extreamly unhappy; God
cannot but abhor so base a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
from his likeness in
those, who by nature are his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64458:60"/>
children, and should be farther
such according to his gracious
design; neither can any thing
more offend his eyes, than see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to use one another
unkindly: so that if obtaining
the certain favour of the great
God, with all the benefits at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it, seem considerable to
us; or if we think it adviseable
to shun his displeasure, with its
sad effects; it concerns us to
practise these duties. So I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that sort of Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
enforcing these duties,
which more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
God.</p>
            <p>Farther,<note place="margin">III. Head of Discourse.</note> before we deny our
relief to our poor Neighbour,
let us with the eyes of our mind
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64458:61"/>
look on him, and attentively
consider who he is; what he
is in himself, and what he is in
relation unto us.</p>
            <p>1. He whose need craves
our bounty, whose misery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
our mercy, what is he?
He is not truly so mean and
sorry a thing, as the disguise
of misfortune, under which he
appears, doth represent him.
He who looks so deformedly
and dismally, who to outward
sight is so ill bestead, and so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
accoustred, hath latent
in him much of admirable
beauty and glory; he within
himself containeth a nature ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
excellent; an immortal soul,
and an intelligent mind, by
which he nearly resembleth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64458:61"/>
God himself, and is compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Angels; he invisibly is
owner of endowments, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
him capable of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and best things: What are
Money and Lands? what are
Silk and fine Linen? what are
Horses and Hounds in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
to Reason, to Wisdom, to
Vertue, to Religion, which he
hath, or (in despight of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune)
he may have, if he
please? He whom you behold
so dejectedly sneaking, in so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
a garb, so destitute of all
convenience and comfort, (ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the dust, naked or clad
with rags, meagre with hunger
or pain) he comes of a most
high and heavenly extraction;
he was born a Prince, the Son
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64458:62"/>
of the greatest King Eternal; he
can truly call the Sovereign
Lord of all the World his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
having derived his soul
from the mouth, having had
his body formed by the hands
of God himself:<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 2.</note> (in this, <hi>The rich
and poor,</hi> as the Wise-man saith,
<hi>do meet together; the Lord is the
Maker of them all.</hi>) That same
forlorn Wretch, whom we are
so apt to despise and trample
upon,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> was framed and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Lord of the visible World;
had all the goodly brightnesses
of Heaven, and all the costly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures
of Earth created to serve
him:<note place="margin">Psal. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> (<hi>Thou madest him,</hi> saith the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> of man) <hi>to have dominion
over the works of thine hands; thou
hast put all things under his feet:</hi>)
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64458:62"/>
Yea, he was made an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of Paradise, and Possessour
of felicities superlative; had
immortal life, and endless joy
in his hand; did enjoy the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
favour and friendship of
the most High: such in worth
of Nature, and nobleness of
Birth he is, as a man; and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more considerable he is, as a
Christian: for as vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
as he looks, God hath
so regarded and prized him, as
for his sake to descend from
Heaven, to cloath himself with
flesh, to assume the form of a
servant; for his good to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and undergo the greatest
inconveniencies, infirmities,
wants and disgraces; the most
grievous troubles, and most
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64458:63"/>
sharp pains incident to mortal
nature; God hath adopted him
to be his Child; the Son of
God hath deigned to call him
Brother; he is a Member of
Christ, a Temple of the Holy
Ghost, a free Denizon of the
heavenly City; an Heir of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and Candidate of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory; the greatest and
richest Personage is not capable
of better priviledges, than God
hath granted him, or of higher
preferments, than God hath
designed him to: He equally
with the mightiest Prince is the
object of Gods especial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Grace, of his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
regard and care, of his
fatherly love and affection; who,
as good <hi>Elihu</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Job 34. 19.</note> 
               <hi>accepteth not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64458:63"/>
the persons of Princes, nor regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the rich more than the poor;
for they are all the work of his
hands.</hi> In fine, this poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whom thou seest, is a man,
and a Christian, thine equal,
whoever thou art, in nature,
and thy peer in condition; I
say not in the uncertain and
unstable gifts of fortune, not
in this worldly state, which is
very inconsiderable; but in
gifts vastly more pretious, in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to an estate infinitely more
rich and excellent: yea, if thou
art vain and proud, he sober
and humble, he is thy better, in
true dignity much to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before thee, far in real
wealth surpassing thee:<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 6.</note> for, <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the poor that walketh in his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64458:64"/>
uprightness, than he that is perverse
in his ways, though he be rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That distinction, which
thou standest upon, and which
seemeth so vast between thy
poor Neighbour and thee, what
is it? whence did it come?
whither tends it? It is not
any wise natural, or according
to primitive design: for as all
men are in faculties and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of nature equal, so
were they all originally equal
in condition, all wealthy and
happy, all constituted in a most
prosperous and plentiful estate;
all things at first were promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously
exposed to the use and
enjoyment of all; every one

by Gods Providence, that
as some mens industry and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
might be exercised by
their poverty, so other men by
their wealth should have abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of practising justice and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
that so both rich and poor
might thence become capable
of recompences, suitable to the

God also by this order of things
designs, that a charitable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
should be maintained
among men, mutually pleasant
and beneficial; the rich kindly
obliging the poor, and the
poor gratefully serving the rich.
Wherefore by neglecting these

to consider, that a poor man,

and that poverty it
self is no such contemptible
thing as we may be prone to
imagine: there are Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which may qualifie
Poverty even to dispute the place

is, that every one of us doth

how pretious soever, to any of

should establish a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

us, both in point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and of estate: for since
all things considerable are
common unto us, since we are
all purchased and purified by
the same precious blood, since
we all partake of the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
faith, of the same high
calling, of the same honourable
priviledges, of the same glorious
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64458:72"/>

all have the same Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
why should these secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

(I say not in worldly state,
or outward appearance, such

our opinion and affection ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
that slight distinction
of <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> in concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
temporal? How can
we slight so noble, so great a
Personage as a Christian, for
wanting a little dross? How
can we deem our selves much

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:64458:73"/>
which is not worth speaking or
thinking of, in comparison to
what he enjoyeth? Our Lord
himself is not ashamed to call
the least among us his Brother,
and his Friend; and shall we
then disdain to yield to such an
one the regard, and treatment
suitable to such a Quality? Shall
we not honour any Brother of
our Lord? shall we not be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and kind to any Friend of
his? If we do not, how can
we pretend to bear any true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
or affection unto himself?
It is his express precept, that the
greatest among us should,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 26.</note> in
imitation of his most humble
and charitable Self, be ready to
serve the meanest;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 10.</note> and,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 3.</note> that we
should <hi>in honour prefer one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

and <hi>in lowliness of mind
esteem others better than our selves,</hi>
are Apostolical Rules, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indifferently to rich and
poor, which are plainly viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by disregarding the poor.
Yea, this relation should, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to St. <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine,
dispose us not only freely to
impart these temporal goods,
but even, if occasion be, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to expose our very lives
for our brethren:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Hereby,</hi> saith
he, <hi>we perceive the love of God,
because he laid down his life for
us; and we ought to lay down our
lives for our brethren.</hi> How
greatly then are they deficient
from their duty, how little in

are unwilling to part with the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64458:74"/>
very superfluities and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their fortune for the
relief of a poor Christian? Thus
considering our Brother may
breed in us charitable disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
toward him, and induce
us to the practise of these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">IV. Head of Discourse.</note> if we reflect upon
our selves, and consider either
our nature, or our state here,
we cannot but observe many
strong engagements to the same

frame and temper of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
directeth and inclineth
us thereto; whence by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

perfectly men; by the contrary
practise we rebel against the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64458:76"/>
Laws, and pervert the due
course of our Nature; we do
weaken, corrupt and stifle that
which is best in us; we harden
and stupifie our souls; so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
degenerating from the
perfection of our kind, and
becoming rather like savage
beasts, than sociable men; yea,
somewhat worse perhaps than
many beasts; for commonly
bruits will combine to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
of one another; they will
defend and help those of the
same kind.</p>
            <p>2. And if the sensitive part
within us doth suggest so much,
the rational dictates more unto
us; that heavenly faculty, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
capacities so wide, and so
mighty energies; was surely not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64458:76"/>
created to serve mean or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
designs; it was not given
us to scrape eternally in earth,
or to amass heaps of clay for
private enjoyment; for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of one puny creature, for
the sustenance or satisfaction of
a single carcase: 'tis much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
an intelligent person to
weary himself with servile toils,
to distract his mind with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cares for concernments so
low and scanty; but to regard
and pursue the common good
of men; to dispense advise and
aid, where needs requires; to
diffuse its vertue all about in
beneficial effects; these are O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
worthy of Reason,
these are Imployments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to the native excellency
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64458:77"/>
of that Divine Power implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in us; such performances
declare indeed what a man is,
whence he sprang, and whither
he tends.</p>
            <p>3. Farther, examining our
selves, we may also observe,
that we are in reality, what our
poor Neighbour appears to be,
in many respects no less indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and impotent than he: we
no less, yea far more, for our
subsistance depend upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
bounty of another, than
he seemeth to relie upon ours.
We as desectible creatures do
continually want support; we
as grievous sinners do always
need mercy; every moment we
are contracting huge debts, far
beyond our ability to discharge;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64458:77"/>
debts of gratitude for benefits
received, debts of guilt for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
committed; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perpetually stand obliged
to be craving for mercy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
at the Gates of Heaven. We
all, from Prince to Peasant, live
meerly upon alms, and are most
really in condition Beggars: to
<hi>to pray always,</hi> is a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on us from the condition
of our nature, as well as by
the command of God. Such
a likeness in state should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dispose us to succour our
fellows,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz.</note> and <gap reason="foreign">

them which suffer adversity, as

credit they yield consists in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their Master ridiculous
to wise men, and infamous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all men: but, putting
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase that any should be so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64458:88"/>
as to respect us meerly for
seeming rich, why should we
accommodate our practise to
their vain opinion, or be base
our selves because others are
not wise? But however, (may
he say again) it is a pleasant
thing to see them; a heap of
Gold is the most lovely specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that one can behold; it
does a mans heart good to view
an abundance of good things
about him; for this plea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he hath a good Author;
this it should seem was all the
benefit the Wise-man observed
in them, accruing to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:<note place="margin">Eccles. 5 11.</note>
               <hi>What good,</hi> saith he, <hi>is
there to the owners thereof, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the beholding of them with
their eyes?</hi> But if this be all
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64458:89"/>
they are good for, it is, one
would think, a very slim bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
they afford, little able to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
the pain and care requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the acquist and custody
of them; a benefit indeed not
proper to the possessour, for
any one may look on them as
well as he, or on the like; any
one at pleasure may enjoy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sights; all the Riches and
Ornaments of Nature, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
splendours of Heaven, and
the sweet beauties of the Field,
are exposed to common view;
the choicest Magnificencies and
Gallantries of the World, do
studiously present themselves to
every mans eye; these in part
every man truly may appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to himself; and by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64458:89"/>
any man can as well
take all that he sees for his own,
as the tenacious Miser doth
fancy his dear pelf to be his.</p>
            <p>But mine Heir (perhaps
he will farther say) will thank
me, will praise me, will bless
me for my great care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
If he doth, what is
that to thee? Nothing of that
will concern thee, or can reach
thee; thou shalt not hear what
he says, or feel any good from
what he does: And most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
thou art mistaken in thy
opinion concerning him; as
thou <hi>knowest not who</hi> he shall be,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 6.</note>
               <hi>that shall gather all thou heapest
up,</hi> or <hi>shall rule over all thy labour,
(whither he shall be a wise man or
a fool,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 2. 19.</note> a kinsman or a stranger,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64458:90"/>
a friend or a foe) so thou canst
as little guess what he will
think or say: If he hath wit,
he may sweetly laugh at thee
for thy fond wisdom; if he hath
none, his commendations will
little adorn thy memory; he
will to thy disgrace spend what
thou leavest, as vainly, as thou
didst get or keep it. But (this
to be sure he will in the end say
for himself) Money is a good
reserve against necessary occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or bad times, that may
come; against the time of old
age, of sickness, of adversity;
'tis the surest friend a man can
have in such cases, which, when
all fails, will be ready to help
him:<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The rich mans Wealth is
his strong City,</hi> the Wise-man
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64458:90"/>
he thinks never spake more
wisely; he therefore will not
dismantle this fortress, but will
keep it well stored, letting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his wealth lie dead and
useless by him: but (to let pass
now the prophane infidelity of
this plea, excluding all hope in
God, and substituting our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in the room of his)
what a folly is it, thus to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
evil, and to create to our
selves a present adversity from
a suspicion of one future; to
pinch our selves now, lest we
should suffer hereafter; to pine
to day, because we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it possible that we may
starve to morrow; to forego
certain occasions of enjoying
our goods, for that perchance
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64458:91"/>
the like occasions may happen
one day, we know not when;
not to use things now, when
reason bids us, because they
may be useful at another time?
Not considering also, that many
intervenient accidents, more
probably than a moderate and
handsom use of our Wealth,
may crop the excrescencies
thereof.</p>
            <p>2. But setting aside these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
excuses of penuriousness,
we may consider, that seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the good use of them in
beneficence, Riches are very
impertinent, very cumbersom,
very dangerous, very mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
things; either superfluous
toys, or troublesome clogs, or
treacherous snares, or rather all
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64458:91"/>
these in combination, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of trouble, sorrow, and
sin. A small pittance will, and
must suffice to all reasonable
purposes, to satisfie our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
to procure conveniencies,
to yield innocent delight and
ease: our nature doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
nor cannot bear much:
(<hi>Take heed and beware of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 15.</note> saith our Lord, <hi>for a

of the things which he
possesseth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim 6 8.</note> that is, a man may
live well without it) all the
rest, setting beneficence apart,
can only serve vanity or vice,
will make us really fools or

which drown men into destruction
and perdition.</hi>) They puff up
our minds with vain and false
conceits; making us, as if we
were in a dream or frenzy, to
take our selves for other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
more great, more wise,
more good, more happy than
we are: for constantly, as the
Wise-man observed,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The rich

and <hi>Agur</hi> thus intimates in his

up our thoughts, our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
our endeavours, our
time and leisure; possessing
our hearts with a doting love
unto them,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> (excluding other

about them,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 22.</note> (choaking other

all our life with business about
them,<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 41.</note> (inconsistent with due
attention to our other more
weighty and necessary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
filling our heads with
suspicions,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 4.</note> and fears,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 10.</note> piercing
our hearts with troubles and
sorrows; they immerse our
souls in all the follies of pride,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64458:93"/>
in all the filths of luxury,<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 5.</note> in all
the mischiefs emergent from
sloth and stupidity;<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 19</note> they are
<hi>the root of all evils</hi> unto us,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 10.</note> and
the greatest obstructions of our
true happiness,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 23, 24.</note> rendring Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
almost impossible, and
Heaven in a manner inaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us: so that to be rich,
(if severed from a sober mind,
and a free heart) is a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and the source of many
grievous distempers both of
body and mind; from which
we cannot otherwise, well
otherwise, secure or rescue our
selves, than by liberally spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in works of bounty
and mercy: so shall we ease
our selves of the burthens, so
shall we elude the temptations,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64458:93"/>
so shall we abandon the vices,
and so shall we escape all the
sad mischiefs incident to them:
Thus to use wealth, shall turn
it into a convenience, and an
ornament of our lives, into a
considerable blessing, and a
ground of much comfort to us.
Excluding this use of wealth,
or abstracting a capacity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good therewith, nothing is
more pitiful and despicable than
it; it is but like the load, or
the trappings of an Ass; a wise
man on that condition would
not chuse it, or endure to be
pestered with it; but would
serve it, as those Philosophers
did, who flung it away, that
it might not disturb their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations:
'tis the power it
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64458:94"/>
affords of benefiting men,
which only can season, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
it to the relish of such a
person; otherwise it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, which the Wise-man
affirms,<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Better is a little with
the fear of the Lord, than great
treasure, and trouble therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Again, we may consider,
that to dispense our Wealth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
is the best way to preserve
it, and to continue Masters
thereof; what we give, is not
thrown away, but saved from
danger; while we detain it at
home, (as it seems to us) it
really is abroad, and at adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
it is out at Sea, sailing
perilously in storms, near rocks
and shelves, among Pirates;
nor can it ever be safe, till it is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64458:94"/>
brought into this port, or ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this way; when we have
bestowed it on the poor, then
have we lodged it in unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
safety; in a place where
no rapine, no deceit, no mishap,
no corruption can ever by any
means come at it. All our
Doors and Bars, all our Forces
and Guards, all the circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and vigilancy we can
use, are no defence or security
at all in comparison to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposal
thereof: The poor man's
stomach is a Granary for our
Corn, which never can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted;
the poor man's back
is a Wardrobe for our Clothes,
which never can be pillaged;
the poor man's Pocket is a
Bank for our Money, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64458:95"/>
never can disappoint or deceive
us; all the rich Traders in the
World may decay and break,
but the Poor can never fail, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
God himself turn Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;
for what we give to the
poor, we deliver and entrust in
his hands, out of which no
force can wring it, no craft can
filch it; it is laid up in Heaven,
whither no thief can climb,
where no moth or rust do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide.
In despite of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
of all the might, of all the
malice in the world, the liberal
man will ever be rich; for
God's Providence is his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
God's Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are his Defence; God's Love
and Favour are his Reward;
God's Word is his Assurance;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64458:95"/>
who hath said it,<note place="margin">Prov. 28 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that <hi>He which
giveth to the poor, shall not lack:</hi>
no vicissitude therefore of things
can surprize him, or find him
unfurnished; no disaster can
impoverish him, no adversity
can overwhelm him; he hath
a certain reserve against all
times and occasions: He that
<hi>deviseth liberal things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 32. 8.</note> 
               <hi>by liberal
things shall be stand,</hi> (saith the
Prophet.) But on the other
hand, being niggardly is the
likeliest course we can take to
lose our Wealth and Estate; we
thereby expose them to danger,
and leave them defenceless; we
subject them to the envious eye,
to the slanderous tongue, to the
ravenous and insidious hand;
we deprive them of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64458:96"/>
which if it be away,
<hi>The watch-man waketh but in
vain:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 127. 1.</note> We provoke God irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
to take it from us,
as he did the Talent from that
unprofitable servant, who did
not use it well. We do indeed
thereby yield God just cause of
war, and enmity against us;
which being, <hi>Omnia dat qui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta
negat;</hi> we do forfeit all to
Divine Justice, by denying that
portion which belongs to him,
and which he claims. Can we
hope to live in quiet possession
of any thing, if we refuse to
pay our due Tributes and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes
imposed upon us by our
Almighty Sovereign; if we live
in such rebellion against his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
such violation of his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64458:96"/>
right, such diffidence to his
Word?<note place="margin">Prov. 11. 28.</note> No: <hi>He that trusteth
in his riches, shall fall, but the
righteous shall flourish as a branch:</hi>
such is the difference between
the covetous and the liberal
in point of security and success
concerning their Estate.</p>
            <p>Even according to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and ordinary way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
things, (abstracting
from the special Providence of
God) the liberal person hath
in consequence of his bounty,
more real security for his
Wealth, than this world hath
any other: He thereby gets an
interest in the gratitude and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of those, whom he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligeth,
together with the good
will and respect of all men,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64458:97"/>
who are spectators of his vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and generous dealing: the
hearts and memories of men
are repositories to him of a
treasure, which nothing can
extort from him, or defraud
him of. If any mischance
should arrive, or any want
come near him, all men would
be ready to commiserate him,
every man would hasten to his
succour. As when a haughty,
a greedy, or a gripple man do
fall into calamity or disgrace,
scarce any one regardeth or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
him; Fortune deserting
such a person, carries all with
it, few or none stick to him, his
most zealous flatterers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the first that forsake
him, contempt and neglect are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64458:97"/>
the only adherents to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
that of the Wise-man
appears verified,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 27.</note> 
               <hi>He that hideth
his eyes from the poor, shall have
many a curse:</hi> so the courteous
and bountiful person, when
Fortune seems to frown on
him, hath a sure refuge in the
good will and esteem of men;
all men, upon accompts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and honesty, take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be concerned in his
case, and engaged to favour
him; even those, who before
were strangers, become then
his friends, and in effect disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their affection to him: it,
in the common judgement of
people, appears an indignity and
a disgrace to mankind, that such
a man should want or suffer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:64458:98"/>
4. Nay farther we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that exercising bounty is
the most advantagious method
of improving and increasing
an Estate; but that being te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
and illiberal, doth tend
to the diminution and decay
thereof. The way to obtain
a great encrease, is to sow
much: he that sows little, how
can he expect a good Crop? It
is as true in spiritual Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
as in the other, that <hi>what
a man soweth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>that he shall reap,</hi>
both in kind, and according
to proportion; so that great
Husband-man St. <hi>Paul</hi> assureth
us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6, 10.</note> 
               <hi>He that soweth sparingly, shall
reap sparingly; but he that sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
bountifully, shall also reap
bountifully:</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> means
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64458:98"/>
the same, when he saith, <hi>To him
that soweth righteousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 18.</note> 
               <hi>shall be
a sure reward.</hi> The way to gain
abundantly is, you know well,
to trade boldly; he that will
not adventure any thing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
how can he think of a
large return? 'Tis so likewise
in the Evangelical Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
if we put out much upon
score of Conscience or Charity,
we shall be sure to profit much.
Liberality is the most benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Traffick that can be; it is
bringing our Wares to the best
Market; it is letting out our
Money into the best hands; we
thereby lend our Money to
God, who repays with vast U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury;
an hundred to one is the
rate he allows at present, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64458:99"/>
above a hundred millions to
one he will render hereafter; so
that if you will be Merchants
this way, you shall be sure to
thrive, you cannot fail to grow
rich most easily and speedily:
<hi>The liberal soul shall be made fat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 24.</note>
               <hi>and he that watereth shall be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
himself:</hi> This is that which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> again argues upon, when
commending the <hi>Philippians</hi>
free kindness toward him, he
says,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Not because I desire a gift,
but I desire fruit that may abound
to your accompt.</hi> Bounty yields
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a fruit that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies
and abundantly turns to
good accompt; it indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Gods benediction, the
fountain of all desirable plenty
and prosperity, for, <hi>The blessing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64458:99"/>
of the Lord it maketh rich,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and he
addeth no sorrow with it.</hi> It is
therefore the greatest want of
policy, the worst ill-husbandry
and unthriftiness that can be, to
be sparing this way; he that
uses it, cannot be thriving; he
must spend upon the main
stock, and may be sure to get
nothing considerable. God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
so proceeds, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
and retaliate men in
the same kind, wherein they
endeavour to please him, or
presume to offend him; so that
for them who freely offer him
their goods, he in regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
will prosper their dealings,
and bless their estates: (<hi>For
this very thing the Lord thy God
shall bless thee in all thy works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 10.</note>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:64458:100"/>
               <hi>and in all that thou puttest thine
hand unto,</hi> says <hi>Moses</hi>) but they
who will not lay out any thing
for him, he will not concern
himself in their success other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than to cross it, or (which
is worse) to curse it: for if he
seem to favour them for a time
with some prosperity in their
affairs,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 17.</note> their condition is much
worse thereby, their accompt
will be more grievous, and their
fate more disastrous in the end.</p>
            <p>5. Farther, the contributing
part of our goods to the poor,
will qualifie us to enjoy the rest
with satisfaction and comfort:
The Oblation of these First-fruits,
as it will sanctifie the
whole lump of our Estate, so it
will sweeten it; having offered
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64458:100"/>
this well-pleasing sacrifice of
piety, having discharged this
debt of justice, having paid this
tribute of gratitude, our hearts
being at rest, and our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
well satisfied, we shall,
like those good people in the
Acts,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 46.</note> 
               <hi>eat our meat with gladness,
and singleness of heart;</hi> to see the
poor man by our means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated,
eased, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed,
will give a delicious
relish to all our enjoyments.
But withholding his portion
from the poor, as it will pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and profane all our Estate,
so it will render the fruition
thereof sowre or unsavoury to
us: for, can we with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
taste our dainties, or view
our plenties, while the poor
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64458:101"/>
man stands in sight pining
with hunger? Can we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regret see our Walls cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Tapestry, our Horses
deckt with Golden Trappings,
our Attendants strutting in
wanton Gaiety, while our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
poor Brother appears half
naked, and trembling with
cold? Can we carry on one
finger enough to furnish ten
poor people with necessaries,
and have the heart within us,
without shame and displeasure,
to see them want? No; the
sense of our impiety and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
toward God, of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity
and unworthiness
toward our Neighbour, will
not fail (if ever we conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
reflect on our behaviour)
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64458:101"/>
to sting us with cruel remorse
and self-condemnation; the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of want and misery sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
us, will pierce our
ears, and wound our hearts;
the frequent objects of pity and
mercy, do what we can to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them from our prospect
or regard, will so assail, and so
pursue us, as to disturb the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our enjoyments, to
quash the briskness of our
mirth, to allay the sweetness of
our pleasure; yea rather, if stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
and obduration have not
seized on us, to imbitter all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; we shall feel that true,

            </p>
            <p>6. I shall touch but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
more, perswasive of
this practise; it is this: The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
nature of our Religion
specially requires it, and the
honour thereof exacts it from
us; nothing better suits Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
nothing more graces
it, than liberality; nothing is
more inconsistent therewith, or
more disparageth it, than being
miserable and sordid. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Niggard is the veriest non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
that can be; for, What is
is a Christian? What, but a
man, who adores God alone,
who loves God above all
things, who reposes all his trust
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64458:102"/>
and confidence in God? What
is he, but one who undertaketh
to imitate the most good and
bountiful God, to follow, as the
best pattern of his practise, the
most benign and charitable
JESUS, the Son of God; to
obey the Laws of God, and his
Christ, the sum and substance
of which is Charity; half whose
Religion doth consist in loving
his Neighbor as himself? What
is he farther, but one who hath
renounced this world, with all
the vain pomps and pleasures of
it; who professes himself in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
and affection of mind
to forsake all things for Christs
sake; who pretends little to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
affect, or care for any thing
under Heaven; having all his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64458:103"/>
main concernments and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
his heart, his hopes, and
his happiness in another world?
Such is a Christian; and what
is a Niggard? All things quite
contrary: One whose practise
manifestly shews him to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
another thing beside, and
before God; to love Mammon
above God, and more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in it, than in him; One,
who bears small good will,
kindness or pity toward his
Brother; who is little affected
or concerned with things future
or celestial; whose mind and
heart are riveted to this world;
whose hopes and happinesses
are setled here below; whose
soul is deeply immersed and
buried in earth: One who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64458:103"/>
to constant habit, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
breaketh the two
great heads of Christian duty,
<hi>Loving God with all his heart, and
his Neighbour as himself:</hi> It is
therefore, by comparing those
things, very plain, that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to reconcile gross contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
and inconsistencies, if
we profess our selves to be
Christians, and are illiberal. It
is indeed the special grace and
glory of our Religion, that it
consisteth not in barren specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
or empty formalities,
or forward professions; not in
fancying curiously, or speaking
zealously, or looking demure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but in really producing sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
fruits of goodness;<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 8.</note> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64458:104"/>
good and profitable unto men,</hi> such
as those chiefly are, of which
we speak. The most gracious
wisdom of God hath so model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
our Religion, that according
to it Piety and Charity are the
same thing; that we can never
express our selves more dutiful
toward him, or better please
him, or more truly glorifie him,
than when we are kind and
good to our poor Brother. We
grosly mistake, if we take gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Alms to be a Jewish
or Popish practise, suitable to
Children and Dullards in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
beneath so refined, so

God for our professed subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto the Gospel of Christ,
and for our liberal distribution
unto our brethren, and unto all
men:</hi> without it our faith is
dead and senseless; our high
attainments are fond presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions;
our fine notions and
delicate spiritualities are in truth
but silly dreams, the issues of a
proud and ignorant fancy: he
that appears hard-hearted and
close fisted toward his needy
Brother, let him think or call
himself what he pleaseth, he
plainly is no Christian, but a
blemish, a reproach, and a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64458:105"/>
scandal to that honourable
Name.</p>
            <p>7. To all these Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Reasons inducing to
the practise of this kind of
Charity, I might subjoin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
and set before you the
fairest Copies that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
thereof. We have for it
the pattern of God himself, who
is infinitely munificent and
merciful;<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 5, 17.</note> 
               <hi>from whom every good
and perfect gift descendeth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17. 25.</note> 
               <hi>who

things unto all;</hi> who <hi>giveth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and upbraideth not.</hi> We have
the example of the Son of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 9.</note>
who out of pure charity did
freely part with the riches and
glories of Eternity, voluntarily
embracing extream poverty and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64458:105"/>
want for our sake, that we who
were poor, might be enriched;
we that were miserable, might
become happy;<note place="margin">Act. 10. 38.</note> who <hi>went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
doing good;</hi> spent all his
life in painful dispensation of
beneficence, and relieving the
needs of men in every kind. We
have the blessed Patriarchs to
follow, who at Gods pleasure
and call did readily leave their
Country, their Friends, their
Goods, and all they had. We
have the practise of the holy
Apostles,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 27.</note> who freely <hi>let go all
to follow their Lord;</hi> who chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
sustained all sorts of losses,
disgraces, and pains for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the honour of God, and
procuring good unto men; we
have to move and encourage us
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64458:106"/>
hereto the first and best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
most full of grace and
holy zeal,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 34, 35.</note> who <hi>so many as were
possessours of lands and houses, did
sell them,</hi> and did impart the
price of them to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>so that there was none poor
among them,</hi> and that <hi>distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was made to every one as he
had need.</hi> We have all the saints
and eminent servants of God
in all times, who have been
high and wonderful in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of these duties, (I
could tell you of the blessed
Martyr St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pentius in vit. Cypr.</note> who was
liberal by whole sale, bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

left, and seeing a poor man that

pieces, and gave one to that
<hi>poor man;</hi> and many like instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of authentick History
might be produced, apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
our imitation: I might
also, to beget emulation and
shame in us, represent exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
practises of Humanity
and Charity even in Jews, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans
and Pagans, such as
in these cold days might pass for
more than ordinary among us)
but I shall only propound one
present and sensible example,
that of this Noble City, whose
publick bounty and charity in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64458:107"/>
all kinds, (in education of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
in curing the Diseased,
both in body and mind, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the poor, in relieving
all sorts of necessities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series)
let me earnestly intreat,
and exhort us all for Gods sake,
as we are able, by our private
charity to imitate, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and to assist; let us do
this so much the more willingly
and freely, as the sad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of things, by Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
brought upon us, do
plainly require, that the Publick
Charity it self (lying under so
great impediments, discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and distresses) should
be supported, supplied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by particular liberality.
No words that I can devise will
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64458:107"/>
be so apt to affect and move
you, as the case it self, if you
please to consider it: hear it
therefore speaking, and, I pray,
with a pious and charitable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of mind attend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A true Report, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>For this excellent Pattern of
pious bounty and mercy, let us
heartily thank Almighty God;
let us humbly implore Gods
blessing on the future manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it; let us pay due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the worthy Promoters
thereof, and pray for rewards
upon them answerable to their
charitable care and industry
employed therein; let us also
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64458:108"/>
according to our ability per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our duty in following and
furthering it: for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to which practise, give
me leave briefly to reflect upon
the latter part of my Text;
which represents some instances
of the felicity proper to a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
person, or some rewards
peculiar to the exercising the
duties of bounty and mercy.</p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>His righteousness
endureth for ever.</hi> These words
are capable of various senses,
or of divers respects; they may
import that the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his bounty is
very durable, or that the effects
thereof do lastingly continue,
or that eternal rewards are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
thereto; they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64458:108"/>
the bountiful man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or his posterity here; they
may simply relate to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance
in Gods regard and
care; or they may with that
also comprehend a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the good memory,
and honourable mention of
men. Now in truth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all these interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the bountiful mans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
doth endure for ever,
that is, very lastingly (or so
long as the special nature of
the case doth bear) in any
sense; or for an absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,
in some sense: the
words in their plenitude do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
and without straining
involve so many truths, none
which therefore we think fit to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64458:109"/>
exclude, but shall briefly touch
them all.</p>
               <p>1. As for future reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and fame, (which that it
in part is intended here, that
which precedes, <hi>The righteous
shall be had in everlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>
doth argue) it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it peculiarly attends
upon this practise: the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
person is especially that
<hi>just</hi> man,<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 7.</note> whose <hi>memory is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
(is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Greek
renders it; that is, is prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with commendations and
praises.) No Spices can so
embalm a man, no Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can so preserve his Name
and Memory, as works of
beneficence; no other same is
comparably so precious, o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:64458:109"/>
truly glorious, as that which
grows from thence: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
of Power and Prowess,
of Wit or Learning, of any
Wisdom or Skill, may dwell
in the fancies of men with
some admiration; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Bounty reigns
in their hearts with cordial
esteem and affection; there
erecting immoveable Trophies
over Death and Oblivion, and
it thence spreading it self
through the tongues of men
with sincere and sprightly
Commendations. The boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
mans very Dust is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant,
and his Grave venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
his Name is never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
without respect; his
Actions have always these best
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64458:110"/>
Ecchoes, with innumerable
iterations resounding after
them: This was a true Friend
to Mankind; This was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Benefactour to the World;
This was a Man good in
earnest, and pious to good
purpose.</p>
               <p>2. The effects of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
are likewise very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
When he is departed
hence, and in person is no
more seen, he remains visible
and sensible in the footsteps
and fruits of his goodness; the
Poor still beholds him present
in the subsistence of himself,
and his Family; the Sick-man
feels him in the refreshment,
which he yet enjoys by his
provision; he supervives in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64458:110"/>
the heart of the Afflicted,
which still resents the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and rejoices in the ease
which he procured him; all
the World percieves benefit
from him by the edification it
receiveth from his example;
Religion obtaineth profit and
ornament, God himself enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
glory and praise from his
righteousness.</p>
               <p>3. His righteousness also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
in respect to his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It is an usual plea for
tenacity and parsimony, that
care must be had of posterity,
that enough must be provided
and laid up for the Family:
But in truth this is a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
excuse, and doing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereto, is a very prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64458:111"/>
method of proceeding
toward that end; it is really
the greatest improvidence in
that respect, and the truest
neglect that can be of our
Children: for so doing, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a seeming Estate,
we entail a real Curse upon
them; we devest them of Gods
protection and benediction,
(the only sure preservatives of
an Estate) we leave them
Heirs of nothing so much as
of punishments due to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
our infidelity, our
impiety and injustice both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God and man: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by liberally bestowing on
the poor, we demise unto them
Gods blessing, which is the best
inheritance; we recommend
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64458:111"/>
them to Gods especial care,
which is the best tuition; we
leave them Gods protection
and providence, which are a
Wealth indefectible and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible;
we constitute God
their Guardian, who will most
faithfully manage, and most
wisely improve their substance,
both that which we leave to
them, and that whith we gave
for them to the poor; we
thereby in good part entitle
them unto the rewards appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to our pious Charity,
our Faith, our Gratitude, our
Self-denial, our Justice, to
whatever of good is virtually
contained in our acts of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
to omit the honour and
the good will of men, which
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64458:112"/>
constantly adhere to the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
mans House and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It is therefore expresly
mentioned in Scripture as a
recompence peculiar to this
vertue, that security from
want, and all happiness do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the posterity of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
person:<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>He is ever mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful

blessed,</hi> saith <hi>David</hi> of him ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally;
and <hi>David</hi> also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
observed, that in all

seed begging their bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. His righteousness also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever in the perpetual
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64458:112"/>
favour of God, and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
rewards which God will
confer upon him, who out of
Conscience and reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, out of good will

hath dispersed, and given
to the poor.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10.</note>

reap a most plentiful Crop
of blessings spiritual; he shall

that he hath <hi>stored up:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 19.</note>
for the goods he hath sold and
delivered, he shall <hi>bonâ fide</hi>
receive his Bargain,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>the hidden
treasure,</hi> and <hi>precious pearl</hi> of

worldly Riches, he shall hear

                  <hi>Well done
good and faithful servant, enter
into thy Masters joy:</hi> he shall
at last find God infinitely more
bountiful to him, than he hath
been unto the poor.</p>
               <p>Thus when all the flashes
of sensual pleasure are quite
extinct; when all the flowers
of secular glory are withered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
when all earthly glories
are buried in darkness; when
this world, and all the fashion
of it, are utterly vanished and
gone, the bountiful mans state
will be still firm and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and <hi>His righteousness shall
endure for ever.</hi>

It follows, <hi>His horn shall be
exalted with honour:</hi> A Horn is
an Emblem of Power; for in

such is the natural Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Souls, that as our

venerate them, whom they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
eminently to practise
it. Other Vertues men see,
and approve as goodly to the
sight, but this they taste and
feel; this by most sensible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
they find to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and profitable, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore but highly prize
it.<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 1.</note> They, who <hi>do their alms

they fail not to get Honour

                  <hi>A good

and things very spiritual, for
things most material; they
obtain that which every man
doth naturally desire and prize,
for that which only fashion in
some places endeareth, and
commandeth: they get the
end for the means, for scarce
any man seeketh wealth for it
self, but either for Honour, or
for Vertues sake, that he may

of Honour according to
gracious promise, (grounded
upon somewhat of special rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
of equity, and decency in
the thing it self) is due from
God unto the bountiful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and is by special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
surely conferred on him.
There is no kind of piety, or
instance of obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God himself is more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
honoured, than by this.

These are chiefly those <hi>good
works,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> the which <hi>men seeing,</hi>
are apt to <hi>glorifie our Father
which is in Heaven;</hi> to these

                  <hi>if you

The comfortable experience of
good in this sort of actions,
will most readily dispose men
to admire and commend the
excellency, the wisdom, the
goodness of the Divine Laws,
will therefore procure God
hearty praise, and thanks for
them: For, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>The administration of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64458:116"/>
this service not only supplyeth
the want of the Saints, but
is abundant also by many
thanksgivings unto God; whilst
by experiment of this ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they glorifie God for your
professed subjection unto the
Gospel of Christ, and for your
liberal distribution unto them,
and unto all men.</hi> Since then
God is so peculiarly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this practise, it is but
equal and fit, that God
should remunerate it with
honour; Gods noble good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will not let him seem
defective in any sort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
correspondence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
us, we shall never be
able to yield him any kind of
good thing in duty, which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64458:117"/>
he will not be more apt to
render us in Grace; they

                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 9.</note>

bountiful man in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and affections of
men. He that ordereth all
the events of things, and
disposeth success as he thinks
fit, will cause the bountiful
persons Enterprizes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
and come off with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
He will not suffer the
reputation of so real an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourer

slurr'd by disaster,
to be blasted by slander, to
be supplanted by envy or

3. God will thus exalt the
bountiful Man's Horn even
here in this World, and to
an infinitely higher pitch he
will advance it in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

be set at the right hand, in a

rank; among the chief
Friends and Favourites of
the Heavenly King; in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Consortship with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

where, in recompence of
his pious Bounty, he shall
