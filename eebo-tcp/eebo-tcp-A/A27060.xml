            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And we ſhall, according to our bounden duty, become humble Suiters at the Throne of Grace, that the God of Peace who hath put ſuch a thing as this into your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Heart, will, by his heavenly wiſdom and Holy Spirit, ſo aſſiſt You therein, and bring your Reſolutions to ſo perfect an effect and iſſue, that all the people of theſe Kingdoms may have abundant cauſe to riſe up and bleſs You, and bleſs God who hath delighted in You, to make You his Inſtrument in ſo happy a Work: That as Your glorious Progenitor, <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> was happy in <hi>uniting</hi> the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and your Grandfather King <hi>James</hi> (of bleſſed memory) in <hi>uniting</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; So this Honour may be reſerved to your Majeſty (as a radiant Jewel in your Crown) That by your Princely Wiſdom and Chriſtian Moderation, the hearts of the People may be <hi>united,</hi> and the unhappy differences and miſ-underſtandings amongſt Brethren in matters Eccleſiaſtical <hi>ſo compoſed,</hi> that the Lord may be <hi>One,</hi> and his Name <hi>One</hi> in the midſt of your Dominions.</p>
            <p>In an humble Conformity to this your Majeſties Chriſtian Deſign, we taking it for granted, that there is a firm Agreement between our Brethren and us in <hi>Doctrinal Truths</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and in the <hi>subſtantial parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi>; and that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are only in ſome <hi>various Conceptions</hi> about the <hi>Ancient Form</hi> of <hi>Church Government,</hi> and ſome particulars about <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi>; do in all humble obedience to your Majeſty repreſent,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64662:3"/>Firſt, In as much as the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of Church-Government and Miniſtry, is, <hi>That Holineſs of Life</hi> and the <hi>Salvation of Souls may be effectually promoted,</hi> We humbly deſire in the firſt place, that we may be ſecured of thoſe things in <hi>practice,</hi> of which we ſeem to be agreed in <hi>principles</hi>: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That thoſe of our Flocks who are diligent and ſerious about the matters of their Salvation, may not by words of ſcorn, or any abuſive uſages, be ſuffered to be reproachfully handled, but may have <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Encouragement</hi> in their Duties, of <hi>exhorting</hi> and <hi>provoking</hi> one another to Love and to Good Works, and of <hi>building up one another in their moſt holy Faith,</hi> and by all religious and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means of furthering one another in the waies of <hi>Eternal Life</hi>; who being not therein oppoſite to Church-Aſſemblies, nor refuſing the guidance and inſpection of their Paſtors, and being reſponſible for what they do or ſay.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That each Congregation may have a <hi>Learned, Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Godly Paſtor</hi> reſiding among them, to the end the People may be publickly inſtructed, by <hi>preaching every Lords day,</hi> by <hi>catechiſing</hi> and <hi>frequent adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and other Miniſterial Acts, as the occaſions and neceſſities of the People may require in health and ſikneſs: And that effectual proviſion of Law may be made, that ſuch as are <hi>inſufficient, negligent,</hi> or <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,</hi> may not be allowed or permitted in ſo ſacred a Function and Imployment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That none may be admited to the Lords Supper, till they can <hi>competently underſtand the Principles of Chriſtian religion,</hi> and do <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally own their Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> by credible profeſſion of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> not contradicting the ſame by a contrary profeſſion, or by a ſcandalous life; and that unto ſuch only <hi>Confirmation</hi> (if continued in the Church) may be adminiſtred. And that the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> of the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> to whom the catechiſing and inſtructing thoſe under their Charge doth appertain, may be produced before any perſon receive confirmation. Which courſe (we humbly conceive) will much conduce to the quieting thoſe ſad Diſputes which have greatly troubled the Church of God amongſt us, touching Church-Members and Communicants.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That an effectual courſe may be taken for the <hi>Sanctification of the Lords day,</hi> appropriating the ſame to holy Exerciſes both in publick and private, without any unneceſſary divertiſments; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain and by long experience found, that the due obſervation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64662:3"/>
thereof is a ſpecial means of preſerving and promoting the power of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and obviating of <hi>Prophaneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Then for matters in difference, <hi>viz. Church-Government, Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> We humbly Repreſent to Your MAJESTY:</head>
               <p>That although upon juſt Reaſons, we do diſſent from the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hierarchy or Prelacy diſclaimed in <hi>Covenant,</hi> as it was ſtated and exerciſed in theſe Kingdomes; yet we do not, nor ever did renounce the true ancient primitive Epiſcopacy, or Preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as it was ballanced or managed by a due commixtion of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> therewith, as a fit means to avoid Corruptions, Partialities, Tyrannies, and other Evils which may be incident to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of one ſingle Perſon: which kinde of attempored <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> or <hi>Preſidency,</hi> if it ſhall by your Majeſties grave Wiſdome and gracious Moderation, be in ſuch manner conſtituted (as that the fore-mentioned, and other like Evils, may be certainly preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) we ſhall humbly ſubmit thereunto. And in order to an happy Accommodation in this weighty Buſineſs, we deſire humbly to offer to your Majeſty ſome of the Particulars, which we conceive were amiſs in the <hi>Epiſcopal-Government,</hi> as it was practiſed before the year, 1640. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The great extent of the <hi>Biſhops Diocess,</hi> which was much too large for his own perſonal Inſpection, wherein he took aperſonal Charge over the Souls of all thoſe within his Biſhoprick; which burden muſt needs be granted to be too heavy for any one man's ſhoulders, the Paſtoral Office being a work of Perſonal Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Truſt, and that of the higheſt Concernment to the Souls of the People, for which they are to give an account to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That by reaſon of this <hi>diſability</hi> to diſcharge their Duties and Truſts perſonally, the Biſhops did depute the Adminiſtration of much of their Truſt, even in matters of <hi>Spiritual cognizance</hi> to <hi>Commiſſaries, Chancellors,</hi> and <hi>Officials,</hi> whereof ſome are Secular perſons, and could not adminiſter that Power which originally pertaineth to the Officers of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> who affirm, <hi>The Epiſcopal Office to be a diſtinct Order by Divine Right, from that of the Presbyter</hi>; did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the ſole Power of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That ſome of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> exerciſed an Arbitrary power, as by ſending forth their <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Viſitation,</hi> inquiring unwarrantably
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64662:4"/>
into ſeveral things, and <hi>Swearing</hi> the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> accordingly; So alſo by many <hi>Innovations</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> not required by Law.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>For the reforming of theſe Evils, we firſt crave leave to offer to your Majeſty:</head>
               <p n="1">1. The late moſt Reverend Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> his <hi>Reduction of Epiſcopacy,</hi> unto the <hi>Form</hi> of a <hi>Synodical Government,</hi> received in the Ancient Church as a Ground-work towards an <hi>Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Fraternal-Agreement,</hi> in this point of <hi>Eccleſiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; which we rather do, not only in regard of his eminent Piety and ſingular Abilities, as in all other parts of Learning, ſo in that eſpecially of the <hi>Antiquities of the Church</hi>; but alſo, becauſe therein <hi>Expedients</hi> are offered towards in the <hi>Healing</hi> of theſe <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And in order to the ſame End, we further humbly deſire, That the <hi>Suffragans Chorepiſcopi,</hi> mentioned in the Primate's <hi>Reduction,</hi> may be <hi>Choſen</hi> by the <hi>reſpective Synods,</hi> and by <hi>that Election</hi> may be ſufficiently <hi>Authorized</hi> to diſcharge their Truſt, and that the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations</hi> may not be ſo Large as to make the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> impoſſible, or to take off the <hi>Miniſters</hi> from the reſt of their neceſſary Work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That no <hi>Oathes,</hi> or <hi>Promiſes</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Biſhops, nor any unneceſſary <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> or <hi>Engagements</hi> be made Neceſſary to <hi>Ordination, Inſtitution,</hi> or <hi>Induction, Miniſtration, Communion,</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities</hi> of Miniſters, they being Reſponſible for any Tranſgreſſion of the Law: And that no Biſhop, nor any Eccleſiaſtical Governor, may at any time <hi>Exerciſe</hi> their <hi>Government</hi> by their <hi>private Will</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> but only by ſuch <hi>Rules, Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> as ſhall be by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> ratified and eſtabliſhed: And that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Proviſion</hi> may be made to <hi>ſecure</hi> both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People</hi> againſt the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi>

Though we are far from thinking that it obligeth us to any evil, or to go beyond our places &amp; callings to do good, much leſs to reſiſt Authority, (to which it doth oblige us) yet doth it undoubtedly bind us to forbear our own <hi>conſent</hi> to thoſe <hi>luxuriances</hi> of <hi>Church-Government</hi> which we there renounced, and for which no <hi>divine Inſtitution</hi> can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

               <head>Our Reaſons for the firſt part of Diſcipline, <hi>Viz.</hi> In particular Pariſhes, are theſe.</head>
               <p>It is neceſſary to the honour of the Chriſtian profeſſion, to the integrity of Worſhip, to the deſtruction of Impiety and Vice, to the preſervation of the Sound, the raiſing them that are fallen, the comforting of the penitent, the ſtrengthning of the weak, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, order, ſtrength and beauty of our Churches, the Unity of Believers, and the pleaſing of Chriſt who hath required it by his Laws: And withall it's agreeable to the ancient Canons and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Churches; and is conſented to by our Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſo is no matter of controverſie now between us.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Yet is not the Rubrick Satisfactory to which we are referred.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it leaves the people at liberty, whether they will let us know of their intention to communicate, till the night or morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and alloweth us then only to admoniſh them; when in great Pariſhes 'tis impoſſible for want of time.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64662:9"/>2. Becauſe it alloweth us to deny the Sacrament to thoſe only that maliciouſly refuſe reconciliation with their Neighbors, and only to admoniſh other ſcandalous ſinners to forbear; though the Canon forbid us to deliver them the Sacrament.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The Reaſons why we inſiſt on the ſecond Propoſal, are theſe:</head>
               <p>It being agreed on between us, that the younger, leſs diſcreeter ſort of Miniſters are unfit to paſs the ſentence of Excommunication without advice and moderation by others; And every Church is not like to be provided with grave, diſcreet, judicious Guides; the neceſſity of theſe frequent leſſer Synods for ſuch moderation, and advice, and guidance, will appear by theſe two general Evidences;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the very nature and ſubſtance of the Office of a Presbyter to have the power of the Keys for binding or looſing, retaining, or remitting ſin: which therefore together, or apart, as there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they are bound to exerciſe. And this being the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, cannot be altered by man. In their Ordination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtabliſhed Order in <hi>England,</hi> it is ſayd [<hi>Whoſe ſins thou doſt remit they are remitted, whoſe ſins thou doſt retain they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi>] And they are commanded to miniſter the Doctrine, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Diſcipline of Chriſt as the Lord hath commanded, and as this Realm hath received the ſame, as expreſly as the Biſhops are. And as the late Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> obſerveth in his Reduction, that they may the better underſtand what the Lord hath commanded, the Exhortation of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is appointed to be read to them at the time of their Ordination: <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed</hi> (or rule) <hi>the Congregation of God which he hath purchaſed with his blood.</hi> And it is apparent in this <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 18, 28. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. —1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17, 24. and other places, that it is the Office of a Presbyter to over-ſee, rule, and guide the Flock with that Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Rule which conſiſteth in the exerciſe of the Keys, or manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or perſonal application of Gods Word to the conſciences and caſes of particular perſons, for their ſalvation, and order of the Church; the Coercive power belonging to the Magiſtrate. And this was the practice of the ancient Church, as appeareth undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Cyprian, Jerome, Chryſoſtome, &amp;c. Concil. Carthag.</hi> 4 <hi>Can.</hi> 22, 23, 29, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37. And is confeſſed by the chiefeſt Defenders of Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64662:10"/>II. If all Preſentments and Appeals be made to the Biſhop and his conſiſtory alone, it will take from us the Pariſh-Diſcipline, (which is granted us) and caſt almoſt all Diſcipline out of the Church; as is moſt apparent to them, that by experience are acquainted with the quality of our Flocks, and the true nature of the Paſtoral work, conſidering,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How many hundred Churches are in a Dioceſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How many thouſand perſons are in many Pariſhes; and of thoſe, what a number are obſtinate in wilful groſs ignorance or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, refuſing to be inſtructed or admoniſhed by their Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How long, and earneſtly, and tenderly, ſinners muſt be dealt with, before they are cut off by Solemn Excommunication.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How unſatisfactory it muſt be to the conſcience of a Biſhop or Synod, to cut off a man as impenitent, upon the bare report of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, before they have upon full admonition proved him impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves, eſpecially when too many Miniſters are (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a paſſion that may cauſe partial accuſation) unable ſo to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a reproof and exhortation, as is neceſſary to work on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the People, and to convict Reſiſters of flat Impentiencie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What abundance of work the Biſhop will have (beſides conſtant preaching, which will require time for preparation) viſiting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches, confirming all the ſouls in ſo many hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes (which alone is more than any one man can do aright, if he had nothing elſe to do) Ordaining, Inſtituting and Examining the perſons ſo far as to ſatisfie a tender conſcience (that takes not all on truſt from others, and is but the executor of others Judgments:) Theſe and much more, with a care of Church-building, Lands, and his own Affairs and Family, and ſickneſſes, and neceſſary abſence ſometimes, will make this great additional work (which muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly performed for ſo many hundred Pariſhes) to be impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Reproofs and ſuſpenſion will ſo exaſperate the ſcandalous, that they will vex the Paſtors with numerous Appeals.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Paſtors will be undone by travelling and waiting, and maintaining ſuch multitude of witneſſes, as is neceſſary for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of Preſentments, and anſwering the Many Appeals.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The buſineſs will be ſo odious, chargeable and troubleſome, that witneſſes will not come in.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Miniſter by theſe proſecutions and attendances, will be taken off the reſt of his miniſterial work.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Biſhops being but men, will be tempted by this intolerable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64662:10"/>
burthen, to be weary of the work, and ſlubber it over, and caſt it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, and to diſcountenance the moſt conſcionable Miniſters that moſt trouble them with preſentments: which when the people perceive, they wil the more inſult, and vex us with Appeals: So that the diſcouragements of the Miniſters, and the utter incapacity of the Biſhops to perform a quarter of this work, will nullifie Diſcipline, as leaving it impoſſible, Experience hath told us this too long.</p>
               <p>And then when our Communion is thus polluted with all that are moſt incapable through ignorance, Scandal, and contempt of Piety,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Miniſters will be deterred from their Adminiſtrations to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſo uncapable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Biſhops that are tender-conſcienced, will be deterred from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſo impoſſible a work, and of ſo ill ſucceſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And men that have leaſt tenderneſs of conſcience, and care of ſouls, and fear of Gods diſpleaſure, will ſeek for and intrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both places.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the tender-conſcienced people will be tempted to ſpeak hardly of ſuch undiſciplin'd Churches, and of the Officers, and to withdraw from them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And hereby they will fall under the diſpleaſure of Superiors, and the ſcorn of the Vulgar, that have no religion, but what is ſubſervient to their fleſh.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ſo whileſt the moſt pious are brought under diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and reproach, and the moſt impious get the reputation of being moſt regular and obedient to their Rulers; Piety it ſelf will grow into diſeſteem, and impiety eſcape its due diſgrace. And this hath been the cauſe of our Calamities.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>As to Liturgie.</hi> It is matter of very great joy and thankfulneſs to us, that we have heard your Majeſtie more than once ſo reſolutely promiſing, that none ſhould ſuffer for not uſing the Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Ceremonies; but you would ſecure them from the penalties in the Act for Uniformity, as that which your Declaration at <hi>Breda</hi> intended: And to find here ſo much of your Majeſties Clemencie in your gracious conceſſion for a future Emendation. But we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave leave to acquaint your Majeſtie,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it greives us after all, to hear that it is given in charge by the Judges at the Aſſizes to indite men upon that Act, for not uſing the Common-prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is not onely ſome obſolete words, and other expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are offenſive.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64662:11"/>3. That many ſcruple, uſing ſome part of the Book as it is, leſt they be guilty of countenancing the whole, yet would uſe it when reformed.</p>
               <p>Therefore we humbly crave, that your Majeſty would here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it is your Maje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

And that your Majeſty will procure that moderation in the impoſition hereafter, which we before deſired.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Concerning Ceremonies.</hi> Returning our humble thanks for your Majeſties gracious Conceſſions (of which we are aſſured you will never have cauſe to repent:) We further crave,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That your Majeſty will leave out thoſe words in your Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, concerning us [That we do not in our Judgments believe the practiſe of thoſe particular Ceremonies which we accept againſt to be in it ſelf unlawful] for we have not ſo declared our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Indeed, we have ſayd, That treating in order to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py uniting of our Brethren through the Land; our work is not to ſay, what is our own opinion, or what will ſatisfie us, but what will ſatisfie ſo many as may procure the ſayd Union. And we have ſayd, that ſome think them flatly unlawful, ſome but inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; ſome think ſome of them unlawful in themſelves, and others but inconvenient; and while th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Impoſer thinks them but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, we conceived they might reaſonably be entreated to let them go, for the ſaving of their Brethrens conſciences, and the Churches peace. We are ſure that a Chriſtians conſcience ſhould be tender of adding to, or diminiſhing from the matter of Gods Worſhip in the ſmalleſt point. The Laws of God being herein the only perfect Rule, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. And that Synod infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt, would lay upon the Churches no other burden but neceſſary things, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. And that for things indifferent, Chriſtians ſhould not deſpiſe or judge each other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. Much leſs by ſilencing the able and faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, to puniſh the Flock even in their Souls, for the tollerable differences and ſuppoſed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of Miniſters. We doubt not but <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without the Ceremonies in queſtion.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing your Majeſty well expreſſeth it [That the Univerſal Church cannot introduce one Ceremony in the worſhip of God that is contrary to Gods Word, expreſſed in the Scriptures.] And mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Proteſtants at home and abroad do think that all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,

It muſt needs be an expreſſion of your Majeſties wiſdome, and tenderneſs of Gods honour, and the ſafety of your peoples ſouls, to refuſe in things unneceſſary to drive men upon apprehended ſin, and upon the wrath of God, and the terrors of a condemned conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We beſeech your Majeſty to underſtand, that it is not our meaning by the word [Aboliſhing] to crave a prohibition againſt your own, and other mens liberty in the things in queſtion. But it is a full liberty we deſire, ſuch as ſhould be in unneceſſary things, and ſuch as will tend to the concord of your people, <hi>Viz.</hi> That there be no Law nor Canon for or againſt them, commanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending, or prohibiting them; as now there is none for any particular geſture in ſinging of Pſalms, where liberty preſerveth an uninterrupted Unity.</p>

               <head>For the particular Ceremonies.</head>
               <p n="1">I. We humbly crave, as to Kneeling, in the Act of receiving the Lords Supper, that your Majeſty will declare a Liberty therein, that none ſhall be troubled for receiving it ſtanding, or ſitting. And your Majeſties Expreſſions [upon Reaſons beſt (if not only) known to our ſelves] commands us to render ſome of our Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are ſure Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſinned not, by not receiving it kneeling; and many are ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould not ſin: And therefore for the better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though not for abſolute neceſſity, we crave leave to take the ſafeſt ſide.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are ſure that Kneeling in any Adoration at all in any Worſhip on any Lords day in the year, or any Week day between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Penticoſt,</hi> was not only diſ-uſed, but forbidden by General Councils, (as <hi>Concil.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64662:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Kneeling in the Act of Receiving, is a Novelty contrary to the Decrees and practice of the Church for many hundred years after the Apoſtles. And if we part with the venerable Examples of all Antiquity, where it agrees with Scripture, (and that for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) we ſhall depart from the Terms which moſt Moderators think neceſſary for the reconciling of the Churches; and Novelty is a Diſhonor to any part of Religion. And if Antiquity be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, the moſt ancient and neareſt the Legiſlation and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, muſt be moſt honorable: and it is not ſafe to intimate a Charge of Unreverence upon all the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, and the univerſal Church, for ſo many hundred years together of its pureſt time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though our meaning be good, it is not good to ſhew a needleſs countenance of the practice of Adoring the Bread as God, when it is uſed by Papiſts round about us. Sayth Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> in his Life, <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>I had a dangerous Conflict with a Sorboniſt, who took occaſion by our kneeling at the receit of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>to perſwade all the company of our Acknowledgment of a Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Some of us that could rather kneel than be deprived of the Communion, ſhould yet ſuffer much before we durſt put all others from the Communion that durſt not take it kneeling; which therefore we crave that we may not be put upon.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We humbly crave alſo, that the Religious obſervation of Holy daies of humane Inſtitution, may be declared to be left indifferent, that none be troubled for not obſerving them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We humbly tender your Majeſty our thanks for your gracious Conceſſion of liberty as to the Croſs and Surplice, and bowing at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> rather than Chriſt, or God: But we further humbly beſeech your Majeſty,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this liberty in forbearing the Surplice may extend to Colledges and Cathedrals alſo, that it drive not thence all thoſe that ſcruple it, and make thoſe places receptive only for a party. And that the Youth of the Nation may have juſt liberty as well as

the Elder. If they be ingaged in the Univerſities, and their Liberties there cut off in their beginning, they cannot afterwards be free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many hopeful perſons will be elſe diverted from the Service of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That your Majeſtie will endeavour the repealing of all Laws and Canons by which theſe Ceremonies are impoſed, that they may be left at full Liberty.</p>
               <p>We alſo tender our thanks to your Majeſtie for your gracious Conceſſion of the forbearance of the Subſcription required by the Canon. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We humbly acquaint your Majeſtie, that we do not diſſent from the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> expreſſed in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Homilies; but it is the controverted paſſages about Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Liturgie and Ceremonies, and ſome by-paſſages and phraſes in the Doctrinal part, which are ſcrupled by thoſe whoſe liberty is deſired. Not that we are againſt ſubſcribing the proper Rule of our Religion, or any meet Confeſſion of Faith: Nor do we ſcruple the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy: Nor would we have the door left open for Papiſts and Hereticks to come in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We take the boldneſs to ſay, that ſince we have had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of your gracious indulgence herein, and upon divers Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to your Majeſtie and the Lord Chancellor, had comfortable encouragement to expect our Liberty; yet cannot Miniſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Inſtitution without renouncing their Ordination by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or being re-ordained, nor without Subſcription, and the Oath of Canonical Obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt obſerve with fear and grief, that your Majeſties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and Conceſſion of Liberty in this Declaration, extendeth not either to the abatement of Re-ordination, or of Subſcription at Ordination, or the Oath of Obedience to the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>We therefore humbly and earneſtly crave, that your Majeſty will declare your pleaſure,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Ordination and Inſtitution and Induction, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred without the ſaid Subſcription or Oath.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:64662:13"/>2. That none be urged to be re-ordained, or denied Inſtitution for want of Ordination by Prelates, that was ordained by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That none be judged to have forfeited his Preſentation, or Benefice, or be deprived of it, for not reading thoſe Articles of the 39. that contain the controverted points of Government and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly.</hi> We humbly crave, that your Majeſtie would not onely grant us this liberty, till the next Synod; but will endeavour that the Synod be impartially choſen; and that your Majeſtie will be pleaſed to endavour the procurement of ſuch Laws, as ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our ſecurity till the Synod, and for the ratification of moderate healing Concluſions afterward. And that nothing by meer Canon be impoſed on us, without ſuch Statute-Laws of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Theſe favours (which will be injurious to none) if your people may obtain of your Majeſtie, it will revive their hearts to daily and earneſt Prayer for your proſperity, and to rejoyce in the thankfull acknowledgement of that gracious providence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that hath bleſſed us in your Reſtauration, and put it into your heart to heal our breaches, and to have compaſſion on the faithful people in your Dominions, who do not petition you for liberty to be Schiſmatical, Factious, Seditious, or abuſive to any; but onely for leave to obey the Lord that Created and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them, according to that Law, by which they muſt all be ſhortly judged to everlaſting Joy or Miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it will excite them to, and unite them in the cheerful ſervice of your Majeſty, with their Eſtates and lives, and to tranſmit your deſerved Praiſe to Poſterity.</p>
