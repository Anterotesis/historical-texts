            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two manifeſt inſtigations which importune the ſequell of my words. Firſt, the equity of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings hitherto, giving me bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and courage. Secondly the ground and principall motives inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating me to this my propoſition and requeſt. For I behold in all your intendments a ſingularity of proceedings grounded upon diſcretion and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, your conſultations being ſteered and ballanced as well by charity and compaſſionate lenity towards the reflecting ſorrowes of others miſeries, as extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62551:3"/>
of Juſtice towards delinquents. And my wiſhes are and ſhall be for the continuance of this wiſdom, which redounds to the glory of God and unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible joy of the Subject. But not to digreſſe too farre from the matter I intended to ſpeake of, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your this dayes reſolution concerning my intended motion will prove as happy as I conceive: the propoſition which now moves me to ſpeake is ſeaſonable and neceſſary. The order of your noble favour and gratious aſpect to ſuch as have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly petitioners unto you, together with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the ſubject, hath given me ſo much confidence in your Honours as to ſolicite an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laſt and late mentioned petition for the poore proteſtants in Ireland who are perſecuted, maſſacred, and miſerably diſtreſſed by the Rebells there, whoſe malice extends not onely to the take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any one particular towne or county, nor content to diſpoſſeſſe the poore inhabitant prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants taken by them, but purſuing them with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Severity, to the imbrewing their murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and moſt wicked hands in their blood, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by all meanes to embeſill his Majeſties Regall authority by uſing their chiefeſt cruelty to his Majeſties moſt true and loyall Subjects. My deſire and humble petition to your honours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that there may be ſome ſpeedy and ſudden courſe taken for the expediting and diſpatching of ſome more auxiliary forces towards the aſſiſtance of our aforeſaid brethren. Your honours cannot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62551:3"/>
upon ſage and mature conſideration but conceive the conveniency, neceſſity and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull extremity they are, and will dayly be more and more plunged into without it. As for my part, I that have formerly engaged my ſelfe for my King and countreys good, am now ready, nay more willing then ever, to adventure both life, eſtate, liberty, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe I may tearme mine, for the good of the Kingdome and advancing of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties honor againſt any forrain or civill ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, under the pleaſing ſhade of whoſe Crown we have ever gathered the fruits of Juſtice, and upon whoſe happineſſe the welfare of the whole Common-wealth principally depends, our hopes principally conſiſting in his royall pleaſure, and you who are his graund Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to determine of things for the benefit of the Common-wealth and advancing of his honours. This of Irelands derogating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt his Majeſtie, perſecuting his Subjects, it muſt needs be a poynt of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity and diſhonour to our Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who may well be taxed with cowardiſe, in that we are ſo tardie, ſlow and diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our poore diſtreſſed brethren; ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and favourable, as not to aſſiſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their wrongs ere they had come to ſo high a head; and ſo forgetfull, as to endanger the loſſe of His Majeſties Prerogative, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62551:4"/>
our owne credit by their unrepelled inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who now exalt themſelves through their ſtrength, and give glory to their arme of fleſh, but I hope that I am really and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded that their joy will be ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and their ſacrilegious pleaſures will prove but momentany, and of no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It is in your pleaſures to crown my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation with a joyfull Reply to this my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent though indulgent Petition. It is you that onely can, and I hope will ſtand their friend in this their ſorrowfull and deplorable extremity. Yea, upon you are their eyes fixt, their hearts grounded, and on your mature and ſage conſideration their principall, yea onely hopes depend, who (both I and they) with ſuch Forces as your Honours ſhall be pleaſed to grant as Auxiliaries, ſhall be ready to venter life and limbe for regaining of our loſt honour, and the maintenance of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Vertue.</p>
