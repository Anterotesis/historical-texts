         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Argument of the Sermon taught me to lay
aside mine own judgment touching the expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or seasonablenesse of this action, seeing the
judgments of so many godly and learned Brethren
concur for it. I have this advantage and benefit
by the publishing of it, that I may return some

then even mine own judgment in such sad and
calamitous times could otherwise willingly have
allowed it to be. Yet it will be a farther accession
unto this content, if you shall be pleased to accept
of this poor part of my labours, first preached in
your hearing, and now submitted to your view;
from him, whose hearts desire and prayer is,
That the Lord (whose you are, and whom you

was pleased at the same

               <hi>David:</hi> After his

               <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> after he had been raised up by a great

upon which the Lord revealed unto him
his purpose of leading his people and children
into captivity, and giving up his Treasures into
the hands of the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> which caused
him to humble himself for the pride of his heart.

So with<note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> hee was caught up to the third

him a <hi>thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to

there is something of<note n="*" place="margin">Camero tom. 2. pag. 50, 60. in quarto.</note> speciall honour therein
bestowed upon <hi>Peter.</hi> We read in Scripture of a
two-fold foundation of the Church; A <hi>personall
foundation,</hi> which is but one; for <hi>other foundation
can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
1 Cor.</hi> 3. 11. And a <hi>Doctrinal foundation;</hi> for
the Church is said to be <hi>built upon the foundation of
the Prophets and Apostles, Ephes.</hi> 2. 20. and so we
read of <hi>Twelve foundations</hi> in the new Jerusalem,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 14. Now, amongst these, as <hi>Peter</hi> had
the precedence in faith, to make the <hi>first confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of Christ to be the Messiah; so hee had the
honour to be the first of those twelve Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who should first of all plant the Gospel, and
gather a Church unto Christ after his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we finde he did, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. In which respect
haply it is, that the <hi>Gospel of the Circumcision</hi> is said
to have been <hi>committed unto Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. 7, 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100399:5"/>
the Gospel was by Christs appointment to
be first of all preached to the Jews, who were God's
first-born, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. and 13. 46. <hi>Exod</hi> 4. 22.</p>
            <p>Now from this time of <hi>Peter's Confession,</hi> Christ
(to take off all mistakes touching his Kingdom)
began to acquaint his Disciples with his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
whereat <hi>Peter</hi> is presently offended, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
upon him to advise his Master, and rebuke
him, <hi>Be it far from thee, this shall not be unto thee.</hi>
Hereupon Christ sharply reprehends him: It is
not now, Thou art <hi>Peter;</hi> but, Thou art <hi>Satan,</hi>
a Tempter, * an Adversary to the work of Christs
mediation; (for, so much the word elsewhere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
<hi>Num. 22. 22. 2 Sam. 19. 22.)</hi> not now a stone
for building, but a stone * of offence; <hi>Thou savour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not the things of God, but the things which are of
men:</hi> that is, Thou hast a carnal and corrupt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of me, and of my Kingdom, conceiving of
it according to the common apprehensions and
expectations of men, and not according to the
counsell and will of God.</p>
            <p>In this Reprehension there is 1. A personal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption,
<hi>ver. 22. 2.</hi> Doctrinall Instruction; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
his Disciples and the people, That all they
who would (as <hi>Peter</hi> had done) own him for the
Messiah and King of the Church, must not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
themselves great things under him in the
world, but must resolve to walk in the steps which
he would tread out before them, <hi>viz. To deny
themselves</hi> as he did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 42. and to bear a
<hi>Crosse,</hi> as he also did, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 17. and so <hi>to follow
him.</hi> And to take off all prejudice and scandall,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100399:5"/>
he assures them, That whatever their fears and
suspicions might be of so hard a service, yet thus
<hi>to deny</hi> themselves was the onely way <hi>to save</hi>
themselves, <hi>vers.</hi> 25, 26. and thus to bear a <hi>Cross</hi>
the only way to a <hi>Crown</hi> and glorious reward,
<hi>vers.</hi> 27. which, lest it should seem an empty
promise without evidence and assurance, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to confirme shortly after by an ocular
and sensible demonstration, <hi>vers.</hi> 28. which we
may understand either of his <hi>glorious transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
the week after, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 1, 2. or of his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Ascension</hi> in their sight, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9. or of his
<hi>pouring forth the holy Spirit</hi> upon them in fiery
Tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 2, 3. or of his more full mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of his Kingdom and Glory unto his
servant <hi>Iohn</hi> by the ministery of Angels, in his
<hi>glorious Revelation, Apoc.</hi> 1. 1. Unto all which
(though the context seeme to relate principally
unto the first) may that promise of our Saviour
be understood to refer.</p>
            <p>The words then are a <hi>Character of a Disciple</hi> of
Christ; He is one who must <hi>deny himself,</hi> and that
not in some more easie matters; but thorowly,
and in all things, so far as <hi>suffering,</hi> and suffering
to the uttermost, <hi>Pain, Death, Shame,</hi> for those
three things are contained in the <hi>Cross;</hi> and all
this, first, <hi>willingly;</hi> he must <hi>take up</hi> his Cross, it
must be an act of election, not of compulsion.
Secondly, <hi>Obediently,</hi> to do it with this resolution,
<hi>of following Christ;</hi> both his Command and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
as a <hi>Lord,</hi> because he requires it; as a
<hi>Leader,</hi> because he goes before us in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100399:6"/>
I have singled out the Argument of <hi>Self-Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
to speak of, in this reverend and grave Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as being very suteable to the state, not only
of Christians always, but more particularly of
these present times wherein we live, and of those
special businesses wherewith we are intrusted:
wherein, having in two or three words considered
what is meant by <hi>Denying,</hi> and what by a <hi>mans
self,</hi> I shall briefly dispatch the Doctrinal part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those premises.</p>
            <p>For the first, the Original word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
emphatical, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> notes, and signifieth
not simply <hi>negare,</hi> but <hi>pernegare,</hi> or <hi>prorsus nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
totally, utterly to deny, not at all to spare or
regard, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi>
and <hi>Suidas:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. Suid. in voce <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> it importeth a perfect or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Denial. It is rendred by <hi>Beza, Abdicet seipsum,</hi>
which is as much as to reject and cast off, as a man
doth a graceless son, whom he will not owne any
more for his, which is the same thing in a Family
with that which the Law calls <hi>Ignominiosa missio</hi>
in an Army.</p>
            <p>For the second,<note place="margin">Leg. 2. D. de iis qui notantur infamiâ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Man</hi> is taken most ordinarily
three wayes in Scripture, either in respect to his
<hi>Creation,</hi> or to his <hi>Traduction,</hi> or to his <hi>Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
the <hi>Natural man,</hi> the <hi>Old man,</hi> and the <hi>New
man;</hi> and so consequently by a <hi>man's self</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
first, a man's <hi>sinfull self;</hi> (to put
that branch in the first place for our method of
proceeding) which the Apostle calls the <hi>Old
man, Ephes.</hi> 4. 22. The <hi>Earthly Adam, 1 Cor. 15.
47,</hi> 48. The <hi>Body of Death, Rom.</hi> 7. 24. The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100399:6"/>
               <hi>Carnal minde, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. Our <hi>Earthly members,
Col.</hi> 3. 5. in which sense to <hi>Deny a mans self,</hi> is in
the Apostles phrase, to <hi>Deny ungodliness and
worldly lusts, Tit.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man's <hi>natural self:</hi> and that 1. in
regard of <hi>Being</hi> and substance, and so it imp<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orts
our life, which is the continuance and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Being:</hi> And the faculties and powers
of nature, our understanding, will, appetites,
senses, fleshly members. 2. In regard of <hi>Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being,</hi>
or the outward Ornaments and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of life, which may all be reduced unto
three heads; 1. external <hi>Relations,</hi> as between
husband and wife, parent and childe, brother and
brother, friend and friend, &amp;c. 2. Special <hi>Gifts</hi>
and endowments, as Learning, Wisdom, Power,
or any other abilities of mind or body. 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Ends,</hi> which naturally men pursue and seek
after, and are all by the Apostle comprized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
three Heads, of Profit, Pleasure, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
<hi>the lusts of the eyes, the lusts of the flesh, and
the pride of life, 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 16. Houses, Lands,
Lordships, great possessions: fleshly, worldly,
natural, unnatural, artificial delights: Liberty,
Praise, Favour, Applause, Preferment: any thing
from which a man doth draw any kind of content
or satisfaction in order to himself.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a Man's morall, vertuous, <hi>Renewed
self;</hi> for as <hi>Lusts</hi> are the members of the Old
man, so <hi>Graces</hi> are the members of the New man;
and as the <hi>first Adam</hi> begets us <hi>after his image,
Gen.</hi> 5. 3. so the <hi>second Adam</hi> regenerates us <hi>after
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100399:7"/>
his Image, Col. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 15. 49. Rom.</hi> 8. 29.
From the one we receive Lust for Lust, and from
the other Grace for Grace.</p>
            <p>Now these things being thus premised, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto this threefold <hi>Self,</hi> there are three
branches of this duty of <hi>Self-Denial:</hi> For some
things are to be denied simply and absolutely;
some things conditionally and upon supposition;
and some things comparatively and in certaine
respects.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Absolutely</hi> and Simply, so a man is to Deny
his <hi>sinfull felf,</hi> and that two wayes; first, <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi>
as it importeth the whole Body of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Concupiscence, which we are to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
and subdue, to crucifie and revenge the
Blood of Christ against it, <hi>Colos. 3. 5. Rom</hi> 8. 13.
whereunto is required a formal and perpetual
endeavour by actual exercise of grace, because
things <hi>Natural</hi> (as Lust is) though they be never
so much altered and abated for the time, will
yet <hi>ex se,</hi> return and reduce themselves to their
original state and strength again, if they be not
still kept under. As a stone will fall down to its
natural place by its own inclination, as soon as
the impressed force which carried it upward is
worn out; and water will reduce it self unto its
natural coldness, if fire be not constantly kept
under it. Neither may we expect, that because
grace belongs unto our renewed nature, therefore
it should with the same natural facility suppress
Lust, as Lust without the workings of grace
would return to its natural vigour and force
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100399:7"/>
again: For there is this remarkable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Lust and Grace, That the workings of
Lust are totally <hi>ab intus,</hi> as to the root of them,
and require not any forraign force or activity to
concurr with them, or to set them on motion; and
therefore though weakned, they are still offering
to return to their strength again. But the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Grace, though partly <hi>ab intus,</hi> when vitall
principles and spiritual habits are infused, do yet
require an actual concurrence, cooperation, and
assistance of the Spirit of Christ immediatly as
from him;<note place="margin">Illo operante cooperamur.</note> for, it is <hi>he who worketh in us for to
Will and to Do:</hi> As there is an aptness in a weapon
to cut,<note place="margin">Aug. de nat. &amp; grat. c. 31.</note> in a wheele to move; yet that cutteth not,
this moveth not,<note place="margin">Non tantum u<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> arbor sit bona, scd ut faciat fructus bonos, eâdem gratiâ nacessarium est ut adjuvetur de Grat. Christi. lib. 1. cap. 19. Velle &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere meum est, sed ipsum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fine Dei semper auxilio non erit meum. Hieron. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om. 2. epist. 197.</note> without a further vital faculty
applying it to these uses. And therefore though
there be no need of labour for Lust to recover
strength, (because it is naturally apt to return
thereunto of it self) yet there is need of much
diligence, and earnest waiting upon Christ by
Faith and Prayer, for the continued supplies of
his Spirit, whereby the Graces which are in us
may be kept on work in the constant mortifying
and subduing of our Lusts, because the habits
of Grace infused do not work alone of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without such supplies. Secondly, <hi>Specially,</hi>
in regard of these <hi>personal</hi> Corruptions which
we in our particulars are more notably carried
unto, which <hi>David</hi> calls the keeping of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from his <hi>own iniquity, Psal.</hi> 18. 23. for,
though natural corruption, where-ever it is, be
a Seminary of all sin, yet in particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100399:8"/>
it usually putteth it self forth more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in some particular sins. As the sap of the
Earth is the <hi>fomes</hi> and matter of all kinde of
fruits; yet in one ground it sorts better with
Wheat, in another with Barley; in this Tree it
becomes a Grape, in another an Olive: so ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin in one man runs most into Avarice,
in another into Sensuality, in a third into Pride
and Vain-glory, and the like. We read of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
sins, the lying and laziness of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
Tit.</hi> 1. 12. the curiosity and inquisitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17. 21. the pride and
cruelty of the <hi>Babylonians, Isai.</hi> 47. the robbery
of the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Caldeans, Iob</hi> 1. 15. 17. And
we read of Personal sins, the stubbornness of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the gainsaying of <hi>Corah,</hi> the envy of
<hi>Saul,</hi> the churlishness of <hi>Nabal,</hi> the ambition
of <hi>Absolom,</hi> the intemperance of <hi>Felix,</hi> the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
of <hi>Simon Magus, &amp;c.</hi> Thus particular
persons have their more proper sins, whereby
they have most of all dishonoured God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
his Spirit, neglected and resisted his Grace,
and defiled their own Consciences; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Conversation, though Repentance, as an
Hound, drive the whole Herd of sin before it,
yet the dart of the Word sticks most in this sin,
which is thereby singled out for a more particular
detestation.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Conditionlly,</hi> and upon supposition of
God's special <hi>Call,</hi> and in that sense we are to
<hi>Deny our natural self,</hi> which we are the rather
to do; first, because God calls no man to deny
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100399:8"/>
his whole self, and <hi>wholly</hi> to all purposes, at
any time or in any case. He allows us, yea, he
requires us to seek the good of our souls, to seek
any thing without the which we cannot be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
to promote by all means our own salvation,
to seek our selves out of our selves, in Christ and
in his Righteousness. Secondly, because he never
calls us unto any either morose and cruel, or
superstitious <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> such as is that of the
covetous worldling, who when he wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he desires, wanteth power and an
heart to eat thereof, and bereaveth himself of
good, though the things which God gives, he
gives them unto us to enjoy, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 8. &amp; 6. 2.
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. or as that of <hi>Baal's</hi> Priests,<note place="margin">Vid. Hospinian de Orig. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach. l. 6. c. 30. &amp; de festis, lib. 2. cap. 30. Clavis Reg. Sacerd. lib. 8. cap. 7. §. 5.</note> and
the Sect of the <hi>Flagellantes,</hi> who cut and whip'd
themselves in their frantick devotions, as <hi>Saire</hi>
the Cafuist telleth us of <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Benedict,</hi>
two Founders of the regular Devotions or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they
were wont to cast themselves naked into Snow,
and amongst Thornes to vex their bodies. A
notable Relation of which kinde of <hi>Self-Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
(I know not whether more nastie or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious)
a learned and grave Divine of ours
hath largely collected out of <hi>Climacus</hi> and <hi>Lewes</hi>
of <hi>Granada,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Downham part. 4. lib. 1. cap. 4. §. 4.</note> in the fourth part of his Christian
Warfare.</p>
            <p>But we are then <hi>called</hi> by God to <hi>Deny our
selves,</hi> our Reason, Wisdom, Parts, Learning, Ease,
Wealth, Lands, Houses, Honour, Favour, Credit,
Applause, Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Life,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100399:9"/>
whatsoever is dearest unto us, whensoever it
stands in <hi>Opposition</hi> unto, or in <hi>Competition</hi> with
Christ, his Glory, Kingdom, or Command. In
which sense we are to deny our selves <hi>Alwayes,</hi> in
<hi>praeparatione animae:</hi> And <hi>Actually,</hi> whensoever
any thing dear unto us is inconsistent with the
Conscience of our duty to God. And thus (to
instance onely in our own profession) <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
neither Liberty, nor Life, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Gospel of Grace, and of the Name
of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Acts 20. 24. Acts</hi> 21. 13. Nor
<hi>Micaiah</hi> his safety or reputation in <hi>Ahab's</hi> Court,
1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. 14. Nor <hi>Levi</hi> his father or mother, or
brethren, or children in the zeal of God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 9. Nor <hi>Ezekiel</hi> his dear wife,
the delight of his eyes, when God took her
away with a stroke, and forbad him to mourn
for her, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 16, 17, 18. Nor <hi>Matthew</hi>
his receipt of Custome, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 27. Nor
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> their Nets, their Ships, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when they were called to follow Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>In this case things are to be denied two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of wayes: First, as <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Snares,</hi>
when they are either <hi>Baits</hi> to draw us into sin,
or are themselves the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>wages</hi> of sin.
When they are <hi>Baits</hi> unto sin; <hi>If thy brother</hi>
(saith the Lord) <hi>the son of thy mother, or the
son of thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosome, or
thy friend which is as thine own soul, entice thee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which
thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers, &amp;c.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100399:9"/>
Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto
him, neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt
thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou
shalt surely kill him, thine hand shall be first against
him to put him to death, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 13. 6, 9. Though
an Idol be made of Silver and Gold, yet being an
Idol, it must be thrown away with detestation like
a menstruous Cloth, <hi>Isai.</hi> 30. 22. If <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
offered money for the gifts of the Spirit, the
Apostle doth abhorr so abominable a negotiation,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. 20. Even the Brasen Serpent when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a snare by the abuse of men, is no longer
preserved as a Monument of mercy, but broken
in pieces as <hi>Nehushtan,</hi> a piece of brass, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
16. 4. When they are themselves the <hi>fruits</hi> and
<hi>wages</hi> of sin: so <hi>Zaeheus</hi> denies himself in all his
unjust gaine, which he had gotten by sycophancy
and defraudation, and when Christ offers to
come into his house, will not suffer <hi>Mammon</hi> to
shut the door against him, <hi>Luke 19. 8. Restitution,</hi>
as it is a most necessary, so it is one of the hardest
parts of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> when a covetous heart must
be forced to vomit up all its sweet morsels again.
Unjust Gaine is like a barbed arrow, it kills if it
stay within the body, and it teares, and pulls the
flesh away with it if it be drawn out;<note place="margin">Forte per angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stam tenuis vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecula rimam Repserat in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meram fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, &amp;c. Hor. cpi. li. 7.</note> as the Fox in
the Fable, which having crept in at a narrow hole
to feede on a prey, and being filled was grown too
big to make an escape at the same passage, was
constrained for saving his life to empty and starve
himself again, that he might go out by the same
way as he came in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100399:10"/>
II. As <hi>oblation</hi> and <hi>sacrifices,</hi> whensoever Christ
calls us to dedicate them unto him: when <hi>Abraham</hi>
was called from his country into a land of so journ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which he knew not: when <hi>Daniel</hi> was called
from a King's Court to a den of Lions: when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
from the honours of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the afflictions of
God's people: when the Disciples from their nets
and their ships to follow Christ, and wait upon a
persecuted Ministry: when <hi>Paul</hi> from an <hi>active</hi> to
a <hi>passive</hi> persecution, immediatly they consulted
not with flesh and blood, but willingly left their
own comforts to obey Gods commands. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
the uses, the property of all we have is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;
all our vessels, all our merchandize must be
superscribed with a new title, <hi>Holiness to the Lord,
Isa. 23. 18. Zech.</hi> 14. 20, 21. Then mens chief care
will be to honour the Lord with their substance,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 9. to bring their Sons, their Silver, their
Gold to the name of the Lord, the holy One of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
Isa.</hi> 60. 9. All we are, or have, we have it on
this condition, to use it, to leave it, to lay it out, to
lay it down, unto the honour of our Master, from
whose bounty we received it.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> and in some respect so we are
to deny our <hi>Renewed self,</hi> our very vertues and
graces. In the nature and notion of <hi>duties,</hi> so we
are bound to seek, to pray for, to practice, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
to treasure up, and exceedingly to value
them: but in <hi>relation unto righteousness,</hi> in the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>Covenant</hi> of life and salvation, and in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison</hi>
of Christ, so we must esteem <hi>all things losse
for the excellency of the knowledg of Christ Iesus our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100399:10"/>
Lord,<note place="margin">Qui docet in opera confidere, is negat meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Christi suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere. <hi>Ferus in Act. 15. August.</hi>
                  </note> Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10. It is a dangerous thing to hang
the weight of a soul upon any thing which hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mixture of weakness, imperfection, or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in it, as the purest and best of all our <hi>duties</hi> have.
<hi>Vae etiam laudabili vitae hominum, si remotâ miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ
discutias eam.</hi> It is a dangerous thing to
teach, that Faith, or any other evangelical vertue, as
it is a <hi>work</hi> done by us, doth justifie, or succeed in
the place of legall obedience unto the purpose of
life. There is nothing to be called our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but <hi>Iehova tzidkenu, Ier.</hi> 23. 6. Faith justifies
as the window may be said to enlighten, because it
alone is apt (which no other part of the structure
is) to convey and transmit that light which ariseth
out of, and belongeth unto another body, and
not unto it; therefore it doth not justifie <hi>habitually,</hi>
as a thing fixed in us; but <hi>instrumentally,</hi> as that
which receives and lets in the righteousness of
<hi>Christ,</hi> shining through it upon us; as the Cup feeds
by the Wine which it conveys; as the Looking-glass
maketh the wall to glister, by reflecting the
beam of the Sun from it self upon it.</p>
            <p>The sum of all in one word, is this: We all profess
our selves to be <hi>Disciples</hi> of Christ, and Candidates
of glory and immortality by him, and we have all
promised to <hi>follow him</hi> whithersoever he leads us.
Now whosoever will be in truth, what he is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and profession, must learn this fundamentall
duty, to <hi>deny himself,</hi> willingly and obediently to
forsake all <hi>sin,</hi> to subdue all <hi>general</hi> concupiscence,
with his own proper and <hi>personal</hi> corruptions, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
without any limitation or exception. To
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100399:11"/>
cast away and forsake, <hi>alwayes,</hi> in preparation of
heart; and <hi>actually,</hi> whensoever Christ calls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<hi>whatsoever</hi> is neer or dear unto him, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it becomes either a snare to conscience, as a
<hi>baite</hi> unto, or <hi>fruit</hi> of sin: or a sacrifice unto <hi>God,</hi>
as matter of duty: to undervalue and disesteem the
best of all his <hi>graces</hi> in respect of the righteousness
of Christ, and <hi>in order to justification</hi> in the sight
of God: looking on every thing, being, well-being,
outward enjoyments, inward abilities, vertues,
graces, as matters of no rate or estimation, when
Christ and the conscience of duty standeth in
competition with them.</p>
            <p>I have done with the Doctrinal part of this
point, and am sorry to have so long detained a
learned Auditory with things so fully known unto
them before. I now proceed to Application.</p>
            <p>It is said when Christ preached this Doctrine,
that he called the people unto him with his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 34. My Exhortation proportionably
unto you and my self shall be double. One as we
are the <hi>people</hi> of Christ, the other as we are his
<hi>Disciples,</hi> and <hi>Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the people of Christ, let us be exhorted,</p>
            <p>I. To take heed of that sin which is formally
opposite unto <hi>Self-denial,</hi> as a sin most pernicious
and obstructive to salvation, which is the sin of
<hi>Self-love,</hi> or self-estimation; a most comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and seminal lust, which lies at the root of
every other sin: for, unto the formality of every
sin belongeth an inordinate conversion of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unto it self, and therefore it is set by the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100399:11"/>
Apostle as Commander in chief in the head of a
whole Regiment of sins, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 5. It branches
it self into two great sins, <hi>Self-seeking,</hi> as an end,
and <hi>Self-depending,</hi> as a means unto that end,
(for, he that worketh for himself, will work from
himself too.)</p>
            <p>

upon a will wedded unto it self. Now this kind
of Self-love our Saviour here telleth us is indeed
the greatest Self-hatred that can be. <hi>Whosoever

his life for my sake, shall find it,</hi> v. 25. Our <hi>love</hi> and
our <hi>life</hi> should still go together; for, all things
are loved in order to life. That onely may be the
<hi>terminus</hi> of our love, which is the fountain of
our life. If any man have his life from himself,
that man's love may rest in himself. Now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

into the Sea, and do not stay within themselves,
and so are kept from being harmfull. If the Sun
should keep its light, the Clouds their rain, the
Earth its sap unto themselves, what use were there
of them, or benefit by them? God hath made all
things in such a sweet subordination, that each one
serving that which is above it self, inanimate ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and both man, and man God; all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

and obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self-depending</hi> is, when we put confidence (for
<hi>Spirituall ends,</hi> which respect righteousnesse and
salvation) in our <hi>graces,</hi> expecting pardon of sin,
favour with God, and finall happinesse from our
own duties; as the Jews did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. And
when for other <hi>Civill</hi> and publick ends wee put
confidence in Men, Counsels, Horses, Treasures,
in an <hi>Arm of flesh,</hi> rising and sinking, confiding
and drooping or desponding, according as second
causes doe ebb or flow: A sin which in these
times wee are too much guilty of, and whereby
God being so greatly provoked, might justly
leave us to our selves, that when wee finde our
selves <hi>fatherlesse,</hi> we might be driven more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to finde <hi>mercy in him.</hi> It is a sin very injurious
to the Love, Power, Wisdome, Mercy, Truth
of God, upon which Attributes of his our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100399:12"/>
should cast anchor; For all these are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,</hi>
alwayes the same, ever equally neer
unto us, tender of us, ready to engage themselves
for us: And therefore there should not be such
changes, such risings and fallings in our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon him. But wee weak men are like a
Ship at anchor; though the anchor be fastned
unto a sure Rock, which moveth not, yet the Ship
notwithstanding is subject still to tossings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse,
when windes and wayes beat upon it:
So, though our anchor and confidence have a
sure and stedfast ground to keep it unmovable;
yet according to the different aspect of second
causes, our hearts are too apt to waver and
change; one while to say with <hi>David, I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be moved;</hi> and presently, upon the turne of
things, to be faint and troubled againe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee should pray and labour for a more stable
and composed frame of heart: Say not one while,
The enemy is strong, now we shall be devoured:
say not another time, The enemy is weak, now
we shall prevail, and have an end of trouble. But
let us learn to <hi>sanctifie the Lord God of Hosts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in our hearts, let him be our fear, and let him be
our hope:</hi> when he humbleth us, let us <hi>fear,</hi> and
yet still <hi>trust</hi> in him, because if we repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
hee will lift us up; (for, it <hi>is all one with him
to help, whether with many, or them that have no
power.)</hi> And when hee exalteth us, let us <hi>rejoyce,</hi>
and yet still <hi>tremble;</hi> because if we be proud, and
provoke him, hee lifteth us up in anger, that hee
may make our ruine and fall the greater, as the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100399:13"/>
Psalmist speaks, <hi>Thou hast lifted me up, and cast
me down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Let us be the more earnestly exhorted unto
the practise of this duty, by how much the more
necessary it is, and foundamental unto salvation:
for which purpose let us learn and put in use
these few brief, but excellent Rules. 1. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
the Word and <hi>Counsel</hi> of God in our <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
In matters of Faith, Worship, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
let us fetch our light from him, and not
<hi>lean on our own wisdom, nor be wise in our own
eyes, Prov. 23. 4. Isai.</hi> 5. 21. nor suffer natural and
carnal reasonings to elude and shift off any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truth, whereby lust should be restrained,
and conscience guided. 2. To exalt the <hi>authority</hi>
of God in our <hi>wills,</hi> to say as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Lord, what
wilt thou have me to do?</hi> This is the great point
upon which all duty hangs. The principal point
in difference between God and sinners is, whose
Will shall stand,<note place="margin">Serm. 3. de Resurrect.</note> his or theirs. <hi>Cesset voluntas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria,
non erit infernus,</hi> said <hi>Bernard</hi> truly: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Will, and you conquer Hell. 3. To exalt
the <hi>honour</hi> of God in all our <hi>aimes.</hi> Let us be
willing that it go well or ill with our selves,
according as the one or the other doth most
make for God's glory, and for the advancing of
his Name; to say as <hi>David, If I shall find favour in
the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and shew
me his habitation: But if he thus say, I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in thee, behold here am I, let him do to me as
seemeth good unto him, 2 Sam.</hi> 15. 25, 26. To say
with <hi>Iob,</hi> cap. 1. 21. as well when he taketh away
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100399:13"/>
when he giveth, <hi>Blessed be his Name.</hi> To say with
<hi>Paul, Let Christ be magnified in my body; whether it be
by life or by death, Phil.</hi> 1. 20. It is fitter that he should
have his <hi>honour,</hi> then that we should have our <hi>ease.</hi>
It may be our <hi>prayer,</hi> that he would glorifie himself
in our deliverance; but it must be our <hi>choice,</hi> rather
not to be delivered, then that he should not be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
If thou wilt (Lord) be glorified by our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
we shall admire and magnifie thy mercy;
But if thou wilt be glorified by our destruction,
we must needs adore thy dominion over us, and
acknowledg thy righteous judgment in procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
against us. Lastly, To set up the <hi>love</hi> of
Christ and his Church uppermost in our <hi>hearts:</hi>
this <hi>love will constrain us,</hi> and make us willing to
be offered up in the publick service: to say with
<hi>Ionah, Cast me into the sea,</hi> so the tempest may be
stilled: to say with <hi>Esther, I If perish, I perish:</hi> to say
with <hi>Paul, I will very gladly spend &amp; be spent, though
the more abundantly I love, the less I be loved:</hi> and, <hi>we
are glad when we are weak, and you are strong.</hi> This
publick Love will cry down all private interest,
and make us say to our selves as <hi>Elisha</hi> to <hi>Gehazi, Is
this a time to receive money, and to receive garments,
and olive-yards, and vine-yards, and sheep, and
oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants? 2 Kin.
5.</hi> 16. and as <hi>Ieremy</hi> to <hi>Baruch, The Lord is breaking
down, and plucking up; and seekest thou great things
for thy self? seek them not, Ier.</hi> 45. 4, 5. Certainly,
that man cannot without great repentance and
restitution expect mercy from Christ, who, so he
may promote his own private and sordid ends,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100399:14"/>
               <hi>quocunque modo,</hi> and make a prey and merchandize
of the calamity of his brethren, and the times;
cares not how he defraud, spoile, devoure, suck
from the publick into his own Cisterne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
not which way the Church or the State fall,
back or edge, sinke or swim, so he may sleep in a
whole skin, and secure his own stake, and fish in
troubled waters, and with the unjust Steward, write
down fifty for an hundred; and like a Fly, suck
fatnesse and nourishment unto himself out of the
wounds and sores, out of the blood and tears, out
of the ruines and calamities of other men. Surely,
if ever God's hands were <hi>clapped at any dishonest
gain;</hi> if ever the <hi>flying roll</hi> did seize upon the houses
of perjurious robbers, to consume the Timber and
the Stones thereof: if ever the curse of <hi>Gehazi</hi> did
attend upon ill-gotten treasures; if ever <hi>Salt and
Brimstome</hi> were spread upon lands purchased with
iniquity: if ever fire did devour the habitations of
injustice: if ever a wo did hunt those who increase
that which is not their own, and build with blood:
if ever the <hi>stone did cry out of the wall,</hi> and the beam
out of the timber answer it: if ever the <hi>furrows of
the field did complain,</hi> and call for thistles in stead
of wheat, and cockle in stead of barly: such men as
these must expect that the wrath of God will min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
gall and bitternesse with such wages of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they are sure never to enjoy them in their lives
with comfort, nor to leave them at their deaths in
peace, nor to transmit them to their posterity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a canker and curse. <hi>The robbery of the wicked
shall destroy them. Pro.</hi> 21. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100399:14"/>
Now then for the quickning of us to this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
duty, there are two notable encouragements
in the text. 1. It enableth us to <hi>take up our cross,</hi>
meekly, willingly, obediently to accept, and bear
whatsoever affliction God shall lay upon us. The
less we value our selves, the better able shall we be
to digest any troubles that befall us. We are not
moved at the breaking of an earthen or wodden
vessel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if a Diamond or rich Jewel be defaced,
it doth greatly affect us the more vile we are in our
own eyes, the more unmoved we shall be when any
bruize or breach is made upon us. Who am I, that
I should fret against God, or cavill at the ways of
his providence? that I should think my self wise
enough to teach, or great enough to swell against
the will of my Master? why should the servant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
his back too delicate to bear the burden, or
his hands too tender to do the work which his
Master was pleased to bear, and to do before him?
Did Christ bear a crosse to save me? and shall not
I do the same to serve him? did he bear <hi>His,</hi> the
heaviest that ever lay on the shoulders of a man?
and shall not I bear <hi>mine,</hi> which he by his hath
made so light and easie? Surely, if we could have
spiritual apprehensions of things as they are in the
eyes of God, Angels, and good men, shame would
be esteemed a matter of honor and glorying, when
it is for Christ. The Apostles went away from the
presence of the Counsel rejoycing, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 41. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that they were <hi>honored with
dishonor,</hi> or had the dignity conferred upon them
to suffer shame for the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100399:15"/>
2. It enableth us to <hi>follow Christ</hi> in all duties of
obedience. When I can say, <hi>not my will,</hi> I shall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, <hi>Thy will be done;</hi> I shall follow him as a <hi>Lord.</hi>
No so necessary a qualification to <hi>service,</hi> as <hi>self-denial:</hi>
Christ himself, though by the dignity of
his person he were free, yet being in the form of a
servant, did <hi>not seek, nor do his own will, but the will of
him that sent him.</hi> Joh. 5. 30. &amp; 6. 38. I shall follow
him as an <hi>example:</hi> for what he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands us to do,
to the doing thereof he encourageth us by his own
example, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 15. Legal obedience is in <hi>hearing
and doing;</hi> but Evangelical obedience for the most
part is in <hi>hearing and imitating, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 21. For
this end we were predestinated, unto this we were
called, that we might be <hi>conformed unto him, hear
him in all things whatsoever he shall say,</hi> Act. 3. 22.
<hi>and follow him wheresoever he shall go,</hi> Rev. 14. 4. To
give up our selves in all things unto his <hi>wisdom</hi> to
counsel, and unto his <hi>will</hi> to command us, and in no
service of his to confer with flesh or blood. This is
the highest &amp; noblest disposition of a child of God,
and that wherein he most resembleth Christ, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
and prescinde all <hi>self-respects</hi> in every thing
wherein his Master is to be served and glorified.
<hi>Self-seeking</hi> ever proceeds from <hi>lowness of mind.</hi>
The more truly &amp; spiritually noble any man is, the
more publick-spirited for God's honour, and the
good of Church and State. Look among the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and you will ever finde, that those who live
onely to and for themselves, are either <hi>base</hi> or <hi>wild,</hi>
mean, or tyrannicall. Worms, caterpillars, weezles,
mice, rats, live and eat only for themselves; this is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100399:15"/>
their <hi>basenesse.</hi> Lions, Wolves, Leopards, Tigers,
prey and ravine onely for themselves; they plow
not your land, carry not your burdens, submit not
to your commands; this is their <hi>wildnesse.</hi> But
the noblest creatures, as Sun, Moon, Stars, have
spheres of activity, wherein they work for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good, and the more large their sphere, the
more noble their nature. God hath planted a kind
of <hi>natural self-denial</hi> in all creatures. Light things
will move downward, and heavie things will
move upward, to preserve the compages of nature
from a rupture. And he hath planted a kind of
<hi>Morall Self-deniall</hi> in very Heathen men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they preferre the publick safety and interest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
themselves. As <hi>Pompey</hi> answered the man
who would have disswaded him from going upon
a publick, but dangerous Expedition, <hi>Necesse est ut
eam, non ut vivam.</hi> But we are never enough out
of our selves, till Christ have taken the spoils of us,
and divided all that is in us unto himself and his
Church; and enabled us, when Satan calls upon
Wit, to be wanton or scurrilous: upon Reason, to
be proud and hereticall: upon Will, to be stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
and froward: upon Passion, to be disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and violent: upon Power, to be insolent and
injurious: upon Wisdome, to be cunning and
crooked: upon Learning, to be flatulent and aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
upon Wealth, to be luxurious: upon Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of minde, to be ambitious, or the like:
to answer, I am neither <hi>Yours,</hi> nor mine <hi>owne;</hi> I
am bought with a price, and his I am who so dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bought me. He denyed himself to purchase
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100399:16"/>
me, I will deny my self to serve him: I will not
be so unwise as to lose my soule by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
for the saving of it; or to forfeit Christ by
serving his enemy, and so ruine my self. I have
done with the exhortation which respects us as the
<hi>People</hi> of Christ: And come in the last place to the
other which concerns us as his <hi>Disciples</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
            <p>It consisteth of two branches. 1. That we would
pray for, 2. That we would practice this excellent
duty. For motives unto both which let us seriously
consider,</p>
            <p>1. That nothing in the world is more dangerous
to the publick welfare of States or Churches,
then private <hi>self-seeking.</hi> One false tooth or notch
in a wheele will spoile the motion of an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
instrument. One string in a Lute which
hath a private tune of its own, dissonant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious
to all the rest, will corrupt the whole
Musick: one self-seeker who would be baited
with a wedge of gold, and a Babylonish garment,
had almost brought mischief upon the camp of
<hi>Israel. Private Interest</hi> will ever obstruct pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
duties: <hi>what shall I do for the hundred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents?</hi>
will be a strong objection against a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
resolution. It was private interest made <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
oppresse <hi>Israel,</hi> that they might not grow too
strong and potent a people, <hi>Exo.</hi> 1. 10. It was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
interest made <hi>Ieroboam</hi> set up the Calves at
<hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> least unity of worship should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the ten tribes to the house of <hi>David</hi> again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12. 26, 27, 28. It was private interest made

the <hi>Iews</hi> crucifie the Lord of glory, <hi>If we let this
man alone, the Romans will come and destroy our place
and Nation, Ioh.</hi> 11. 48. (for indeed there was a
publick fame and expectation of a great Prince to
arise out of <hi>Iudea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Praecrebuerat oriente toto ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; constans Opinio esse in fatis, ut eo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Iudaeâ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecti rerum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirentur. <hi>Suct. in Vespasiano, cap.</hi> 4.</note> who was to rule over all the

interest made <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the crafts-men
cry up <hi>Diana,</hi> and cry down the Gospel, <hi>Act. 19. 24
27.</hi> As little ditches joyned to the sides of a great
River, will draw it away from its own channell; or
as a Wen, or some other unnatural excrescency will
suck away unto it self nourishment from the whole
body.</p>
            <p>2. On the other hand, That <hi>self-denial</hi> is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
preparation unto great services: the more low
and useless we are in our own eyes, the fitter we are
to be imploied by God, who powreth the oyl of his
grace <hi>in vasa co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trita,</hi> into broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vessels. When God
offred <hi>Mos.</hi> to destroy <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; make of him a great
nation, he hath no heart to such preferment, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate-affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the people of God swallow'd up
his family-affection, &amp; all regard to all domestical
interests, <hi>Ex.</hi> 32. 10. 11. So <hi>Ioshua</hi> his successor divided
the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> amongst the Tribes, &amp; had no
portion allotted for himself till the publick was ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and that by the care of the people, <hi>Ios.</hi> 19. 48.
when the pepole of God were afflicted in <hi>Nehemiah's</hi>
time, he was so far from adding therunto by any act
of oppression or violence, that he remitted much of
his own right, and <hi>refused to eat the bread of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100399:17"/>
Neh. 5. 14. Solomon</hi> prays not for riches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
or any matter of private advantage, but for a
publick grace, the spirit of wisdom for government,
1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 3. 9. He had the <hi>heart of a Governor</hi> before, &amp;
that taught him to pray for the <hi>head</hi> of a <hi>Governor</hi>
too. How low was <hi>David</hi> in his own eys, when God
took him to feed his people? <hi>Who am I? what is my
Father's house, that thou hast brought mee hitherto?
2 Sam.</hi> 7. 28. How doth <hi>Moses</hi> even to a sinful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
under-rate himself, when he is to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a great service? <hi>Who am I, that I should goe to
Pharaoh? I am not eloquent, I am of a slow speech, and
a slow tongue, Ex.</hi> 3. 11. &amp; 4. 10. It is true, there was
in this declining of his, somthing of <hi>Self</hi> hid in his
heart, to wit, the fear of enemies, which God took
notice of, when he tels him, <hi>The men are dead which
sought thy life, Ch.</hi> 4. 19. yet I doubt not, but <hi>Moses</hi>
did truly conceive of his unfitness for that service, as
he spake. So <hi>Isaiah,</hi> a great Prophet, <hi>Wo is me, I am
undone; for I am a man of unclean lips,</hi> Isa. 6. 5. So
Paul, <hi>I was a blasphemer, a persecuter, injurious; and
yet I obtained mercy,</hi> the mercy of pardon, the mercy
of imployment; mercy to be a Saint, mercy to be an
Apostle. <hi>Greatest of siners, less then the least of Saints;</hi>
and yet that Apostle, who <hi>laboured more abundantly
then all the rest, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 10. Before we use great
Timber in buildings, we lay it out in the Wind
and Sun, to draw out all its own natural moisture:
before we use brick, we fetch out the softness of the
clay, which it hath of it self, and harden it in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
that it may be fit for service: we cannot make
lime and mortar of Stones, so long as they retain
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100399:17"/>
their naturall hardnesse, till by the heat of fire
they be made dissolvable, and so fit to temper:
So the Lord humbleth and draweth out selfe-thoughts,
self-sap, self-indispositions, any thing
which might cause shrinking or warping, before
he intrusts his fervants with great imployments.
High buildings have deep foundations, tall Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars
deep roots, <hi>quantum vertice, tantum radice;</hi>
Richest Treasure is drawne out of the lowest
mines: God layes the foundation of great works
in despised and selfe-despising instruments, <hi>in a
day of small things,</hi> as it were, in a <hi>graine of mustard-seed,</hi>
that he may have the greater honour. What
a high dignity was it to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to bee
the Mother of God? She will tell us what foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
God laid in her for this dignity: <hi>He had
respect to the low estate of his handmaid, Luke</hi> 1. 48.
What graces doth Christ honour to be the Keyes
of eternall life but <hi>self-denying Graces?</hi> Faith and
Repentance. By the one wherof we are taught to
go out of our selves, by the other to abhor our
selves.</p>
            <p>3. Consider again, That there are no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of life which are not exceeding subject unto
the temptation of self-seeking. Some men gaine
by the publick troubles; if differences should be
composed, and a happy end put to these calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
their offices, commands, advantages, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would expire; they must then shrink back
into their wonted lower condition again.<note place="margin">Quod superest, iterum, Cinname, Tonsor eris. <hi>Martial.</hi>

should be a too strict Reformation, and animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version

would much lesse water drive their Mill; and as
<hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> so in this respect, might they say of
Christ, <hi>If he increase, we must decrease.</hi> We in our

duty be required, so much preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humiliation,
thanksgiving, admonition, superintendency; so
frequent returnes and vicissitudes of service do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
our office, wee must then shake hands for
ever with all our outward ease and quiet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
never more to have the power and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of our selves. We might instance end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely
in things of this nature, from the Throne
to the Plow.</p>
            <p>Now then it much behooveth us who are the
<hi>Lord's remembrancers,</hi> to pray earnestly unto him
for a large spirit of <hi>self-denial</hi> upon all in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
service, both others and our selves, That
God would preserve us all from this dangerous
temptation, That he would take out of us all
our own sap and lusts, whatever would make
us warp, and shrink, and crack, and bee unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the State, the Church, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
whereunto we belong. She who was to
marry an <hi>Israelite,</hi> being her self an Alien, was
to be shaven and pared, and taken as it were
from her own former shape, before she became
an <hi>Israelite.</hi> The Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is no fit

Tyre, Ethiopia, Philistia,</hi> must renounce
their naturall and Gentilitian honours, and derive
their genealogy from <hi>Zion,</hi> before they can be
usefull unto the service and glory of God: <hi>All my
springs</hi> (saith he, speaking of <hi>Sion) are in thee,
Psalm</hi> 87. A man who works all for, and out of
himself, is like a standing Lake, which harbours
Toads and Vermine, of very little use, of no
pure use at all; but they who deny themselves,
and work for God, and from God, are like the
streams of a spring; their sweetness, and pureness
running out of the springs and fountains of <hi>Sion,</hi>
make them fit for their Master's use, and prepared
unto every good work.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore, I say, pray for <hi>all</hi> who are in
publick imployment, That God would give them
publick spirits.</p>
            <p>For the King's Majesty, That God would fill his
heart with this excellent grace, and with the love
of the common welfare above all other respects or
Interests, That he may bewail his poor people,
as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>What have these sheep done,</hi> that in a
difference of mine they should suffer such bitter
things? That God would mercifully preserve
him from joyning with the Enemies of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(to the endangering thereof) for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of such ends, as those Enemies of God,
even according to the principles and practices of
their Religion, are much more likely in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
to betray and destroy, then promote or
preserve.</p>
            <p>For the Parliament, That God would double
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100399:19"/>
upon them the Spirit of <hi>Selfe-Deniall;</hi> that as
they have denied themselves, their ease, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
estates, and have indefatigably wrastled with
mountainous difficulties to vindicate publick li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and reformation: so God would keep it
alwayes in the imaginations and resolutions of
their hearts, to seek the wealth of the people; and
as <hi>Mordecai</hi> did, <hi>to speak peace unto them, and to their
seed, Ester</hi> 10. 3. That God would cause them still
<hi>to speak comfortably unto the Levites, who teach the
good knowledge of the Lord;</hi> and to command them
<hi>to carry forth all filthinesse out of the holy place,</hi> as
good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 5. &amp; 30. 22. That
no jealousies may ever break asunder, but that
piety and wisdom may most sweetly knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Civill and the Ecclesiasticall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
in things pertaining to God and his
House.</p>
            <p>For the Armies: That God would pour out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the noble spirit of selfe-deniall, and carry
them by his power and blessing with unwearied
resolutions to the services they are intrusted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
That <hi>nothing but the alone desires of anhappy</hi> and
well-grounded <hi>peace</hi> may put spirits and vigor into
the sword of war.</p>
            <p>For our selves, That we may in all matters of
duty and service deny our selves. It is a singular
mercy of Christ unto us, so to order the businesse
of his Church, as that the reverence of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and function of his Ministers should be as it
were complicated and linked up together with
his own honour, according as he hath said, <hi>He that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100399:19"/>
heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you,
despiseth me;</hi> whosoever entertaine honourable
thoughts of Christ by our Ministry, cannot but
therewithall reverence us, and esteem the feet
of those beautifull, who discover such glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
unto them. And it is but a counterfeit and
hypocriticall pretence of zeal for piety, which
is accompanied with any low thoughts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous
undervaluing of the Ministers of the
Gospel. The <hi>Galathians</hi> received <hi>Paul</hi> as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of God, yea, as Christ himself, and would
have plucked out their own eyes to have given
them unto him: But though Christ hath joyned
these things together, yet it is our duty in all our
aimes and desires to abstract and prescinde our
Master's interest from our own reward; to seek
Christ's honor alone, and to leave unto him the care
of ours.</p>
            <p>I dare not think or suspect that in any of our
humble advices and petitions to the honourable
Houses of Parliament, we have at all pursued any
private Interest of our own, but only that service
which wee are perswaded Christ hath entrusted
his Ministers withall, which I am fully assured
hath been the only scope we have aimed at: yet
because some are jealous with a jealousie of <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,</hi>
that it is so; Let us our selves also be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
with a jealousie of fear and <hi>caution,</hi> that it
may not be so: and let us pray for humble and
selfe-denying hearts, that God would enable us
to passe through evill report, and through good
report; and would furnish us with such spirituall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100399:20"/>
meeknesse and wisdome, as that we may be able
to make it manifest to the consciences of all,
even of enemies themselves, that as <hi>we preach not
our selves but Christ Iesus the Lord,</hi> so we <hi>seek not</hi>
our selves or <hi>our own things, but the things of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ;</hi> nor affect <hi>dominion</hi> over the people of
God, but would only be <hi>helpers of their joy,</hi> and
furtherers of their salvation, and <hi>servants unto them
for Iesus sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the first part of my exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to stir us up in behalf of our selves and others,
to pray unto God to bestow this excellent grace
upon all who are entrusted in publick services, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which (had I sooner thought of it) I would
have subjoyned a-like exhortation unto every one
of us in our Ministry, to presse and urge the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this duty upon our people, especially
when we preach before those who are called unto
publick trusts, and in whose hands the managing
of great and common affaires is deposited. For,
certainly, self-seekers can never serve the publick
with fidelity.</p>
            <p>I now proceed unto my last part of my appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>viz.</hi> An exhortation unto us our selves to
practice this heavenly duty, wherin I can but offer
a sceleton, and some naked lineaments of what
might have been more fully enlarged. I shall
branch this exhortation likewise into two parts:
One concerning our generall Ministry, the other
concerning our particular Relation unto the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of this Assembly.</p>
            <p>For the former; (I shall need say nothing of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100399:20"/>
third way of self-deniall; there being none, I
presume, either here or in our Ministry, who so
value their own graces as to seek righteousnesse
from them, or to hang salvation upon them.) Of
the two former, let me crave leave to offer a word
or two.</p>
            <p>First, That we would study to <hi>deny our selves</hi> in
those more peculiar and speciall failings which we
are subject unto as Ministers of the Gospell:
many particulars might be singled out, I shall name
but two at this time, namely <hi>Affection</hi> of <hi>New
Lights</hi> in Doctrine, and of <hi>New senses</hi> and Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Scripture.</p>
            <p>For the former, there are in this age of Liberty
(for, usually such men do <hi>Captare Tempora impaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
&amp; inquieta,</hi> as <hi>Petrus Aerodius</hi> a learned Civilian
telleth us) very many itching and wanton wits, men
of an <hi>Athenian</hi> temper, who spend all their time in
nothing else but to hear and to tell some <hi>New The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,</hi>
who flie after too high notions, and abstruse,
metaphysicall, unheard-of fancies; not contenting
themselves with the wholsome form of sound
words, and the general harmony of Orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
who direct all the studies and navigations
of their minds unto <hi>Theologia incognita,</hi> to practice
new experiments, and to make new discoveries.
For mine own part, I never liked <hi>Projectors</hi> in any
kind, they usually delude others, and undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
But above all, a Projector in Learning is
one of the most unhappy: and of all Learning,
none more dangerous then a <hi>Projector in Theology;</hi>
the likeliest piece of timber of any other, out of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100399:21"/>
which to shape first a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and after that an
<hi>Heretick,</hi> and at last an <hi>Atheist;</hi> such were the
Ancient Hereticks of old, <hi>Valentinus, Basilides,
Montanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Lib. 4. Hist. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Marcus,</hi> and therest, who as <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
telleth us, were wont to amuse the people
with strange words, and unintelligible expressions,
the better to draw them first into admiration, and
by that into belief; and such were in our later
age of the Church, <hi>Faustus Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Conra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Vorstius,</hi> and divers others, whose corrupt
and bold doctrines, have spread like a gangrene,
and miserably infested the Churches of Christ
in other Countreys. And many such are likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to arise and multiply in these Kingdoms
(heretofore famous for unity in Doctrine) if the
fancies of <hi>New Light,</hi> and <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi>
(falsely so called) should go on and prevail: one
sad example whereof wee have already in the
prodigious and most execrable blasphemies of a
<hi>Socinian</hi> Heretick, to say nothing of any other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt, but when the prophecies of
Scripture, touching the affaires of the Church
which are yet future (of which I beleeve there
are many) shall be fulfilled, there will by that
meanes bee much more light in understanding
such predictions, then it is possible yet to have
of them while they are unfulfilled; (for, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of prophecies are the best and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
expositions of them.) But in things <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
and <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> in matters of Faith, Duty,
and Godlinesse (which, I am sure, ought to be the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100399:21"/>
heads of our preaching) to cry up <hi>New Lights,</hi>
and to amuze the people with Metaphysicall
fancies, and Chimicall extractions, as if they were
deep and heavenly mysteries, and in the meane
time to neglect the preaching of duty, and the
savory and saving principles of Repentance and
new Obedience, is the next way to introduce
Scepticism into the Church, and a farre readier
means to make men question the truth of all
that they learned before, then ever to attain any
certain knowledge of the things which are newly
taught them. In this therefore let ministeriall
prudence and zeale for the souls of our hearers,
and for the peace of the Church, teach us to <hi>deny
all pride</hi> and wantonnesse of wit, which would
offer to tempt and transport us into <hi>by wayes,</hi> and
make us busie our selves in finding out a North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
passage (if I may so speak) unto heaven; but
let us content our selves with the <hi>words of truth
and sobernesse,</hi> with the <hi>wholesome forme of sound
words,</hi> that we may be <hi>wormen who need not be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth;</hi> and
making manifest the will of God to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of our hearers by <hi>demonstrations of the
spirit and of power,</hi> that they being <hi>convinced, and
the secrets of their hearts discovered, may fall downe
and worship God, and acknowledge that God is in us
of a truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Let us learne to <hi>deny our selves</hi> in the <hi>affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of new senses</hi> and meanings of Scripture, in
indulging a liberty to our own wits and fancies,
to pick exceptions at the pious and solid expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100399:22"/>
of other learned men. Wee know how
affectation of <hi>Allegories</hi> and forced allusions in
<hi>Origen</hi> and some other Ancients, and affectation
of <hi>Cabalismes</hi> in many Rabbinicall Doctors,<note place="margin">Vide Reuchlin. de arte Cabali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticâ.</note> hath
pitifully wrested and abused the holy Text; which
is no small sinne in the Apostle <hi>Peter's</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Aug. de unitat.</note>
2 <hi>Pet. 3. 16. Dic ubi cubas in meridie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. cap. 16.</note> you
know what a wilde and proud sense the Donatists
put upon that place to maintaine their African
Schisme. But as <hi>Iuvenal</hi> said of children, <hi>Naxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
debetur pueris reverencia,</hi> I may say in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense of the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Nunquam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recundiores esse debemus quàm cùm de Deo agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Sen. Nat. qu. lib. 7. ex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotele.</hi>
               </note> that wee owe
much reverence and veneration unto them, and
we may not without much modesty, and gravity,
and godly fear, set our selves to the expounding
of them. I do not deny (it were injurious to the
gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, bestowed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
upon them, so to doe) but that we may
deliver our own private conceptions upon any
part of Scripture, though unobserved by others
before us, (that may be revealed to another which
sitteth by, which a former had not discovered;)
But I dislike <hi>the affectation</hi> of finding something
<hi>new and strange</hi> in every thing we read, though
plaine, easie, and by others literally and clearly
expounded; a coming with prejudice unto the
labours of our brethren, and a willingnesse to find
faults and defects in what they have done before
us. Whensoever therefore we judge it needfull
to interpose any opinion or sense of our owne,
let us, First, do it with humility and submission,
with reservation of Honour and Reverence unto
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100399:22"/>
others from whom we differ; not<note n="a" place="margin">Non ita pro no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strâ sententiâ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micemus, ut eam velimus scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum esse quae nostra est, &amp;c. <hi>Aug. de Gen ad lit. l. 1. c.</hi> 18</note> magisterially

               </gap>, as if we spake ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this case take heed of departing <hi>vel latum vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guem</hi>

which is according unto godlinesse,</hi> into diverticles
of fancy, or criticall curiosity; but let us resolve
ever to judge those expositions best and soundest,
which are most Orthodox, practicall, heavenly,
and most tending unto the furtherance of duty
and godlinesse.</p>

let us learn in the service of Christ's Church to
<hi>deny our naturall self,</hi> to spend and be spent, and
like burning Lights be contented to wear out, and
be consumed in our Master's service.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>. Clem. Alex. strom. l. 6.</note> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things will call upon us for the performance of
this duty.</p>
            <p>1. The prejudices and jealousies which men
are apt to conceive against us. Some look upon
us as if we did drive a designe, and affect a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and fought great things for our selves.
Very many likewise have an evil eye upon the
outward condition and prosperity of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
they are apt to object unto us, and very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to lay plots, and subscribe Petitions against us
in the matter of our maintenance. Meaner ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
courser diet, narrower harbour, every way
<hi>magis curta supellex</hi> judged good enough, and
much fitter for us. In these and the like cases it
becomes us, and it is our duty to maintaine and
vindicate <hi>Iura Ministerii</hi> and <hi>decentiam Statûs;</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100399:23"/>
wee cannot without unworthy cowardize betray
the rights which belong unto our places. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Paul</hi> doth <hi>magnifie his office,</hi> and so in our
degree and proportion must we;<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13.</note> and he will plead
for <hi>double honour</hi> in behalfe of those who labour
in the Word and Doctrine,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> and so may we. Only
because these are things which concerne our own
order, and so we may by prejudice be mis-judged
in the discharge of such duties as these, as if we
did seek and serve our selves; Let us do it with
such tendernesse, as that we may stop the mouths
of those who watch for occasion against us; and
by our humility, meekness, innocency, wisdome,
contempt of the world, and all the pleasures and
vanities thereof, using it as if wee used it not,
without vanity, without levity, without excesse,
by our bounty and charity, and ministring to the
necessities of the Saints, and making all our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
appear to have written on it, <hi>Holinesse to the
Lord,</hi> we may put to silence the ignorance of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and the calumnies of envious men.</p>
            <p>2. The weaknesses of divers men, who are but
babes in knowledge, men of low and narrow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
will likewise call upon us to deny our
selves in our parts and learning; though we could
set forth a feast of <hi>strong meats,</hi> of wine, of fatted
things; yet we must descend and provide <hi>milk,</hi> and
<hi>cibum praemansum</hi> for such as these;<note place="margin">Mark. 4. 33.</note> and with the
Apostle,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 12.</note> 
               <hi>be all things to all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 11. 14.</note> 
               <hi>that by all meanes
we may save some.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22.</note> In some Seas and winds, the
maine saile may be hoised up; in others, the lesse
you spread the swifter you move. <hi>Paul</hi> had strong
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100399:23"/>
arguments when he disputed with the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
at <hi>Athens;</hi> and easie, low exhortations
when he instructed the servants and children at
<hi>Ephesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The pride, frowardnesse, and humours of
men will many times minde us of this duty. Usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men will expect to be pleased and flattered,
when indeed they ought to be reproved by us.<note place="margin">1 King. 22. 13, 14.</note>
Our relations unto them,<note place="margin">Ier. 1. 17, 18.</note> our dependencies upon
them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 6.</note> will tempt us to forbare unwelcome
truths,<note place="margin">Amos 7. 12, 14, 15.</note> lest we forfeit our reputation with them,
our supplies from them.<note place="margin">Mark. 6. 18.</note> In this case wee must
resolve to deny our relations,<note place="margin">Acts 4. 19. 5. 29.</note> our dependencies,
to preferre the truth of God, and the conscience
of duty before the favours of men,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 15.</note> 
               <hi>though the
more we love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>the lesse we be loved.</hi> Cowardize in a
Minister is baser then in a Souldier, by how much
our warfare is more honourable. A faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
will get more love and honour at the last,
then a sinfull and fawning dissimulation. Though
<hi>Paul</hi> reproved the dissimulation of <hi>Peter,</hi> yet <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
praiseth the wisdome of <hi>Paul. Pessimum ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micorum
genus, laudantes.</hi> A man can have no
worse enemy in the world then a flattering and
fawning Minister, that dares not deale plainely
with his conscience. We are in much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to wrong the souls of men by our <hi>oyle,</hi> then
by our <hi>salt;</hi> by our praises, then by our reproofs.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the sad condition of the Church of
God in these times of distraction and distress,
doth mainly call upon us for this duty of <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,</hi>
that wee would set our selves more to seek
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100399:24"/>
the welfare of the whole, and the closing up of
the sad breaches that are amongst us, then how
to advance our owne ends, or to advantage our
selves. And in this case there are two things wee
should learn to deny.</p>
            <p>1. Our owne <hi>interests</hi> in comparison of the
common safety. Let it never enter into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of any of us to wish, or be contented that the
troubles continue, that the breaches and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
be kept still open till parties be balanced,
till wee can by time work out more probable
meanes to advance our owne interests. Oh that
such a thing as sides and parties should bee ever
thought on amongst Brethren, when Churches
and Kingdomes are in a flame! You remember

two great Commanders, who though there were
private differences between themselves, yet being
at any time joyned in Commission upon publick
service, either military or civil, for the good of
their Countrey, they were wont to leave their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
at the gates of the City, and go on with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and accord upon the common affairs. It is an
excellent example, and worthy the imitation of
Christians.</p>
            <p>2. Our private <hi>judgements</hi> and <hi>opinions,</hi> so farr
forth as not to widen the wounds and encrease
the divisions of a Bleeding Church, by an unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
venting and contending for them, they
being not in themselves matters of faith and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
duty, but matters meerly problematicall, and
of private perswasion, wherein godly men may be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100399:24"/>
differently-minded, without breach of love, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of salvation. I have long had this opinion,
that a divided Ministry in this Kingdom, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
and Non-conformists was fomented by
an Episcopall interest; that some being zealous
on the one side, and others on the other, they
might never want matter for their power, having
objects both for their frownes and for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to worke upon. Whence peradventure it
was, that when former Ceremonies grew more
generally to be digested, the practice of others,
and more offensive, began to be introduced, to
discriminate Ministers still, and by that meanes
to be the <hi>fomes</hi> of Episcopall power. As men
put vipers and flesh into vessels of wine, that by
feeding on them it may be preserved from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it self. But what, or whence should the
cause now be, that wee must still have a divided
Ministry? That they who were formerly united
in suffering, should like <hi>Petrus Alexandrinus,</hi> and
<hi>Meletius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiphan. lib. 2. Haeres. 68.</note> (as we find the story in <hi>Epiphanius)</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a sunder upon lesser differences, and make
secessions one from another? Whose interest is
hereby promoted? Who are they that are most
pleased by these divisions? Are any more likely
to make advantage by the divisions of brethren,
then they who are enemies unto them both?</p>
            <p>For the Lord's sake, let us lay it to heart, and
the more we see the common enemy gratified by
it, and glorying in it, the more let us be grieved
for it, and ashamed of it, and on all hands endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to take off the edge of prejudice and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100399:25"/>
When sheep push and run heads against
one another, it is a foretoken of ill weather. It
were worth not onely our fasting and praying, but
our studying, our sweating, our bleedng, our dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to recover peace to the Church, and unity
amongst Brethren againe. Why should not the
world say of us now, as they were wont to say of
Christians heretofore, <hi>Vide ut se diligunt?</hi> Surely,
biting, devouring, censuring, counter-working,
spending the edge of prejudice, policies, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
against one another, well it may be through
humane weaknesse amongst good men, but I am
sure it is the thorn and prickle, it is not the rose
or flower which growes upon that tree. I shall
add but one word more unto this point, and so
conclude it; and it is this, That no man ought to
prejudice a publike and generall Right by any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
apprehensions of his owne, though they may
seem to have a pretence of humility and selfe-deniall
in them. No single person by any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer
of his, may undertake to extinguish a
common property. In copartnercy or fellowship,
the rule of the civill Law grounded upon cleare
reason is this,<note place="margin">Leg. 65. §. 5. D. pro Socio.</note> 
               <hi>Non id quod privatim interest unius
ex sociis servari solet, sed quod societati expedit.</hi> No
persons private interest, but the common advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the society is to be attended. And againe,
<hi>In re communi nemo jure quicquam facit altero invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 28. D. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni dividen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note>
Therefore the Apostle, when upon great and
weighty reasons he declined in his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to receive maintenance from the Churches of
<hi>Achata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> he yet withall writes a whole Chapter to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100399:25"/>
vindicate and assert the just claime of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Gospel unto maintenance, lest hee
should by a private act of <hi>self-deniall</hi> (necessary
<hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> for him himselfe to exercise) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the common and perpetuall interest of all
the Ministers of the Gospel. Surely, if I had a
singular opinion in matters not of faith or necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to salvation, different from the opinion of
all others, and had confidence enough to value it,
and wit enough to plead for it, and wisedome
enough to manage it unto plausible correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,
and forehead enough to undervalue the
judgement of all other godly men concerning it:
I hope either modesty or piety would constraine
me to learn of the Apostle to have <hi>such a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to my self,</hi> and not by an unseasonable obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it, to offend my brethren, and to trouble the
Church of God.</p>
            <p>I have but three short words more of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
unto us, with respect to our service in this
reverend Assembly, and then I shal conclude; and
they are, that with respect hereunto we would
learn to <hi>Deny our selves,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, In our own <hi>private Affaires,</hi> times, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
that we would not suffer these any way to
retard, or obstruct the publick service. The eyes
of friends are upon us, expecting our haste: the
eyes of enemies upbraiding and deriding our
slownesse: the eyes of other Churches abroad,
looking on us as healers, and repairers of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in these times of trouble and division,
and longing to see the fruits of our labours. Let
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100399:26"/>
these considerations move us not to be weary or
faint in our minds, but to do our uttermost to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
truth, and to recover peace unto these torn
and afflicted Churches,</p>
            <p>Secondly, In our <hi>Speeches</hi> and debates: Some
men have excellent abilities of copious and fluent
speaking, a felicity which I so much the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and admire whereever I finde it, by how
much the greater mine own inability is of sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
digesting or uttering mine own concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Yet considering the necessity of hastning
the work which wee have before us, I humbly
conceive it were fitter to speak<note n="a" place="margin">Vt Menelaus <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Lastly, in matters of <hi>difference,</hi> if at any time

our selves. <hi>Passions</hi> are seldom friends unto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

in them. The more heavenly the minde is, the

slept, while the ship was under a tempest. I love

allusion from it: Our Propheticall, our Christian

and distempered with passion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100399:26"/>
I conclude all in the words of the Apostle, <hi>Look
not every man on his own things, but on the things of
others. Let the same mind be in you which was also in
Christ Iesus, who being in the form of God, thought it
no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> and yet he <hi>humbled
himself,</hi> and <hi>emptyed himself,</hi> and <hi>made himself of no
reputation,</hi> and <hi>took upon him the form of a servant:</hi>
And being <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> became <hi>obedient;</hi> and Lord
of <hi>Life,</hi> obedient unto <hi>Death;</hi> and Lord of <hi>Glory,</hi>
obedient to the death of the <hi>Crosse.</hi> If our Lord
and Master did so deeply deny himself to save and
redeem his Church: Let it not be grievous unto us
to deny our selves to serve and to edifie the
Church.</p>
