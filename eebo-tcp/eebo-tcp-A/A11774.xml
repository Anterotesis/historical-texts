            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the true-hearted <hi>British</hi> Readers.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>DEare Christian Country-men</hi>; I ſend out this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> in this doubtfull and dangerous time, not only to shew you the neceſſarie dependancie betwixt our Kingdome of <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> and the <hi>vnited Provinces,</hi> but alſo to comfort &amp; ſtrengthen you againſt all feares, that are or may be interjected, by the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and malice of our Adverſaries, or our owne miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceite or diffidence. For I do not finde the Enemie more buſily practiſing to diſcourage vs, and to raiſe falſe fires to affright vs, then vvee our ſelues (as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy perſons vſe) apt to miſconſter all things, and to imagine the worſt, vpon the ſight of euery shadow.</p>
            <p>And yet I muſt confeſſe, that, as there are many of thoſe who labour to effect a diviſion betwixt vs, and to this end, reviue old grudges, and provoke new quarrels; ſo the common current ſeemes to runne a contrarie courſe to that vvhich it had wont, (as tides have their ebbes) and the generall diſpoſition of moſt men is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, as perſons light of loue, who deſire to shift their old approued friends for fresh Suiters, and prefer the change of an adulterous bed before the married. But I take this to be but a fit or throw of paſſion, which vvilbe eaſily caſt off, vvith more hate and loathing, then it is now hotly purſued vvith longing, when ſome diſcontents are ſetled, and men on both ſides are come to themſelues againe. And for the State it ſelfe (I meane that maine Axeltree vvhereon our Kingdome
<pb facs="tcp:17481:3"/>
turnes) I do aſſure my ſelfe, it is the ſame it was, firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded on former principles extracted from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience on both ſides; and that wee only move, vvhilſt it remaines conſtant, though wee imagine otherwiſe; as ſimple paſſengers ſayling ſwiftly by the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſuppoſe the trees, ſteeples, towers, and rockes to goe backward.</p>
            <p>Thus wee are diſtracted &amp; affrighted with our owne shadowes; ignorance makes vs Infidels: and vvhilſt vvee ſee the face, but vnderſtand not the intention and ſcope of ſome paſſages of State, vve and our friends waxe ſuſpicious of each other; and that ſuſpicion raiſeth many rumors; and thoſe rumors, though falſe, may beget and nourish a true and dangerous hate betwixt vs. My owne Countri-men haue tongues laxatiue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and Strangers are in their vvordes, as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe other things, libertines. That vvhich I write may helpe to make both ſides more confident of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loue, more retentiue and ſparing of their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; at leaſt it shall haue that effect in me, till I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the yſſue, vvhich I hope vvill be happie.</p>
            <p>The bell is rung out, and I heare the ſound and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it gives on both ſides. Vpon the <hi>States</hi> ſide, men feare the paſſages and cariages of all things in <hi>England</hi>; and for this, are liberall and free in their diſcourſes, making the feare greater then the cauſe requires. On the <hi>contrarie ſide,</hi> they are doubtfull or rather deſperate, and therefore proſecute his Majeſtie with all kind of calumny. <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Paſquills</hi> are day by day there vented thicke and threefold one vpon the necke of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vvherein not only the <hi>King of Bohemia</hi> and the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> but our <hi>King</hi> alſo is baſely traduced and abuſed. This comforts me, and aſſures me they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb facs="tcp:17481:3"/>
none of their owne, and therefore hold his Majeſtie to be an enemie. Let this aſſure vs, that he is the ſame vve vvould haue him, howſoever for ſome reſpects of State, he ſeemes, (to weake eyes who behold things aloofe off) to be otherwiſe inclined. But, for my owne part, I comfort my ſelfe eſpecially, and deſire you would be comforted againſt all theſe ſuſpicions, feares, and jealouſies, out of two conſiderations; the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercie of our <hi>God,</hi> and the vviſedome and policie of our <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, let vs conſider wee haue a good and gracious God watching over vs, who vvill not ſuffer his Truth to be extinguished, but as he hath hitherto miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved it, ſo ſtill he will continue to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>And though, for our abuſe and contempt of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (together vvith our barrenneſſe in good,<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.32.33.</note> our fruitfulneſſe in euill) <hi>he viſite our tranſgreſsions with the rod, yet will he not vtterly take his mercie from vs, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his truth to faile.</hi> Let vs then reſt in peace;<note place="margin">Pſal. 121.4.</note> 
               <hi>for hee that keepeth vs doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe.</hi> And let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe many former deliverances, which he hath wrought for vs, after an extraordinary and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manner, aſſure vs of the like fatherly care and protection ſtill, if wee faint not,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 17.34 35, 36, 37.</note> but faithfully and conſtantly depend vpon his mercifull promiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the vviſedome of our <hi>Prince,</hi> which is ſo renowned, as for it he is gladly admitted a generall Arbitrator in forraine parts to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of State. Let this comfort vs, and aſſure vs, that God hath not given Him ſo much light for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, much leſſe for evill. Let vs thinke, that ſince He was intertained with ſo much love, and ſo great ſignes of joy into this Kingdome, and hath beene ſerved ſince
<pb facs="tcp:17481:4"/>
with ſo much obedience, (farre more then a father could expect from his children) that Hee will ſo much ſeeme to neglect his owne honour and ſafety, or our lives and liberties, as to leave vs in the hands of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or abaſe vs in the eyes of other Nations, to leade vs, or ſuffer vs to bee led into temporall or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall captivity. Let vs thinke alſo he cannot forget ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 88. or the <hi>Powder-plot,</hi> (though now perhaps, it be vnſeaſonable to remember them) nor yet the many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and practiſes againſt His perſon, Crowne, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and the Truth he profeſſeth: nor that God will ſuffer him to ſleepe ſecurely in the armes of ſuch, as He knowes watch onely for oportunity to deſtroy Him and His. Thinke alſo, that Nature will reviue and worke in Him, though it ſeemes to lye in a trance for the preſent time: and that He cannot but ſee, that it is impoſſible to love the Root, and hate the Branches; or to love the Fruit and Branches, and hate the Roote. Our love to his Royall Progenie muſt needes aſſure our love to Him; and the hate of others to Them, aſſure their inward hate againſt Him. And for ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade otherwiſe, that our love to the Kings Children, and hate to the adverſe party, proceedes either out of diſcontent, or a Puritanicall humour in vs leading to diſloyalty,<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.16.</note> 
               <hi>Let their lyes turne vpon their owne pates</hi>; and let <hi>evill happen to them that thinke evill,</hi> and that would poyſon and pervert all good purpoſes with practiſe.</p>
            <p>And though the ſubtill Enemies labour to breed je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies betwixt Him and His, knowing it to be for their advantage, and the onely way to blemish the Goſpel, and diſcredit good men, by breeding this ſuſpicion, which may eſtrange and alienate the heart of the Prince from his people, and friends from each other; yet
<pb facs="tcp:17481:4"/>
thinke it cannot ſinke into his Majeſties breſt, that ſuch <hi>ſervants,</hi> ſuch <hi>ſubjects; Profeſſors of the Goſpel,</hi> should intend the leaſt hurt to him, who is the <hi>Defender of their Faith.</hi> It is for <hi>Heathens, Turkes, Papiſts,</hi> to become Aſſaſſinates, Parricides, and bloody Traitors; and it is for Tyrants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe, to ſuſpect their friends, brethren, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and therefore to cut them off at the motion of their Flatterers, <hi>Bashawes, Ieſuites,</hi> and other tame tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-Traytors. Good Princes, who are fathers of the Common-wealth, cannot do thus, will not doe thus; whilſt in themſelves they ſee no cauſe of their ſubjects hate; or if they ſee any, can finde a readier way by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, to remove the cauſe, and prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, then by ſeconding one evill with another, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the overthrow of all, and to make the diſeaſe deſperate, by endevouring a contrarie cure; or the flame riſe higher, by caſting in fresh fuell, or quenching it with oyle.</p>
            <p>Thinke alſo it is our Enemies plot, to ſtirre vp our heady and haſtie humors, and to cauſe the Prince to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content his beſt and trueſt ſubjects; and, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by all meanes to provoke them to impatience and reſiſtance, that ſo themſelves might be armed in His co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable defence, and have occaſion alſo to bring in other borrowed Ayde vnder the ſame pretence, but with aſſurance of His and all our ruines in the yſſue; as hath ever happened to that vnfortunate State where they haue become <hi>Sticklers.</hi> But thinke his Majeſtie cannot but ſee this aſwell as vvee and much better; and therefore be you quiet, that their intents and projects may be fruſtrate.</p>
            <p>Finally, thinke now your <hi>King</hi> is making of his owne <hi>Monument,</hi> vvriting his owne <hi>Chronicle</hi>; both
<pb facs="tcp:17481:5"/>
which are raiſed and compoſed by deedes, and not wordes: and aſſure your ſelves, <hi>Hee</hi> that can ſpeake and write ſo wel, will never ſo farre contradict his owne vvordes with repugnant actions, as thereby to race his Armes, to ſtaine the honour he was borne vnto, and vvhich hee hath made good and bettered hitherto, by high and holy enterprizes of act and <hi>admonition</hi> againſt <hi>Rome</hi>: but thinke therefore, that all this time, Hee is acting his part in the eye of the whole vvorld; that he is working his Maſter-piece in the publique market, and trying his exact skill in <hi>King-craft</hi> vvith the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Statiſts</hi> in Chriſtendome; that is, vvith <hi>Rome, Spaine, Auſtria, Italy, Machiauel,</hi> and the extracted ſtrength and quinteſſence of all theſe, the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore thinke, howſoever for the preſent he carries himſelfe, and ſeemes to be led by ſome of that ſide, yet in the end, the Lyon may awake, breake looſe and teare his keeper; or elſe leade, vvhilſt he ſeemes to be led; and then the vvorld shall ſee, that neither the opinion of his ſinceritie in the <hi>Truth,</hi> nor of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable wiſedome and policie, were vaine miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, but that our harmeleſſe <hi>David</hi> can vſe honeſt <hi>Hushai</hi> to ouerthrow their craftie <hi>Achitophel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Church</hi> shall triumph and be comforted, the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> flourish, His <hi>honor</hi> shal be eternized; neither shall you repent of your patience, nor I of my perſwaſion to this end; vvherein I reſt, vvith an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods mercy herein, and that wee shall ſee our deſire vpon our Enemies.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:17481:5"/>
neglect their honors in ſome paſſages, that he would conſider there are three things mouing me to this; any of which when they come in my vvay; may force me to ſtrike them vvith my tongue, ſince I cannot reach them vvith my hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt is the <hi>Libertie of the Goſpel,</hi> to vvhoſe free paſſage they are open and profeſt enemies, altering Religion for the worſt where they conquer, taking part vvith the Serpent againſt the Seed of the woman, and deſiring to bee knowne Catholique perſecutors of all true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is the <hi>Libertie of life,</hi> that by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of nature each Nation hath and ſeekes to preſerue vnder their owne rules; vvhich likewiſe the <hi>Spaniard</hi> labors to take from humane ſocietie, and to preſcribe Lawes to all Chriſtendome. Which ambitious mood hath poſſeſt them euer ſince that Catholique title was confer'd vpon them by that Sea,<note place="margin">Luke. 4.6.</note> vvho next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly vnder Satan, hath the diſpoſition of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Earth at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is the bloody, inhumane, and vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian dealing vvith the Kings Children, even when they pretend to deſire affinitie vvith that Houſe, and that dallying about reſtitution of wrongs, toſſing the ball from one to another; and laughing in their ſleeues, that their diſſimulation hath deluded our plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and poſſeſt them of ſo rich a Country, vvhich is a fit roade to invade all Chriſtendome. For now they haue a high vvay, or thorow-fare to convey their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies commodiouſly from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Auſtria</hi> all the way in their owne Command. But vvhome have they not thus delt vvithall for their owne advantages, if former preſidents could make men beware of their courſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17481:6"/>I do proteſt, ſauing theſe quarrels, I beare nor ſpleene nor malice to any <hi>Spaniard</hi> living, much leſſe to the Nation, whome (theſe things excepted) I honor as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits me: but when any of theſe conſiderations come croſſe my thoughts, they ſtir vp a ſalt humor, vvhich fals from my eyes into my inke, and turnes it more blacke and bitter, and more sharpe vvithall then the Gall and Coperas vvhich gaue it the firſt tincture; and this makes my ſtile harsh, when I touch vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſtring. No other good can cauſe me to forget theſe euils, or perſwade me to take thoſe for my friends who are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to theſe, or affoord them good words, who loade theſe vvith opprobrious ſcoffes and open injuries. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in them begets indignation in others, and no man that doth euill, can euer hope to heare well from any but Cowards, or flatrerers.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> Aſſure them and all the world, theſe three conſiderations aforementioned, worke contrarie effects in me towards them. I loue them firſt for Religions ſake, they being a hiding place for the pore perſecuted members of Chriſt hunted out of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and other diſtreſſed Countries.

               <p>Men may ſay, their owne reſpects worke theſe effects, and I willingly grant, that perhaps, they are involved together. And what Nation is there, or what State; nay, what man, that in all friendship lookes not inward and homeward with one eye? when I thinke vpon theſe things, I cannot but loue them, and ſpeake well of them; nor can particular injuries (which

               <hi>2. The conſultation: Conſider her wayes. Conſideration</hi> is a ſerious examination of any buſineſſe, with the cauſes, effects, beginning, continuance, and iſſue thereof. It is a reflection of the minde vpon it ſelfe, from ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy object; a rumination of the judgement, ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and reuoluing ſome matter in hand, vntill the ſame be perfectly digeſted, ſetled, and diſpoſed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: The lacke of this, is that vvhich vvholly keepes men in ſloth, and ſo in all ſinne and ignorance, vvhilſt they doe not conſider either the reward of glorie, vvhich they looſe by omiſſion of good and vertuous actions, or the punishment of shame, and eternal paine, which they procure to themſelues by ſinne and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.<note place="margin">Ier. 12, 17.

            <p>Although euery man therefore, at the firſt ſight, thinkes conſideration to be no great vvorke, but that the weakeſt may wel effect it, yet the wiſe (vvho better conſider the matter, and who truly can only conſider vvell) know, that it is a difficult vvorke, to contract
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17481:14"/>
the whole power of the ſoule to one narrow point, and to hold it there firme, ſtable, and vnmoued, vntill from thence a reſolution or certaine concluſion be wrought out and effected. This cannot be done vvithout labour and practiſe, euen vvhen the mind is moſt able, and the faculties at beſt command: But vvhere the mind is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteddy, and the imagination ſtirring, or the memorie too ſlacke, the judgement cannot certainly, and to good purpoſe conſider, as it should or vvould, if theſe vvere obedient. As we ſee a burning-glaſſe held firme, contracts and gathers the vnited beames of the Sunne, and ſo ſets the object on fire: but if either the glaſſe moue, or the object moue, it loſeth the force, at leaſt fayles in the effect. This likewiſe wee may ſee moſt cleerely in perſons, vvhoſe braines (as they ſay) are crackt and diſtracted, how they flicker and flit in their diſcourſe, as the phantaſie shifts and wanders to and fro; ſo that they can hardly bring either their vvords to a perfect period, or driue their purpoſes to any determination, becauſe of this defect. They may be witty, cannot be wiſe: and neuer did Age ſo abound with ſuch brittle ſpirits as this of ours.</p>
            <p>And to this end, I remember a vvitty mad-woman (who found her owne diſeaſe, and by long experience tooke notice of her owne imbecility) tolde a friend of hers, vvho demanded, in vvhat part she found the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions of her diſcourſe, ſince for the preſent shee ſeemed very ſober and compoſed, as shee had wont to be: O my good friend (quoth shee) I am for flashes, but I cannot Thinke: that is, shee could not ponder, and deliberately conſider of this or that thing, as shee had formerly done. We ſee therefore, the lacke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17481:15"/>
I meane, of the power to conſider, is an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clination to madneſſe; and the lacke of indeuor, where the power is preſent, is an inclination to folly; and the lacke of execution and action, vvhere invention and deliberation haue gone before, is not onely an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but an abſolute conſummation of ſlouth and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe.

Sloth is a ſinne; nay, it is the roote of all ſinne, the mother-ſinne. For ſinne hath no exiſtence in nature, but is a priuation of grace, a depravation of action; ſo that in the alteration and change from right to vvrong, there muſt needes bee a reſidence in ſloth.

            <p>The contrarie to this then, is, <hi>That Diligence is a vertue,</hi> and the very roote of all vertue.

might want no vvorke, but as ſoone as he vvas made, fall to action, to vvhich he vvas made, that therein he might reſemble his Maker, and be a liuing image of his, and no dead Idoll; for though it be true in ſome ſenſe that <hi>Lucan</hi> ſaith:

An idoll (ſaith the Apoſtle) is nothing in the World, that is,<note place="margin">1. Cor, 4, 8.</note> a thing either to no purpoſe, or to evill. So a Sluggard doth nothing in the World, or if he buſie himſelfe in any thing, it is in ſome idle or ſuperfluous imployment,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115, 4 5.</note> or vvorſe, in doing ſome miſchiefe. An idoll hath eyes and ſees not, eares and heares not, a mouth and ſpeakes not; feete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he doth not travell; and ſuch a golden Calfe or ſilver idoll, is a mightie Sluggard,<note place="margin">Sap. 13, 15.16.</note> who vſeth not thoſe partes of bodie, minde, and authority that God hath giuen him to the right end vvhereunto they vvere giuen him, that is, to Gods glorie, his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and the good of humane ſocietie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4.

as it were in a citie, is farre more commodious, then to inhabit a ſolitarie manſion, vvhere there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe in time of neceſſitie, nor comfort in time of doubt, nor ſocietie in time of pleaſure. Theſe things she doth, I ſay, of her ſelfe, without a Tutor, or a head and gouernour, to binde her vvith others in a ſtrict league of amitie; and herein shee becomes a Tutor to man, and makes Reaſon a Scholer to Senſe; laying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect plat-form of a Common-vvealth,<note place="margin">Pro. 30.25</note> which fooles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, cowards and ſluggards maligne, wiſe men imitate, no man exceedes.</p>
            <p>And if vvee looke into the Societie of man, wee shall finde, the greateſt felicity to be in ſuch places, and among ſuch people, as are ordered according to this preſident; That is, vvhere there is moſt diligence vſed, and vvhere ſloth is moſt carefully avoided: for it ſtands vvith reaſon, that vvhere many joyne in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and vnanimous conſent and combination, the ſucceſſe muſt needes be there proſperous and happie: But vvhere as ſome draw backe and ſtand ſtill, vvhilſt others draw forward and proceed, they doe not only diſorder and diſtract the diligent, but increaſe their burden, and make the draught heauier to ſuch as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Thus in Armies, a few Cowards may occaſion the loſſe of all, and a few valiant perſons reſolutely knit in one fortune and ingagement, may diſcomfite a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of negligent perſons. Sloth is the Nurſerie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evill in a Common-wealth, ſcarcitie, famine, begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the everie, ſedition, diſobedience, and finally, the ruine and diſſolution of the whole bodie and frame of the State ariſeth from thence.</p>

For a Noble man therefore to be a Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, or a racker of Rents, or a corrupt taker of bribes, or a protector of wicked perſons, or to buſie or employ himſelfe in priuate vvorkes, as common perſons doe, is to deny his owne office and calling, honour and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

For ſuch are the guard, the ſentinell, the watch, the perdu for the Common-wealth; great reaſon they should therefore ſtand together, and defend the State with their goods and bodies, from an invaſive vvarre, and not invade it themſelues by force or fraude, as if they were open enemies It is therefore farre vnfit for true Nobility to be educated in an idle courſe of life, and trayned vp onely to hunt, or hawke, or dance, or drinke, or court, or play, (the ordinary exerciſes of theſe degenerate times) when the contrary is injoyned them; as if it vvere expreſſed in their Patents, vnder the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their honours.

            <p>It is vvell therefore, vvhere the children of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are trayned vp in counſell and military affaires: where they ſeeke the warres, and places of action as their proper Academies; and doe not thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues accomplished, till they are able both to adviſe, and execute in matters of State.

            <p>I haue ſeene in <hi>Scotland</hi> the miſerable Cottages of the poore Hindes; and I wondered a while at the cauſe, imputing it either to the barrenneſſe of the ſoyle, or the lazie diſpoſition of the Commons: But when I looked vp higher, and inquired diligently into the true cauſe; I found the Land fertile, the poore men painfull, but the Lordly owner is in all the fault; who deſirous to liue at Court (not for action, but idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) muſt raiſe his Rents to the extreameſt racke; yea pull one piece from another with violent torture to this end. And that he may doe this the better, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lets out Leaſe but from yeare to yeare; and he that giues moſt is the next new Farmer for my next new maſter. I ſay for my next new maſter, becauſe of late the ancient Owner, by this idle courſe hath learned to out-law himſelfe of all; ſo that the diligent tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eates out the lazie Lord: and as the Poet ſings of <hi>Troy, jam ſeges eſt vbi Troja fuit,</hi> ſo may I ſay of theſe, the Taylor hath taken meaſure of many faire Mannors, and ſurvayed them by the Yardwand; making that the

But this is not all the miſchiefe, for the poore Tenant vndone alſo by this hard Farme, and outed of all, (hauing notvvithſtanding his paines and prouidence, eaten vp his horſe and cowes, and vvhole eſtate) now fals either to theft or beggerie; in vvhich lazie kinde of life, hee ſoone findes ſuch ſweetneſſe, as hee wonders not now, that his Land-lord loued his eaſe ſo well, ſince he ſees by experience, that prouerbe to bee true which ſaith; <hi>Well fare nothing once in the yeare</hi>; for ſuch as haue nothing are without care or feare, and may ſit ſtill when others muſt looke out. You may as well reclaime him from this courſe, as you could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Landlord from that curſed crueltie and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby he firſt fleade his Tenant, and after ſtript himſelfe, and puld his owne eſtate (in the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God) ouer his owne eares. Now he fills the Common-wealth with beggars of his owne breed (as lowſy perſons their next neighbors with vermine) and meeting with many like himſelfe, bound vp together in one fortune and condition, he becomes with them a dangerous body, fit for any deſperate attempt either of theft, ryot, or rebellion; as waters falling from a ſteepe hill raiſe a floud in the next valley. And thus whereas they were profitable and diligent members, the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſloth of other men hath made them ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous excrements to be cut off or purged out; for feare of

            <p>And looke now from the Noble-man, or from the Pope himſelfe, (if wee count him the higheſt) through euery office, trade, or profeſſion, to him that holdes the plough, if this be not the common practiſe and courſe of life, as if the very end of each mans beeing were to inrich himſelfe by the loſſe of others, yea by the loſſe of all; and the more he doth thus, the more wiſe he is thought to bee, and the more worthy of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; and if he doth otherwiſe, he is eſteemed but a ſimple fellow, vnfit for any imployment. To inſtance this in two or three particular profeſſions at home,

looke vpon the Lawyers, and ſee who it is amongſt them, that refuſeth to plead againſt truth and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for falſehood and treaſon, if he may haue his Fee? Looke vpon the Clergie, if there bee not a <hi>D.

Looke into the Countrie, if the greedy Farmer doe not ingroſſe three or foure ſeuerall Farmes, which had wont to maintaine as many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; whileſt, beeing vnable to ſtocke all of them, or to follow all of them being ſtockt, he beggars hereby him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the poore, his Land-lord, and the Commonwealth; And though this be contrarie to the Law of the Land, and to all conſcience, yet in hope of priuate gaine he vvill doe it to the publique loſſe. Looke into all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces either of the Church or Common-wealth, if this abuſe be not general: ſo that the places which had wont to maintaine, and imploy three or foure able men, are now ingroſt by one that perhaps vnderſtands nothing in them, but muſt execute by deputy; nay, perhaps this one ignorant man ingroſſeth two or three of theſe, to the generall detriment and diſcouragement of all. And whereas heereto-fore able men both in ſtate and otherwiſe, where choſen to high and honorable places, who would neither giue bribes to come in, nor neede take any beeing in: Now others are imployed too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, vvho muſt bribe to come in, and muſt needs take bribes to recouer their expences, and to maintaine their eſtates, being once come in. Would to God there were an Act made, that whoſoeuer should ſeeke directly or indirectly, by himſelfe or friends, by mony or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

any office in Church or Common-wealth, till he were thereunto freely called and invited by ſuch as had lawful power, might thereby be diſabled to enter, and be caſt out, vpon proofe, beeing entred. Then men would labour to make themſelues fit, and that might truly be termed a <hi>Calling,</hi> vvhich now is nothing but an intruſion, vſurpation, or purchaſe. Thus the ſtudie of priuacie diſturbes and ouerthrowes all bleſſed commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; and turnes the bleſſings of God into curſes: for if God ſend plenty, the poore Farmer cannot liue, things are ſo cheape; that all the increaſe he hath cannot pay his Landlords Rent, it is ſet ſo high, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the greateſt increaſe, and to the greateſt price: And the Land-lord can abate nothing of his Rent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet his apparell, dyet, and other expences at the higheſt pitch; If he should abate of his Rent, hee muſt then abate of theſe alſo: Which neither his wife, nor his childe, nor himſelfe will admit: Nay rather let the poore ſtatue, let the Common-wealth decay, and the whole runne to ruine, then they reforme any of their ſinnes, or forbeare any of their ſuperfluities. Thus therefore whereas wee had wont to pray for peace and plenty, whileſt charitie dwelt amongſt vs, now both rich and poore muſt pray for warre, ſcarcitie, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, elſe one man cannot liue by another.</p>
            <p>This is the effect of priuacie, whilſt euery man cares onely for himſelfe, and neglects the Common-wealth: but this is contrarie to the practice of the Piſmire, vvho like a good Common-wealths man, gathers for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and others in communitie.

            <p>As for the multitude of their Shippes it is ſuch, that vvhilſt I conſider it, mee thinkes it probable, that as many of them inhabite the Sea, as the Land.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Secondly, by this meanes their owne Beere and Barly is vented at good rates, which if ours were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and freely admitted, would ſcarce be vendible; and ſo men are excited and incouraged to ſow, mault, brew, and to ſeeke to ſupply the Common-wealth vvithin it ſelfe, vvithout borrowing abroad.</p>
            <p>And vvhilſt I conſider this, I can but ſometime vvonder (perhaps in my ignorance) at our reſtraints about the out-lading of Corne and Beere, euen vvhen there is no dear<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h but plenty, if men vvere forced to bring out their ſtore. Aſſuredly if in the time of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, vvhen God ſeemes to call vs to faſting and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, (as at this preſent) faſting vvere enjoyned and ſtrictly obſerued, and the Alehouſes daily and duly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for auoyding of idlenes, drunkenneſſe and exceſſiue ryot, there needed no other prouiſion againſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. But this is the plague, theſe Statutes being penall are beg'd aforehand, or left to the purſuite of beggars
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17481:34"/>
and baſe Promoters, who compound the forfeiture and cooſen the Lawe; or committed to the ouerſight of ſuch as are Ingroſſers themſelues, vvho deſire to haue all things deere, that they may vent their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities at the beſt rate, and ſo grow rich, though the Common-wealth waxe poore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly from this Exciſe of forraine Beere and other commodities the State makes more gaine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of the vvarres and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vvorkes, then all the reſt that deale in them. For in Beere eſpecially they double the price, and haue clearely as much for the Exciſe as the Merchant paid to the Bruer. Now in this they do the parts of prouident fathers, vvho ſeeing their prodigall children waſte their portions, they vnderhand lend money, vvhich their children know not of, and ſo preſerue their Lands from ſale, and their pawnes from forfeiture, returning them againe vvhen the haue more vvit to keepe them and vſe them.</p>
            <p>And in my conceit this vvere a good <hi>Toile</hi> to take out frugall <hi>Foxes,</hi> and a ſure trap for our negligent drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and prodigall heires; vvho being only niggardly in publique vvorks where they should freely giue, vvill grutch to diſburſe ſix pence towardes the maintenance of the Miniſter, and reliefe of the poore, or twelue pence towardes a Subſedy for defence of the State, or for the Kings and kingdomes honour, vvhen they will at that very time, willingly ſpend ten times ſo much in ryot and exceſſe, neuer feeling or complaining of the matter, though they continued this courſe euery day, and cannot by perſwaſions of reaſon, or the force and authoritie of the lawes of God or man, be diuerted and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17481:35"/>
drawne from it: ſuch a baſeneſſe there is in man, ſuch a dull and beaſtly ſottishneſſe in nature, to contrary Religion and reaſon, eſpecially being ſeconded in any euill by company, and confirmed therein by cuſtome, paſt reclaiming.</p>
            <p>Now if the vnited Provinces had peace vvith <hi>Spaine,</hi> as other Countries haue, or vvere in ſubjection to <hi>Spaine,</hi> as not onely the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> but ſome of their owne infected members, and ſome others perhaps of Ours, inconſiderately (as I ſuppoſe) ſeeme to deſire: then neither should they be ſecure of their owne lives, eſtates, and liberties, nor their neighbors ſafe by them. For aſſuredly, howſoever men flatter themſelves, as the Catholike King would be King of all Catholike ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeme to deſire him for their head: But should they be ſo vnhappy as to haue their deſires, what were they but ſlaves? ſince vvhere the <hi>Spaniard</hi> comes, he ſets himſelfe downe like an abſolute and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall Lord, ſilencing all Lawes but his owne, vvhich are as thoſe of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi>; yea as thoſe of <hi>Draco</hi> written in blood. Never did the <hi>Lurdanes</hi> more Lord it in <hi>England,</hi> then they vvhere they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, or be let in vpon any tearmes: tell me <hi>Naples, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Antwerpe,</hi> if this be not true. And though Religion be made the ſtalking-horſe to infatuate and bewitch the mindes of men, and make them betray themſelues and their Countries to ſlaverie; yet the Larke beeing dared, and the Woodcocke in the Net, that maske is caſt away, and there is as much truſt to their promiſes, as to the <hi>Moores</hi> their Kinſmen and late Countrimen. So that becauſe of this feare, as long as the contrariety of Religion laſteth, the innocent party cannot be ſafe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17481:35"/>
vvithout armour, nor ſecure then. Shew mee in any part of Chriſtendome, vvhere any perſon profeſſing the reformed Religion hath beene ſpared, vvere hee friend, neighbour, or kinſman, if That ſide had ſtrength enough to reach his throat: and notwithſtanding our advantages let ſlip in mercy, and none of them purſued bloudily, how haue they in all places, by all meanes waded in bloud vp to the chinne, for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their deſignes? And this will continue as long as Antichriſt raignes; for the Wolfe is bloudy, and the Lambe ſimple; his Fleece warme, and his Bloud and Flesh ſweet. But if the peaceable Goſpel had free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and free operation, then indeed there were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope, but ſecurity, that wee should liue in peace one by another, and that the ſtrength and riches of one King, should not be terrible to another; vvhilſt God would teach every one to be contented with their own, to attend with conſcience the charge they haue in hand, the peaceable governement of the <hi>States</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and as brothers to joyne their powers againſt the common enemie of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi>; not ſo much ſeeking his ſubverſion as converſion; nor am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly thirſting after the enlargement of their owne Kingdomes, as piouſly deſiring the enlargement of Chriſtes Kingdome. For as a covetous rich man, if he ſeriouſly thought to vvhat end his goods vvere giuen him, and what a ſtrict account he muſt make for them, would not ſo greedily hunt after his owne hurt and others loſſe: ſo aſſuredly, if ambitious Princes did vvell conſider their charge, and conſcionably ſtudy vpon the workes and duties of their Callings, (knowing, <hi>that as the people are giuen to be their ſeruants, ſo they interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

Since, beſides the conveniencie of Situtation, their induſtrie is able to effect any difficult vvorke, vvhich others thinke invincible: ſo that wee ſee them powerfull and proſperous euen in all actions they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake by Sea or Land; and that they carry any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize through, though it bee againſt <hi>Himſelfe,</hi> the moſt powerfull and politique Enemy in Chriſtendome. <hi>Moſt powerfull</hi> I call him in regard of his <hi>Indies; moſt politique,</hi> in regard of <hi>his Ieſuites</hi>; and an <hi>Enemy</hi> I call and count him in regard of <hi>Religion; wee beeing for Chriſt, and hee for Antichriſt.</hi>

vvith contempt. So that all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides is the more ſecure by reaſon theſe States and their Countries are imbroyled, and they againe inrich themſelues by that vvhich impouerish the <hi>English</hi> and all other Nations, (for which partly they may thanke the warres) I meane by the Eaſt-<hi>Indian</hi> Voyages, wherein they haue theſe aduantages, vvhich (I ſuppoſe) others want.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, they goe with leſſe charge then others both for men and victualls.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Secondly, they carry out no coyne from their owne <hi>State,</hi> but vvhat they bring in of others; their owne being kept baſe (perhaps for theſe purpoſes) ſo that they furnish themſelues elſwhere, and weaken not the wealth and common ſtocke vvhich is currant in the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly they vent the commodities which they bring from thence, for the moſt part in other places, and returne either mony, or other more neceſſarie ſupplies, in ſtead of the leſſe neceſſarie, vvhich they carry out.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, they make (as I haue before noted) an eaſie exchange, not trading vpon ſo ſtrict conditions as wee doe, but as freely as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> doth vvith them and others; and ſo oftentimes meete their commodities halfe way, and barter powder and shot, for Pepper, Cloues, and other ſpices.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:17481:38"/>5. Fiftly, They haue a large territorie and ample command in the Eaſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> from whence they haue expelled the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> by force, and ſo haue farre better oportunity &amp; conveniencie to trade there, then any other Nation whatſoever; nay, they are able to lade themſelues from their owne Lands. Yea, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible what ſtrength they haue in thoſe parts both of men, Forts, and Confederates; and what a circuit of ground they command, whereupon thoſe rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are growing: All which they haue wonne with their induſtrie, wiſedome, and valour, from this Enemy of theirs, having crackt his credit there amongſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> as they hope to do heere alſo amongſt true beleevers. Neither hath He hope either there or here, ever to recover what Hee hath loſt both in reputation and Rent, except Hee can worke a diviſion amongſt themſelves, or at leaſt betwixt them and vs: which therefore to effect, He turnes every ſtone, and tryes all concluſions Policie can invent. But I truſt, even <hi>Thoſe of theirs that are moſt interested in the quarrels of the Church at home, and thoſe of ours who are moſt intereſted in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne quarrels,</hi> ſee the yſſue of theſe differences too well, to giue ſcope to their affections ſo farre, as thereby to be made inſtruments to repoſſeſſe the <hi>Spanyard</hi> either here or there in the ground he hath loſt. Since what they at home helpe to give the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> they take from their owne Libertie, and what we take, or helpe to take from the <hi>Hollander</hi> to giue to that State, is to take from our ſelves, to giue to our enemies, vvhilſt we weaken our beſt friends, and make the generall enemy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome ſtrong, for our owne certaine ruine amongſt others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:17481:39"/>As for the terrible grouth of the <hi>Hollander,</hi> vvhich ſome ſeeme to ſtartle at, it cannot fright vs; ſince their principall ſtrength is at ſea, and ſo obnoxious to many vnauoydeable dangers in their trade, except they hold good correſpondencie with vs. For our very Coaſt vvilbe euer able to command them, and hold them in awe, and they muſt reſolue either in ſtormes to ride out all hazards, &amp; fight againſt winde, tide, rocks, ſands, and all other caſualties, or to ſubmit themſelues to the mercie of our harbours. And in calmes or fayre wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt paſſe euery flie-bore, at leaſt euery Fleet they ſend out and receiue home, with a guard ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keepe vs vnder hatches; otherwiſe wee shall be ſure to gaine more by their voyages, then they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that are the venturers. Now how impoſſible it is for that State <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o preuent theſe diſaſters of theirs, and aduantages of ours, is apparent to any man that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſituation of their Coaſt and ours.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore whether they trade as Marchants or men of warre, and vvhether they labour to increaſe their Eſtate at home or abroad, or to hold their owne already acquired, our friendship is ſo abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, as they can doe nothing vvithout it, nor ſtir out vvithout leaue. So that God hath bound vs together by an vndiſſolueable band of neceſſitie; and it vvere well therefore that our hearts aſwell as our Lands, and our trades in all other places, aſwell as at home, vvere ſo vnited. Now if I may haue licence after ſo many judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons that haue handled our trade in the Eaſt-<hi>Indies</hi> to and fro, and grounded their reaſons vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, to caſt in my conjectures, I would ſay, the cauſe wee thriue not in that voyage, is:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:17481:39"/>1. Firſt, becauſe of our great charge; for our ships re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more Mariners then theirs, and the moſt that goe haue ſmall or no ventures, Great men being all the sharers: and thoſe that go meerely as ſeruants, beſides that they are not ſo carefull of the maine aduenture as they should bee, and would if they were owners, wilbe well payde and full fed notwithſtanding howſoever the Voyage fals out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, our ships carry out much ſiluer, ſome by permiſſion, more by ſtealth; and this is ſure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing weakens a State ſo much as tranſportation of coyne. Let other things be tranſporred out of the Land, or bee deare or cheape within the Land, all is one; this or that man may bee the richer or poorer, the State is the ſame ſtill. But vvhere mony is exhauſted, and the returne doth not countervaile the out-going, there the State decayes by degrees. As for example, if our Cloth, Corne, Beere, Saffron, Tinne, Hides, and the like, will pay for our Silkes, Wine, Spice, Tobacco, &amp;c. wee may ſtill liue, though wee liue poorely (as luxurious bodies, vvho haue good ſtomackes to ſupply and renue their decayed ſtrength and vvearied ſpirits) but if we waſte more one way, then the other vvill countervaile, whilſt wee haue no other commings in of Bullion from the <hi>Indies,</hi> as <hi>Spaine</hi> hath and wee wont to haue, our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muſt needes decay and fall into pouertie, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting monie, which is properly the wealth and ſtrength of a State: Euen as wee ſee naturall bodies, when they are libidinous, fall into conſumptions, becauſe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences exceede their revenues and commings in.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly, wee may obſerue our waſte, and ſo our weakenes in this kinde, vvhen wee ſpend in <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:17481:40"/>
more wine, velvets, Silks, gold and ſilver, in Laces, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broderie, Guilding; more Sugar, Tobacco, Drugs and Spices, then they do perhaps, in the places from whence wee fetch them, and where Nature hath made ſome of them neceſſarie nourishments: ſo that our owne ships are not ſufficient to furnish vs, but others alſo vent much of theſe their vanities vpon our Coaſt. Thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this or that man may be the richer by this Trade, but I cannot conceive how the publike purſe is filled with Bullion, or the Commonwealth advanced, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much impoverished, and miſerably weakned by it. As for ſuch as ſay, The Kings Cuſtome is the greater, and shipping increaſed by it, I can conceive no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in either, but conjecture, that ſtocke which is there waſted, and worne out with vſe, would in both theſe reſpects, be more beneficiall, were it any other-where, or any otherwiſe employed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, we are tyed to ſuch hard conditions, as muſt needes bee a venter indeed, if wee profit by the Voyage: For if we be ſtrong, we muſt not touch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Spaine</hi> ſeales the Warrant; and if we be weake, wee become a prey to them, or any other more potent. Thus vve are ſent out as sheepe among Wolves, and like Doves among Kites; and if vve ſtirre any of theſe contrary to expreſſe order, that Iuſtice, which would moderate all commerce amongſt Chriſtians, in an even and equall Balance, makes a preſident of his owne, and mues vs vp at our returne.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fiftly and laſtly, vve haue no Land, or a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in thoſe Parts, and ſo not the like meanes from our owne annuall crops to lade our owne ships, or the like liberty and oportunity to furnish our ſelves by trading

vvith thoſe ſeverall Nations, as they have.</p>
            <p>But now if it vvere poſſible to vnite our Trades there, and to bring both Nations into one Corporation, it would be a meanes to ſtrengthen and aſſure both parts here and there, and to enrich both parts without feare of any third, or falling out amongſt our ſelves.</p>
            <p>For I verily beleeve, that that diſguſt betwixt the two Nations in the Eaſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> vvas not ſent thither vvithout a <hi>Romish</hi> practiſe: nor can I beleeve, that thoſe many delayes and dallyings ſince vſed in the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe grievances, and in not ſatisfying His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties juſt demands, proceeded altogether from free and loyall thoughts to their owne State, but had the corrupt mixture of <hi>Spanish</hi> Lees in the bottome. Which may teach vs to be more charitable, then to cenſure the vvhole Nation for the practiſe of ſome few: ſince wee may conſider, this State is compounded of members diverſly affected; and that the good and honeſt people doe ſuffer in our ſufferings, vvhilſt they ſee the others offer vs injurie, vpon purpoſe to make vs breake off, for the benefit of their <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeene a glimpſe of that profit, vvhich the <hi>vnited Provinces</hi> make of their Land-enemy: their other Enemy is the Water both ſalt and fresh; of this likewiſe they make a profitable friend, as I vvill labour briefly to manifeſt.</p>
            <p>The Sea lyes continually raging vpon their Coaſts in ſuch a manner, as if it would hourely eate them vp, and ſwallow all at a mouthfull. It over-lookes them, and they ſeeme to lye vnder it: yet they keepe out this ſtrong enemy at the armes end by art and induſtrie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but rampiers and fortifications of Sand
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17481:41"/>
to oppoſe it. To make theſe ſtrong therefore, and to vnite them that they may not be blown away with the violence of euery ſtormy vvinde, it is incredible what paines they take, ſetting a kind of long graſſe vpon the ſame barren Sands, as curiouſly and carefully, as wee ſet flowres and hearbes in our gardens: which graſſe once getting roote, bindes the earth together, that the winde cannot readily come to blow it away, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them by the like combination to turne their weakeneſſe into the like ſtrength. Now this were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if they had but a little banke to keepe, but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what a large Coaſt they are to guard and make good in this manner, (vvanting our naturall vvalles of rocke) it is a miracle that they should haue ſo much courage as to vndertake it, and ſo much conſtancie as to purſue it, and ſo much cunning as to effect it. I make no queſtion if ſome Nations, vvho beare their heades aloft, had the like worke in hand, they would either neuer attempt it, or faint and giue ouer in the midſt; &amp; rather vvith the <hi>Heluetians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caeſ. Com.</note> ſeeke new Countries to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite, then be at ſuch a continuall coſt and care to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their owne againſt two ſuch enemies at once: when theſe notwithſtanding, do not only keepe their ground, but as they haue dealt vvith <hi>Spaine</hi> for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion vpon their ancient Liberties, Rights, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, ſo heere they haue wonne vpon the Ocean, and recovered a great part from the Seas vſurpation; part whereof, hauing neither ſand not other ſoyle to helpe them, they defend with ſtupendious heapes of ſtone, vvhich, vvith incredible coſt, they fetch from their neighbor Princes, euen in places farre remote, for monie; and with a continuall ſupply of theſe from time
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17481:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to time, keepe out the entrance of ſo furious an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The aſſault and battery vvhich the Sea makes in this one place that I haue ſeene, is about an English mile long or more, vvhich they defend and maintaine with huge piles of timber (brought likewiſe from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne parts) inter-lined vvith thoſe heapes of ſtone fore-mentioned about the bredth of two or three acres all that vvay: otherwiſe the Sea vvould breake in ouer all, and ſoone determine the controuerſie betwixt them and <hi>Spaine,</hi> taking poſſeſſion of all from both of them by force.</p>
            <p>Thus wee ſee how this people maintaine their owne, both againſt the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the Ocean, by helpes which they fetch from forraine Nations; vvhilſt both ther ſouldiers, wherewith they oppoſe the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> are principally ſtrangers, and the very walles and bankes, vvhereby they hold out the Sea are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forraine, and far-fetcht. And this is none of the leaſt part of the Piſmires wiſedome and diligence: to which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſends vs for imitation, whilſt he ſaith, <hi>Goe to the Piſmire, O Sluggard, Conſider her wayes, and be wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as they haue this open and able enemie, the Ocean, beſieging them almoſt about, &amp; aſſaulting them without continually; ſo haue they vvithin the <hi>factious fresh-waters,</hi> that vvill keepe vvithin no bankes (like <hi>Schiſmatickes,</hi> without the ſalt of ſobriety and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ouerflowing them at certaine ſeaſons. Inſomuch as their ſoyle ſeemes a ſpunge in Summer, and a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Meare in Winter; for then, almoſt, all the face of the Continent is vnder vvater. But ſee what profit they make of this Adverſarie, whilſt cutting large paſſages
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17481:42"/>
from place to place with incredible coſt, theſe waters worke for them continually as faithfull ſeruants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying their carriages by this meanes, to and fro, in a cheape, eaſie, and ſafe manner. And ſuch vſe doubtleſſe do they make of the ſeuerall ſects and Religions, by neceſſitie tollerated amongſt them, to helpe to carry the generall charge and burthen of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, with the greater eaſe and aſſurance.</p>
            <p>Nay not only the water, but the winde alſo is their journeyman, and labors continually for them by Mils and other Engines; ſome pumping and forcing the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters out of their ſurrounded paſtures; ſome preſſing oyles, others beating flaxe, hempe, copper; ſome grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding corne, others ſpice; ſome making paper, others ſawing timber; and briefly, neither man, woman, or child, neither ſea nor land, neither water nor winde ſuffered to be idle, but whereſoever it blowes, it blowes good to ſome of them. And it is remarkable &amp; wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that though there be many of theſe Mils in every towne, yet none of them lacke worke, but haue aſmuch to do as they can turne their hands to attend. But whilſt wee conſider the harmony of the vvhole, together with the neceſſarie dependancie of one part with and vpon another, wee readily ſee, that theſe Mils helpe to imploy their ſhips, and their ships them interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably; So that vvhereas one ſaith vvittily but not well, How all the elements conſpire there together to be naught, to ſhew their diſlike of the naughty people, I may truly ſay, All the naughty Elements are forced there to do good, to shew the vertue and diligence of the good people, who conſpire together in honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and artificiall induſtrie. And this is one of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17481:42"/>
they can do things they vndertake, at cheaper rates then many vvith vs, becauſe they make the artificiall Engine to worke for them, vvhich vvith the eaſie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of one or two diſpatcheth the buſineſſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of twenty. Thus as <hi>Sertorius</hi> taught his weake ſouldier to pull off the horſe tayle, haire after haire, which a ſtronger could not moue together all at once, ſo theſe make their ſtrong vvits ſupply the defect of weake handes, and with the helpe of <hi>Pallas</hi> or <hi>Mercurie,</hi> effect that vvhich <hi>Briarius</hi> would wonder at. By this meanes an infinite number of people are imployd in Shippes, Samoreuſes, Hoyes, Skutes, and Botes, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and recarry commodities, to fiſh, fowle, and trade from towne to towne. So that, though it be hard (as I haue ſayd) to determine vvhether the Land or Sea be moſt inhabited by this Nation; yet it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I verily beleeue, that if their Land feedes one, and inricheth one, the vvater feedes two, and inricheth ten for that one. And ſo excellently haue they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe channels, as they ſerue not only for neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie draines to their grounds, and for highwayes in tranſporting their goods commodiouſly from place to place, but for ornaments alſo to beautifie aſwell as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their Townes, vvhere the Ships and Botes paſſe vp and downe through their ſtreetes, and loade and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loade, take in, and deliuer wares at their doores; the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers being walled on both ſides with faire houſes, and the bankes ſet orderly and pleaſantly with trees in moſt places as you paſſe the common ſtreetes of greateſt dealing and ſtirring.</p>
            <p>Thus trade they within land amongſt themſelues, to the exceeding pleaſure and profit of all, and abroad at
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17481:43"/>
Sea by the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indian</hi> Voyages, by their fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Whale, Cod, Sturgeon, Herring, and the like, they imploy a world of Shippes and men, and by this meanes are not only able to maintaine the vvarres, but to helpe their neighbors alſo with Men and money: and notwithſtanding all this, to build and plant vvith ſuch coſt and curioſitie, as if they meant not to loſe the poſſeſſion, or did it for the vſe of other men, eſpecially their good friends the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Nay rather they ſeeme to build thus richly and gorgeouſly vpon purpoſe, as if they intended by that meanes to intice the couetous and ambitious <hi>Spaniards</hi> to aſſault them; and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to aſſure the Aſſaylants of their reſolution, to ſtand out to the laſt man; and that they take not ſuch paines for the pleaſure of any other, but themſelues and their owne children, eſpecially not for their Enemies, whom they rather contemne then feare, as theſe evidences manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Now as wee paſſe along, it vvill not be amiſſe to ſpeake a word of their buildings, which are faire, large, vniforme, all of brick, edged with marble or free-ſtone. No coſt is ſpared either to adorne them vvithout or vvithin, or to adapt them to the owners vſe. Many of their houſes are paved with blacke and white Marble, and curiouſly fronted and in-layd vvith diuerſe rich pieces. Yea the paving of their ſtreetes is ſuch, being much of it bricke laid edge-wiſe, as doth vvitneſſe the generall vvillingneſſe of their hearts to advance any publique worke either for neceſſarie vſe or ornament: vvherein they are a people beyond compariſon forward and liberall, ſo that all common vvorkes of whatſoeuer kinde, are vvith great zeale and diligence performed on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17481:43"/>
all hands, and that they may be vvell and ſubſtantially effected and maintayned, no coſt is thought too much at any hand.</p>
            <p>I tell not any of theſe nigh and notable thinges, as vvonders farre off, but to make this vvonder the more notable, that being ſo neere and ſo vvell knowne by many, they are followed by ſo few, nay ſcarce imitated by any.</p>
            <p>Their planting is likewiſe remarkeable, vvhere not only the ſeuerall Citties and townes haue large, faire, and pleaſant vvalkes, ſet vvith trees after an exact, artificiall, and beautifull manner, and ſo kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vvith great care and coſt (as the private Gardens of great Perſons vvith vs, or as <hi>Morefields</hi> of late, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe) but alſo the very hedge rowes are ſo fenced, and orderly diſpoſed, and the high-wayes ſo planted, as a man vvould thinke he ſtill trauelled through private vvalkes, not publique roades, and thorow-fares.</p>
            <p>One reaſon of this may bee, becauſe through all theſe Countries there are either none or very few <hi>Commons.</hi> Thoſe that are, being very ſmall, are thus imployd for matter of ornament, vvhere the common perſon is not ſuffered (as vvith vs) to ſpoile all at his pleaſure, to cut downe vvhat his predeceſſors planted; but all is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by generall conſent. Which I know not whether to attribute to the good diſpoſition of the people, and their care of poſteritie, or to the vviſedome and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Magiſtrates, executing good Lawes ſtrictly and impartially vvhich tend and reſpect publique vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or to the people and Magiſtrates joyntly concurring
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17481:44"/>
and conſenting in one for the common good.</p>
            <p>And that I haue ſome reaſon for this doubt, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that vvith vs there is more good ground waſted (to paſſe by Forreſts, Chaſes and Parkes, matters of meere pleaſure, or more pleaſure then profit,) and not to mention Commons which lye dry Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) in fennes and ſurrounded grounds, then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>all the Lowe-Countries</hi>; in all the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> I ſay, where meanes for the maintenance of all theſe wars, and works, and buildings, and wonders before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and after to be mentioned is found out. And theſe fennes or Commons of ours (vvhatſoeuer other shew they make to the ignorant and vnexperienced at firſt ſight) ſerue for nothing but to breed idle perſons, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, theeues, and beggars: For either, being ſuch, they reſort to thoſe places as to their harboroughs and couerts, or comming thither able and honeſt men, are ſoone made ſuch: <hi>Firſt,</hi> by the charge of the poore, vvhich they finde there, to vvhom they are forced to contribute by the Law. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the waſted ſoyle, promiſing fairely in the Spring, but deceiuing their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in Winter, the time of moſt need. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by the converſation of their neighbors, corrupting one the other by idle example. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by the oportunity of places out of the vvay, and ſo out of the eye of the Law and Magiſtrate, and giuing shelter to all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. So that in <hi>England</hi> generally, vvhere you finde the largeſt Commons, there you may finde theſe miſerable enormities. Neither will the people learne better either by reaſon or experience, ſo hath ſuperſtition wedded them to the errors of their Anceſtors in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:17481:44"/>But in theſe Countries either through the lacke of Commons, the diligence of the Magiſtrate, or the good diſpoſition of the people, it is farre otherwiſe, vvhere there are none or very few beggars, except neere the Court, and thoſe moſtly of other Nations. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed euery man vvorkes, and depends vpon himſelfe (vvith Gods bleſſing) for his ſuſtenance; thinking it a shame, that two hands should not feede one mouth, and clothe one backe: None but the aged or impotent with them will aske any thing, and they very ſeldome; and that rather by preſenting themſelues as objects of compaſſion to the paſſenger, then by verball ſollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this is ſo vvell knowne, as families falling into decay, haue died through penurie, rather then they vvould make others acquainted vvith their vvants. Which obſtinacie or pride of theirs I praiſe not, but ſet the ſame downe only to shew the generoſitie and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their natures vvhich abhorres dependancie. To preuent this inconvenience, the charitable <hi>State</hi> is forced, vvhere the like ſuſpicion is had of vvant, to ſearch the houſes of ſuch, and to contribute towards their neceſſities, by a kind of ſilent and cloſe compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea there is often found, that diuers of theſe haue beene releeued by mony caſt into their houſes, and that in large ſummes by liberall hands, vvhilſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue kept themſelues ſecret, as doubting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or returne at leaſt of their free benevolences, if the receivers had knowne vvhere to make reſtitution.</p>
            <p>And now indeed I muſt confeſſe, though their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities be not ſo full of oſtentation, nor ſpent in that ſort, that wee (by the example of our forefathers) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ours; that is, at the doore, (vvhich courſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17481:45"/>
not, but vvish continued, in regard of the aged and impotent perſons, and in regard of the couetous, vvho take an eaſie excuſe to be vncharitable, and vvill neither giue priuately nor publiquely; and in regard of the vain-glorious,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.14.</note> who will giue there publiquely or no vvhere) yet it is more properly, and I thinke, more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably beſtowed by them then by vs. For vvith vs (as good Cuſtomes may be corrupted) this <hi>Doore-dole</hi> (as I may call it) rather makes rogues and vagabonds, then releeues aged and impotent perſons. So that, as the <hi>Abbies,</hi> and other like houſes, hauing in their handes the liuings of many poore people, (whoſe ſuperſtitious forefathers gave ſo much to the Church, as they left nothing for their children) might vvell releeue at their doores ſuch, as vnder the <hi>colour of deuotion and long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 20.47</note> they had before rob'd and diſinherited: ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe many vvith vs, hauing before fed themſelues full vvith the ſweat of other mens browes, euen to glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, drunkenneſſe, and ſurfetting, may releeue vvith their ſcraps, crummes, bones, and broken beere, the neceſſities of ſuch, as they, or their predeceſſors, haue before vndone and made beggers, either by ſome hard Farme, or by vſurie, or ſome craftie bargaine, or by ſuites and moleſtations, or ſome other the like cruell exaction. But theſe on the other ſide giue little at the doore (except to the impotent, or to children) but their charities are more properly and profitably pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>vz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, in putting out poore children apprentiſes, vvhich haue their trades taught them freely, and their meate and drinke they duly receiue at the houſes of the better ſort from day to day by turnes, during their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiships:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17481:45"/>
Where notwithſtanding they are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to hang idlely from their worke, and to loyter away the time, but fed, diſpatched, and ſent away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. The like to this, or rather better, vvas that act for binding out apprentiſes with vs even to husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Country, vvhich vvas hotly purſued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhile by ſome good Patriots vvith happy ſucceſſe; but this ſoone met diſcouragements, as many other good things doe, vvhich are executed vvith more heate then conſtancie.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Secondly, their charities are ſeene in their <hi>Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes</hi> for the aged people of both ſexes, ſeuerally by themſelues; vvhoſe Roomes are kept, and they tended, both in a neceſſary and neate manner; inſomuch, as a man comming into one of thoſe houſes (as every towne hath one of them at the leaſt, very large and faire, vvith gardens and all other neceſſaries for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and recreation of wearie age) he would judge them to be built only for shew and brauerie: Yea, euery ſeuerall chamber or Cell is ſo adorned and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, as it vvould not only content the dweller, but delight the beholder alſo: And a ſtranger would rather judge them the habitations of rich Marchants, then of poore decrepide and decayed perſons.</p>
            <p>I know no Nation exceedes vs in theſe kinds of vvorkes, eſpecially ſince the Reformation of Religion, and that the Goſpell came to bee freely preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, ſo that (to the honour of God and His cauſe be it ſpoken) our <hi>thankefulneſſe</hi> hath beene more fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then our Adverſaries <hi>merit</hi>: but theſe of ours are the charitable actions of particular perſons, ſo that one place hath (perhaps) ſuperfluitie of proviſion, having
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17481:46"/>
many Almes-houſes, and another lackes neceſſarie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, having none: vvhereas in the <hi>vnited Prouinces</hi> theſe houſes are maintained at the publike charge of the State or the Cities; and ſo every place is alike ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently provided for according to an even and equall proportion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly, their Waſe-houſes for poore Orphans are ordinarie in every Towne, vvhere great numbers of children of both Sexes, are educated, (as in Chriſts-church Hoſpitall in <hi>London</hi>) and ſome of them taught Trades, others trayned vp in Learning, and every one employed according as they are inclined and found ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; and then ſent out to ſerue in the Church or Commonwealth, vvhen they are fitted for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The women have choice to goe or ſtay at pleaſure: but if they marry, then are they diſmiſſed from thence, yet not empty handed, but ſo provided as may ſerue to ſet vp young beginners, leſt they should ſeeme onely to marry, as vvith vs they vſe to doe too often, to fill the Commonwealth with idle beggars.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, their Gueſt-houſes for the ſicke are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in all places, and well provided of all neceſſaries as the other before-mentioned. There the ſicke finde cleane linnen, good beds and fires, attendance, meate, drinke, Phiſicke, Chyrurgerie, and whatſoever may helpe toward his recovery at the common charge of the State. So that be he a native or a ſtranger, an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant or hired ſouldier, or any other perſon, if hee bee poore and ſicke, hee is admitted and provided for, till God diſpoſe of him, either to health or death. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as vve shall not ſee in an Age, a poore man or a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17481:46"/>
childe lye ſicke groning in the ſtreetes, nor a diſtreſſed woman there travelling in child-bed, in the eye of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe paſſengers; as it fals out too often with vs, more I muſt confeſſe, out of foolish pitie, for lacke of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good Lawes for their timely employment, and for prevention of idleneſſe, then for lacke of charitable hearts to relieve their neceſſities once decayed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fiftly, their Bedlams and Dul-houſes for diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted people, and their Houſes of correction or Tucht-houſes, for idle people that will follow no certaine nor ſetled courſe of life, nor betake themſelves to any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are as ordinarie and generall in every place as any of the reſt afore-mentioned: and all meanes vſed to reclayme the firſt to their wits, the other to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſties. Neither are any of theſe houſes left to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and covetous abuſe of any one man, but their Rents, disburſements, vſages, and orders, are duly and often viſited and examined by the Magiſtrates &amp; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and an open eare affoorded to all complaints, with a ſpeedy reformation of all injuries and abuſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixtly, their Lumbards or Loane-houſes, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the benefit of the poore, where Brokers are not ſuffered to take fifty, or one hundred in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ratably in leſſe ſummes even to ſixe pence, to the grinding of the faces of poore men, the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of labourers, the maintenance, enticement, nay, enforcement and provocation of theevery; but the poore may vpon pawnes ſupply his owne neceſſity at eaſie rates of fiue or ſixe pounds in the hundred, and haue reaſonable time of redemption allowed.</p>
            <p>Thus firſt they wiſely prouide to keepe men from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17481:47"/>
vvant, by imployment, and then prouide to ſupply their wants, if age, ſicknes, infirmitie, or caſualtie caſt them into pouertie, by vnavoydable neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>And all theſe vvith many other charges domeſticke and forraine, may the more eaſily be ſuſtained, whilſt the people are naturally or cuſtomarily frugall, and bound to be ſo, if not by Lawes, (as wee are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) yet at leaſt by the example of their Predeceſſors dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Superiors liuing, as I would to God wee were. This frugality of theirs appeares in three reſpects; in their feeding, and cloathing, and calling: or in their diet, apparell, and titles.</p>
            <p n="1">1, Firſt, their <hi>diet</hi> is but homely, euery day is not a feaſting day, but they know God made a Sea aſwell as a Land, and appointed there should be Faſts aſwell as Feaſts. Yea, their whole life ſeemes nothing but a faſt from ſuperfluity, if vvee compare it vvith our owne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their exceſſe in drinke, which is the only ſtaine of their Nation: Neither is this ſo much as Rumour makes it ſeeme; for euen in this vice I feare wee exceede them; at leaſt I am ſure, if they ſpend more time in drinking then we doe, wee ſpend more drinke then they vſe to doe in the like time.</p>
            <p>As for their feaſtes, if any exceſſe be among them, it is there to be found, and that rather in their long ſittings, then coſtly ſurfers: for theſe their meetings ſeeme meerely to be loue-feaſtes, and to be made more for ſocietie and neighbourhood, then for the delicacie of the Cates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are neither various nor chargeable. They travell not over Sea and Land for dainties, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need they travell farre for Cookes; their owne ſerue their turne, and fit their ſtomachs and Pallates

better, then either the luxurious <hi>Italian,</hi> or ryotous <hi>French.</hi> Salt is their principall ſpice, and they trauell to the <hi>Indies</hi> rather for vs then for themſelues: ſince if they ſpend one pound of thoſe Drugges, wee, for that one, (I beleeue) ſpend one hundred. And the ſame may be ſaid of Sugar and other compoſitions for ſauces, which they bring to vs, as to Gluttons, vvhilſt, like ſober and temperate perſons, they abſtaine themſelues from the exceſſive vſe of thoſe vnwholeſome prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, as their diet is moderate, where all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and waſte is avoyded, ſo are they modeſt in their apparell, shewing themſelues conſtant to their country fashion, and decently cloathed euery man according to his ranke and ſtate. The Lawes neede not limit them, vvhilſt Reaſon is their Law; and they are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med go to in ſuch apparell, as we shame to be without. I meane, as with vs the only glory is to be gay, and the greateſt shame to be vnder-clad or euen-clad to our Callings: ſo vvith them the greateſt shame is to be gaudy, and the greateſt glory to be decently and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly attired, equall to their abilities, or rather vnder then aboue it: But now the light example of the <hi>French,</hi> ſeconded by our more ſutable converſation, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to taint them by degrees vvith euery exceſſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in apparell; and if the prouident Magiſtrate looke not to it betimes, the vnbrideled and licencious youth vvill, in this reſpect, vndo the publique, and weaue fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſilke for their owne feete, which their plaine and wiſe forefathers (in imitation of the renowned <hi>Spartans</hi>) broke aſunder by induſtrie, and kept broken by frugality and contented ruſticitie. Aſſuredly the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17481:48"/>
ſubjection to any of theſe vices effeminates the heart of man, and prepares a State fit and ſupple for any other ſubjection, how baſe, dejected, or dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſoever it bee.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly, as their diets and clothes are meane, ſo are they generally contented with the eſtates and titles of their Anceſtors, not vainely or ambitiouſly hunting after the badges of Gentilitie or Nobilitie, and vndoing themſelues to purchaſe either. For they thinke it a madneſſe to clip their vvings, thereby to impe out their traines, to leſſen their meanes for the increaſe of their charge, and to ſell their Landes to buy titles. <hi>Much better is it</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to be Earle of Holland in poſſeſsion, then titular King of Ieruſalem.</hi> And by this contentment they enjoy themſelues in a retired priuacie, vvhilſt the Common-wealth enjoyes them as able to ſerue her in all reſpects publiquely, as if they had ſtiles anſwerable to their deſervings. By this meanes alſo they are not charged with ſuch pompe &amp; furniture either of clothes, ſtuffe, Plate, and attendants, as ſuch a ſtate would require, nor are they forced, for the ſuckling and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of theſe Calues, to draw milke from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth till bloud follow, as they muſt do, should they heighten their ſtation.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay, that their moderation in theſe three reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, is none of the leaſt meanes that they are ſo well able to goe through with all other difficulties; whereas with vs the contrarie affection in theſe particulars, vvorkes the contrarie effects, being the three principall cauſes of our generall want.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt for diet, it is vvonderfull, that the Belly and Backe of <hi>England,</hi> like <hi>Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> by Luxurie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17481:48"/>
and Pride should devoure all Gods bleſſings which both by Sea, and Land it ſelfe aboundantly brings forth; and vvhich, if men and not beaſtes had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it, vvere able plentifully to helpe others: when as wee, not therewith contented, as if it vvere ſome barraine part of the world, and not one of the fruitfulleſt, doe call for ſupplies out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alſo, (eſpecially of Beefe and Mutton) when no Land in Chriſtendome is better furnished of thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and ſubſtantiall prouiſions then our owne. But thoſe brethren of ours both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are content with dried fish, barly-broth, milke, whay, cruds, <hi>shamrocks,</hi> long-woorts, rootes, and the like, vvhilſt they furnish vs vvith their flesh which they finde ſo vendible in our Markets.</p>
            <p>One of the cauſes of this may bee the idle waſte of our young <hi>ſtore,</hi> euen then when they are new falne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dam. What droves of Calues, Lambs, Rabets, and yong Fowle, with fish, fruit, and abundance of other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, are daily devoured in one City of <hi>London,</hi> before they come to maturitie, and that for the ſatisfaction of euery prodigall youth, and luxurious Dame?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, for apparell, beſides that no mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory can thinke vpon all the our-landish toyes, which are howrely brought in, and made neceſſarie to vs, by the change of ſo many new fashions that haue floated amongſt vs in their ſeaſons) the principall clothing vſed amongſt vs, is both forraine and beyond the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the vvearer, if either his eſtate and calling, or the Lawes of the Land were looked vpon vvith reſpect. But wee are more led in theſe things by the example of our preſent ſuperiors, then the Lawes of our wiſer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.

It vvere braverie therefore indeed worthy of a Courtier, knowing others would imitate and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in the heade of the fashion, to adorne himſelfe vvith domeſtique ornaments, banishing thoſe Dorres and Butterflies from his eares and elbowes who durſt buzze about him contrarie perſwaſions; and whilſt hee ſeeth the <hi>Italian, French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> come in ſilkes, to incounter theſe with ſcarlet cloth; thoſe <hi>English</hi> bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries, as our Anceſtors had vvont, and our vviſer neigbors vſe to doe. What aduantage hath an imbrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red coate, of a plaine modeſt habit, in treatie or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell? Only this, that the more ſober perſon knowes there may be a ſudden sharpneſſe of vvit, or a reſerved formality, no ſoliditie, where there is ſo much vanitie. And now, I pray, vvhen Gallants know that this is the generall opinion of the vvorld, and their outward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits is one of the principall marks whereby men gueſſe at the inward, vvhat haue they gotten by their affected brauerie? nay how much rather, if they be vviſe, haue they loſt, to buy the opinion of folly at ſo deare a rate? doubtles, if in theſe kindes wee could be ſo happily vviſe, as to moderate our ſelues either by Lawes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, vvee should ſoone abate much of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors pride, vvho for lacke of vent for their vanities vvould be forced to ſpend them within themſelues; and ſo our broad-clothes vvould in short time fret out their ſilkes and veluets, and vvee should learne by the frugall example of the wiſe <hi>Piſmire,</hi> to make profit of them, as they now make profit of vs.</p>
            <p>The like may be ſaid of that ambitious diſpoſition or humor of ours to hunt after titles, as if the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Spaine</hi> had infected our more temperate climate,

            <p>There are Lawes to preuent all theſe diſorders, and to keepe every man in his rancke: But they lye dead, vvhilſt theſe vices often liue in the perſons that should execute them. So that the offence is lawfull, the lawe is ſinfull; vice hath gotten the vpper-hand of vertue, and the Law now either ſerues to no end, or only ſerues to <hi>shew vs our trangresſions,</hi> and how apt vvee are to do vvhatſoeuer Iuſtice prohibits, though therein wee contradict both the will of <hi>God and the King.</hi> Would God that heereafter whoſoeuer durſt preſume to beg the penaltie of a Statute ordayned for preuenting or remouing theſe and the like common annoyances, thereby to make the Lawe voide for his priuate bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, (deſpenſing vvith a generall offence done to the Common-wealth) might be counted a traytor (as truly he is no better) and ſo punished for his treaſon, <hi>that others might heare, and feare, and doe no more ſo.</hi>

            <p>I might adde fitly in this place the ſeveritie of the Magiſtrates in the <hi>vnited Provinces,</hi> in taking all mulcts of this kinde where the tranſgreſſion is common, and imploying ſuch forfeitures to the generall good of the State, <hi>making with the blood of one Scorpion, an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poyſon of others</hi>: Likewiſe I might ſpeake of their Mercy in that vvhich concernes life, inſomuch as, though fellony be death by their Lawe, yet few die

But indeed their generall diligence ſo takes them vp, and prouides ſo vvell for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, as there are very few theeves amongſt them, in compariſon of other Countries where idleneſſe is more permitted.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe tell you, how not only <hi>Robbery,</hi> but euen that cloſe kinde of theft, <hi>vſurie,</hi> vvhich eats vp all trading, and picks the pocket of euery profeſſion, is no free-denizen in their Land, but a meere ſtranger or ſojourner, and that a very poore one: And how by this meanes Land is bought and ſold at good rates, and the ſtocke of euery man kept ſtirring in ſome kinde or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which quickens the Common-vvealth, and keepes the backe of the Marchant from breaking. And I could wish, by the way, with all my heart, that it vvere banished <hi>England</hi> alſo, or at leaſt muzled for bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo deepe: Or, if neither of theſe, yet that the bandes and aſſurances might be publiquely recorded, and a part of the intereſt kept backe to the vſe of his Majeſtie and the Church, towards the redeeming of Impropriations. And great reaſon for this, ſince now, offending againſt God and the King, they pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their increaſe to either; but by this meanes might be reſtrained, or at leaſt conſtrained to do his Majeſtie ſervice, and to recover to the Church their ancient right; vvhich to performe, I doubt not, from the tenths of the vſe-money in <hi>England,</hi> a ſumme ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient might ſpeedily be raiſed.</p>
            <p>I might likewiſe shew their equity, not onely in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding controverſies, and cutting off delayes in Lawe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17481:50"/>
with expedition, but alſo in providing for the poore Debtor, who hath not to pay his Creditor. For if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that either fire, ſea, ſuretiship, truſt, or ſome ſuch croſſe, or (as we ſay) caſualty, hath impoverished him; and that his wants ariſe not either from prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or ſlouth, or ſome perſonall defect in his Calling, he shalbe inabled and ſet vp againe; at leaſt, if hee be caſt into priſon, the mercileſſe man, who with vs ſayth, He will make Dice of his bones, shall be forced to keepe him there at his owne charge. And ſo it is, if the ſuite ſmell of vexation in the Plaintife, or if the Defendant ought and be able, but fraudulently denies, or delayes to ſatisfie the Plaintife, a quicke and ſpeedy tryall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth the truth, and cuts off thoſe demurres, vvhich vvith vs had vvont to occaſion greater loſſe of time and money, then the loſſe of the debt, or thing in queſtion could haue beene to either party, at firſt without ſuite: though now to the honour of the Clergie, Conſcience begins to finde the right end, to vnwinde that infinite bottome of controverſies, which the confuſed variety of opinions had made in the determination of Right and Wrong. Yet whether that courſe of theirs, where the impriſoned lyes at the charge of the Actor, vvould doe well or no with vs, I doubt; though there, I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, it neither makes any man the leſſe wary of his eſtate, or the leſſe carefull to pay his debts; neither is dealing any thing the more dead; every man ſo honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly aymes to doe what he is able for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſatisfaction of all; ſo that few repent of any truſt they have affoorded others.</p>
            <p>I might here alſo obſerve amongſt them,<note place="margin">Com lib. 8. cap. 12.</note> that which <hi>Comines</hi> obſerves of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that vpon every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

            <p>Perhaps this may bee the peoples fault, who are ſo farre from obſerving extraordinary and religious Faſts, as they will not obey the Magiſtrate commanding or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and civill Faſts for politicke reſpects.

But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the fault is, I wish it were mended.</p>
            <p>I should conclude all with a touch of their Councel, and politique Government in point of State, but that the buſineſſe is too deepe and private for my inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Onely I obſerve a generall freedome permitted and vſed, where generall actions which concerne all, and are maintained by all, are generally debated, argued, fifted and cenſured by all men without contradiction.

But after all this, the

reſolution and concluſion is ſilent and ſodaine, vvhilſt they giue all men libertie to informe, they themſelues only direct and diſpoſe of the buſineſſe: for they ſeeke not the ſatisfaction of their owne vvils ſo much, as the generall ſatisfaction of all, vvhere it may be with the good of all. And vvhilſt men doe no hurt vvith their hands, they permit them freely to do all the good they can with their tongues, without feare of punishment. No man doth any thing, vvhich he is ashamed to heare of; or if he doth euill (as all men may erre) deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to heare of it by any meanes, that ſo he may the better and ſooner know how to amend it. It is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and obſtinate which hideth his faultes, and ſtops the mouth of truth by violence; the penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth his error, becauſe he intends to giue ſat<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

And aſſuredly therefore, as religious pretences and a ſtrict obſervance of the <hi>Romish Faith,</hi> haue much advanced the <hi>Spanish</hi> Conqueſts one way, amongſt fooles that wilbe eaſily miſled with flourishes: ſo the preſſing of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> vpon conquered Countries hath hindered his Conqueſts in other partes amongſt wiſe and free Nations, vvho can looke into thoſe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble drifts of policie.

vvhich he beares by ſubjecting it to one of their dead ſtatues, the vvorke of their owne hand.

            <p>And now to returne to my purpoſe, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all that I have ſayd in praiſe of this people, that my Countrymen may not paſſe the ſeas, or travell farre for a proofe, let them looke into Maſter <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Britania,</hi> in the title of <hi>Pembroke-shire,</hi>

            <p>Or let every <hi>Reader</hi> take a neerer courſe, and looke home to the next great <hi>Towne</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in our Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſider in vvhat ſtate ſuch places were at their firſt arrivall, and how they have increaſed in wealth, people, beauty, order, and trading, ſince their admiſſion and entertainment there, and (I beleeve) he will be of my mind.</p>
            <p>To inſtance one place for all amongſt many that I know, looke vpon the City of <hi>Norwiche,</hi> which may be a mirror to all the Kingdome beſides; and that partly I might ſay, principally by their meanes. The order and good governement of the Magiſtrates, the diligence of the Citizens, their quicke trading, vvhereby they ſet many on worke within ten or twelue miles round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17481:55"/>
the Citie, is notable and admirable. This is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally occaſioned by the example of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as alſo by a kinde of vertuous emulation, to which the <hi>English</hi> are excited by their diligence. And this, though it move envie in the baſer and ſlouthfuller ſort, vvho are loth to ſee others live by them, and ſay they are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by the cheape ſale of ſuch wares as the Strangers worke: yet others of better mind and metall, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this, and provoked to fare hard, to be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, to worke early and late, that they may ſell as cheape, and make as good worke as the Stranger.</p>
            <p>Many neceſſarie trades they haue brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, whereby our owne materials, and our men are joyntly well imployed: they haue beene the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters of many profitable Engines both for peace and warre: Travellers by Sea and Land are beholden to their labors; and for the belly, they haue taught vs by rootes, fruite, and the Garden crop, to ſpare much flesh and Corne, if vvee were as wiſe and willing to vſe them as they doe. This doubtleſſe is a good preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for dearth and ſcarcitie, and I would it vvere made more generall in our Land, that ſo wee need not ſpend all our flesh vvithin our ſelues, at leaſt not borrow of others, who haue farre more need of their owne then wee. There was once a courſe taken by the Iudges to ſettle and reward ſuch planters and Gardiners at the publique charge in euery place; but being only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and never farther enquired after, it vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and died aſſoone as it vvas conceived, before it could conceiue and bring forth a yeeres increaſe.</p>

Wherfeore to shut vp all in a word:</p>
            <p>Since God hath giuen vs one originall, not only from <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Iaphet,</hi> but in a farre neerer line to be derived from our firſt arrivall in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo fitted our natures and manners together, that (except ſome ſmall differences which vvill be betwixt Nation and Nation, euen by the different temperature of the ſoyle and ayre, or other naturall accidents, as betwixt brother and brother in a houſe) vvee agree well, and ſeeme as if wee were one people.</p>
            <p>Since it hath pleaſed God ſo to place vs vpon earth, that one may conveniently helpe another in ſpite of the interpoſition or oppoſition of any third.</p>

And laſtly, to make theſe motives more ſtrong, and without which all the former and much more were nothing.</p>
            <p>Since God hath made vs <hi>Profeſſors of one true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> vvherein they may chalenge properly to be <hi>Defenders of the Faith,</hi> and to belong to the chiefe <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> as well as wee; let vs joyne together in one as brethren, and let not the malice of <hi>Sathan,</hi> the Policie of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the treaſon and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of the <hi>World,</hi> the exorciſmes and charmes of <hi>Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> with any other <hi>Spanish Court Holy-water,</hi> divide vs, diſtract vs, or diſcourage vs; but rather obſeruing all theſe traines wiſely, and viewing the end and ſcope of their enterprizes, let vs weave our ſelves more cloſely together, and tye our ſelues inſeparably in a true-loues knot, that <hi>Alexander of Rome may neither vnty nor cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</hi>
