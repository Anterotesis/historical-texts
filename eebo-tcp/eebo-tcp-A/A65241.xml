            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause I know you were at
a distance when that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and never enough to
be lamented Fire, begun
the 2. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> desolated our Native
City, the glory of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
London;</hi> In which, I, your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriot,
formerly happy in it, am now
a great sufferer with it; I think it a just
service to the publique, and no unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
present to you, to endeavour
such an account of the commencement,



<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51852:3"/>
progress and conclusion of it, as both
mine own view, and the faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of others assists me to; that as God
may have the glory of his just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on a populous and rich City dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
and impoverished, so men may
see the dreadful effects of providence,
untutelar to their acquisitions, and call
off their hearts and confidences, from
these sublunaries, to God, who only
can bring them to us, and preserve
them with us, and by whom only they
can be transformed into comforts,
(which as elementary and vicissitudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
they can in no true sense be.
<hi>For the fashion of this world passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>)
and the glory of it being but as
a Flower of the Field; to set the heart
upon that which has wings and flyes
away, will we, nill we, is to be as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to our own deception, as weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and wilfulness can make us, or
misery and judgement can continue us
to be.</p>
            <p>And because (Sir) it is bruited
abroad by some that this fatal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
had a more than ordinary express
of fury, that is, that <hi>London</hi> was fired
from Heaven, as was <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi>



               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51852:3"/>
of old, though say they, God
restrained the Fire from such dismal
effects as then were permitted it: And
others referr it to the spight and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
of male-content Villanes, and
mischievous Forreigners, greedy thus
to revenge themselves of us, for our
stout demeanours towards them, and
our great successes against them, which
they judge no otherwise ballanceable
than by this spoil and non-such disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
equal, if not <hi>paramount,</hi> to
any other diversion: because (Sir) I
say men are so variously acted in this
<hi>Euroclydon</hi> of Providence, which has
been so stupifying to every mans sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that either was a compassionate
spectator, or a concerned sufferer in
the spoil and loss of that once famous
place, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> so long ago terms,
<hi>Nobilissimum emporium &amp; commeatu ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiatorum
maxime celebre;</hi> I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
to write my thoughts of the
rise, nature, and circumstances of the
Fire, and to beg your patience and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
both to them and me.</p>
            <p>And here (Sir) I must confess
though I adore the greatness of God,



<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51852:4"/>
and deplore the grievousness of the sin
of <hi>London,</hi> for which God may justly
bring upon it, not only what he has, but
greater and more eradicating judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
such as he expresses, <hi>when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
he will make an end by, and the fire of
his wrath shall burn, and none shall
quench it.</hi> Though whatsoever of this
that might have been more, is the
deserved severity of God to its many
and monstrous sins, yet doe I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this Fire was like that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> for that was fire
from the Lord out of Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.
24. Fire not only of wasting things
combustible, but Fire of exinanition to
to the earth and soyl, incapacitating it
to produce necessaries for the life of
man and beast, converting the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the place into Brimstone and
Salt and Burning, as the Lord para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraseth
on <hi>Sodoms</hi> judgement, <hi>Deut.</hi>
29. 33. so that it became desert, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be dwelt in again. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 13. 19.
for such fire, like the waters on the old
world, God may be only thought once
to exemplifie his power by, and to fix
the fear and awe of him in the minds



<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51852:4"/>
of men, insolent against him, whose
greatness it can reach, whose obdurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it can penetrate, whose fixation in
the world it can dissettle; <hi>God who has
said his spirit shall not always strive with
man, forasmuch as he is but dust, lest the
spirit that he hath created should fail before
him,</hi> makes all judgement his strange
work, and therefore such stupendious
ones as this, he may be thought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
much more his strange work:
once indeed he has appeared in flaming
Fire and devouring Brimstone to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and the City of the rich and fertile
plain, who were <hi>sinners before the Lord,</hi>
that is, who because they were rich
were riotous, and because they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
from the soyl which was rank
and lusty, gave themselves up to luxury
and pride; (<hi>For the sins of Sodom were
idleness and fulness of bread.</hi>) Once
more he will send his Son in flaming Fire
to dissolve the world and render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
to his enemies; but his intercur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
judgements of Fire between this
first &amp; that last president of unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledness,
are alloyed by mixtures of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in them. And I perswade my self of



<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51852:5"/>
this nature was the late judgement by
Fire upon <hi>London,</hi> a City not like <hi>Sodom</hi>
without Priest and without Magistrate,
whose vices and insolencies bore down
both ordinances of Church and State.
<hi>Londons</hi> fulness of bread and idleness
were no publick and owned effronte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
no such wickedness as <hi>Sodom</hi> had
was setled by a law, or practised against
law in her, no rioters against Angels
were her inhabitants as the <hi>Sodomites</hi>
were, no murmurers were they against
Gods soveraignty as the <hi>Sodomites</hi>
were, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Therefore God in the
midst of judgement remembred mercy
to <hi>London;</hi> God overthrew not only
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> but all the Cities
of the plain, giving <hi>Zoar</hi> only for a
Sanctuary to one <hi>Lot;</hi> but God has
not destroyed the Suburbs of <hi>London</hi>
or the neighbouring City to it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them for a shelter to her many
thousand inhabitants; God destroyed
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in a moment,
<hi>Lament.</hi> 4. 6. by a special and not to
be disputed finger of God, no mortal
instrument co-operating, no culinary
fire being so speedy in its consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,



<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51852:5"/>
but God exercised his judgements
on <hi>London</hi> gradually that the spectators
might by the sight of their punishment,
bewail the ingratitude of their sin
deserving it; God overthrew all the
Inhabitants of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and that which
grew upon the ground of it, but God
has preserved the Inhabitants of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and much of their riches to be a
seed of succession and a door of hope
to its future restauration. God petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<hi>Lot</hi>'s wifes body as a standing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of his wrath upon her, but
for looking back upon <hi>Sodom</hi> whence
she was delivered, with commiserati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it and wish of better fortune to
it, but God has delivered the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>London</hi> to look to <hi>London</hi>
with pity and to praise him for their
deliverance, and they wish its re-edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I hope, without sin, and will set
on to build it, I hope, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Lastly, <hi>Sodoms</hi> judgement
is termed <hi>Eternal fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7v. Jude</note> as if God had
made those monstrous sinners, who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the glory of God into shame,
to have a Hell both here and hereafter,
unusual sinners punished with unusual



<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51852:6"/>
judgements; But <hi>Londons</hi> doom, I
hope, is not such, for God has given its
inhabitants the <hi>spirit of grace and of
supplication,</hi> and though they have
ashes for beauty, and the spirit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness
for the garment of salvation, yet
are they submissive to God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepters
of his correction, and abiders
by it till he release them from it. And
hence it is (Sir) that I conclude since
<hi>London</hi> was that City when it was
fired that had a people and thousands
of them that feared God sincerely; if
in any part of the world God had a
chosen generation, and a people nigh
unto him, the judgement of fire sent
upon it was not miraculous and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
as those fires we read consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Sacrifice on the Altar, 9, 10.
of <hi>Levit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 9. Iosephus lib. 8. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. Iudic. c. 7. l. 8. c. 2.</note> or that which consumed
the Flesh upon the Altar upon <hi>Elias</hi>
his Prayer, or that which destroyed
the Souldiers, sent to apprehend <hi>Elias,</hi>
or that which consumed <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,

natural operation and activity sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the addition of Gods penall
power in it, no such Fire I humbly
conceive was this, but that Fire which
the providence of God suffered to fall
out by the mediation of concurring
circumstances specifique to that Issue
and productive of the consequences
of it.</p>
            <p>Yet Secondly I humbly also conceive
this Fire of desolation, not to be
barely natural, but to be signal of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
supernatural, for Gods not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his power to hinder it, is the
tacite commissioning of nature to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
its utmost of active evil, that is,
of penal truculency, which only is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
and asswaged by God, who
says to the Sea, hitherto shalt thou go,
and to the Plague, Sword, Famine,
Fire, beyond this bound yee shall not
pass. Which considered, there may
several particulars be mentioned which
might subserve to this ruine;</p>

Which considered, if <hi>London</hi> were not

have been of such import as it was;
but such it being, it must by a parity

and thence must follow unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
that all designs of ruine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution

            <p>Thus (Sir) it may be probable the

Secondly, can it be denied but that it
may be furthered from a party at

while Loyal and under due Obedience
to lawful Government they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the only check to their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy,
and the only probable ballance
to their mutinous preponderations?
for though I well know they do
not all agree in first principles, yet
may they conjoyn in the design of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
their opposites, (as they account

but also with the virulent vulgar,
and the deboshed libertines nessed in

them to any destructive course in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement

promisouous aggregations of men,
having vast Suburbs, and (those inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited

under a loose Shire Government, and
many of those single Persons, Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

from those insolent and needy num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
who if not restrained by strong
Watches, and Trained bands ready
upon all summons, and hindred rise or

Popular readiness to seize upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectors,
would undoubtedly upon
any general and amazing contingent,
become vexatious and bloudy, which
being the apprehension of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Inhabitants to be responsible for them,
and upon survey of their number about
1647. I remember the number of them
who lived in the Out-parts and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
on Government, as to their
charge to or in it, was said to be many
thousands. And how dangerous these
added to the other poor members of
Parishes and Masters of Sheds and
Houses are, is easie to be judged and
has been found by sad experience in
the Fire, the loss of which was much
in the Goods imbezzelled, and the
Thefts committed by them upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of helping forth goods and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

ought to be concerned in the misery
of any part of it, as to prog for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to pilfer from them whom
the Fire sufficiently threatned, and at
last preyed upon; the Fire had no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
from their labour, nor the
removers any benefit by their fidelity,
but they either valued their labour so
high that no losers purse could well
reach to it, (by reason of which some
ordinary House-keepers were put to
40. pound charge but to remove from
the Fire, and some few of the more

at neer 400. pound,) or accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
that under pretence of it
they might colour and act their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

paying out all on <hi>Saturdays</hi> their pay

themselves were certainly put to great
straits, being either forced to give one
part to carry away the rest, or to
leave all to the fire; the mercies of

opportunity to mis-carriage of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands

I may say was one of the wonders of
the world, if Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth
were a competent judge, who desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not with <hi>Moses</hi> to see Gods glory,
but to see with Satan the World and
the glory of it, summed together in
the riches of <hi>London,</hi> and the rarities
at <hi>Westminster;</hi> this riches in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and the subsistance of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
thereof, was as well devoured
by the Suburbian thieves, and by the
Countreys extortion for their Carts
and conveniencies, as by the Fire; all
which had their respective share in
laying load upon <hi>Londons</hi> broken
back, and upon the general distraction
of, and in it.</p>
            <p>Which I note, not to lay an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
upon all assistants, either as
Labourers or as Carts; for some, and
many I hope, and know by relation, to
have been very honest and reasonable,
but into those honest and happy hands
God knows many of my goods fell not,
nor the goods of thousands more, but
into the hands of those Harpyes that
devoured all they took, and cryed
Give give, never to return again;



<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51852:17"/>
whereupon the argument must stand
good, that the riches of <hi>London</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only the posessors during the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of Laws and the ability of the
Magistrate to circumspect every part
of his charge, all disability of thine so
to do, and so this distraction of the
Fire must demolish the wall of sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and draw a line of level to
whatever industry and villany during
that rage will prey upon. For as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

is judged by men unconscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

may endevour, return and
threaten detension of goods so unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gotten, and some out of honesty,
and othes out of fear may return some
parts, and others out of envy to those
that have more than they may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
things that by these means may
come to the owners hands; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all these, there will not
be thetenth of the goods restored that
were carried away purely in theft; so
great and effectual a temptation is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
to need where it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned



<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51852:18"/>
by conscience, nay in this
harrass of Fire, and that so generally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorptive
of the City, then there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
towards authorizing a scruple of
conscience, and absolving persons
from the guilt of theft; In that what
they took being in a kind of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck,
wherein no body owned
goods, and they deserted and left to
the Fire, must have been consumed;
better they were taken away by any
to whom they would do good, then
consumed by the Fire which does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but hurt. And if they will now
part with their dubious titles upon
reasonable terms, they that took away
goods in a sort wrongfully, will prove
themselves preservers not raptors,
which I in a great measure distrusting,
do conclude that though the Fire in
<hi>London</hi> might not come, yet it might
be negatively continued from those
needy numbers who fish in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
waters, being like the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

of the Fire in <hi>Antioch</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
the four square Market-place,
the publick place where all Writings
and Registers were kept, as also the
Kings Houses; which Fire so increased
that it threatned firing the whole
City; <hi>Antiochus</hi> accused the Jews to
be the incendiaries, and all the Jews
were like to be slain upon the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and bruit of it;<note place="margin">Book 7. c. 25. <hi>de bello Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.</hi>
               </note> but <hi>Collega</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing
the people, and further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring

thinking that when they had

could not be required at their hands.

all the day, but some part of the

of <hi>London</hi> (as they deridingly, and
perhaps sinfully call them) are plagued
and punished by Fire; I say not to
dance after these mistaken Pipes
whose notes are besides Gods Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth.
All that I see or dare believe
inscribed by God upon the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, that the sin of the Nation,
punished by War and Plague last year,
and yet unrepented of, is further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by God, thorough the sides
and heart of the chief Corporation
and Master-City of this Island,<note place="margin">Eze. 15. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
whose burning is the Herald of
God to the Nation, calling it to view
its remaining doom upon its persisted
impenitence; For as they were
not the greatest sinners on whom the
Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, so were they
the greatest sinners in <hi>England</hi> on



<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51852:24"/>
whom the Fire of <hi>London</hi> fell, and
whose Fortunes and habitations it has
levelled; but except we punished,
and others yet priviledged therefrom,
repent, we shall all, and altogether
perish.</p>
            <p>The next remarkable circumstance
in this Fire, was that of <hi>Place</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it first began, which was <hi>Pudding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi>
a place so called, but from some
eminent seller or sellers of Puddings
living of old there, it being usual to
take denomination of Lanes and
Streets, not only from mens names,
chief owners of, and dwellers in them,
but from some other accidents from
whence they are denominated; thus
as the Lord <hi>Baynard,</hi> Lord of <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi>
Castle, gave name to Castle
<hi>Baynards</hi> Ward, and Sir <hi>Iohn Basing</hi>
to <hi>Basing-hall</hi> Ward; so streets have
been called according to several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
as <hi>Lothbury,</hi> because Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Brasiers living therein, made
every one Loth the Street for the
noise; <hi>Bread-street, Milk-street, Wood-street,
Candlewick-street,</hi> and infinite
others were called from the <hi>Bakers,



<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51852:25"/>
Milk-women, Wood-buildings,</hi> and
<hi>Chandlers</hi> that in quantity dwelt there,
which is evident in the Survey of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Stowes</hi> Survey.</note>
so is this <hi>Pudding-lane</hi> called;
For that Lane bordering upon <hi>Thames-street</hi>
and <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> where people
of labour and poor condition ply, and
are early in the morning, and late at
night, when the Tyde serves to bring
up Fishermen, Passengers, and other
Boats and Portages; the vicinity of
such a good house as they call them,
wherein Pudding, the general belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
dish of English men was sold, might
reasonably bring the place in request,
and thence give denomination to the
corner wherein the seller lived.</p>
            <p>This little pittyful Lane, crowded
in behind little <hi>East-cheap</hi> on the
West, St. <hi>Buttolphs-lane</hi> on the East,
and <hi>Thames-street</hi> on the South of it,
was the place where the Fire origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
and that forwarded by a Bakers
stack of wood in the house, and by all
the neighbouring houses, which were
as so many matches to kindle and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it on to its havock; thus the Fire
meeting with the Star Inn on <hi>Fish-street-hill</hi>



               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:51852:25"/>
on the back of it, and that Inn
full of Hay, and other combustibles,
and with the houses opposite to it, and
closed with it at the top, burned three
ways at once, into <hi>Thames-street,</hi> (the
lodge of all combustibles, Oyl, Hemp,
Flax, Pitch, Tar, Cordage, Hops,
Wines, Brandies, and other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
favourable to Fire; all heavy
goods being ware-housed there neer
the water side, and all the wharfs for
Coale, Timber, Wood, &amp;c. being in
a line consumed by it) unto <hi>Fish-street-hill,</hi>
till it met the other Fire at the
Bridge, to the Interval of Building,
and to <hi>Butolphs-lane</hi> into <hi>Mark-lane</hi>
in <hi>Tower-street;</hi> and in all this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
progress met with no opposition
from Engines or other Artifices; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was impossible in such a
strait, and in such a rage of Fire, they
should be serviceable; for if all the
Engineers of mischief would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
the irremedyable Burning of
<hi>London,</hi> they could not have laid
the Scene of their fatal contrivance
more desperately, to a probable success
than there where it was, where nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

in the very heart of the Trade and
Wealth of the City; these all concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in this place, put a great share
of the mischief upon the choice of the
place.</p>
            <p>And hence there may be a more
than ordinary argument, that this
choice was not a thing of accident
but contrivance, and meditation for
some time, If it were by the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality
of Man only permitted by
God, for so was the Plot by <hi>Mendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>

be framed and disposed, not only the
whole Fabrick sinks and proves effete,
but the actors in it, and the well wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers

<hi>Deliberandum est diu quod constituen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum

and probable it is that the many
forraign minded and addicted subtilists
amongst us, adjuuated by the needy
miscreants and desperadoes at home,
might do much to the production of
this Centaure, which so speedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

            <p>And if God, who knows all things,



<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51852:27"/>
and whose infinite wisdom is past
finding out, or hiding from, stirred
up evil men to act his counsell to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

take off our thoughts from evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,

<hi>Gods thoughts are upon us for evil,
and not for good,</hi> and we have just
ground to bemoane our ways and

God; for the punishment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he sends such sweeping and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checqued
judgements, such as a Fire
is, which has no ears to hear the cryes
of the sick, weak, aged, lame, who
are in danger to perish, by not being
able to remove themselves from it,
nor happy in being tendred by others
who will in that disorder pity them;
nor eyes to see the cryes and moans
of those Widdows, Orphans, and
spoyled Creatures, whose tears are
Orators potent enough to prevail
with any thing but its inexorability,
<hi>When God gives the inhabitations of



<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51852:27"/>
London for Fuel to the Fire, when he
sets his face against them, that they shall
go out from one fire, and another fire
shall devour them then this had,</hi> 'tis sad.
And this was the case of <hi>London,</hi> the
fire removed from in one place follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, yea, sundry there were
that removed two or three times, yet
lost at last, and that not only by evil
instruments who forfeited their trust
and took advantage of the confusion
incumbent on all men, but by the very
Fire which broke in, like waves of
the Sea, and raged like a Beare,
robbed of her Whelps, untill it
had executed its errand, and made
that predicable of <hi>London</hi> which
<hi>Florus</hi> writes of <hi>Samnium,</hi> so destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Papyrius</hi> the Roman Consul,
<hi>Vt hodie Samnium in ipso Samnio requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur.</hi>
So that though the advantage
of place was much in this as in other
cases, <hi>ubi plus valet locus quam virtus,</hi>
and though there might have been
rational and probable anticipations of
these conflagrating progresses, yet
were they altogether hid from the
eyes of those whose interest in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

and fortune it would have been
to have improved them.</p>
            <p>The third circumstance of furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the Fire was that of the <hi>wind,</hi>
which was not only not still but boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous,
and such as carried it to, not
from the City, and turned to fan and
blow up the Fire East, West, South,

God threatned upon <hi>Elam, 49 Ier. 36.

of which the Fires natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

of circumstances inductive to

judgement, but to be sent as an
evidence of God incensed, and of sin
the meritorious cause of <hi>it out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
sinful.</hi> For if the punishment of
one single element be dreadful, as the
water was to the old world, and the
Air is in pestilential infections, and
the Earth was when it opened its
mouth to swallow up <hi>Corah</hi> and his
company, how dreadfully sinful are
those provocations of a land or person
That God punishes with double and
treble judgements in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
what vengeance is that like
to prove, which has Gods Armies of
fire and wind united, when his single
army of Insects are enough to destroy
<hi>Aegypt?</hi> and when his negative ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility
is productive of Famine to
consume his enemies? Whom, because
they would not serve in the abundance
of all things, he will press to serve
their enemies, and be ruined by his
bringing upon them the want of all
things? And if <hi>Ionas</hi> his storm at Sea



<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51852:29"/>
was so dreadful, that he swallowed
up in it, is said <hi>to call to God out of the
belly of Hell, 2 Ionah</hi> 2. What a Hell of
confusion and torment were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>London</hi> delivered from
when their lives were in the rage of
Fire and Wind, and when the Fire
carried the noyse of a whirle-wind in
it, and was so informed with terrour,
that it surprised the eyes and hearts of
men with fear, as well as their houses
and goods with flame? So that this
wind from the Lord was not a wind
like that of <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 31. which
brought the <hi>Israelites</hi> quayles, a wind
of benignity, nor such a wind as God
made to pass over the earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the waters into their Trench
after they had inundated the earth, and
absorped all the gayity of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.
1. but a wind it was that carried
away and rent asunder, by leading
on the Fire upon its prey, a wind it
was that was commissionated to joyn
with the Fire to devour above 2 third
parts in the midst of the City, as the
phrase is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 2. And this is that
which in the concurrence of two such



<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51852:29"/>
potent circumstances renders it more
than ordinary as well in the intention
of the chief cause as in the operation
of the mediate ones. For had God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathized
and severed their conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
they had not done that compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
mischief they did, but in that
they corresponded each with other,
and both performed a savage charge
upon <hi>London,</hi> routing her Beauty,
Riches, and being in a great degree, it
is not to be doubted but as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
enemies rage is glutted with
the booty of his option and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(those that prophesied of its
firing before it happen'd, being proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the principal contrivers and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of the firing of it, &amp; those that
blew the coals, heated the iron, and
made all things ready to further it) so
the Lords anger in permitting such a
success was great, and the humiliation,
for it ought to be serious and sacred;
for if God made the wind winged, I
allude to that passage in <hi>Zach. c. 5. v.</hi> 9.
to proportion the fire to its breadth as
well as boisture of fury, if this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
like that of the <hi>Caldaean</hi> God



<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51852:30"/>
speaks of in 1 <hi>Hab.</hi> 16. must march
through the breadth of the City, if
the flying rowl of Cursing had its
length and its breadth, as the Prophet
<hi>Zachary</hi> has it, 5 <hi>ch. v.</hi> 1. then this fire
and wind in its length and breadth of
procedure and subversion, being a
great judgment, calls for length and
breadth of humiliation before God
for it, yea not to be sutably affected
for the provokings of sin, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
punished once for all; incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibility
is next door to final impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
the merit of utter subversion.</p>
            <p>And truly, when to all this it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
that the Fire burned at some
time contrary to the wind, and as it
were in opposition of it, and then did
as much spoil unto whatsoever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
&amp; was as unchecquable then
as when it had the winds raising and
chasing it, then surely there must be
great ground to conclude that this
wind as well as this Fire come from
the Lords anger, and that whatsoever
in it was besides the usual import of
Fire in a place of so great help and
experience to obviate and Master it,



<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51852:30"/>
was by the precise appointment and
commission of God, who does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Authorize the Sword to do executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the world, but imploys Air,
Wind, Fire, Water as well as other
Creatures to be his Baliffs to Arrest, if
not his Devils to ruine them. And if
further it be ruminated, that Gods
proceeding by pauses, (which though
not very deliberate, compared with
fatal protracted ones, yet mild weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the method of Gods firing
and consuming all in a moment as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
was, seems to insinuate that
God in this might expect a man or
men holy before and accepted with
him to stand in the gap, and propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
(as it were) for the City, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Fire might have been forced
back and carryed off) the non appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of such, whose spirits God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with holy Charity to Gods cause
and their Nations weal, shrewdly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates
a suspicion that God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
or suspending the impediments
might conclude the formidable issue,
that it had, when God not only
hides himself from his people that



<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51852:31"/>
pray, but calls off his peoples devotion
from prayer for pardon, that so his
wrath may take its full course, and
burn so that none can quench it. In
such a case Gods expectation being
defeated, it is time to sit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Judgments with confession of our
doing wickedly, and justification of
Gods righteousness in whatever he has
done.</p>
            <p>The fourth circumstances of aid to
the Fire was the drought of the season
and the want of water, which had not
only prepared the combustible matter
for a speedier reception of igneous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
and Contacts, but prevented ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of remora's and extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to both wind and fire; For as
showers usually lay winds, so winds
abated, usually mitigate fires. Here
then was another instance of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this fire, that God suffered it
to carry all before it, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded
by nothing specifiquely its
check, whereby is argued in a good
measure Gods allowance of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
and his conduct of this his artillery
of havock, and besom of severity;



<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51852:31"/>
God having created all things in
proportion to the whole of his design,
and placed in nature ballances and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsives
as well as insolencies and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilences
of assaults on harmony, when
these repulsives shall be exinfluenced,
and their vigour not only be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but their contraries prevail and be
effectual, then is doom inevitable, and
the consequence as fatal as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of it, unsearchable. And this was
Poor <hi>London's</hi> case, God had given us
a long brightness of weather, and
made every thing so dry, that it was
of it self, by the length and efficacy
of that exhaustion, <hi>in potentia proximâ</hi>
to fire, and the Springs were so low,
and the Engines of raising water so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
that there was no suitable
appease to it, applicable, whence it
came to pass, that as a Buck that is not
able to run must yield and die, and a
Vessel that cannot bear steerage and
sails, must be surprized and taken, by
wanting the conveniencies to flight,
and a Souldier that has lost his sword
and shield must submit to his Enemies
quarter, how manly soever his courage



<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51852:32"/>
be, so in the defect of those obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to fire, it unavoidably must
follow that whatever the fire can do
it may and will do, for all natural
stays being absent, the battel is gained
without stroake, and the possession got
without so much as challenge.</p>
            <p>For as in ways of mercy God makes
every thing ancillary hereunto, as he
suspended the fires consuming in the
case of the three Children, and in the
bush which burned but consumed not,
and as he does in invigorating dry
bones, and in making the weak things
of his justitution to confront and evict
the mighty oppositions of flesh and
bloud, as he bears down the daring
Monarchs of humane Learning, and
precipitates the fiery Sciolists of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
by the piety, zeal and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of illiterate men Apostoliz'd and
made by him unopposable, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his little and low Ordinances as
the world esteems them, <hi>the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of preaching,</hi> and the faith of a
Crucified and derided Saviour, para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to all more subtil projects of
captivation, because conducted and



<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51852:32"/>
blessed by him who is all power, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and duration, and therefore can
be neither abbreviated or defeated in
his volitions and resolves. (All things
working together for the good of his
Elect, and his counsel ever standing
like Mount <hi>Sion</hi> which can never be
removed.) As I say in his paths of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and obligement to man he predis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and forecalls severalties to their
Randezvous, and draws forth such
services from them, as conduces to his
own honour and his holy servants se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and comfort by them, so in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to judgements does he ripen and
forward them by such assistances and
proper adjuncts, that the beauty of
penal providence is maintainable from
them in spight of all artifices of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
to Eclipse or cashire it; <hi>Thus
when he will destroy a sinner, he hardneth
his heart against his fear;</hi> and when he
will give Victory to his Armies, he
causes a noise of horsemen and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
and drives them away in fear
when none pursues them, yea he will
and does prove a Terrour to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
even in the pleasure of it, as



<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51852:33"/>
he did in the hand-writing upon the
wall to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What alas signifies <hi>Haman</hi>'s rage,
if God deny him favour with <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus</hi>
as wontedly, and bring in
<hi>Ester</hi> his Enemy to his supersedal?
What avails <hi>Sampson</hi>'s strength, if
God give a key to the secret of it,
which resides in its unshavenness?
To what purpose is <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
if God turn it into foolishness
and conntermand the aids and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operations
with it, we put all our
endeavours and attainments in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

of them, if he speaks no <hi>fiat,</hi> folly is
the best prognate of our contrivances;
so necessary is Gods allowance and
aid, that without it all is abortive
and amort.</p>
            <p>As then when God is in mercy or
judgment present, all things are as
they are properest to be, so in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
on either side, there can be no
thorow effect of either, for all things
observe him, and as when he says
Goe they Goe, so when he says re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede

the world what <hi>He</hi> is; and when He
has famine, pestilence, sword, or any

salubrity of air, and causes the

and will not render its amability

            <p>And if the <hi>drought</hi> and scantness of

where he says of the Caldaeans, <hi>a drought
is upon her waters, and they shall be

and God is said to call for a drought
on the Land upon all things man and

then to want water when

no rain of a long time before the
fire, and both the Springs low; and
the Water-works at the Bridge-foot
which carryed water into that part of
the City burnt down the first day of
the fire.) Thus, thus for it to be was no
small judgment, for as it is a mercy to
have God a ready help when trouble
is near, so is it a judgment to have his
creatures denyed when there is most
use for them, when their presence is

by evil instruments, and remands them
not into their restraint, but suffers them
of servants to become Masters and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments

unconcernedness of God, when his
great arrows are thus shot forth of his

hearts of mens delights and recumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
so that they see all that was dear

to shew that where God shews

            <p>The fifth circumstance of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, was that of the choice of place

upon, the Heart of the City, both

all up to <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> to <hi>Aldersgate,</hi> all

Thus from the East to the West it
prostrated Houses, Halls, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
Churches, Monuments; all which
it so flaked and enervated, that it has
left few standing walls, stout enough
to bear a roof, without new raising
or charge of repair equivalent to new
building; which argues the Fire more
than ordinarily in earnest, when it was
not only not impartial, but not copa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

God turns mens pleasure into fears,

how we of this City can discharge our

<hi>Quos perdere vult Iupiter dementat,</hi>
or in that <hi>Quae fata manent non facile

for every fatality, <hi>or unlesse the day

to such I shall make no reply that will

hope I may with modesty and truth say,
that whatever <hi>Londons</hi> guilt before God
hath been, and its receiving from the Lords
hand by this fire is, God is just, and it hath
reaped but the fruits of its own sinful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as to God <hi>Londons</hi> destruction is of it

places privileged from her Calamity were,
and when ever the temper of her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

no more Criminal than the rest of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whose Emissaries and Suffragans either
called up those disorders in her, or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

before God or man for that, which a
more governable place (then the continued

more than they will appeal from them to
the power they have gotten over them, and

them. And though the least instance of <hi>Lond.</hi>

this, which he has not now, in many

was a Native of <hi>London,</hi> the Son of

his non-avocation by Provision for

all amassed together, did portray
him probable enough to expect such

when the Eminency of this Charity

they, poor Souls, being outed of their

is, that many men of great Estates,

there seemed to be reason to apply
them: The Preamble of 1 Jac. 15. has
these words; <hi>For that Fraud and Deceit

Debt, when there is ability in the

time of its discharge is come; or to
let it come, when it comes, with defal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Fees and allowances of

to the Creditor receiving, than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit

and diminution to his expence, then
upon this latitude of Credit, given and
taken, falls out to either.</p>
            <p>Let then (Sir) the Man of Estate that
is deep in the undone Tradesmans
Book, and who heretofore, thought it
but a thing of course to make him stay
long, and dance many fruitless atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies,
and to inforce him to hedg in
his first Debt, by addition of money
lent, and acceptation of security for
both: Now consider the Citizens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
thus to do, and the merciless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness



<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51852:85"/>
of thus delaying him, and comply
with this accident of stress which God
has, without his possibilitie of presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or prevention, brought upon him
and he will oblige him by a Mercy
and Justice propitious to this his exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and declare himself truly <hi>Great;</hi>
For Titles and Words are but Wind,
but real actions of Virtue are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
determinations of Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
the life-draught of which was
Heroically expressed in that Contest
between the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Mountjoy, Temps. Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eliz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom there being quarrels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
rivalry of Favour, <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
hautess being revived in them,
the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> daring to accept,
as readily as the E. of <hi>Essex</hi> was ready
to give him the Challenge, met the E.
of <hi>Essex</hi> in the Field, the after Stage of
their Combate; the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi>
being the Defendant, told the Earl of
<hi>Essex,</hi> That he fought him with some
disparity, because that if he killed the
Earl, his life was sure to go for it; but
if you my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> kill me, your
Interest is so great at the Court, and



<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51852:85"/>
in the Favour of her Majesty so much
to you, that you will easily obtain her
pardon; therefore, my Lord, before
we fight, let me beg the favour of you,
that you give it under your hand, that
you challenged me, and do pardon
me: The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> said, That I will,
but how shall we do to have a Pen and
Inkhorn: My Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> replyed,
I have one: Oh but quoth the Earl of
<hi>Essex,</hi> would you have me quit my
Sword in the Field, and my Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which I stand: Yes, my Lord,
(quoth my Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi>) and you
shall write it upon my back; I know
your Lordship to be a Person of so
great Gallantry, that there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to me, that can dishonourably
come from you: So the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
wrote it upon his back, after which
they generously fought, to shew their
respective Valours.</p>
            <p>This I introduce to shew that true
Nobility and Generosity, abhors to
take an advantage poorly and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly
against any man: Whereupon
I am hopeful this disablement of the
Citizens of <hi>London</hi> by Gods act, who



<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51852:86"/>
is Soveraign over all, to whose plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our Souls and Bodies, with all the
present and future attendants on them
are Vassals; I trust, I say and hope, it will
produce a speedier and more effectual
payment of their due Debts from those
that owe them, then otherwise they
would have got them in from them.</p>
            <p>And Sir, I am further hopeful, that
those Creditors to the City that are
undammaged, or so only detracted
from by this accident, that they are
but shaven by it, not shorn, that is,
abated in the excrements and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of their Estates, not in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and totality of it; that these
would be as patient and tender as
they Christianly can to them that
are clean undone; as many, God
knows, are, whose savings from the
destruction will not keep the life
and soul of themselves and their
charges together: They whom this
accident hath made unable to live,
and yet whom Providence rescues
not from their misery by death:
Those whose children they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are disabled to bring up,



<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51852:86"/>
and by the disablement of others
(the calamity being so Epidemical)
are not to be supplied with breeding
from others: Those who turned out
of their callings, and unstocked by
the loss of that ruffle, are neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to set up, or fitted to other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
if they could be found,
proportionable to their age and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
Those that are thus already
Prisoners to want, pensive thoughts
and terrours of despair, are to be
commended with all sympathy to
their Creditors Mercie and Kindness:
That they would forbear reproaches
to them, and arrests of them, or suits
against them; for prisons get no
debts, nor doth poverty pay any;
nor can they hope to be forgiven of
God their great debt, who forgive
not their Brother, thus distressed, his
small one to them: And remember
what <hi>Tilly,</hi> I have heard, said to <hi>Morgan,</hi>
when the one marched into <hi>Stoade,</hi>
and the other marched out, <hi>Hodie
tu, Cras ego, I might have been in
your case, the fortunes of Warr are
dubious; you must now leave that place



<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51852:87"/>
which you have kept as a man, and I
now enter on that which I have bought
with many a man, and with much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
therefore, Sir, let us be friends in
the conclusion, who have been enemies
in the premisses:</hi> Let this, I say, be
practised in the little debates of mine
and thine referrable to Trading, thus
clogg'd and impeded, and there
may be hopes that <hi>London</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive,
and its Citizens have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to imploy their industrie in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviencie
to Gods blessing, and in time
to make convenient restitution. And
those Rents and Fortunes of Lords,
Knights, Gentlemen, and other Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors,
which now are incontributive to
the publique Charge, as well as unay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
to their own expences, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
provision for, will in time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards their wonted service;
And the Magistracy of <hi>London</hi> be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by men of Fortune and fitness,
whose Issues may, as heretofore, be
provided richly for in all Counties of
the Nation; and Charitie to the Poor
and to Learning, may by them be
propagated, whose Predecessors in



<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51852:87"/>
dwelling and course of life, have, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with men Ecclesiastical, been
more publique and generous that
way, then all the Nation besides.
Which I mention, not to raise the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of any, but to move com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to the present cloud upon Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and to alledge what may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their present ease, in order to
their future publique usefulness and
benefaction. Thrifty Oaks, though
fleeced of under boughs, yet if not
headed, may thrive and grow stately
timber Trees; but if once headed,
prove after but Pollards, short and
rough Timber, fit only for small and
course uses. So is it with men under
accidental Mischances; if they be
fiercely proceeded against, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
they are probable only to live
in misery, and to die in poverty: but
if they be favoured, till their industry
fortunated by God has made head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
its misfortune, and evicted its
cloud, they prove rich and valuable,
according to the belief, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereof, my humble prayer for
them stands or falls.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:51852:88"/>
It were also (Noble Sir) worthy the
consideration of the Nations wisdom
and goodness, to provide some Law
of defence against the rigours of
Landlords, and the refractoriness of
Tenants, by which the Partie detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by this act of God, might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
the additional misery of a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious
contest. Let (Sir) mercy be
shewed to the Looser, but not pretence
of loss, pass for loss of disablements,
where it has really devoured nothing
but valuless Lumber: Neither let the
condition of Books, Papers, Writings,
and Records burnt or lost, be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by some Good and Grave
Salvo, pleadable for the Loosers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnitie,
least many long since dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
Debts be revived, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
afresh; and least men be by
loss of Evidences evicted their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
or at least vexed with Suits
concerning them; nothing being
more sure, then that many men out
of Town, and in distraction in Town,
either forgot to secure many Books
and Papers of weight and value; or
else committed them to they knew



<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51852:88"/>
not whom, and shall receive them
from them they know not when; nay
it may so fall out, that many Writings
may by chance come into those hands
from whence they moved, and cease
to be securities to those to whom they
are passed; and what mischiefs may
hereupon ensue (if some Law of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and bar be not interjected) is
easie to presage. It were (Sir) also
most sutable to the paternity of your
House, to provide somwhat about the
Registers of Churches, which are now
in such dispersion, if they survive the
Fire, that they would be commanded
into some Office, there to be till the
Parishes to which they belong be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built:
For since Certificate of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
Legitimation of Children, proof
of Ages, light in point of Pedegree,
depend thereupon, the same will be
the reason of their preservation now,
that was of their Institution at first,
and many poor Infants will be, when
grown Men and Women, at a loss ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediable,
if some caution against,
possible, and probable evils of such
nature, be not passed into a Law.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:51852:89"/>
And Sir, to all these add not the least
important act of your Piety and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the furtherance of a Law, for
making the Second of <hi>September</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
a Solemn Fast for the National
sins that merited this Judgment of God
upon its <hi>London:</hi> And the Sixth of
<hi>September</hi> a day of Thanksgiving for
ever, for Gods merciful stay of the Fire
that it proceeded no further, to enter
into the Suburbs, and to destroy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as it had done in <hi>London:</hi> That
the Pallaces of our Soveraign and his
Peers, and the Cathedral and City of
<hi>Westminster</hi> went free, that they should
be spared when <hi>London</hi> and St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
felt the furie of merciless Flames,
ought to be had in yearly and hourly
remembrance. Nor can any better
and more religious occasions of both
duties be given us by God, than these
prementioned exchanges of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
the Staff of which as well
comforts us, as the Rod of it afflicted
us; for since he shewed himself to be
<hi>ex utroque Caesar,</hi> it befits us to shew
our selves Christians to both his exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
of Power and Mercy.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:51852:89"/>
These things (Sir) I have in haste
prepared in present to you, that it
may appear to the Nation, That there
is one (amongst the many others that
are well affected to <hi>London</hi>) that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it his duty to appear for her, not
ashamed of her dislustre, and that now
he can pay her no other duty, then
that of his tears over her, and prayers
for her, allowes her those, and over
and above those, pleads her Cause
with God and the Nation, not justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Innocency, or lessening her
guilt, not excusing her Provocation,
or drawing a vayle over her Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
No, God forbid I should thus
become the Pharisee for her, who
ought to put her Mouth in the Dust,
and by her silence before her corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
God, testifie her consent to the
Justice and adequateness of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon her: On this account I

which now seems arid, and sapless, may
kindle in the womb of Providence,
and take root downward, and bring

in repentance, for past Provocations,
