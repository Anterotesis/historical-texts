            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE HAPPY
<hi>Future State of England:</hi>
OR,
A DISCOURSE by way of LETTER to
the late EARL of <hi>ANGLESEY,</hi> Vindicating Him
from the Reflections of an <hi>AFFIDAVIT</hi> Published by the
HOUSE of COMMONS, <hi>Ao</hi>. 1680. by occasion whereof Observations
are made concerning Infamous WITNESSES.</p>
            <p>The said Discourse likewise contains various Political Remarks
and CALCULATIONS referring to many Parts of Christendom;
with Observations of the <hi>Number of the People</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi>
and of its Growth in Populousness and <hi>Trade.</hi> The Vanity of
the late <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> being shewn, the Author doth on
<hi>Grounds of Nature</hi> Predict the Happy future State of the <hi>Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the End of the Discourse,
There is a Casuistical Discussion of the Obligation of the KING,
His Heirs and Successors, wherein many of the Moral Offices of Absolute
and <hi>Vnconditional Loyalty</hi> are Asserted.</p>
            <p>Before the Discourse, is
A large PREFACE, giving an Account of the whole WORK,
with an <hi>Index</hi> of the Principal Matters.</p>
            <p>ALSO,
The Obligation resulting from the Oath of SUPREMACY
to Assist and Defend the Preheminence or Prerogative
OF THE
Dispensative Power
Belonging to the KING, His Heirs and Successors.</p>
            <p>In the Asserting of that Power, various Historical Passages occurring in the <hi>Vsurpation</hi>
after the Year 1641. are mentioned, and an Account is given of the Progress of the <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Dispensing,</hi> as to Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> about <hi>Religion</hi> since the Reformation, and of diverse Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> declaring their Approbation of the Exercise of such Power, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in what concerns Punishment by Disability or Incapacity.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR one who is sensible how little he knows of things past or
present, to Dedicate a <hi>Discourse</hi> of the <hi>future State</hi> of his
Country to your Lordship, who are by the Age allow'd to be
as Critical a Iudge of Men and Things as any it affords, may
seem to have in it somewhat of Presumption. But when
your Lordship shall have had leisure to consider the plain
Grounds of Nature, on which my Prediction in the following
Papers hath gone, I will not so much hope that what I have attempted may
appear to have been no Presuming, as I will expect that your Censure will
cast the Presumption on the other side, namely, on such who were Predictors
with a <hi>continuando,</hi> of the <hi>Unhappy State</hi> of their Country; and especially
on the account of the Religion of our most Gracious Prince. And were I now
to have my Iudgment tryed only by that of the <hi>Mobile,</hi> who measure all things
by the Events, I account I should be out of the Gunshot of Censure, since the
course of Providence after my writing of the following Work having Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
His Majesty to fill the Throne of his Ancestors with so many Royal
Virtues, it has been Conspicuous to them that the Glories of his Reign
have transcended the highest flights of my mentioned Expectation.</p>
            <p>And indeed, as I remember to have long ago heard one of the Fathers cited
for a Passage to this purpose, namely, that on a Supposal that God recounting to
him the Perfections of the Creation, should ask him what he could name want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that he could wish, he would answer, <hi>Unum Laudatorem, Domine,</hi>
so it might till of late be said that in this new Creation or Restoration of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
under His Majesty's Reign, the only thing we had with anxiety to wish
and desire from God next to the ennabling us to Praise his divine Goodness,
was one whose Talent of noble thoughts and words might be adequate to the
celebrating the many Talents of our Prince, and their successful Improvement
both for the Honour and Security, and Ease of his People.</p>
            <p>But neither is such one <hi>Praiser</hi> now wanting; for he who shall read the
many late Loyal <hi>Addresses</hi> from all Parts of the Kingdom, will find the <hi>People</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> to be the <hi>Unus Laudator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:3"/>
My Lord, as I in the following Discourse almost wholly Printed long ago in
the last Reign during the freedom of the Press, adventured on Grounds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to predict such a <hi>growth</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as would make all England <hi>become
one sober Party of Mankind,</hi> and that the more ingenious sort of Iesuits
would by natural Instinct throw off those Principles condemned in this Pope's
Decree; and with Iustice then acknowledged a <hi>Sober Party</hi> in that order, and
have at large in <hi>p.</hi> 322. particularly shew'd my Abhorrence of charging the
belief or practice of those Principles on all Persons in that Order: So I have
likewise in <hi>p.</hi> 238. given my Iudgment that all Seditious Principles own'd
by any who call'd themselves Protestants must naturally decay, and have at
large in my <hi>Preface<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> opposed my measures of <hi>futurity</hi> to those of a late <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> concerning the <hi>two Plots,</hi> that he thought the
<hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Dissenters</hi> would be ever carrying on, and without his Lordships
excepting the Loyal in those religionary Parties.</p>
            <p>But having said this, I must likewise say that these happy <hi>births</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi>
having been but (as it were) the <hi>Births</hi> of a <hi>Day</hi> under the Powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of His Majesty's Government, or (as I may say) a <hi>Nation</hi>'s being thus
<hi>born</hi> in a <hi>Day,</hi> are beyond what I did expect: and I did little think that
with the suddenness of the motion of Lightning when it melts the Sword and
spares the Scabbard, His Majesty's <hi>Declaration</hi> of Indulgence to Dissenters,
would at the same time melt so many hearts, and all hostile Principles of the
Doctrine of Resistance wrapp'd therein, as it spared the Persons of the deluded
Opiners. I account that any indifferent Observer of the extraordinary <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>painting</hi> their Loyalty in their <hi>Addresses</hi> (and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth

Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> after the way of the <hi>bolder touches</hi> of <hi>Titian</hi>
in their former <hi>Addresses,</hi> with the <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>LIVES AND FORTUNES</hi> was

of Compassion toward such his Brethren; and into a noble sense of a great and
good Prince, having made his Subjects of all Religionary Perswasions <hi>Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
for <hi>Joy,</hi> and turned all their hearts to invoke Heaven in wishing for him
according to that <hi>old Style, a long Life, a secure Kingdom, a safe House,
valiant Armies, a faithful Senate, loyal Subjects, the world at Peace, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The comparatively narrow <hi>Idea's</hi> of Charity and Beneficence that Subjects
Minds are capable of toward one another do incline them to think chiefly of
<hi>particular</hi> Toleration, and such as we call <hi>Dispensation,</hi> and that too with the
nicety of Caution, and upon Persons making the notification of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and their particular disclaiming of all Disloyal ones, previous to their
Toleration; and beyond this pitch the flights of my poor thoughts have not
gone in the following Work. But His Majesty having his Great thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
on restoring <hi>England</hi> to its ancient Figure in the World, namely of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
it, and coming to the Throne when he found the Land so impoverish'd

               <hi>Genius</hi> found out so expedite a way to make the Confidence between the Prince
and People mutual (and which is the hinge on which the Happy State of any
Country turns) as hath made any general Relapses into Principles of disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
during his Reign, almost morally impossible. For according to that Saying
of <hi>Tully, Perditissimi est hominis eum laedere qui laesus non esset, nisi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be partly expressed in the words of the Prophet, viz. <hi>The heart of the
Father's being turned to the Children,</hi> and the natural Consequence of the
<hi>turning the heart of the Children to their Father;</hi> a more noble work then
for an <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>come</hi> and solve Doubts.</p>
            <p>And thus while the Principles of some narrow-hearted Divines might
seem confined, like the Sands in their Hour-glasses, yet His Majesty's
great Thoughts and <hi>largeness of heart</hi> given him by God, being (as was said
of <hi>Solomon's</hi>) like <hi>the Sands of the Sea shoar,</hi> and he having without setting
up <hi>Weigh-houses</hi> for Loyalty or Religionary Principles, created universal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Peace in the Nation, and allow'd his Subjects a <hi>paulò majora ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namus</hi>
then verbal Recantations, he by thus trusting his Subjects at once with
their Consciences, hath provided an otherguess Prospect for English Minds,
then what can rise from <hi>disputacity,</hi> or the <hi>Ecclesiarum Scabies,</hi> and
hath likewise secured the transmitting of his Character into the English Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
with such Rays of Glory as are brighter then those that have there
adorn'd our former Princes, under whom the <hi>Roses,</hi> and <hi>Scepters</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>
were <hi>united,</hi> through his having so much united the hearts of People of
all Religions to himself, and to one another.</p>
            <p>My Lord, It is here but just that I should acknowledge it to your Lordship
that you have been and are <hi>Pars Magna</hi> in so highly Contributing by your
great Figure at the Helm in the last and this present Reign, to this happy
State of <hi>England.</hi> For while in that Reign so many were so intent by what
an ingenious late Writer calls <hi>The Wheel within a Wheel,</hi> i. e. the Real Plot
within the Nominal one of the Witnesses; and by Out-cries against the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> to bring in a Roman Republick, your Lordship by your most
wise Councels and indefatigable diligence in guarding the Monarchy, and
effecting that it should not be plotted away by Names or Things, will appear
in the History of the Age, as one who perhaps beyond any one now a Subject
secured the old Fundamental Government of <hi>England,</hi> and upon which only the
new future Happiness of it could subsist.</p>
            <p>I have entertain'd the Reader with a new Argument of Republicks gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
growing more impracticable: but I shall do but justice to your Lordship in
representing your very <hi>Character</hi> as an <hi>Argument</hi> of sufficient weight to
poise the minds of the ingenious and the ingenuous against innovations by
that sort of Government. For the World would soon want the benefit of the
Example of the perfect justice inherent in your nature (that glorious Virtue
that is the allow'd Continent of all the rest, and necessarily attracting the
Eyes and Hearts and Veneration of the Populace) if Heaven had not fix'd
you in the Sphere of Monarchy; a dull Mediocrity of Vertue and of Wit and
reason being only easie to a popular Government, and nothing but an <hi>Oyster-Shell</hi>
or an <hi>Olive-Leaf</hi> being to be there expected by a Person heroically just
to his Country as his recompence, and his being always liable to such <hi>liberae
accusationes &amp; Calumniationes</hi> as were under what I have call'd the
<hi>Martyrocracy</hi> here in the turbid Interval of the Plot-times, and of the Fears
and Iealousies.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship was then by the help of your great Vnderstanding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Temper, and your constant Serenity of thought, <hi>saevis tranquillus in
undis;</hi> and while so many of the timid were with their narrow spirits in
that stormy Conjuncture, toss'd about with excessive Fears and Iealousies,
and nauseous to themselves and others, your Lordships great thoughts like a
well built first Rate-Ship, allow'd you both Ease and Triumph on the Sea of
Time: and in the Night of the Popular Fears, your great Reason was dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the Loyal <hi>tanquam lucerna in navi Praetoriâ</hi> how and where to steer
their Course with safety to the Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:4"/>
While toward the End of the following Discourse, I recollected how much
and how far my belief had been with that of many Loyal embarqued in the
belief of a <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>the Plot,</hi> I there in <hi>p.</hi> 359, and 360. took notice that
<hi>the Notions that men had of a Plot were very various: Some then were
so far gone in credulity, as like the Fool that</hi> Solomon <hi>saith believeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word, they were resolv'd to believe every thing the Witnesses had said
or would say, the Loyal generally acquiesced in the Notification of it as
Publish'd by the Government;</hi> and I likewise call'd to mind what I had
during my belief of somewhat of it mention'd in those hot Times, and while.
I was writing the warmest part of my Discourse in that Conjuncture, and
when generally every heat of mens Passions was Feverish, and every Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Pestilential, and when the <hi>Vitium temporis</hi> was Concurrent with the
Faults of the Writer: and there in <hi>p.</hi> 14. observing, that <hi>since according to
the expression of God's not being the God of the Jews only, but also of
the Gentiles, so it being true that the King is King of the Papists as well as
Protestants, King of the Irish as well as English, and a Common Father to
them all, it may be worthy of his royal goodness, and a god-like thing
in him to distribute to them all the kindness that would not undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others, (i. e.</hi> that they were <hi>capable of</hi>) and having then in
<hi>p.</hi> 44. urged the <hi>possibility of Recusants being a sound part of the State here
as well as in</hi> Holland, I held my self obliged to do them and the Course of my
Impartial observing, the right as toward the end of the Discourse to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it, that <hi>whatever petulance some of them were formerly guilty of,
yet that the deportment of the generality of them hath of late appear'd
with such a Face of Loyalty, as was necessarily attractive of our Christian
Love and Compassion.</hi> And I concluded with the Observation, <hi>That it was
not for nothing, nor without some end that Divine Providence permitted so
many Protestants to erre in one great Point; and that probably it might
be to the end to produce in their Minds so great a degree of Compassion
and Charity toward the Persons of all Roman-Catholick Christians, as
may not only last in this Conjuncture, but be operative in them by all Moral
Offices of Humanity and Christianity during their Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Course of Providence having further honoured His Majesty's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by bringing to light in it the Truth about those odious Matters that
particular Roman-Catholicks were charged with, (and for which in the general
Iudgment of the Impartial they appear now to have been put to Death by false
Testimony) the <hi>cry</hi> of such <hi>Blood</hi> may well (I think) pass for a <hi>loud Call</hi>
against making the Body of the Roman-Catholicks uneasie by the Penal Laws,
and while the Reason for their Severity hath so apparently ceased.</p>
            <p>As toward the latter end of the <hi>Preface</hi> which was committed to Writing in
the latter end of the last Reign, I mention'd it as the Concordant vogue of the
Populace to throw off the belief of the only Person referr'd to as a witness in
the following Discourse, so it must be acknowledged that Time hath by its
births of Discovery, now given a just occasion for the laying aside all the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations
there against any Principles in the Canon-Law, or the Casuistical
Morals of the Iesuits, that my self and others then built on the Fate of
<hi>Godfrey:</hi> and hath a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cording to what I have predicted concerning the Fate
of the Principles of the Iesuites Condemned by this Pope, tacitly evaporating
by Fear and Shame, made them appear obsolete. And it is one of the Glories
of His Majesty's Reign, that all those Principles <hi>in terrorem,</hi> which gave
occasion formerly for the Continuance of the Laws <hi>in terrorem,</hi> do now appear
offer'd up as Sacrifices to the Iustice of it. And tho from the account I found in
<hi>The Policy of the Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> of the Fact of some of the Iesuits having
opposed the Publication of that Decree in <hi>France,</hi> as having issued from the Pope
<pb facs="tcp:103047:4"/>
in his Court of Inquisition, I took occasion to dilate on the Aggravations of their
Disobedience to the Pope, yet upon my having since enquired into the Transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Papal World, I have found Cause to absolve them from any Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that kind.</p>
            <p>And accordingly as the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> in his <hi>Pseudo-Martyr</hi> saith,
that <hi>Chrysostom</hi> expounding that place in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Domus Dei facta est spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunca
<hi>Hyaenae,</hi> applies it to <hi>the Priests of the</hi> Iews <hi>as hardest to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and saith, <hi>That the</hi> Hyaena <hi>having (as</hi> Chrysostom <hi>observes) but one
Back-bone, cannot turn except it turn all at once, so that the Romanist
Priests having but one Back-bone, the Pope, cannot turn but all at once
when he turns;</hi> it must be acknowledged that the <hi>Pope</hi> having by that his
noble <hi>Decree</hi> done so much right to his own Honour, and that of his Church
(and indeed of Humane nature) as to damn those tenets, the aversion of the
whole Order of the Iesuites from them was necessarily and naturally to
happen.</p>
            <p>And from the <hi>Doctor</hi> in that Book applying further to the Iesuites, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Christ said to those whom he sent, what I tell you in darkness, that
speak you in light, and what you hear in the Ear, that preach you in
Houses, and fear not them that kill the Body; and if no other thing were
told you in darkness, and whispered in your Ears at your missions hither
then that which our Saviour delivered to them, you might be as confident
in your publick preaching, and have as much comfort of Martyrdom, if
you died for executing such a Commission,</hi> and then reflecting on <hi>the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that were delivered them in darkness</hi> in that Conjuncture, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
those Papal Vsurpations on the Regal Rights, whereby they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from all subjection to the King; it may be here occasionally observed that
many persons of our several Religionary Perswasions having for Curiosity gone
to hear the publick Preaching of these Missionaries, have there met with such
ingenuous Explications of the Moral Offices that concern the most Vital parts of
Religion, and those so pathetically applied, as that they have looked on
such men who were formerly dead in Law, to be as it were sent from the dead
to make others better Christians and better Subjects, and to be thankful for
the Dispensative Power animating those for that purpose, and have found no
Cause to fear that they had any Politick whispers in their Missions to oppose the
Power of our Monarch more then their Brethren do that of the Great Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
one, and to whom in the <hi>litis-pendentia</hi> between him and the Pope
about the <hi>Regale,</hi> they adhered.</p>
            <p>My Lord, as to what I adventured to predict of the success of his Majesties
Political Measures, his past Prudence so eminently appearing in the <hi>Series</hi> of
his Great Actions might sufficiently encourage me without any help from Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasme;
for <hi>Nullum numen abest, si sit prudentia.</hi> And the Supposal about
his coming to the Throne in great maturity of years, a thing that the prudence
of the <hi>Romans</hi> had strict regard to in the Age of their Consuls (and for
which Office none was qualified under the Age of 43 years) and his bringing
to the Throne a vast Treasure of Knowledge and Experience refin'd and solid
by many Experiments of Providence on himself, according to the Divine
words of <hi>Seneca de provid. Deus quos amat, indurat, recognoscit, exercet,</hi>
might well raise the highest expectation of his Conduct.</p>
            <p>But yet neither was I without some regard therein to the common Course of
Divine Providence, even in this Life rewarding in any Illustrious Person a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
tenderness for Religion, and inquisitiveness in any Controverted Point
about it, and at last contrary to the most valuable secular Interest determining
his thoughts one way tho perhaps erroneously; and I will venture to conclude
that if it had imported the salvation of such an exemplary inquisitive honourer
<pb facs="tcp:103047:5"/>
of God (and who with great holy Exercise had defecated his thoughts from set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
on any local Religion, as such) to have found out the truth in that
Problematick Point, God would have honoured him so far as to have sent an
Angel to direct him to it: and will expect that such a one whose <hi>delight was in
the Law of the Lord and therein did meditate day and night,</hi> tho he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
comprehended not every thing aright in it, yet that <hi>he shall be like a
Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, that brings forth his fruit in his Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and that his Leaf shall not wither, and that whatever he doth shall
prosper:</hi> and that his <hi>ways</hi> thus, <hi>pleasing God, he will make even his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to be at peace with him,</hi> and that he <hi>who makes peace in his high
places, and who can make peace between high and low, and makes men to
be of one mind in an House,</hi> will bless him with these Effects, and make him
<hi>grow in favour with God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I shall in the next place take occasion to acquaint your Lordship that
in the Preface (and which every Candid Reader of any Book will peruse before
his reading of the Book) I do explain my self more clearly about some things and
words writt in the turbid times, and which as one saith well, are the worst times
to write in tho the best to write of: and I do not fear the wanting any mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
who shall read over the whole, and which may well be expected before the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of his <hi>Exceptions,</hi> tho it may seem as copious as one of the Bankers Bills
in Chancery. But because the former part of the Discourse necessarily requiring
those courser Colours relating to Popery to be first laid on, before the fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r ones
and the gilding on the happy Future State of our Country; and for that to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any ingenious men now with Notions of Popery were to hinder their repose in
the state I foretold, I have been at the pains of making a <hi>large INDEX,</hi> and where
I have directed the Reader how and where to enter into the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and
<hi>New Earth</hi> of his Country, without passing through the <hi>Purgatory</hi> of any expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about Popery or the Plot: and perhaps the more Loyal and Ingenious Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
whether Roman-Catholick or Protestants there taking notice of some grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
passages relating to some who were formerly of their perswasions being placed
near others that are less so, may be the more pleased therewith, accordingly
as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> observes, that a <hi>Rose</hi> set by <hi>Garlick</hi> is the sweeter.</p>
            <p>Heaven having furnished your Lordships mind with so many Excellencies
that are extraordinary, I could wish that it had been my ability or fortune to
have here provided for your Entertainment somewhat of value that was not
vulgar. But my essaying, or offering here and there at some matter of thought
which by receiving its Form from your Lordships great reason, and particularly
in <hi>p.</hi> 158. and the following ones in my making it a <hi>Fundamental Principle for
the quiet of the World, that men are neither to get nor lose by Religion,</hi>
and my distinguishing in mens <hi>Hypotheses</hi> between their <hi>Principles</hi> denominable
as <hi>Religionary,</hi> and such <hi>Complicated</hi> therewith that are not so, and my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
judged that <hi>none ought to be severe to any Recusant before he hath a
Moral Certainty of such person having imbibed any of the Principles impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to Recusancy that are irreligionary and unnatural,</hi> and my defiance of
the petulance of the Faction by my placing Lawrels on those Heads at which
it was throwing dirt, and my shewing how not only Christians of the Roman-Catholick
Church in its great spreading Latitude, but even those of the more
particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and reverers of the Diocess or Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
are under no obligation by the <hi>LATERAN Councel</hi> to be either Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
or disloyal, may shew somewhat of my honest well wishes in this kind.</p>
            <p>I am not so va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n as to think that any thing relating to Numbers or <hi>Political
Calculations</hi> in the <hi>Discourse</hi> can appear new to your Lordship, who are so
great a Master in that kind of Knowledge, that the most Curious of the Age
may therein beg instruction from you. But I shall here presume to acquaint your
<pb facs="tcp:103047:5"/>
Lordship, that I observing that many in the late Conjuncture whom I looked on
as honest, loyal, and learned and ingenious men, and some who had formerly
a <hi>gusto</hi> for the real Learning that refers to number, weight and measure, did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Conversation so uneasie by talking of nothing but <hi>Popery, Popery</hi> (and
which I looked on as unentertaining and nauseous as the <hi>Porke, porke &amp; porke</hi>)
I thought it might be publickly useful to lay open a new Scene of Thought before
such Persons by shewing them some Calculations relating to the <hi>numbers</hi> of the
People of <hi>England,</hi> founded on somewhat like Records, and some to its gradual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in Trade as well as populousness, and others relating to other parts of
the World, whereby their Souls having somewhat like a new intellectual World
before them to expatiate in, might no longer be confined to a perplext
word.</p>
            <p>Yet moreover considering how lately it was that they came out of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
of <hi>Panic</hi> fears, when so many who went to Bed without their Brains
were afraid of rising without their Heads, and that as our English World was
<hi>emerging</hi> out of the late general <hi>DELUGE</hi> of Fears and Iealousies where
<hi>omnia pontus erant,</hi> &amp;c. the Curious beheld the several births of Mens
Reasons attended with Imperfections like those of the Animals referr'd to;
<q>
                  <l>—&amp; in his quaedam modo caepta per ipsum,</l>
                  <l>Nascendi spatium, quaedam imperfecta, suisque</l>
                  <l>Trunca vident humeris: &amp; eodem corpore saepe</l>
                  <l>Altera pars vivit, rudis est pars altera tellus;</l>
               </q>
and thus saw the spectacles of mens various Vnderstandings gradually creeping
into sense and reason, and not suddenly likely to be perfected: I shew'd so
much Complaisance to them, as in stead of hastily removing their Thoughts
from the <hi>Course</hi> soil of <hi>Popery</hi> or the old Papal Vsurpations, to build my
Fabricks of Numbers and Calculations upon it: and I may say, that finding
their vitiated Fancies rellish'd nothing at that time grateful but the thoughts
about Popery, I then chose to make that the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of the Notions I meant
as Physick for their Cure.</p>
            <p>According to the way of judging of the Draught and Proportion in perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Painting by their respect to the Eye being directed to the Center there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
any ordinary Reader's judgment will be carry'd by the <hi>Index</hi> to find what
was principally aim'd at in the following Discourse, namely to incline him to
preserve the haereditary Monarchy. And he will there find that my next aim to
that was in a great part of the Work to dispose those who formerly had been
diffident of their Prince, to <hi>Promote the Public Supplies for the necessary
Support of the Government.</hi> And my judging that <hi>our most eminent Patriots
would be inclined to value themselves as such, on the promoting the same,</hi>
may to some appear as the most <hi>sanguine</hi> part of my Predictions. But as I
leave it to any indifferent man to judge of the grounds of Nature I went on in
so doing, so I may some way support the Credit of my measures of futurity in
that Affair by the past event of the Loyal Confidence in His Majesty shewn
by his late Parliament in their proceeding so far as they did in Supporting the
Government; and may add that His Majesty's vast Expences that have been
since so Conspicuous to the World in his Naval Preparations, and otherwise in
the Providing for the Security and Honour of the Nation, may well incline any
one else to judge well of such Patriotly temper of any future Parliament, and
to allow of the Reasons by me urged as more Cogent for the present Reign then
the former, considering the Preparations of our Neighbors that have been
since augmented.</p>
            <p>Yet however, I doubt not but that if it had been Gods will further to have
lengthen'd the last reign, the Course of Nature would then have operated as I
<pb facs="tcp:103047:6"/>
have mention'd. And if it shall appear that those natural Considerations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
shall have the success of such further Parliamentary Supplies to His gracious
Majesty, as may tend to the further greatning of his Character and that of the
Kingdom, I shall account my claim the more equitable to have the pardon of my
fellow Subjects of what Religionary Sect soever for any thing in this Discourse
that may disgust them. And, as an eminent <hi>Protestant</hi> Divine hath in a Printed
Sermon thus said, <hi>viz. that man is not worthy to breathe in so good a Land
as</hi> England <hi>is, who would not willingly lay down his life to cure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
divisions and distractions that are among us,</hi> I shall say that any Subject
deserves not to live here under the Indulgence of so good a Prince, who for
the helping him to money by all due means for the defence of this good Land,
would not wish himself as well as his Bigottry a Sacrifice; and who would
not as to any Extravagant dash of a Pen lighting on his Party, and bringing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to his Prince, cry <hi>foelix peccatum,</hi> rather then such Divisions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
and Diffidences of the Government, and stifling of Publick Supplies
should still live as were formerly known in some Conjunctures, and when the Art
of Demagogues appear'd so spightful in endeavours to frustrate the Meetings of
Parliaments.</p>
            <p>But our Prince having freed all his dissenting Subjects from their uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
under Pecuniary Mulcts for Religion, and the Members of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> from the uneasiness of imposing such <hi>Soul-Money,</hi> will, I doubt not,
when he shall please to Call a Parliament, find from them such necessary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
for the support of the Body of the Kingdom, as may ease him under the
weight of his great Desires for it: and that it will then appear to all as absurd
to Crown such a Head with Thorns as hath taken the Thorn out of
every man's foot in <hi>England:</hi> and that his pass'd Sufferings for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
(and others of his Communion having too suffer'd for his Conscience)
bespeaking us in those words of the Apostle, <hi>Fulfil ye my joy;</hi> that both his
and theirs will be then Consummated, and as the Ioy of those of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and of all nominal Churches in <hi>England</hi> hath been fulfill'd by him:
and that as <hi>Luther</hi> was pleas'd in a Christian-like transport of good Nature to
Profess in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Jeselius</hi> a Iew, <hi>Me propter Unum Judaeum Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixum
omnibus favere Judaeis,</hi> we shall for the sake of one of the Roman-Catholick
Communion, who hath formerly suffer'd so much for his Conscience,
and since done so much for the freedom of ours, shew all those of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
our favour to such a proportion as may compleat his and their Ioy.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I am here obliged to acknowledge, that tho while the several
Parts of the following Work were written in the times the Government
charged both Papists and Anti-Papists with Disloyalty and Plots, I express'd
my sense of the Non-advisableness to have the Penal Laws against them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd,
pending such Charge and Plots; I desire the Reader to look on
me as very far from insisting on any thing of that nature in this <hi>Happy
State of England,</hi> now that the <hi>Corner Stone</hi> (and that some of <hi>the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
rejected</hi>) hath thus successfully united the sides of the Fabrick of the
Government in Loyalty.</p>
            <p>My Lord, It is near a year since I writ my Thoughts at large concerning
the Subject of the Repealing those Laws, and they are in the <hi>Fourth Part</hi> of
my Work about <hi>The Dispensative Power</hi> (of which the <hi>two first Parts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Volume) ready for the Press; and reserving my poor Iudgment in
this great Point till the Publication of the whole, I think I shall then set
forth my Opinion as founded on <hi>Medium's</hi> that have not appear'd in Print from
other Writers, and which I believe will not only not give offence to any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but be of general use in allaying the <hi>ferment</hi>
the Question hath occasion'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:6"/>
And if as they who were long fellow-Passengers in a Ship among violent
Tempests and Hirricanes, do usually from their being Participants together
in the danger and horror, take occasion to raise a friendly esteem and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishes
for each other, such of the Loyal whose belief I referr'd to, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
with mine in that of the <hi>Plot</hi> during the late Stormy Conjuncture,
shall be the more favourable to what I write, I shall be glad both for their
sakes as well as mine; but do further judge that what I have so largely
in the following <hi>Discourse</hi> asserted (and by <hi>Reasons</hi> taken from <hi>Nature</hi>)
concerning the Moral impossibility of the belief of the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> gaining ground here considerably, on the belief of the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will tend to secure any one from fears of our
losing our Religion by any loss of the <hi>Test</hi> that may happen: a thing that
none (I think) will fear, who are of the Iudgment of the <hi>House of Commons</hi>
in their <hi>Address to the late King</hi> on the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. (that I
have referr'd to in my <hi>Fourth Part</hi>) and where they say, that <hi>POPERY
hath rather gain'd then lost Ground since the TEST ACT,</hi> and make
<hi>that Act to have had little effect.</hi> I have in the following Discourse referr'd
to that Act as represented to have had its rice in the year 1673. from the
alledged <hi>petulant Insolence</hi> of Papists in that Conjuncture, and I took notice
of a learned <hi>Lord</hi> since deceas'd as vouching somewhat in Print of such tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
among some of them. And a <hi>Proclamation</hi> that year charging the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
therewith, I was <hi>implicitly</hi> guided thereby to take the thing for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and as to the which, considering since the publick Passages in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
I have otherwise judged. But as I think no loyal Roman-Catholick
should in that Conjuncture have suffer'd any Prejudice for any ill Behaviour
of any other of that Communion then, much less ought any such thing be
now; and when there appears so noble and general a spirit of Emulation
among all men of sense in the <hi>Diffusive</hi> Body of the People about who shall
make the <hi>Head</hi> and all Members of that Body most easie: and for the doing
which we may well hope that the People <hi>representative,</hi> and the other Estates
of the Realm will come with all due <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> when it shall please
His Gracious Majesty to assemble them.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have nothing further to add but my begging your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Pardon for this trouble, and my owning the many Obligations I am
under to be,</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Earl of <hi>Anglesy</hi> having shewed me an <hi>Affidavit</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
against him, delivered at the <hi>Barr</hi> of the <hi>House of
Commons,</hi> on the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1680. and <hi>printed</hi> by
<hi>Order</hi> of that <hi>House,</hi> and in which <hi>Affidavit</hi> and <hi>Information</hi>
he was Charged with Endeavours to stifle some Evidence of the <hi>Popish
Plot,</hi> and to promote the belief of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> one, and with encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<hi>Dugdale</hi> to recant what he had sworn, and promising to harbour him
in his House, and that his <hi>Lordships Priest</hi> should there be his Companion
and likewise watch him, his Lordship being thereupon desirous that
right should be done him by a printed <hi>Vindication,</hi> was pleased to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
my Pen therein: and I was the less unwilling to disobey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
because in that <hi>Conjuncture</hi> wherein so many <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were sufferes by the humour of <hi>Accusation</hi> then <hi>regnant,</hi> I held it
a <hi>Patriotly</hi> thing to withstand its <hi>Arbitrariness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> in an Excellent <hi>Manuscript</hi> of his, called, <hi>The Political Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
of Ireland, hath one <hi>Chapter</hi> there, <hi>Of the Government of</hi> Ireland <hi>apparent</hi>
or external, and the Government <hi>internal:</hi> and he describes the <hi>apparent</hi>
Government there to be by <hi>the King and Three Estates, and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Courts of Iustice,</hi> but makes the <hi>internal</hi> Government there to
depend much on the Potent Influence <hi>of the many Secular Priests and
Fryars on the numerous</hi> Irish Roman <hi>Catholicks, and on those Priests and
Fryars being governed by their Bishops and Superiors, and on the Ministers
of Foreign States, governing and directing such Superiors:</hi> and thus while
<hi>England</hi> was blest with the best <hi>external</hi> Government, namely of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
and with the best <hi>Monarch</hi> and a Loyal Nobility and Commons, yet
after the detection of a <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> several Persons under the Notion of
<hi>Witnesses</hi> about the same, made so great a Figure in the Government,
and were so Enthroned in the Minds of the <hi>Populace,</hi> that the <hi>Office</hi>
of the King's <hi>Witnesses</hi> was as powerful as ever was that of the high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
of England, and the <hi>internal</hi> Government of the Kingdom was
then very much as I may say a <hi>Martyrocracy,</hi> and by that hard name the
Noisy part of Protestants Endeavoured to gain Ground as much as ever
any peaceable ones did by the old known Name of <hi>Martyrology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as all <hi>external</hi> Forms of Government have some peculiar defects
as well as Conveniences, so did this <hi>internal</hi> Government appear to have;
and those too so dreadful, that the Air of Testimony having sometimes
got into the wrong place, was likely to have made Earth-Quakes in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Government: and as the <hi>Militia</hi> that after the <hi>Epoche</hi> of 41 was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:103047:8"/>
the <hi>Parliaments Army,</hi> did before the fatal time of 48, produce the
Revolution of the <hi>Army's Parliament,</hi> so were we endangered after the
<hi>Plot-Epoche</hi> of 78, to have heard of the Office of the <hi>King's Witnesses</hi>
changed into another, namely, of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>And whoever shall write the <hi>English</hi> History of that part of time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that <hi>Martyrocracy</hi> was so powerful and domineering, will (if he shall
think fit to give a denomination to that <hi>Interval</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> and to found
the same on most of the <hi>Narratives</hi> he shall read, or the <hi>Sham-Papers</hi>
that many Papists and Protestants after the Plot Attaqued each other
with,) be thought not absurd, if he gives the old <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>Intervallum
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, incertum,</hi> or of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>fabulosum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in the time of the most Triumphant State of this <hi>Internal</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that I undertook to weigh its Empire, as I have done in <hi>p.</hi> 33, 34, 35.
discussing the points of <hi>Infamous Witnesses</hi> and their <hi>Infamy,</hi> and of their
<hi>Credibility</hi> after pardon of <hi>Perjury</hi> or <hi>Crimes and Infany incurred:</hi> and a
bolder man than my self would hardly have dared in that Conjuncture to
have sifted their <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and (as I may say) to have put hungry Wolves
into Scales, and to have taken the dimensions of the Paws of Lions, or to
have handled the stings of Serpents, without expressing against some of the
Romanists Principles he thought Irreligionary, all the zeal he thought consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with Charity and Candour to the Persons of Papists, which is so much
done in the Body of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> and without the expressing of which my
<hi>Vindicating</hi> a <hi>Noble</hi> Person from being a Papist, had been an absurdity.</p>
            <p>However I have been careful in any <hi>Moot-points</hi> of <hi>Witnesses,</hi> not to
disturb in the least the Measures of the <hi>External</hi> Government about
them; and out of the tender regard due to the safety of Monarchs from
all Subjects, have in <hi>p.</hi> 205 asserted the Obligation of doing every thing
that is fairly to be done, to support the Credits of <hi>Witnesses</hi> produced in
the Case of <hi>Treason,</hi> and have there given a particular reason for it: and
have in <hi>p.</hi> 36. with a <hi>Competent</hi> respect mentioned <hi>Dugdale</hi> on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Shamm</hi> sworn against the Earl of <hi>Anglesy,</hi> as if his <hi>Lordship</hi>
had undertook to have unjustly patronized him: and have shewed my self
inclined enough to belief credible Witnesses, by the Concurrence of my
thoughts with the <hi>Iustice</hi> of the Nation in <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Case; and the fate of
which Person, and the <hi>Casuistical</hi> Principles that allowed it, I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not mentioned, but out of a just indignation against the infamous
<hi>Shamms</hi> about it spread by some ill Papists to the dishonour of that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Lord the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there was another consideration that induced me to write with
such a Zeal as aforesaid, against such <hi>Romanists</hi> Principles and their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
and but for which the following Discourse had not swollen to a
large Volume.</p>
            <p>I observed that since the late <hi>Fermentation</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> such a <hi>Panique</hi>
Fear of <hi>the Growth of Popery,</hi> and the numbers of <hi>Papists</hi> had been by
Knaves propagated among Fools that made the <hi>English</hi> Nation appear
somewhat ridiculous abroad, and that during its Course many consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Protestants were so far mis-led, as to think the State of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could never be restored to it self, but by disturbing the <hi>Succession</hi> of
the Crown in its lawful Course of <hi>Descent:</hi> and therefore resolving to do
my utmost to free the Land from the Burthen of another guess <hi>Perjury,</hi>
by the general Violence done to our Oaths <hi>Promissory</hi> (I mean to those of
Allegiance and Supremacy) then that of any Witnesses in their Oaths <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertory,</hi>
I thought fit at large to shew the Vanity of any Mens fearing
<pb facs="tcp:103047:8"/>
that Popery can ever (<hi>humanly</hi> speaking) be the National Religion of
<hi>England;</hi> and to direct them that they may not, by the imaginary danger
of Popery to come, run with all their swelling Sails on the Rock of it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
by <hi>founding Dominion in Grace,</hi> and out-rage those Oaths that do at
present bind us without reserve to pay Allegiance to the King's Heirs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his <hi>demise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for any one who being concerned to see so many of his Country-men
lying (as it were) on the Ground, and dejected with unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
fears of the extermination of their Religion and themselves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smearing
themselves with the dreadful guilt of their great Oaths,
was resolved to endeavour to help them up, and by perswasion gently to
lead them to such a high Prospect of thought, from whence they might
at once have a view of the <hi>past</hi> and <hi>present</hi> State of Popery here and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in former Ages, and likewise of its probable future one, (a <hi>sight</hi> that
might better entertain Curiosity than what the <hi>Traveller</hi> speaks of, when
from a high Mountain in the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> he could view both
the great <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Sea) not to have rendered himself an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>Perswader</hi> by his <hi>Discourse</hi> carrying with it <hi>Self-Evidence</hi> that he
was no Papist, had been a vain attempt.</p>
            <p>And again for any one who would perswade the generality of Popish
or Protestant Recusants, that it is not their Interest by any Artifices to
endeavour to make so great a Figure in the <hi>Internal</hi> Part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as they have in some former <hi>Conjunctures,</hi> without his Discourse
carrying likewise <hi>Self-Evidence,</hi> that his <hi>Advice</hi> was that of a Friend to
their Persons, as far as the publick Security would admit, had been an
attempt as insignificant as the former.</p>
            <p>I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> often took notice of this <hi>distinction</hi> of the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>
of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Presbytery: viz.</hi> Such of them that properly are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominable</hi>
by <hi>Religion,</hi> and such that are not: presuming in my private
judgment to differ from the Measures took by the Government in King
<hi>Iames</hi> his time, when the printed <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Anniversary</hi> of the
<hi>Gun powder Treason</hi> represented Papists <hi>Religion</hi> to be <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notion of Principles <hi>denominable</hi> by <hi>Religion</hi> have ranked <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
Purgatory, Invocation of Saints,</hi> and others, and have
judged none of their Principles Irreligionary, but such as the late Learned
Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> in his incomparable defence of Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to Popery, as injurious to Princes and their Subjects and what
King <hi>Iames</hi> in his <hi>Speech</hi> to <hi>both Houses,</hi> hinted as such (according to
what is cited by me <hi>p.</hi> 172) viz. <hi>As it is not impossible but many honest
men seduced with some Errors in Popery may yet remain good and faithful
Subjects, so on the other hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>none that know and believe the Grounds and
School-Conclusions of their Doctrine, can ever prove good Christians or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Subjects:</hi> and such as are apparently contrary to the Light and Law of
Nature.</p>
            <p>But there is nothing in this <hi>Discourse</hi> otherwise than <hi>en passant,</hi> that
impugns or confutes the old Religionary Points controverted formerly
between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the passages
throughout referring to those old points, might (I believe) be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
together in about a <hi>Page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if I were as in a <hi>Dictionary</hi> to express the sense of the words, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
and <hi>Irreligionary</hi> so often used in this <hi>Discourse,</hi> I would say that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
by <hi>Poper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> or (as the Writers in Latin call it, <hi>Papismus</hi>) I
mean the power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in imposing <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeds</hi> and Doctrines
<pb facs="tcp:103047:9"/>
and Rules of Divine Worship on Men, and his Jurisdiction interloping in
that of Princes and their Laws, and the doing this by the Charter of
<hi>Ius Divinum,</hi> and as he is Christs pretended Vicar; and by the term of
<hi>Irreligionary</hi> of often by me applied to Principles, I sometimes mean such
as are barely <hi>NOT</hi> religionary, that is to say, Principles that are not in
truth and in the nature things, parts of <hi>Religion,</hi> whatever any Sanction
of the Papacy or a Presbytery may term them, and which do not <hi>religare</hi>
or <hi>bind</hi> the Soul to God by <hi>Moral</hi> Obligations, nor by any <hi>Band</hi> of <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to our Prince or <hi>Charity</hi> to our Neighbour, but do only tie men to a
Party and to the owning with them several points of <hi>speculation,</hi> and no more
necessary to be believed in order to our improvement in Moral Offices
that the Divine Law natural or positive enjoyns, or conducing to the same,
than are the <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of the old or new Philosophy.</p>
            <p>But I most commonly apply the word <hi>Irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ligionary</hi> to Principles that
are <hi>reverâ</hi> contrary to Religion, and Justice, and Morality, and such as I
would therefore dis-robe of the Name of Religion; and under this term
of <hi>Irreligionary</hi> not only all the Antimonarchical Principles of the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
and Presbyterians are properly to be reckoned, but those Principles
of the <hi>Papacy</hi> that even in the times of our <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Ancestors,
(as I said) <hi>were so injurious to our Princes and their Subjects,</hi> and which
were by them as <hi>Vsurpations</hi> on the Crown opposed and defied, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by those of them who were in their tempers most Magnanimous:
and in this Case the <hi>Papal</hi> Principles that favoured those <hi>Vsurpations</hi> on
the rights of our Princes, might be said to be both <hi>Non-Religionary,</hi> or
things beside the matter of Religion, and likewise <hi>Irreligionary</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Religion, as being unjust.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Religio Officii</hi> (as <hi>Tully</hi> calls <hi>the Conscience one hath to do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>)
did bind those Princes of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Religion, to impugne his Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Usurpations on their Realms: and in the Case of the meanest <hi>Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Pope's</hi> Excommunication was never allowed good in
<hi>Westminister-Hall</hi> under our <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Kings.</p>
            <p>The latter end of the very Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> was likely to have
diverted our <hi>English</hi> World with the sight of as remarkable a <hi>Prize</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between the two <hi>Swords,</hi> (I mean the <hi>Pope's Spiritual</hi> and her <hi>Temporal</hi>
one) as was ever played on its Stage: and when Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> her
Kindsman who had reconciled our Nation to <hi>Rome,</hi> was so far lost in the
<hi>Pope's</hi> good Graces, as that his <hi>Legantine</hi> Power was abrogated by the
Pope, and in affront to <hi>Pool</hi> given to <hi>Peito</hi> a poor Friar; but whose red
Hat by Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> opposition could get no further than <hi>Callis;</hi> and
She was so regardless of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Curses in the Case, that his <hi>Bulls</hi>
in favour of his new <hi>Legate</hi> were not permitted to Arrive here, and the
designed <hi>Legate</hi> was enforced to go up and down the Streets of <hi>London</hi>
like a begging Friar without a red Hat. And more need not be here said to
express the <hi>Principles</hi> that Usurp on Monarchs to be <hi>Irreligionary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I have in the former part of the <hi>Discourse</hi> once or twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
the term of <hi>Apostates,</hi> for some turning to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
I did there speak <hi>Cum vulgo,</hi> and likewise according to the <hi>Style</hi> of our
<hi>Courts Christian,</hi> which proceeding against some perverted to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> impute to them the Crime of <hi>Apostacy:</hi> but having observed
in the Progress of this Discourse, that that term was seditiously used by
the Disciples of <hi>Iulian,</hi> I have reprehended the further calling any men
<hi>Apostates,</hi> for the alteration of their judgments in some controvertible points
of saith between <hi>Papists</hi> and Protestants, and that may without absurdity be
called Tenets of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:9"/>
As to the expression of the <hi>Extermination</hi> of Popery, and likewise of
Presbytery used in this <hi>Discourse</hi> sometimes, (and with allusion to the
trite term of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> viz. <hi>Exterminium haereticorum</hi>) I have there
in <hi>p.</hi> 283 sufficiently expressed my abhorrence of the <hi>Extermination</hi> of
<hi>Persons,</hi> and (as is there said) do only <hi>refer to the Extermination of
Things and Principles Religionary, and indeed to speak more properly of
that part of Mens Principles only that is Irreligionary and against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of exterminating and recalling are often used by <hi>Cicero</hi> as
signifying the contrary: and when Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters shewed such an
imperious design in him for the <hi>Revocation of Popery</hi> that had been driven
away, and banished or exterminated hence by so many <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and even for the Extermination of Heresie out of the <hi>North,</hi> as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
such apprehensions in the Government of what was intended by
other innocent and modest Papists, that made the gentlest of Princes in a
<hi>Speech</hi> in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament say, <hi>and if it be practicable</hi> the ridding our
selves quite of all of that Party that have any considerable Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
none need wonder at the past warmth of Subjects expressed against the
<hi>Recalling</hi> of the <hi>Exterminated</hi> Papal Power: nor yet at the warmth of
their Zeal against the Principles of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> propagating an <hi>Internal</hi>
Power here when they had been exterminated from <hi>Rome</hi> it self: and
when the Lord <hi>Chancellors Speech</hi> to both Houses had mentioned the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against Protestants in Foreign Parts; to look as if they were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make way for a general Extirpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are poor Judges of things who think that Doctrines of Religion
cannot be said to be exterminated out of Kingdoms, and their Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Banishment of the Persons professing them. Who accounts not
Protestancy sufficiently exterminated from being the State-Religion in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and yet <hi>Sandies</hi> his <hi>Europae speculum</hi> tells us, <hi>That there were 40000
professed Protestants there.</hi> Is not <hi>Iudaism</hi> sufficiently Exterminated
from being the Religion at <hi>Rome,</hi> tho thousands of professed <hi>Iews</hi> are
there tolerated?</p>
            <p>'Tis the publick <hi>approbation</hi> of <hi>Tenets</hi> or Doctrines, and not any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
or indulgence to persons who prosess them, that gives Doctrines
a place within the Religion of a State: for to make any State approve of a
Doctrine contrary to what it hath Established, is a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> But
the truth is, the famous Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> (formerly Heavens <hi>peculiar
People</hi> on Earth) having not been more generally guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their prosperity, than of <hi>Superstition</hi> during their Captivity and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and Extermination from their Country, hath taught the
World this great truth that the readiest way to propagate <hi>Superstition,</hi>
and Error is by the <hi>Exterminium</hi> and Banishment of Persons.</p>
            <p>Whatever Church any men call their <hi>Mother,</hi> if the Magistrate finds
them to own the Interest of their <hi>Country</hi> as their <hi>Mother,</hi> and to honour
their true Political <hi>Father,</hi> they cannot wish their <hi>days more long in the
Land</hi> than I shall do.</p>
            <p>I remember under the <hi>Vsurpation</hi> there passed an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>
(as 'twas called) <hi>for the banishment</hi> of that famous Boute-feu <hi>Iohn Lilburn:</hi>
and under the Penalty of the <hi>Vltimum supplicium,</hi> and he shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
returning to <hi>England,</hi> and being tried in <hi>London</hi> where he was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
known, and the only thing <hi>issuable</hi> before the <hi>Iurors</hi> being <hi>whether
he was the same</hi> John Lilburn, those good men and true thought him so
much transubstantiated, as to bring him in <hi>not guilty:</hi> and when ever I
<pb facs="tcp:103047:10"/>
find any Papist not only willing to change the <hi>Name</hi> Papist for Catholick,
but the thing <hi>Papistry,</hi> for the <hi>Principles</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under
its first good Bishops, and before <hi>Popes</hi> beyond a <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Power aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be Universal Bishops and Universal Kings, and that even a <hi>Iesuite</hi>
instead of the Rule of <hi>Iesuita est omnis homo,</hi> hath alter'd his Morals and
Principles pursuant to the <hi>Pope's</hi> said <hi>Decree,</hi> so far as truly to say, <hi>Ego
non sum ego,</hi> I shall not intermeddle in awakening Penal Laws to touch ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his life or liberty.</p>
            <p>Nor can any <hi>Presbyterians</hi> with justice reflect on the Zeal of any for
the Continuance of the Laws, for the <hi>Extermination</hi> of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> when
they shall reflect on the Royal Family having been by their means (as is
set forth in this Discourse) <hi>exterminated</hi> out of the Realm into Foreign
Popish Countries: and of which they might easily have seen the ill effects,
if their understandings had not been very scandalously dull.</p>
            <p>But there is another happy <hi>Extermination</hi> that I have in this Discourse
from Natural Causes predicted to my Country, and that is of the fears
and jealousies that have been so prevalent during our late <hi>fermentation:</hi>
concerning which the <hi>Reader</hi> will shortly find himself referred to in many
Pages in this Discourse, and to have directed him to all of that Nature
would have made the <hi>Index a Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> designing to eradicate the fears of Popery out
of the Minds of <hi>timid</hi> Protestants, by the most rational perswasions I
could, shewed somewhat of <hi>Complaisance</hi> in sometimes humouring their
<hi>Suppositions</hi> of things never likely to come to pass. I have accorded with
them in the <hi>possibility</hi> of the Event of Arch-Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi>'s Famous <hi>Prophecy,</hi>
tho I account the same as remote from likelihood as any one could with
it: and do believe that if that Great and Learned Man could have foreseen
the mischief that <hi>Prophecy</hi> hath occasioned by making so many of the
Kings good Subjects disquieted thereby, (and which by at once <hi>Chilling</hi>
their Hearts and heating their Heads, hath rendered them less qualified
for a chearful and steady discharge of their respective Duties) he would
have consulted privately with many other <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Pious Divines</hi>
about the intrinsick weight of the matter revealed to him, before he had
exposed it to the World: for that in the days when <hi>God spake by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
yet even then <hi>the Spirits of the Prophets were</hi> always <hi>subject to the
Prophets:</hi> and there is no <hi>Fire</hi> in the World so <hi>bad a Master</hi> as the <hi>Fire</hi>
of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>It is observable that there hath scarce since this Prophecy been a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture</hi>
of time wherein men uneasie to themselves would make the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
so, but this <hi>Prophecy</hi> hath been <hi>reprinted</hi> in it and cryed about,
and few <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> but are as <hi>perfect</hi> in it as a <hi>Sea-man</hi> in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The substance of it was to foretel Persecution that should happen in
<hi>England,</hi> from the Papists in the way of a sudden Massacre, and that the
<hi>Pope</hi> should be the Contriver of it, and that if the King were restored
it might be a little longer deferred.</p>
            <p>A person less learned than that Great Prelate could easily give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the past Out-rages of Massacres that have been perpetrated by
Papists, and of the tendency of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Principles to the very legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Future ones: but the most Pious and Learned Man in the World
ought with the greatest Caution imaginable to pretend to Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Future Contingencies, in a matter both so unlikely and so odious
as this, and which might probably occasion so much Odium to so many
<pb facs="tcp:103047:10"/>
innocent Papists, and so much needless trouble to so many timid Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</p>
            <p>That Pious and Great <hi>Prelate</hi> did not (I believe) foresee that at the
time when his <hi>Prophecy</hi> should dart its most fearful influence, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Chair would be filled with a Person of so great Morality and Vertue as
the present <hi>Pope</hi> is, and a Pope that would brand the sicarious Principles
of those <hi>Ianizaries</hi> of former Popes, the Jesuites, and that he would be
by so many <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks called <hi>the Lutheran Pope,</hi> and that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
numbers would be here so comparatively small long before this
time, as to render it absurd to think that without the Execution of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<hi>Peanal Law</hi> of an infatuation upon them, they will ever attempt any
such desperate design against such vast Numbers protected by the best
of Princes under the best of Governments.</p>
            <p>Whatever Principles of <hi>Irreligion</hi> any particular dissolute Papists might
by any be supposed to retain, it is not to be supposed but that they who
shew respect enough to <hi>Numbers</hi> and their weight in <hi>spiritual</hi> Matters,
and particularly in the Divine Concourse with the Majority of Numbers
in the Election of the head of their Church, and in the determinations of
a General Council, and in their valuation of their Church by its Universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
will not contemn the power of Numbers in Matters <hi>Political;</hi> and
I believe it will never among their innumerable Miracles and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be Revealed to them, that numbers are by them in things <hi>Political</hi>
to be dis-regarded.</p>
            <p>But as I observed of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Prophecy in this <hi>Discourse,</hi> viz. <hi>That
he guessed shrewdly:</hi> so one thing hath happened that may partly salve
the Credit of this Prelate's Conjecture: And that is, that some <hi>Nominal</hi>
Protestants (but too justly to be thought <hi>Popishly affected</hi>) having rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the Jesuites of their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Resistance</hi> and of their <hi>Principle of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
being founded in Grace,</hi> Endeavoured to <hi>robb</hi> them of their <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,</hi>
and as his Majesty's <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> the 28th, 1683 mentioned,
did plot an execrable Out-rage of that kind: and some of the <hi>Dissenters</hi>
that appeared to me for sometime after I began this <hi>Discourse,</hi> only <hi>as
Sheep straying from the Flock,</hi> as they did to that Great <hi>Minister</hi> of the
State who bestowed on them that expression, were afterward turned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
Animals: and as the effect of <hi>Nycippus</hi>'s Sheep according to
<hi>Aelian</hi> bringing forth a <hi>Lion</hi> in one of the <hi>Greek</hi> States, was resented as <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi>
a Change of the Government, these mens producing the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> was to be much more regarded as an <hi>Omen</hi> of our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Mischief than what any former predictions could import, and it was
shortly accompanied with a real design to have effected it: and as I hope it
will be with such a sense of shame in others of them when they shall survey
the Circumstances of that bloody design notified in the <hi>King's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Iohn Geree</hi> an Eminent and Learned Presbyterian <hi>Minister</hi> of
<hi>S. Faiths</hi> in <hi>London</hi> did express, in a <hi>Dedicatory Epistle</hi> before a <hi>Book</hi> of
his called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, published some Weeks before the Fate of the Royal
<hi>Martyr,</hi> and in which <hi>Epistle</hi> he importunes the Lady <hi>Fairfax</hi> to shew
the Book to her Husband then <hi>Lord General</hi> to prevent his participating
in the guilt of the Regicide then feared, and saith, <hi>O Madam let us fit
down and weep over our Religion, and we, whither shall we cause her shame to
go. How shall we now look Papists in the Face, whom we have so reviled
and abhorred for their Derogatory Doctrine and Damnable Practices against
Kings or any in Supreme Authority? O study that it may never be said that
any Person of Honour and of the Protestant Religion had any hand in so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb facs="tcp:103047:11"/>
worthy an Action as the deposing and destroying of a King whose preservation
they stand bound to endeavour by so many Sacred Bonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have accorded with our timid Protestants, that <hi>Popery may gain ground
perhaps in some turbid Interval, and how by the Divine Omnipotence and
Iustice, the Course of Nature in its continuing the Protestant Religion may
be over-ruled, and that on the account of our having justly deserved the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation
of Popery, we may reasonably apprehend the dangers of it,</hi> p. 140.
but have never <hi>recurred</hi> from shewing them the Future prosperous
Estate of Protestants and Protestancy in <hi>England,</hi> but to advance the
more forward into the following Representations thereof.</p>
            <p>But having thus with Compassion to the timid endeavoured to discharge
my duty as to the Moral Obligation of <hi>Complaisance</hi> (an <hi>Obligation</hi> that
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath so well shewn to be most clearly rising from the <hi>Law of
Nature,</hi> and which the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine so strongly inculcates, and by
vertue of which we are to <hi>bear one anothers Burthens,</hi> and sometimes to
<hi>the weak to become as weak</hi>) I thought it afterward proper by the strength
of Argument desumed from the nature of things to fortifie the minds of
the Loyal against Un-Christian and Un-manly Fears.</p>
            <p>But as to the Dis-loyal and Factious, let them (by my consent) <hi>fear
on.</hi> I shall not trouble my self to <hi>bear</hi> the <hi>burthens</hi> of them who resolve
to be <hi>Burthens</hi> to the Government, and who would if they could, load it
with Presbyteries <hi>dead-weight,</hi> while they give that <hi>term</hi> to our Bishops.
Let those who would have both Protestant Princes and their other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>fear them,</hi> be laughed at for <hi>fearing</hi> of <hi>Papists,</hi> and for not having
a better understanding with the Persons of Papists, when there is so good
an understanding and coincidence between the <hi>Principles</hi> of such <hi>Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Protestants, and that very part of the <hi>Principles</hi> of some Papists that
is <hi>Irreligionary</hi> and subversive of the Rights of Princes and their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and when yet they seem not to understand that; and let Papists
(by my consent) afford themselves recreative smiles, if ever in any
Conjuncture of time that may come, they shall behold the Factious Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to come under its <hi>Wing</hi> for shelter after
their so long endeavouring to <hi>deplume</hi> it.</p>
            <p>But because I have observed some well meaning and loyal <hi>Dissenters,
frighted</hi> both by Cholerick and Melancholy Expositions of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>
(a good Book in which some ill men have found the obscurest passages to
be the clearest for their ill purposes, and in the dark places of which Book
many having long lain in Ambush, have thence sallied out to cut Throats,
and subvert Governments, I have here rear'd up a <hi>Bull-wark</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
that may secure them from the imaginary dangers of Castles in the Air,
or <hi>Visionary</hi> Armies in the Clouds of any Mens fancies: and in compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Loyal</hi> Protestants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose Melancholy
<hi>Suppositions</hi> I had a while <hi>closed</hi> with both as a Friend and Wrestler, that
I might give them a fair and soft fall, I thought it then proper to warn
them of the danger of extravagant <hi>Suppositions,</hi> and acquainted them
that most <hi>Bedlams</hi> were founded on <hi>Suppositions,</hi> and the thought of
<hi>Quid si caelum ruat,</hi> and of Peoples imagining Earth-quakes to happen in
the State from falling Skies: and have shewn them how irrational a
thing it is to suppose that a lawful Prince, how unlawful or heterodox
any of his Tenets in Religion may be, will injure his Laws and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by Law Established: and having conducted the <hi>Reader</hi> through the
former more melancholy and strait and unpleasant passages in the <hi>Fabrick</hi>
of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> have took care to lodge him in a more Airy and Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:103047:11"/>
               <hi>appartment,</hi> and whence he may recreate himself with <hi>looking out</hi> on
the Future State of <hi>England,</hi> and remain assured that no frightful <hi>Spectrums</hi>
and <hi>Fantoms</hi> will disturb him there, when he is either at his <hi>Rest</hi> or at
his <hi>Devotions,</hi> and which I have for his diversion <hi>furnished</hi> with some
such fair <hi>Pictures</hi> of his Countries Future State as may perhaps not much
either shame it or my self, in regard that I think in the <hi>draught</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
thereof, my <hi>Art</hi> has been according to Nature, how carelessly laid
soever the Colours may have been, and where he moreover will have the
<hi>Prospect</hi> I before described, and if his <hi>sight</hi> be clear, will find the Sky so
more and more, tho so many <hi>Politick</hi> and <hi>Lachrymist would-be's</hi> have
told him of the contrary.</p>
            <p>I believe that since the <hi>Predictions</hi> of the <hi>deluge</hi> by <hi>Noah</hi> to the old
World, there were never so many angry <hi>Predicters</hi> and <hi>Predictions</hi> of a
general inundation of misery to any Country, under a Future Prince,
as within these late years we have been overwhelmed with, and that to
the discomposing of mens minds in their common converse and while they
did <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> as in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and were so ready to devour
all their Countrymen who believed not the same <hi>inundation</hi> with
them.</p>
            <p>But during this great <hi>Deluge</hi> of our popular fears of one of Popery,
I have ventured in <hi>p.</hi> 297 and 258 of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> to express my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension
of the Future State of <hi>England</hi> making men ashamed of their <hi>past
fears</hi> and their former deference to ill boding <hi>Prophets,</hi> and that our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<hi>Prophets</hi> will appear to be <hi>toto Caelo</hi> mistaken in their <hi>Auguries</hi>
as much (as <hi>Gassendus</hi> tells us) all the <hi>Astrologers</hi> were in <hi>France</hi> when by
reason of the great <hi>Conjunction of watry signs</hi> in <hi>Piscis</hi> and <hi>Aquarius</hi> in the
<hi>Year</hi> 1524, they said that there should be then in the <hi>Month</hi> of <hi>February</hi>
a second <hi>Deluge</hi> that should overwhelm <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and by
reason whereof <hi>many People went with their Goods and Cattel from the low
Lands to the hilly Country,</hi> and yet after all the <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rmentation</hi> those <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers</hi>
had made among the <hi>Populace</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Month</hi> of <hi>February</hi>
(as <hi>Gassendus</hi> tells us) tho naturally rainy, proved the dryest Month
that ever was known in those Countries.</p>
            <p>I account that the <hi>deluge</hi> of the popular <hi>fears</hi> did sensibly decrease after
the year 81, and that to the great dissatisfaction of those whose broken
Fortunes made them no worse under it, than the <hi>Fishes</hi> were in <hi>Noahs.</hi> The
more rational and sagacious sort of Protestants, who had been so long <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>
with that deluge, and did nauseate the fears and jealousies that had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed
them, began to see <hi>Land,</hi> when his Majesty with so just a <hi>Caution</hi>
advised them in his <hi>Speech</hi> to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament, <hi>That their just care of
Religion should be so managed, as that unnecessary fears should not be made a
pretence for changing the Foundations of the Government,</hi> and his <hi>Declaration</hi>
of the <hi>Causes</hi> that induced him to dissolve that Parliament, signifying his
Royal <hi>Resolution both in and out of Parliament to use his utmost endeavours
to extirpate Popery, and in all things to Govern according to the Laws of the
Kingdom,</hi> was in effect, like the <hi>Olive-branch</hi> brought by the <hi>Dove</hi> into the
<hi>Ark,</hi> an happy <hi>indication</hi> of peace and settlement to the minds of the people
and of <hi>the Waters being abated,</hi> and indeed a <hi>demonstration</hi> to them that
the <hi>Dove</hi> had found <hi>ubi pedem figeret,</hi> and that our Laws and Religion
had done so too: and on that great <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Lex terrae,</hi> that so many
mists had so long kept us from seeing, there ensued a general <hi>shout</hi> of
Loyal <hi>Addressers</hi> throughout the Kingdom, like that of <hi>Sea-mens</hi> at their
first seeing of Land after a long stormy Voyage, and when they thought
<pb facs="tcp:103047:12"/>
they had lost their Course: and the hearing of those shouts from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Countries, served as a Call of invitation to the many <hi>Timid</hi> and
Loyal, and likewise to many unfortunate persons, to return thither after
they had flocked from thence to the <hi>Metropolis</hi> as an <hi>Ark</hi> for their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
on the rising of the <hi>deluge</hi> of fears in some preceeding years: and
it served to some <hi>cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an</hi> and to other <hi>unclean</hi> Beasts as a <hi>Call</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> that
they were to March out of the <hi>Ark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>unclean Beasts</hi> I mean the sturdy <hi>Paupers</hi> that I have in this
<hi>Discourse</hi> spoke of, who were observed shortly after the Alarms of the
Plot from so many <hi>Proclamations,</hi> to flock from so many parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to <hi>London,</hi> like the Rustical <hi>Plebs</hi> I have spoke of naturally thronging
to the shore, when they see a poor Vessel contending with a violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
near it, and the next Minute likely to <hi>Condemn</hi> it as a wrack, and
furnish them with <hi>Gods Goods</hi> (I mean such as they call <hi>wrack'd</hi> ones)
and when to prevent the <hi>Owners</hi> of them from the benefit of some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>alive</hi> to the <hi>Shoar,</hi> they are so ready to out rage those forlorn Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
they see swimming to Land.</p>
            <p>Many such <hi>Atheistical</hi> Ruffians of all Religionary Sects (and who
had been desperate in the Country) might, being come to the <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
there probably feed themselves with vain hopes of mischief to be done
to or by some particular persons, and would probably have been ready
enough to be Mercenary Bravo's to either any <hi>Iesuites</hi> or <hi>fifth-Monarchy
men</hi> or the Jesuited Protestant Patrons of the <hi>Doctrine of Resistance.</hi>
But this <hi>Scum</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi> was afterward as naturally thrown <hi>off</hi> from
the well governed City, as are the <hi>Purgamenta Maris</hi> from the Shoar
without making any Heads or Arms ake to remove them, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more welcome harbour in the City than they had in the Country,
were I believe litterally thrown upon the <hi>Sea</hi> to Convey them to the
<hi>Asylum</hi> of the <hi>Malheureus</hi> that we may call our Foreign <hi>Plantations:</hi> and
of the great and extraordinary Glut of the <hi>Advenae</hi> from the <hi>Country</hi>
ceasing in <hi>London</hi> after the year 1681, the yearly general <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
gave a sufficient proof, and did (as I may say) <hi>include</hi> too the <hi>Burial</hi>
of the <hi>Plot,</hi> or at least of the popular fears of danger from it.</p>
            <p>The critical <hi>Observator</hi> on the <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi> having long since
told us, <hi>That there come about 6000 yearly out of the Country to live in</hi>
London, and which swells the Burials about 200 yearly, and likewise
taught us the <hi>Rule</hi> of 1 in 30 there yearly dying, I have in <hi>p.</hi> 155 Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the yearly great encrease of the <hi>Burials</hi> from the <hi>Year</hi> 1675,
(when the <hi>fears</hi> of the <hi>Growth of Popery</hi> were so much in fashion) how
very great the encrease of the number of the living there was to the
<hi>Year 1679 inclusive,</hi> and the extraordinariness of which encrease was so
justly imputable to that of the <hi>Advenae</hi> from the Country: and to which
it may be added, that the <hi>Burials</hi> from what they were in the <hi>Year</hi> 79
(<hi>viz.</hi> 21730) <hi>falling</hi> back about 700 in the <hi>Year</hi> 80, yet in the <hi>Year</hi>
1681 were in all 23971, and so for every <hi>Thousand</hi> gradually dying more
in those <hi>Years</hi> referred to, 29000 were supposed to have in the same gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
lived more than in the former: and all which years before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
were of ordinary health.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Year</hi> 1681 having produced that <hi>Pacific</hi> Royal <hi>Declaration,</hi>
and the Congratulatory <hi>Addresses</hi> thereupon, and likewise that encrease
of the <hi>Burials</hi> before mentioned (that might be supposed to happen part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the <hi>Advenae</hi> from the Country being for some time necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> in making preparations there to leave it, and by
<pb facs="tcp:103047:12"/>
some of them in the mean time dying, and partly from some new <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>upers</hi>
then coming from the Country to hide their heads in obscure places in
<hi>London,</hi> and which they durst not shew in the Sun-shine that <hi>Declaration</hi>
had made in the <hi>Country,</hi> and partly by the deaths of many Loyal Persons
in <hi>London</hi> whom the <hi>Addresses</hi> and expectations of Preferment for their
Loyalty brought thither) yet the Burials in the following year, <hi>viz.</hi>
1682, being but 20690, was a considerable <hi>indication</hi> of the abatement
of the popular fears which led so many timid Persons from the Country,
with hopes to find our <hi>Metropol<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

as the most quiet part of a <hi>Ship</hi> is naturally that which is nearest the
<hi>Main-mast:</hi> and the <hi>Burials</hi> in the year 83 being but 20587, gave an
<hi>indication</hi> of the <hi>Advenae</hi> from the Country not then encreasing: and
although the <hi>Total</hi> of the <hi>Burials</hi> for this year 84 was 23202, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most probable that there dyed above 3000 of <hi>Infants,</hi> and of <hi>Aged,</hi>
and <hi>infirm,</hi> and <hi>indigent</hi> People by the <hi>Accidents</hi> of the extraordinary
<hi>Frost,</hi> it may be well accounted that the popular fears have not been in
this year augmented.</p>
            <p>Altho during the so long continuance of the general <hi>ferment</hi> in the
Kingdom after the <hi>Plot-Epoche,</hi> (and in which inter<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al so great a part of
the following <hi>Discourse</hi> was printed Sheet by Sheet) I could not after
the King and Pope had both of them by written <hi>Edicts</hi> (as it were)
denounced War against the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> that included so much
Hostility to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as of <hi>England,</hi> but participate
in the general heat against those <hi>Tenets,</hi> and improve the occasion of
writing <hi>polemically</hi> about the same, yet I think none could more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Military</hi> Discipline, than I have those of <hi>Loyalty</hi>
in not going beyond the <hi>Measures</hi> of the Government, and in following
the <hi>Standard</hi> of the Royal Pen, set up in the <hi>Proclamations,</hi> and likewise
in the <hi>Declaration</hi> aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> dedicating his <hi>Pseudo-Martyr</hi> to King <hi>Iames,</hi> begins his
<hi>Epistle</hi> by saying, that <hi>as Temporal Armies consist of pressed men and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaries,
so do they also in this War-fare in which your Majesty hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by your Books: and not only your strong and full Garrisons, which
are your Clergy and your Vniversities, but also obscure Villages can Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Souldiers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Besides since in the Battel your Majesty by your Books
is gone in person out of the Kingdom, who can be exempt from waiting on you
in such an expedition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Learned <hi>Monarch</hi> in his printed <hi>Premonition to all Crowned Heads,
free Princes and States,</hi> doth <hi>Magno Conatu,</hi> go about to prove the Pope
to be <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> and very subtilly discusseth the <hi>Moot-points</hi> out of the
<hi>Apocalypse</hi> that refer to it: and from that one <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> the
<hi>Papacy</hi> hath since the <hi>Reformation</hi> received much more prejudice, than
hath the <hi>Reformation</hi> from that other famous <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Heresy:</hi> and the
Compellation of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> is especially a more terrible weapon against
the Pope, when used by the hand of a King.</p>
            <p>But I must frankly say should my <hi>Prince</hi> Combat the <hi>Pope</hi> with this
name in Print, and descend to Command my poor Service in that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
I should humbly apply to him to excuse me therein: and as it was
observed concerning <hi>Aretine,</hi> that <hi>he left God untouched</hi> in his <hi>Satyrs,</hi>
giving this reason for it, <hi>Ille inquit non mihi notus erat:</hi> so I shall say the
same thing of <hi>Anti-Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Thunder</hi> of the <hi>Royal</hi> Power was in so great a number
of Proclamations heard all over Christendom against particular persons,
<pb facs="tcp:103047:13"/>
and their known Principles and Designs, his Subjects might well think
it a part of Loyalty during that time to wear <hi>Clouds</hi> in their Brows, and
to be tributary to the Royal Cares by endeavouring in their several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
to support the Throne, and to concur with the constant <hi>Practice</hi>
of <hi>Nations</hi> in receiving the beliefs of Matter of Fact as stated by Soveraign
Power according to the common saying of <hi>Imperatori seu Regi aliquid at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testanti
plenè creditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this <hi>Teste</hi> of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> (as I may say with allusion to the
words in our Writs of <hi>teste me ipso</hi>) that will be the <hi>Clew</hi> to the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
to guide them in that dark and intricate Labyrinth of time, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
spoke of: and will probably be helpful to any <hi>ingenious</hi> Protestants or
Papists who shall write its <hi>History,</hi> when they shall from the many <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections</hi>
of the <hi>Pamphlets</hi> relating to that time treasured up by the curious,
see so many bold and contradictory <hi>Shamms</hi> and <hi>Affidavits</hi> fighting with
each other for that belief in a Future Conjuncture, that they could not
obtain in the past: and 'tis nothing but the declared <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that in such <hi>odiosa materia,</hi> will qualifie a judicious Historian to do
<hi>right</hi> to himself or his <hi>Reader,</hi> or even to his History, and keep it from
being thrust down among <hi>Narratives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be rationally supposed that when <hi>Princes</hi> and their <hi>Ministers</hi> do
think fit to notifie their judgments of some matter of Fact wherein they
might receive the first Information from Persons lyable to exception, that
there were many concurrent Circumstances lay in the <hi>Balance</hi> before
them: and which perhaps they might not think convenient to divulge:
and moreover it is a thing commonly observable, that Divine Providence
doth influence the understandings of <hi>Princes</hi> (who are its instruments
in the Government of the World) more signally than of other men,
and that Crowned Heads are still blessed in some measure as of old <hi>by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Spirit coming on them,</hi> than what animated them while private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and that therefore their asserting of <hi>Facts</hi> of <hi>State</hi> is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
than that of other men.</p>
            <p>I therefore in the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>shamm</hi> of throwing the <hi>Odium</hi> of a Plot
upon <hi>Protestants</hi> in one particular Conjuncture, have not come short of
or gone beyond the Measures of the Government: nor do I believe that
any Historian of it will.</p>
            <p>And when I did read the various <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and did confer Notes with
some of the <hi>Curious</hi> about the last mentioned <hi>Shamm,</hi> and participated
with the Loyal Protestants in their Concern and Sollicitude for the honour
of their Religion thereby attacqued, yet I gave no <hi>Rule</hi> about the <hi>Merits</hi>
of the matter in my private thoughts, till I saw in the <hi>Prints</hi> the Copy
of the Order of <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 2d, 1679. reflecting on the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

               </gap>d in my thoughts with the many Loyal Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
and Papists who judged another <hi>Effort,</hi> that pretended to be of
the same Nature with the former, and referred to a Plot of Protestants,
to be a poor vile <hi>Artifice</hi> or <hi>Shamm,</hi> projected by some Calumnious <hi>Anti-Papists,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:13"/>
a shamm too despicable to be here named, and obvious enough
to <hi>detection</hi> from the <hi>Trite</hi> saying, <hi>That they who can hide can find.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the many pitiful <hi>Shamms,</hi> whose humming noise did a while please
our <hi>Mobile,</hi> and were below the notice of the Government, have had
their <hi>triduum insecti,</hi> and are not to expect to live in <hi>Story,</hi> or to be there
Entombed like the <hi>Fly</hi> in Amber.</p>
            <p>The powerful Effects of the Royal <hi>Declaration,</hi> freeing our Land from
the Plague of Fears and Jealousies and the Annoyance of the <hi>Swarms</hi> of
these <hi>Flies,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> his intercession prevailed to deliver a Realm from the
Judgments of other ones, will be a more adequate Subject to a great
Writers thoughts, and especially when he shall consider that in the Course
of Nature and without Miracle, those great Effects could not but
rise from so great an Efficient: and as to which any one will perhaps be
of opinion with me, who shall consider that the most <hi>terrible</hi> of <hi>terribles</hi>
in so many mens apprehension of <hi>Popery</hi> is its <hi>arbitrariness:</hi> and that
therefore the publication of the Royal Resolution to govern according to
the Laws would effectually secure us against all <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Hobbs saith <hi>in his</hi> Behemoth, I confess I know very few Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
among Christians of Points necessary to Salvation. They are the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
of Authority and Power over the Church or of Profit, or of Honour
to Church-men, that for the most part raise all the Controversy. For what man
is he that will trouble himself or fall out with his Neighbours for the saving
of my Soul, or the saving of the Soul of any other than himself?</p>
            <p>And no doubt it is not barely any mens believing the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi>
or <hi>Trasubstantiation,</hi> or <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Works of Super-Errogation,</hi> that
hath made the past ferment among us, but the Arbitrariness of the Papal
Power and the Complication of the <hi>Tenet</hi> of the Plenitude of that Power
with those Religionary Tenets, and the making of it Penal not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
those or other Tenets from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the making men Tenants
<hi>in capite,</hi> to a Foreign Head for their Brains and Estates, and an outland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Bishop, who lives a Thousand Miles off, with new <hi>Non obstantes</hi> outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their old Laws, and whom they can never see blush after it.
But his Majesty having declared, <hi>That he would use his Royal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
both in and out of Parliaments to Extirpate Popery,</hi> (of which
its Arbitrariness was its great dreaded part) <hi>and in all things to Govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of the Realm,</hi> the People knew that the <hi>Laws</hi> had
sufficiently provided against <hi>Appeals to Rome,</hi> as well as against <hi>Appeals
from the Country to the City,</hi> and that <hi>Declaration</hi> naturally fortified the
minds of the People as a <hi>Praemunimentum,</hi> guarding them before hand (as
I may say with allusion to our <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Praemunire</hi>) against the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power either of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> and did in effect set up an <hi>Ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
Office</hi> in each of his Majestie's <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> to secure them
against Arbitrary Power <hi>as such</hi> in whomsoever, and that they might in
<hi>in utramvis aurem dormire</hi> as to any danger from the same; and 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no wonder that the <hi>Reflux</hi> of People from the <hi>Metropolis</hi> to the
Country ensued thereupon, as I have remarked out of the <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:</hi>
and from which <hi>Bills</hi> perhaps we may divert our selves with the
sight of the <hi>Burial</hi> of that <hi>Plot,</hi> which some feared and others hoped
would have been <hi>immortal,</hi> who would have had it <hi>Entailed</hi> too on their
<hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> tho they would not allow the <hi>Crown</hi> to be so to the
<hi>Royal</hi> Line.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:14"/>
The <hi>Political</hi> uses that the <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> may be put to, being
more <hi>various</hi> than the profound <hi>Observator</hi> on them took the pains to
mention, as I have thence, by a <hi>glancing</hi> view of the gradual Encrease of
the People, coming out of the Country for several years, to dwell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Compass of those Bills, and likewise of the gradual decrease thence
deduced, given an account of what I thought might in some measure
deserve the name of an <hi>Indication</hi> of the diminution of the popular fears
resulting from the <hi>Burials,</hi> after the great <hi>auspicious</hi> year of the Royal
<hi>Declaration,</hi> so I could, in order to the <hi>lessening</hi> of the fears of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of <hi>Dissentership</hi> within the Circuit of those <hi>Bills,</hi> from the <hi>Total</hi>
of the <hi>Christenings</hi> in the respective <hi>years</hi> since that of 81, give what I
might without Vanity call more than <hi>Indicium,</hi> and which perhaps
would be by Critical Persons allowed for somewhat like a <hi>Demonstration</hi>
of the Encrease of the Numbers there, (as I may say) <hi>born</hi> into the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to what <hi>proportion,</hi> and that very particularly:
and make it out thence that above the proportion between the <hi>Burials</hi>
and <hi>Christenings</hi> that was in the <hi>Year</hi> 81, there were <hi>Christened</hi> 1084 in
the <hi>year</hi> 82, and that the disposition of People for baptizing their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the way of the Church of <hi>England</hi> did encrease near a 13th <hi>part,</hi>
in the year 82, and that above the <hi>proportion</hi> between the <hi>Burials</hi> and
<hi>Christenings</hi> that was in the year 82, there were in the year 83 Christen'd
2146, which is near a 6th <hi>part,</hi> that the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of Children in the
way of the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath gained, and Dissentership hath lost
ground in that year.</p>
            <p>Nor do I find cause to alter my opinion of such baptizing in the way of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having lost, but rather, on the contrary, gained
ground in this year 84, tho to what proportion I cannot positively judge,
by reason of what I before hinted, namely, of the extraordinary propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Burials</hi> this year, arising from the <hi>Accidents</hi> of the great
<hi>Frost,</hi> and which <hi>Physicians</hi> by comparing the encrease of the particular
Diseases by which so many died this year more than in the former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
from those Accidents, have judged to be considerably above 3000,
and likewise by reason of the <hi>Births</hi> having this year been <hi>reverâ</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
fewer, according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Observator</hi> on those <hi>Bills,
That the more sickly the year is, it is the less fertile of Births.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All who have been in the least conversant with those <hi>Observations</hi> of
his, know that the <hi>Births</hi> in ordinary years are equal to the <hi>Burials,</hi> or
rather more: and I have observed the same from the <hi>Paris</hi> Bills, where
the <hi>Christenings</hi> do generally much exceed the <hi>Burials</hi> (and as particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeared by the <hi>Total</hi> of the <hi>Burials</hi> in the year 1683 being 17764,
and the <hi>Total</hi> of the <hi>Christenings</hi> being 19717) but by the <hi>Christenings</hi>
among us <hi>registred</hi> and <hi>reckoned</hi> in our <hi>Bills,</hi> we know thence when the
disposition of the People to baptize their Children in the way of the
Church began to encrease, and Dissentership consequently to decrease;
and accordingly the ground gained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and lost
by Dissentership within the Compass of those Bills, after the year 81,
hath been by me sufficiently proved, <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> given somewhat like a little <hi>Historical</hi> Account
of the <hi>Numbers</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi> since the <hi>Reformation</hi> to our late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctures,
and have with honour mentioned the Vigilance of his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's</hi>
late <hi>Minister,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> in directing a <hi>Survey</hi> of the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
of the People of several Religionary Perswasions in the Province
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and which was returned in the year 76, and whereby
<pb facs="tcp:103047:14"/>
the Comparative Paucity of the number of Papists there is apparent, as it
is by themselves agreed on so to be, as I have cited out of the <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho the Copy of that <hi>Survey</hi> is in the hands of so many Persons,
I would not have mentioned any thing thereof as to the Number of the
Papists, but that Dr. <hi>Glanvill</hi> had first published the same, and whose <hi>Book</hi>
I have referred to for the same. Nor shall I therefore give any particular
account of the numbers of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> resulting from the same.</p>
            <p>But tho I think that the Number of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
perhaps in that <hi>Survey,</hi> so justly and near the matter as was that
of the Papists, yet I am fully of opinion that if the number of <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
were thrice as great as that returned (which I believe no
man will reckon it to be) their proportion with that of the <hi>Total</hi> of
this great Populous Nation would be very inconsiderable.</p>
            <p>But as to all the Writers or Discoursers of their proportion to that <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
that I have conversed with, (and who have rendered the <hi>Quota</hi> of
the <hi>Dissenters</hi> so vast with much positiveness) I am able to say, That
I have easily perswaded them to desist from any positive magisterial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
therein, by shewing them that their measures of the <hi>Total</hi> of
the People of <hi>England</hi> have been but conjectural, and depending perhaps
on some Calculations too fine and subtle, or others too course and gross,
and that no man can be a competent Judge of this <hi>Total,</hi> who hath not
seen the <hi>Returns</hi> on the Bishops <hi>Survey,</hi> and likewise the <hi>Returns</hi> on the
late <hi>Pole-Bills,</hi> and of which latter under the Patronage of a powerful
Minister of the Kings, I obtained Copies, and have thence in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Discourse</hi> shewed the <hi>Total</hi> of the People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> to
be probably much greater than any cautious <hi>Calculators</hi> have made it,
and some whereof made the <hi>Total</hi> to be 5, others 6, others 7 <hi>Millions.</hi>
I thought the doing of this an acceptable service to my Prince and
Country, and the rather for that several <hi>Authors</hi> among the <hi>Magna nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
have published it in Print, that the People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> are
but 2 <hi>Millions:</hi> and which number if they did not exceed, we might
allow our Dissenters a considerable proportion therein, tho yet nothing
near so great even as to such a <hi>Total</hi> as some would have it.</p>
            <p>But the Ebb of their Numbers is at this time so apparent, if we respect
the State of them in the whole Kingdom, that their Out-cry of <hi>Implevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
omnia,</hi> and <hi>The Nation and its Trade cannot subsist without us,</hi> is very
ridiculous: and they are not in my opinion their friends who writing for
them do so customarily magnify their Numbers, and as if they were half
the People of <hi>England,</hi> as some have done: and I believe the Gentleman
whom I have cited for saying in a late <hi>Parliament,</hi> that he observed,
<hi>That in the Choice of Knights of the Shire for the County he lived in,
that they could not bring one in twenty to the Field,</hi> would if he had been
at <hi>Elections</hi> in some other Counties have found they could not there bring
in so great a number.</p>
            <p>And tho the <hi>Puritans</hi> of old were very numerous in the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and our <hi>Dissenters</hi> in the King's long <hi>Parliament</hi> made so great a
Figure as to be able by their weight to crush the <hi>Declaration</hi> for <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
yet in the succeeding <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> the <hi>Dissenters</hi> were far
from valuing themselves an their weight or numbers: but of the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
in that Loyal Long Parliament, I believe there were not any who
wished for the Yoke of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or thought its Platform practicable
in this Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:15"/>
I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> mentioned one thing, that made the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines after 41, think their bringing of the <hi>Yoke</hi> of
Presbytery upon the <hi>English</hi> Necks practicable, and that is, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
according to the <hi>Pacta conventa</hi> between Them and the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
they should have the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> Lands settled
on their <hi>Church,</hi> whereby their <hi>Discipline</hi> how defective soever in weight
as to Principles of <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> would have made it self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
by its <hi>Balance</hi> of Land: and 'tis probable, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> the
<hi>Livings</hi> of the inferiour <hi>Clergy</hi> weighing more in value than the Estates
or Livelihoods of the ordinary inferiour <hi>Layety,</hi> hath supported that
<hi>Clergy</hi> there in their pretences to expect somewhat of <hi>Power,</hi> and which
they yet enjoy in the Figure of the Church Government there Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under <hi>Bishops:</hi> and altho King <hi>Iames</hi> in his planting so many <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices</hi>
throughout that Kingdom, worth 30 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> with a <hi>House</hi>
and some <hi>Glebe Land</hi> belonging to them, never intended any advantage
to <hi>Presbytery</hi> thereby; he yet occasioned some by making so many <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
there more considerable in wealth: but our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines
here having been so fatally disappointed about the <hi>Bishops Lands</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, all ingenious men must necessarily thereby be made apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
that they are never to hope to bring the terror of that Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
upon us by that means.</p>
            <p>It is moreover observable that most of the Race of our old <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
and <hi>Independant</hi> Divines having been extinct, (some few of whom were
Learned Men and gave some Ornament to their <hi>Tenets</hi> by their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
scarce any new ones, and who appeared not in the Church before
the King's Restoration, have since by the publication of any Theological
or DevotionalWritings propp'd up the Credit of their Party, and that
of the Ecclesiasticks of those perswasions none have published any thing
valuable against Popery but some of their <hi>old</hi> stock.</p>
            <p>Tho some <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have not hitherto learned that Modesty and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
from the <hi>Papists,</hi> as to leave off their unjust <hi>valuing</hi> themselves on
their <hi>Numbers,</hi> yet as I know not of any number of Gentlemen that
would choose to live in any Parish in <hi>England</hi> under the severity of that
Church Government, and who would not rather desire to be <hi>extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
from their <hi>Native</hi> Country than to live in it with Presbytery Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,
so neither do I believe, that Presbytery would be endured by
many of our illiterate Mechanicks now more than heretofore, if they
were taught its rigour.</p>
            <p>And tho likewise another Sect of <hi>Dissenters</hi> more Gentlemanly than
that of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> I mean the <hi>Independants,</hi> do in the little <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets</hi>
they write, trouble us much with <hi>proclaiming</hi> their Numbers, and
as if they were not only the sober but the major part of the <hi>Nation,</hi> they
are very ridiculous in trying to make themselves that way dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what is in Fact true.</p>
            <p>I believe that the number of those who in the late times listed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the particular <hi>gathered</hi> Churches, and subjected themselves to
their Laws, and Contribution to their Pastorage, was always inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and as an Argument, of that 'tis in this <hi>Discourse</hi> mentioned that
the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the most Opulent of those Churches in <hi>London</hi> did most
readily quit their Posts, when they could obtain <hi>Head-ships</hi> of <hi>Colleges,</hi>
and that in a Conjuncture when <hi>Independancy</hi> was in a manner the form
of Church Government owned by the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:15"/>
These Churches were always very few in the Country and are now
fewer and scarce visible, unless we will call the Bands of <hi>Quakers</hi> by the
name of Churches, and a name I do not hear they think fit to use.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion that under the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

long gained ground, and still do so.</p>
            <p>There was in <hi>London</hi> an Independant Church under <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Mr. <hi>Biddell</hi> was their <hi>Pastor,</hi> and among other <hi>Tenets</hi> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable

saving Faith;</hi> and That <hi>Christ rose again only by the Power of the Father and
not his own; and That justifying Faith is not the pure gift of God, but may be
acquired by mens natural Abilities;</hi> and That <hi>Faith cannot believe any
thing contrary</hi> to, or above reason; and That <hi>there is no Original Sin; and
That Christ hath not the same body now in glory in which he suffered and
rose again;</hi> and That <hi>the Saints shall not have the same body in Heaven
that they had on Earth; and That Christ was not Lord or King before his
Resurrection, or Priest before his Ascension; and That the Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Tenets</hi> as these, which are far from being <hi>de lanâ caprinâ,</hi> and
are contrary to the <hi>Articles</hi> of our Church may not be extirpated: tho
yet I believe there will never be any <hi>Fermentation</hi> in our Church or State
produced here by them, if in course of time any of them should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of any of our Princes: and much less that any

            <p>There was likewise in our <hi>Metropolis</hi> another <hi>Independant</hi> Church,

ferment the State, yet the opinions of men equally pious and learned will
in all likelihood be always different about the same: and as to these <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi>
the <hi>Questions</hi> are not such as are called <hi>Questiones Domitianae,</hi> or of
catching of Flies.</p>
            <p>But there is a sort of <hi>Questions</hi> that is little better, and that in our busie
World will not usurp the time they have done, and that is, such as are of the
Nature of that I have spoke of toward the Close of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> that
made the <hi>fermentation</hi> in a Church of <hi>Separatists</hi> that went hence to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi>
namely, <hi>Whether</hi> Aron's <hi>Ephod were blew or Sea-green:</hi> and tho
I have asserted it That mens liberty of professing Religionary Tenets may
be reckoned as a part of their Purchace by <hi>Christ</hi>'s Blood; yet methinks
to make the Son of God leave the Bosom of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

standing at the Creed, or bowing at the name of Iesus, or of placing the
Communion Table in the East, or of wearing Surplices, Tippets, Lawn-sleeves
or square Caps, or of keeping of Holy-days, or singing Psalms to Organs,</hi>
and to resolve the World in some plain points, as namely, <hi>Whether the
Soveraign Power may not lawfully enjoyn the observance of the external
Circumstances of Divine Worship, which every man doth in his own Family?</hi>
or <hi>Whether it be not as lawful for the Sovereign Power to enjoyn kneeling at
the Sacrament, as 'tis for private Persons to command their Flocks not to

plain that another mans conceived, or</hi> extempore <hi>Prayer is as much a form to
me or to another as any printed Prayer can be?</hi> or the resolving what
Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Lots,</hi> calls a frivolous <hi>Question</hi> as made by
some <hi>Separatists,</hi> viz. <hi>What Warrant have you to use this or that Form of
Prayer, or to pray upon a Book?</hi> (and to which he answers, That <hi>it is
Warrant sufficient that we are enjoyned to use Prayer, Confession of Sin, and
Supplication for Pardon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>No set Form thereof determined, therefore
any fit Form warrantable: this Form that we use not unfit otherwise, this
Form thereof allowable. And let a man demand of one of them when he
prayeth, what Warrant he hath to use that Form that he then useth, he can
answer no otherwise. So for a Book, the means of help are not determined:
and this one among others: this therefore not unwarrantable. And if one
of them should be asked how he proves it warrantable to use a printed Book
to read on at Church: he shall not be able to make other answer than as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>)
and further hereupon the resolving of another Question, <hi>viz.

neither, is able without premeditation to make as fit a Prayer for the People

Parallel with the Error of those old <hi>Poets,</hi> who would on all occasions
introduce <hi>Gods</hi> to end doubts that were never fit to be begun by men,
and wherein there was not <hi>dignus vindice nodus,</hi> and against which the

            <p>The holy <hi>Iesus</hi> by his Tacit Rejection of <hi>Questions</hi> as <hi>impertiment</hi> (that
the World thought of more moment than some such as are above named)
when he forbore to give his thoughts of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his <hi>pre-existence</hi> of
<hi>Souls</hi> upon the <hi>Question</hi> put to him, viz. <hi>Who did sin this Man or his Parents
that he was born blind?</hi> shewed he thought it not for his honour to have
it supposed that it was part of his Errand from Heaven to set the World
rightin Speculations of Philosophy; and so he threw that famous <hi>Notion</hi>
off as a <hi>Titivilitium.</hi>

in the <hi>Pharisees</hi> their use of Oaths, and thereby invocating God as a
Witness in the Occurrences of their common talk and Conversation,
saith, <hi>In re levi ne magnum quidem virum in testem vocare auderemus:</hi>
as I find him cited by Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Lots,</hi> and wherein he
doth so learnedly confute the superstitious conceit in some of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
of the use of <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice</hi> in recreation, as likewise the other
<pb facs="tcp:103047:16"/>
of mens being obliged to count every thing unlawful that they have not
a Scriptural Warrant for.</p>
            <p>Yet since his writing of those Books of <hi>Lots,</hi> thousands of such our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Protestants have not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crupled to throw the <hi>Dye</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and to
appeal to the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Hosts</hi> by the <hi>Decision</hi> of Battel to signalize the
truth in some of those nugatory and others of those <hi>plain</hi> points before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned:
and our Land groans under the guilt of the Blood of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of thousands of Subjects as well as of the Royal Blood, by <hi>Questions,</hi>
on which an ingenious man would scarce think a drop of Ink necessary
to be spent.</p>
            <p>But I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> express'd my belief, That the fierceness of
our <hi>Dissenters</hi> humour of quarrelling about such little <hi>Ceremonial</hi> matters
will be naturally reclaimed by the influence of the Civility appearing in
the many <hi>French</hi> Protestants here, into a <hi>Complaisance</hi> with our King's and
Church's enjoyned Ceremonies, that all the learned <hi>Books</hi> of our <hi>Divines</hi>
have not been able to work in them: the Civility of the <hi>French</hi> humour
making it natural to those Protestants (as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave remarked) not only
to comply with Princes but even their Fellow Subjects in the use of
all Ceremonies they expect: and as I have in many places of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and particularly in <hi>p.</hi> 239, expressed my thoughts that the <hi>sicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Principles of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> will naturally evaporate by fear and shame;
so I have in the following <hi>Page,</hi> that all Rebellious Principles of any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Protestants <hi>will by fear and shame in our populous</hi> English <hi>World be
abandoned:</hi> and do think, That to the <hi>shame</hi> of quarrelling about <hi>little</hi>
matters, the shame of doing it before <hi>Strangers,</hi> being super-added, will
prevent our future disquiet thereby.</p>
            <p>Let them ask those <hi>Protestants</hi> who are fled hither from Persecution
(the Circumstances of which are with great Judgment stated by Dr.
<hi>Hicks</hi> in his Excellent printed <hi>Sermon</hi> on that Subject) if in case their
great Monarch had excused them from Conformity to the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church
in the points of Praying in an unknown Tongue, and the Worshipping
the <hi>Host,</hi> and the Forbidding the Cup to the Layety, and the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
Religionary points controverted between Papists and Protestants,
and had enjoyned them only such things as our Religion by Law Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doth, whether they would have with the hazard of their lives made a
migration hither from the best Country in the World, their Native Soil,
or have made their Monarch and his Ministers at home uneasie by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of Persecution, and by raising of any dust about unnecessary <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi>
as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leo After</hi> tells us, that the Inhabitants of the <hi>Mountain Magnan</hi> on the
Frontiers of <hi>Fez,</hi> have not thought fit to be at the Charge of any settled
Judicature or <hi>Parade</hi> of the Law to support their <hi>Polity:</hi> but to the end
their Controversies emerging may be decided, and that impartially, they
stop some Travellers passing that way, to give Judgment in the same; and
that himself in his passage there was detained many days to perform the
Office of a Judge, and that his performance of the same was rewarded by
the Inhabitants, defraying the Charges of his Stay: and some of those
People were ashamed perhaps to trouble him, a Stranger with <hi>vilitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>querelles d' alleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus perhaps may those Protestant Strangers that Providence hath
sent hither prove to our Religionary branglers useful itinerant Judges, and
their patience in their Judicature will in my opinion deserve to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
and for the greatness of its burden from the minuteness of its
<pb facs="tcp:103047:17"/>
Controverted Causes, and whereby Strangers are imposed on by as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
trouble as <hi>Travellers</hi> would be if in the several Territories they passed
through, the Inhabitants should desire them to <hi>weigh</hi> their <hi>Air.</hi> But I
hope the Non-Conformists to the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church will find those to ours
ashamed to entertain them here with the <hi>Crambe</hi> of old Controversies of
Ceremonies and things Indifferent; and that those Strangers will not find
themselves invited hither by Nature as to a <hi>Theatre,</hi> where they shall
only see our <hi>digladiations</hi> with <hi>Air,</hi> or <hi>beating of the Air</hi> (as the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
Expression is) and much less where they shall see any Dissenters
<hi>implicitly</hi> swallowing the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Resistance,</hi> and weighing nothing
but <hi>Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was (I think) a little before the Migration of so many <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
here, that some of the <hi>Faex</hi> of our Dissenters were so shameful
as to Nick-name our Clergy: But I do account that the inquisitive and
Philosophical <hi>Temper</hi> of the Age, shining with so much lustre in our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Clergy</hi> (and which <hi>temper</hi> is as naturally accompanied with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
warmth of Charity for the Persons of different Opiners as light it self
can be with heat) is a sufficient <hi>Guarranty</hi> to all Protestant <hi>

their finding from our Church all the favour, I will not say that they have
deserved from it, but all that they will or can: and I believe the Charity of
our Church-men is so great for them as almost to tempt them to wish
That there were some <hi>dignus vindice nodus</hi> in the Religionary part of
<hi>Dissenters</hi> Principles, that might give our C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They have experimented this <hi>temper</hi> of our Divines in Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s

            <p>That great Adorner of the Church of <hi>England</hi> both with his Learning

to fill it with more Volumes against the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>

            <p>I have not mentioned this as if I thought that any of our excellent

From various grounds of natural reason, I may venture to predict

in any Prince as to the Religion by Law Established, rendring

of freedom of their Consciences, and depriving him of the Brains as well
as Bowels of a Man, and against impressions of trouble from what so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Writers have insinuated, namely, that a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Prince
must by virtue of the Authority of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council exterminate
his Heretical Subjects, I have in <hi>p.</hi> 283 mentioned that the <hi>Munster Peace</hi>

fears and jealousies as of their Religion and Property upon any Prince by
the Lineal Course of <hi>Descent</hi> coming to be their Ruler, who may profess
any Religionary <hi>Sentiments</hi> different from theirs.</p>
            <p>And because the <hi>factum</hi> of that Peace hath not by any Writers since our

<pb facs="tcp:103047:18"/>
of Peoples understandings in the firm Provision made there for mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
secure in their Religion by Law Established, whatever the Religion
of their lawful Princes may be, I shall here give some Cursory Account
of the great <hi>Fact</hi> of that Peace (and wherein some Popish Princes made
so great a Figure, and who sufficiently understood how far the <hi>Later an</hi>
Council obliged them) that may not only shew it a kind of Pedantry to
imagine that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Princes are still by their Religion bound,
after all the Revolutions of time and its incursions made on their former
measures as to Heterodox Religion and Religionaries, to use the same
Methods as formerly, and to move in the same Line as heretofore, (just as
some <hi>Crabs</hi> on the Land are observed in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> to be so sullen in
their way, that rather than they will move in the least on any side, they
will go over a House or a Tree) but may likewise serve as a <hi>Praemunimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
to secure men in all future times against the fear of any danger to their
Religion by the <hi>Heterodoxy</hi> of their <hi>Princes,</hi> a thing that may be expected
often to happen, since People can no more promise themselves that their
Princes will successively resemble one another in their understanding
faculties than in their bodily shapes.</p>
            <p>Thus then sufficiently for the purpose above mentioned the <hi>Reader</hi>
may take the <hi>Scheme</hi> of that matter.</p>
            <p>It may be observed that in <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nmark</hi> and in all the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the lower and upper <hi>Saxony</hi> where ever Protestants have the sole
power, no Papists are permitted to have any publick exercise of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
and that in <hi>Austria, Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> and all the Hereditary
Lands of the House of <hi>Austria, Bavaria</hi> and the upper Palatinate, where
the Papists have the sole Power, no Protestants are suffered to have the
publick Exercise of their Religion. And these whole Territories above
mentioned being entire bodies within themselves, under one head either
of the one or the other Religion, without the intermixture of different
Dominions, are uniform in the exercise of their Religion respectively
different.</p>
            <p>But the intermediate parts of the <hi>German</hi> Empire are interwoven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
several Princes of different Religions, and therefore are of mixt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary
professions: <hi>that is to say,</hi> those professions are exercised some
here, some there in different places: and because the Inhabitants of the
<hi>intermediate</hi> Territories being mixed and pretending to have each of them
a right to the same places of Worship, various Quarrels did arise among
them: therefore when they deprived one another of the freedom to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their <hi>Religion,</hi> the Treaty of Peace at <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Osnabrug</hi> in
the year 1648. did appoint the restitution of places for the publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Religion on both sides, and ordered that all matters of this kind
should be thence forward settled as they were in use heretofore in the
<hi>Year</hi> 1624: which Order occasioned a <hi>Deputation</hi> from all the <hi>States</hi> of
the <hi>Empire</hi> at <hi>Francford</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1656, and 1657 and following, to
see that Decree and other matters put in Execution.</p>
            <p>Those <hi>intermediate</hi> Territories are the Circles of <hi>Westphalia,</hi> of the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> of the <hi>Welterans,</hi> of <hi>Franconia,</hi> and of <hi>Suaben</hi> containing many
Principalities and great Cities, depending immediately upon the <hi>Empire,</hi>
which being of different Religions and mixed one with another, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their Territories and Jurisdictions, none that in the time of War
was prevalent, did suffer a different Religion to be exercised: but
since the Instrument of the Peace made at <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Osnabrug</hi> was
published, the liberty of Religion is to be regulated universally by the 7th
<pb facs="tcp:103047:18"/>
               <hi>Article<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and some other <hi>Articles</hi> determining matters between <hi>Protestants</hi>
and <hi>Papists:</hi> and according to this <hi>Constitution</hi> altho some Territories,
which formerly were under Protestant Divines, are now under a Popish
power, and <hi>vice versâ,</hi> yet the liberty of Religion is to be left to each Party
as it was used in the year 1624.</p>
            <p>Thus the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> and one of the <hi>Landgraves</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and
a Prince of <hi>Nassaw</hi> are obliged to leave to the <hi>Protestants</hi> within their
Dominions, the free exercise of their Religion. And so in some of the
<hi>Imperial</hi> Cities, as in <hi>Francford, Ausburg</hi> and others, the Papists have
the free exercise of their Religion restored to them among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Ausburg</hi> the Magistracy is half of the one and half of the other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
but in all the other Imperial Cities the Magistrates (I think)
were wholly Protestants, except at <hi>Collen</hi> and <hi>Heilbron</hi> where they are
wholly Papists.</p>
            <p>If any one considering the sharper Animosities between <hi>Lutherans</hi> and
<hi>Calvinists,</hi> then those between either of them and the <hi>Papists</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

shall tell me, That if the Treaty of <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Osnabrug</hi> did plant Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
among <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> as to the Persons and Religions of
each other, it did wonders, I shall therein accord with him, and that it
was somewhat like that of the pulling down the <hi>Partition-wall</hi> between
<hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> and that tho <hi>Luther</hi> a more Cholerick yet (I think)
a better natured man than <hi>Calvin,</hi> did sufficiently in his Writings inveigh
against the asperity of Magistrates in punishing Heterodoxy (and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

for their Sick or Infants or Women with Child to stay for the
Clemency of better weather; and whereby many of them there died
with the extremity of the cold in their Journeys. And it had been in a

Law, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Calvinists</hi> shall have the same right for the free exercise of
their Religion which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> have, <hi>and that to the end
that any might be ashamed of pretending to be afraid of any detriment
that might accrue to their Persons or Religion, under a</hi> Lutheran <hi>or</hi>
Calvinian <hi>or</hi> Popish <hi>Successor, and that all might be really afraid of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring
God and wounding their Consciences, by prejudicing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable
Rights of those Princes Successions, it is thus further determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the 7th</hi> Article <hi>of the</hi> Instrumentum pacis Caesareo suecicum, <hi>§. 1.
viz.</hi> Vnanimi quoque Caesareae majestatis omniumque ordinum consensu, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
'Tis likewise thought fit by the unanimous Consent of the Emperor and all the
States of the Empire, that whatever right or benefit both all the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Empire, and the Peace of Religion, and this publick agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the decision of all Grievances therein do allow to all Catholick
States and Subjects, and to those addicted to the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession, the
same shall likewise be allowed to those that are called the Reformed, (<hi>i. e.
Calvinists</hi>) with a Salvo to the States called Protestants (<hi>i. e. Lutherans</hi>)
as to all things Covenanted and agreed between themselves with their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and as to all Privileges and other dispositions whereby Provision was
made for Religion and its exercise and the things thereon depending, by the
States and Subjects of each place, and with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to each for the freedom of
their Consciences. Now because the Controversies of Religion which are in
Agitation at this time among the forenamed Protestants have not been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
reconciled, but have been referred to a further endeavour of agreement,
so that they still make two Parties: therefore concerning the right of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is thus agreed between them: that if any Prince or other Lord of the
Territory or Patron of any Church shall hereafter change his Religion, or
obtain or recover a Principality or Dominion either by the right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
or by virtue of this present Treaty, or by any other Title whatsover;
where the publick exercise of the Religion of the other Party is at present in
use, it shall be free to him to have his Court-Chaplains of his own Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him in the place of his Residence, without any burthen or prejudice to his
Subjects: but it shall not be lawful for him to change the publick Exercise of
Religion or the Laws, or Ecclesiastical Constitutions which have been there
hitherto in use, or take from those their Churches whose they formerly were,
or their Schools or Hospitals, or the Revenues, Pensions and Stipends belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto, or apply them to the men of their own Religion, or obtrude on
their Subjects men of another Religion, under the pretence of a Territorial
Episcopal or Patronal Right, or under any pretence whatsoever, or bring
about any other hinderance directly or indirectly to the Religion of the other
Party, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, here hath been a great <hi>Pacification,</hi> and the same agreed on
to be a perpetual Law, and <hi>pragmatick Sanction,</hi> and as strongly binding
as any Fundamental Law or Constitution thereof, comprhending in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> all his Confederates and Adherents, first the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
King and House of <hi>Austria</hi> the Electors and Princes of the Empire,

Well: but yet it may be by our timid Protestants objected; that all

referred to, but reckon without their <hi>Host,</hi> I mean the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that one <hi>Bull</hi> against it from <hi>Rome</hi> would thunder it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and render it voidable or void, and that all the Concessions to
<hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and hindring their <hi>Extermination</hi> were nugatory,
and that such a written <hi>Treaty</hi> carried in it, its own <hi>deletion</hi> and that of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and that the <hi>Bulla Caenae</hi> every <hi>Maundy Thursday</hi> Excommunicates

this Peace as likewise <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Territories,</hi> and the Erecting of <hi>Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi>
into Secular <hi>Principalities,</hi> and settling them on Heretical Princes
and their Heirs forever, whereby so much prejudice accrued to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Religion and the Apostolick Sea, would probably engage the
Pope some time or other to quash it as null, and to damn both the Peace
and all that made it.</p>
            <p>I answer, that within two days after the signing that Peace, the Popes
<hi>Nuntio</hi> at <hi>Munster</hi> protested against it: declaring that he made that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi>
by the Pope's express Commands: and on the 26th of <hi>November</hi>
1648, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 10th issued out his <hi>Bull</hi> against it from <hi>Rome</hi>
called, <hi>Sanctissimi Domini nostri Inn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therein blames the <hi>Emperor</hi> and his Confederates and the most Christian
King, on the account of the perpetual abdication of some Ecclesiastical
Goods and Rights possessed by Hereticks, and for their permitting to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
the free exercise of their Religion by that Peace, and their being
further Authorized by it to bear <hi>Offices</hi> and enjoy not only Church Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings

            </p>
            <p>But what did this <hi>Declaration</hi> from his Holyness signify in that Case?
No more than one from <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> would have done. The Emperor
and Princes of <hi>Germa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> did gloriously stand to their <hi>Pacta conventa,</hi> and
took care to see the same solemnly ratified and executed notwithstanding
the Papal <hi>Declaration</hi> of their <hi>Nullity.</hi> They knew the Pope's <hi>Nuntio</hi>
would soon protest, and the Pope himself declare against the Peace:
and had therefore in <hi>Terms</hi> therein agreed, <hi>That no Canons or special De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Councils or Concordats with Popes or Protestations, or Edicts, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts,
Mandates or Absolutions whatsoever should in any Future time be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
against any Article of it.</hi> And they likewise knew that the Pope's
<hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Nullity</hi> of that Treaty would contain no Threatnings
of <hi>Excommunication</hi> or <hi>Damnation</hi> against their Persons, but only <hi>Quelques
choses</hi> or <hi>things of Course,</hi> or to speak more properly <hi>Nullities</hi> of Course:
and that while all Christendom was embarqued in that Treaty and going
with full Sail, and favoured with a strong Gale of Nature into its Haven
of Rest, and being to pass by the Popes Fort, and had resolved against
lowering their <hi>Flag</hi> to it, the Pope would of Course fire some <hi>Bulls</hi> of
<hi>Nullity</hi> at them Charged with no significant <hi>Shot,</hi> and as it is usual for
the Forts of Princes to do to Ships that pass by them without paying the
expected Civility, and the Shot from which is not valued by Capital
<pb facs="tcp:103047:20"/>
Ships that pass by them with a strong Gale of Wind: and which perhaps
think it not <hi>tanti</hi> to fire again upon the Fort; nor doth that perhaps
throw away more shot on them.</p>
            <p>And thus stood this <hi>Munster</hi> Peace, wrought (as it were) by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Crowned Heads and States of Christendom, and thus it stands;
and any who will look into the <hi>Empire</hi> will find those <hi>Pacta con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venta</hi>
as to the part of the Emperor and Princes of the Empire outbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the chances of time to this year (how much soever the Emperor
may be supposed to have been steer'd by <hi>Iesuites</hi> Councils) and likely
still so to do, whereby the various Rights and Religions of <hi>Princes</hi> and
their Subjects have been secured, and whereby we may see how <hi>unstudied</hi>
those men are in the great Book of the World, who think that Popish
Princes will not go on in the Course of their Politicks, tho the Pope
should seem in earnest or in jest to stop them, and that they cannot tacitly
reject the Papal Declarations of Nullity, and yet continue Civil to the
<hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firm continuance of the <hi>Munster</hi> Peace to the year 1680, is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the <hi>Author</hi> of an ingenious Book called, <hi>The Interest of Princes
and States</hi> that year published, and which goeth under the name of Mr.
<hi>Bethel,</hi> and where 'tis moreover observed in p. 155. <hi>That among the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
Princes the Prince of</hi> Hannover <hi>was lately turned Papist, and likewise one
of the House of the Landgrave of</hi> Hessen, Darmestat <hi>and another of</hi> Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburg
<hi>lately turned Papist, but their Countries do all continue Lutherans,
and among the Calvinist Princes</hi> he mentions the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
but saith, <hi>his Dominions are most Lutherans,</hi> and where in <hi>p.</hi> 156. 'tis his
Observation that of <hi>four Popish Princes of the Empire, all their Countries
are Lutherans,</hi> and saith, <hi>the Princes in this Country</hi> (meaning <hi>Germany)
have no great influence on their Subjects in point of Religion:</hi> and saith,
That <hi>in several Countries belonging to Popish Bishops and Abbots, many Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans
and some Calvinists have not only a Right, but do also actually enjoy
the publick exercise of their several Religions without disturbance, and much
more without Persecution:</hi> and further instanceth in other places in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
where the Proprietors are mixt of several <hi>Princes, Earls, Free Cities,</hi>
and <hi>Romish Ecclesiasticks which causeth in each of them the like Variety in
Religion, and some there being Lutherans and Papists and others being Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,
Lutherans and Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we see instead of the Popes having nulled the <hi>Munster</hi> Peace
<hi>cum effectu,</hi> the <hi>Nulla fides servanda cum haereticis,</hi> hath been nulled in
<hi>Germany</hi> by Popish Princes, and which if they had not done, <hi>Luthers</hi>
aforesaid <hi>nulli estis</hi> had been their <hi>doom:</hi> and the Empire it self had scarce
been more than a <hi>substantial Nullity,</hi> as I may say alluding to what <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
in his Book, <hi>De Nullitatibus</hi> makes such. In plain terms the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had not else been now a <hi>Nation,</hi> nor would the <hi>Emperor</hi> again have
been saluted by the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> as I have in some of the Comminato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Letters</hi> from the <hi>Port</hi> observed him called, <hi>viz. Lord of few Regions:</hi>
and this any one (I think) will grant who shall consider that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
he hath had either of intestine troubles or Foreign between the
years 1648 and 1680, hath made his Circumstances as to Power and
Riches appear but just proportionable for holding his own (with the help
of his Neighbours) against the <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have observed great right done to the <hi>Emperors</hi> Politicks in that

Peace, and wherein he saith, That <hi>the Emperor preserved thereby at least
the lives of eleven times a hundred and ninety two thousand Myriades of

whereupon the <hi>Panegyrist</hi> pronounceth, <hi>That the World was blest by a

for that purpose being very memorable, I shall here set down, <hi>viz. Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nande

and Emperors,</hi> (as I have in <hi>p.</hi> 68 mentioned out of <hi>Erastus</hi> and suitably
enough to <hi>Historical</hi> truth) to have been valuable to the Empire at but
half of 80 <hi>l.</hi> each, it may well be supposed that it was a very vast Treasure
that <hi>Germany</hi> hath lost by its Wars and preserved by its said Peace.</p>
            <p>Yet is there one way assignable from which it may be deduced that
the value of what the Emperor preserved was as much really too short,
as from the Panegyrists account it appeared extravagant; and that is this,
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Emperor</hi> by that Peace having kept so many from afterward
destroying their own Souls by destroying others Bodies, may be truly said
to have preserved what was invaluable, we know who having judged it
that there is no <hi>proportion</hi> between the wealth of the whole World and
one Soul.</p>
            <p>And now having by the deduction of the great <hi>Fact</hi> proved the <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableness</hi>
of the happy continuance of the luscious blessings of Peace and
Unity of affections among Princes and their Subjects of different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I shall here in the <hi>Close</hi> of the Consideration of the same, entertain
the <hi>Reader</hi> with this last pleasant agreeable <hi>Scene</hi> of it, which <hi>Scene</hi> will
represent to him the fair Church built at <hi>Fredericsburg</hi> by the present
<hi>Prince Elector,</hi> one of the fairest Churches in <hi>Germany:</hi> and which was
by him in our great year of fears and jealou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies and fatal discords, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
1680, finished and dedicated to <hi>Holy Concord</hi> and <hi>Vnion</hi> perhaps in
Contra-distinction to the Term of <hi>Holy Church:</hi> and its Dedication and
Consecration was with great <hi>Devotion</hi> solemnized, and not without the
choicest <hi>Vocal</hi> and <hi>Instrumental Musick</hi> that could be thought proper to
be used then, and with which the Offices of the <hi>Ceremony</hi> began: and
<pb facs="tcp:103047:21"/>
the <hi>Musick</hi> being over, there was an inaugural Oration there made in the
honour of <hi>Holy Concord,</hi> and of the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the Church to it.
And after that, the Prince Elector (who is a <hi>Calvinist</hi>) engaged Doctor
<hi>Fabritius</hi> Principal <hi>Divine</hi> to his <hi>Electoral</hi> Highness, to preach there;
and in the <hi>Afternoon</hi> of that day another <hi>Sermon</hi> was there Preach'd by a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Divine, and in the <hi>Evening,</hi> another <hi>Sermon</hi> was there made by a
<hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Divine: and they all made pious and learned <hi>Sermons</hi> in
order to the propagating of <hi>Holy Concord,</hi> applauding therein the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
design, and with a most devout attention all those three <hi>Divines</hi>
were present at each others <hi>Sermons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was any of his Popish Subjects then afraid that he would infringe
the rights of the exercise of their Religion, because the <hi>Papal</hi> Interest had
been so active in bereaving his Family of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Crown as well as of
its ancient Rights, many of which are forever abdicated from it by the
<hi>Munster</hi> Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>on this Rock</hi> of the <hi>Munster</hi> Peace was the <hi>Holy Concord</hi> of holy
Church-men discordant in opinions founded abroad by a <hi>Prince</hi> allied to
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and whereby the opposite Religionary <hi>Opinors</hi>
quitted their Antipathys against each other, and the Lion made under
his Government <hi>to lie down with the Lamb,</hi> at the same time that we
groaned under a judgment more opprobrious than that threatned to the
<hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> namely, <hi>The sending of wild Beasts among them,</hi> I mean
that of our <hi>Populace</hi> being frightened and worried with <hi>Chymaeras</hi> and with
<hi>Chymeric Ideas</hi> of all Popish Princes being bound to have the Council of
<hi>Lateran</hi> by <hi>heart,</hi> and to observe it <hi>semper &amp; ad semper,</hi> and without the
Latitude of <hi>Prudence</hi> which the very <hi>Definition</hi> of Moral <hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Essential</hi> to it (as I may say with allusion to <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>sicut vir prudens

forgot the Saying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> That <hi>in the multitude of the People is
the King's honour, and the want of people is the destruction of the Prince,</hi>
and with the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Heterodox <hi>Prince</hi> swearing to maintain the Laws
and yet breaking them, and with another <hi>Idea</hi> as horrid and monstrous,
namely, that men might observe their Oaths acknowledging <hi>Allegiance</hi>
to Kings and their Heirs and Successors, and yet exclude their <hi>Heirs</hi> and
<hi>Successors</hi> from the Throne by a Law.</p>
            <p>It was an Observation worthy of the <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and which
he inculcated to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> namely, that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
<hi>of this World passeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> mentioned that in the year 1212, the <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council brought in <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> as an Article of Faith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
Princes were to be compelled to <hi>exterminate</hi> Hereticks: but the
World hath been often <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> since that time, and its substance
that the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls its fashion hath been ever in <hi>transitu:</hi> and the fashion
of that <hi>Lateran</hi> Council is so far <hi>passed away</hi> that Protestant Writers are
somewhat put to it to prove it to have been a <hi>General one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a scurvy fashion long since in the World abroad, and that
was the fashion of mens sowing a piece of red Cloth on their Garments,
when the Monks had Preached them into <hi>Crusados,</hi> for the <hi>Exterminium
haereticorum,</hi> and by Virtue of one of which <hi>Crusado's Bellarmine</hi> boasts
that 100,000 of the <hi>Albingenses</hi> were slain; but that fashion hath been
long left off in the World, and the World been since no more outraged
by it than by the <hi>Fraternity</hi> of the <hi>Rosy Cross,</hi> nor so much as our <hi>English</hi>
World hath been by some who have troubled it about the <hi>sign of the Cross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:21"/>
It was a saying of the old <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and the Papal World is as to many of its <hi>Politicks quite another thing</hi>
from what it was. <hi>Azorius</hi> in his <hi>Instit. Moral.</hi> observed in his time, <hi>That
it falls out often that that which was not the common opinion a few years ago,
now is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of our <hi>timid</hi> Protestants who do not know the <hi>Papal, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
and <hi>Calvinian</hi> World, because they see it not in the <hi>Antique</hi> fashion
they heard it was dressed in 30 or 40 or 50 years ago, seem to have been
asleep since the <hi>Munster</hi> Treaty, and to have dreamed that such fashion
would never alter, and are like <hi>Epeminides</hi> that the old <hi>Fables</hi> mention to
have fetched a sleep of fifty years, and who found himself lost in the
World at his wakening, wanting the sight of the old fashion to shew him
where he was.</p>
            <p>I have therefore a great Compassion for those Protestants who take
the measures of their Religion and Politicks in a manner only out of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> and who think that almost all the <hi>Predictions</hi> of that Book
were made only for <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> was made to be governed
only by their fancies, and their fancies to be given up only to fears of all
ill fashions of things and principles in the World being unalterable, tho
there be scarce a Chapter in that Sacred <hi>Book</hi> but what refers to Changes
and Revolutions, and to moving the unwieldy bulk of Empires by unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and irresistable Turns of Fate.</p>
            <p>The old <hi>Fashion</hi> of the Popish Writers asserting the Right of the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> to take away <hi>Hereticks</hi> lives by virtue of that Branch of the
<hi>Iudicial</hi> Law of the <hi>Iews, Deuteronomy</hi> 17th, hath been long extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by them. The words of the <hi>Text</hi> are thus agreeable to the old
Latin Translation, <hi>And he that out of Pride shall refuse to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of that Priest which shall at that time Minister before the Lord
thy God, that man shall by the Sentence of the Iudge be put to death:</hi> and
the <hi>Calvinistick</hi> Fashion of founding the practice of <hi>Hereticidium</hi> on the
Authority of the <hi>Iudicial</hi> Law is passed away. I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi>
represented the Tenet of firing Heretical Cities, that is in the <hi>Canon</hi> Law
founded on <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the 13th, to be chargeable on our late <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi>
and that justly on the account of their having declared the <hi>Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi>
Law obligatory to us: and have shewed what <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Principle and
Practice was pursuant to that Law.</p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Klockius</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Lawyer in his large Volume <hi>de Aera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio

            <p>I have been expressly cautious in the following <hi>Discourse</hi> to exempt the

and Seditious; and was a Concurrer with many loyal Persons after part
of it was written in thinking that time had untaught those <hi>Principles</hi> to
most of our present <hi>Non-Conformists:</hi> and notwithstanding the many
Seditious and Libellous <hi>Pamphlets</hi> published by some of them against the
Government both of Church and State, yet such was the continuance of
the Candor of the Kings Ministers to them, as that some at the Tryal of a
poor seditious <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestant at <hi>Oxford</hi> occasionally declared before
that wretch, <hi>We know of no Presbyterian Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as a <hi>Popish</hi> Ambassador sent to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began his <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
Speech wherein he was to complain of the <hi>Turks</hi> having unprovo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

            <p>And our famous <hi>Whitaker</hi> hath in his Controversies well resolved us
that these Fruits whereby false Prophets are to be distinguished from true,
are rather their <hi>Principles, Interpretations</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> than their <hi>Lives,</hi>
it being generally observed that the Founders of <hi>Sects</hi> are exemplary for

What the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> in King <hi>Iames</hi> his Reign
were, I have shewn in this <hi>Discourse,</hi> with a Remark on the Political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that after the <hi>aera</hi> of the <hi>Gun-powder Treason</hi> induced them
to give a <hi>Scheme</hi> thereof voluntarily to the Government, and namely,
that they might thereby avoid the receiving a <hi>Test</hi> from it: and no doubt
it was obvious to them that while their Principles were hid and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the State, the warding off of <hi>Faux</hi> his <hi>Dark Lanthorn</hi> would not
have left the Government secure, till it had likewise got the <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
dark Lanthorn from them, I mean by the publication of their <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of their <hi>Principles</hi> shortly after 41, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenant was a sufficient
<hi>Scheme.</hi> And tho the Tenets of Presbyterians and Independents
relating to their Forms of Church Government are enought known as is
likewise the degree of their <hi>Complicating</hi> Principles of Sedition with
the same, between the years 1641 and 1660: yet from that last year to
this present one, they have not by the publication of any <hi>Confession</hi> of
<hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Scheme</hi> of their Tenets; satisfied the Government that all their
Principles are consistent with the Civil <hi>Polity</hi> thereof, and that they
have renounced those former Tenets of theirs that once destroyed it, and
particularly that intolerably seditious one, viz. <hi>That if the Magistrate will
not reform the World, they may.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because several of their <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> have not renounced the <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary</hi>
part of their former Principles (and which were so destructive
to the Sacred Persons of Princes and their State and Government, and of
all <hi>Humane</hi> Society) the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> in their <hi>Convocation Iuly</hi>
21st, <hi>Anno</hi> 1683. did to their great honour pass their <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi>
against certain particular Books of <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> and <hi>Iesuites</hi> and
others, wherein those Tenets and Principles were owned: and the very
shewing of those Tenets to the World by such learned and loyal hands,
hath been (I believe) useful in making many of the Loyal Lay <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
withdraw from others of them they thought therewith infected;
a thing that might well be supposed naturally to happen when those of
them to whom the <hi>term</hi> of <hi>Sober Party</hi> was most due, observed that the
publication of the <hi>Dissenters Sayings</hi> and of the Censure of their Tenets, had
not occasioned their Leaders to publish other <hi>Dissenters Sayings,</hi> or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
that impugned <hi>Disloyalty</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> and promoted obedience to
Government, and what several Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have been
formerly observed to do upon the Worlds minding how much the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> had shook the Thrones of Kings, and as particularly
Father <hi>Caron</hi> in his <hi>Remonstrantia Hybernorum</hi> hath done, and there
citing 250 <hi>Popish Authors</hi> who deny the <hi>Pope's</hi> Power to depose
Kings.</p>
            <p>And no doubt but Dissenters late <hi>Omissions</hi> in this kind, and <hi>Commissions</hi>
in another, will awaken the <hi>Magistracy</hi> to require from all <hi>Protestant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants
such an exact <hi>Inventory</hi> of their Tenets as hath not yet been given
it: and the rather for that it is not by any <hi>Dissenters</hi> denied that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
is so far <hi>Custos utriusque tabulae,</hi> as to be allowed to require all
<hi>Religionary</hi> Parties to give him an account of their Principles, and to live
according to the Rule of them.</p>
            <p>Thus in the <hi>Dutch</hi> States the Magistrates of every place where any
<hi>Sect</hi> of the Heterodox is tolerated, are religiously careful, first to inform
themselves exactly of all their Tenets and Principles, and to see that they
hold no opinion prejudicial to the Constitutions of their Government:
<pb facs="tcp:103047:23"/>
and none doubts but that the entire Body of the Tenets or Principles of
the <hi>Dissenters</hi> to the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, is as conspicuous to that <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>State,</hi> and indeed to the World as can be desired, the present agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which with the Measures of Loyalty I have shewn in this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who hath there read the <hi>Hugonots Sayings</hi> published with any stain to
their Loyalty, or hath seen any of their <hi>Tenets</hi> branded for <hi>Sedition</hi> by an
<hi>Vniversity</hi> or <hi>College</hi> in <hi>France?</hi> But our <hi>Protestant Recusants</hi> having had
here the <hi>liberty</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to enjoy their peculiar ways of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship in their own Families, with the <hi>toleration</hi> of <hi>four</hi> others
of the same perswasion to be present, before all their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>
have been notified to the Government, is an instance of greater <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
shewn by the Government here to such <hi>Heterodox,</hi> than (I believe)
can be parallel'd in any Country whatsoever.</p>
            <p>All dangers are naturally multiplied in the dark: and it is a diminution
of our dread of the very <hi>Iesuites</hi> Principles, that they are generally
known: but if the Body of their Principles were as much unknown,
as are those of Protestant Recusants, yet would the publick be more
immediately concerned in having first an accurate account of those of the
latter, as being more numerous.</p>
            <p>It may be well thought a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> Church whose Principles are <hi>lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:</hi>
and any mens begging from the Magistrate Indulgence to a <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
of <hi>Sedition,</hi> would be as shameful as the Insolence of a Beggar not only
<hi>begging twenty Pound</hi> (as our <hi>Comaedian</hi> said) but begging a Leg or an Arm:
and not like a mans asking me who stands in my way as I am travelling
on the Road that I would not ride over him, but that he may mount into
the Saddle whose Principles direct him to ride over me.</p>
            <p>It was well observed by <hi>Lipsius</hi> in his Notes in <hi>Seneca,</hi> That <hi>Naturae
quodam Instinctu ea maleficia coercent homines &amp; puniunt quae societatem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to any Out-rages from any <hi>Religionaries</hi> which are either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the Bodies of particular Persons, or even <hi>Convulsive</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of States and Kingdoms (and to which the Actors might be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by their particular <hi>heats,</hi> and not the general <hi>light</hi> of their avowed
<hi>Principles</hi>) I account that Complaints against such will soon evaporate
into Air or be buried in Earth, and with some allusion to the words of,
<hi>Let the dead bury the dead,</hi> I may say, let <hi>Plots</hi> bury <hi>Plots,</hi> and <hi>Shams
Shams,</hi> and let any Seditious Protestants and Seditious Papists on the
<hi>Compensation</hi> of their <hi>Crimes</hi> forbear troubling others by calling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Criminals;</hi> and the Figure of the Body of their Parties can no more
be altered by the unevenness and exorbitance of the actings of particular
Persons, than is the rotundity of the Earth by the ruggedness of Rocks
or protuberance of Mountains.</p>
            <p>And that where one Papist goeth out of the World at the back door of
Justice, for the Treason of Clipping and Coyning, twenty of the more
numerous body of the Protestants do so, is not to be wondered at: but
the <hi>id ipsum</hi> to be regarded in any reflections made on a Religion by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of its <hi>Criminals,</hi> is its Principles: and if it could be proved that any
<hi>Caetus</hi> of men were allowed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> to assert the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that <hi>Treason,</hi> (as both Papists and Presbyterians have the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Resistance</hi>) that indeed would have the weight of
a just <hi>Reflection</hi> on our <hi>CHVRCH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:23"/>
Tho several dissolute and nominal Protestants may possibly have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and forged as many Shams and Calumnious Accusations against
other Protestants and Papists, as if they had believed the Practice of
<hi>Calumny</hi> to be lawful, yet hath any of them published in Print the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
of the lawfulness of it; or its being a poor <hi>Peccadillo?</hi> Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not that some particular <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the
turbulence of their several dispositions, have enflamed differences and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
in our Church and State? But who can charge them from doing
this by Communication of Councils with their <hi>Superiors,</hi> and by instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from them? Were any of them charged by <hi>Proclamations</hi> for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing of that nature, as some Popish Recusants were by his
<hi>Majesty's</hi> of <hi>Ian. 16. 1673. for chiefly occasioning the intestine divisions
among us,</hi> and by his Majesty's Proclamation of <hi>December</hi> 2d, 1680.
<hi>for fomenting of differences among his Loyal Protestant Subjects?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet this <hi>Fact</hi> tho thus by the Government charged on some ill

whom so many of our <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks are conducted) but for their
own <hi>Proclamations</hi> of their <hi>Principles</hi> in their Books, and particularly as
to the point of <hi>Calumny,</hi> the only Engine by which <hi>Divisions</hi> could be
wrought among Protestants; and but for their setting up that <hi>Doctrine</hi>
heretofore, without leave from the Pope's <hi>Canon</hi> Law, and backing it
with another to fright any Fools or Knaves from disparaging or even ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating
them, and for their making use and application of these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
since the Pope had damned them by a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> I mean his
<hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 79: and but for Father <hi>Parsons</hi> having so scandalously
exposed the narrowness of his Soul, and the poor <hi>Ideas</hi> he had of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, and even of the Character of a Gentleman by saying what

            </p>
            <p>As there is very little in this <hi>Discourse</hi> that reflects on any <hi>Principles</hi> of
the <hi>Romanists</hi> that may be called <hi>Religionary,</hi> so neither have I troubled
my self to attacque the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the Society of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and of other
<hi>Casuists</hi> condemned by this Pope, that do not <hi>hominum societatem convel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere,</hi>
and it may well be supposed that I having partly grounded my Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of the happy Future State of <hi>England</hi> on the former fashion of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi>
Writing <hi>being passed away,</hi> could not be much tempted to Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Casuists</hi> may still hold the 23d <hi>Tenet</hi> branded in the
Pope's <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Pen, viz. <hi>Faith in its large sense only from the Evidence of the Creation,
or some such Motive is sufficient for Iustification,</hi> and so likewise the 46th
<hi>Tenet</hi> there, viz. <hi>frequent Confession and Communion even in those that live
as Heathens is a Mark of Predestination,</hi> and many other <hi>Tenets</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to <hi>Religion,</hi> and which the <hi>Pope</hi> with so great a Pastoral Sollicitude
hath damned <hi>as at least scandalous and pernicious in Practice,</hi> and hath
<hi>prohibited</hi> to be <hi>defended</hi> by any under the pain of Excommunication, <hi>ipso
facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are other <hi>Tenets</hi> by him in that <hi>Decree</hi> condemned, that I
have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> dilated on as <hi>Convulsive</hi> of Humane Society, which
the <hi>Pietas in patriam</hi> occasioned in me such transports of passion against,
that I wished he had signalized with sharper words of <hi>Censure</hi> than those
<pb facs="tcp:103047:24"/>
beforementioned, and that I thought the <hi>Excommunicatio Major</hi> with the
<hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>lighted Torches</hi> too little for, and even an ordinary <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
in their case to be a Complement or a kind of <hi>sham censuring</hi> them
as <hi>abominable and not good,</hi> or somewhat like the Censure <hi>pro formâ</hi> shot
off against the <hi>Munster</hi> Peace: and I supposed that if he had Sentenced
them to be <hi>absolutely in themselves evil,</hi> he would have satisfied every
one that he had put the World out of their Gun-shot by his putting it
out of his power to dispense with them.</p>
            <p>However finding that <hi>Decree</hi> of great moment to <hi>Christendom,</hi> and yet
by the generality of <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants</hi> to have been not much more
regarded than are the <hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>Dialogues</hi> between <hi>Pasquin</hi> and <hi>Marpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>
that come here, I have deliberately Surveyed it and done it what right
I could. And by occasion hereof do here call to mind a <hi>Remark</hi> on the
<hi>Papacy</hi> I met with in a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> of one of our <hi>Dissenters,</hi> viz. <hi>That if
the Pope were a good man, he might do a great deal of good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho for sometime after I had begun this <hi>Discourse,</hi> I was somewhat a
Stranger to the great Character of the present Pope, (and so continued
till reading the <hi>Preface</hi> of Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s very learned Book of the <hi>Regale,</hi>
I sound he there Celebrated him in these words, viz. <hi>That he is a man of
great probity, and that on his advancement to the Papacy, he conceived a
very ill opinion of the whole Order of the Iesuites,</hi>) I since found cause
from the Universal Concurrence of all Impartial men about the same,
to have the firmer opinion of the quiet of <hi>England,</hi> and do expect from
the influences of such a Pope on the Loyalty and Religion of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> some advance of its happiness.</p>
            <p>Tho most men may have only little <hi>Ideas</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> as of somewhat
above the Clouds, that as a great <hi>Cypher</hi> only surrounds the World, yet
the wiser few who have particularly observed the watchful Eye of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
over the Critical passages, and windings and turnings in their own
lifes, cannot but be sensible that in the designation of persons at stated
times to be at the Helm of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and who are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to have so great a share in the <hi>External,</hi> and a much greater in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Government of the World) the great Governor of it, and <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of men</hi> is no unconcerned Spectator.</p>
            <p>It is (I think) most highly probable that at a time when the World
being filled with the Jesuites <hi>Principles</hi> and Casuistick <hi>distinctions, Vertue</hi>
it self was grown <hi>an empty Name,</hi> and the <hi>Casuists Project of finishing
Transgression, and making an end of Sin</hi> in a subtle way and contrary to
the plain Method intended by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> had in a great part of the
World almost finished the most Vital part of Christian Religion, I mean
<hi>plain</hi> and <hi>downright</hi> Morality, and at a <hi>time</hi> when some <hi>Virtuosi</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>
and elsewhere <hi>half-witted</hi> and <hi>half Atheists</hi> taking it for granted that in
what hearts soever the Jesuites and Casuists Religionary Model had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
the simplicity of the Gospel was extinguished, were observed to
talk of <hi>Albumazar</hi>'s fond <hi>prediction</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion lasting but
about 1460 <hi>years,</hi> and Criticising of the time from whence its promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and likewise the promulgation of those Casuistical <hi>Tenets</hi> bore
<hi>date,</hi> did prophanely insinuate their <hi>Miscreant-Conceptions</hi> of the
Christian Religion not lasting till the time assigned in the <hi>Scripture</hi> for
Christs surrendring his <hi>Mediatory</hi> Kingdom to his <hi>Father.</hi> I say it is most
highly probable that at such a time (and when the Jesuites Interest too,
had so much <hi>Prosperity</hi> as to tempt them to think that the Mountain of
their Religion <hi>should never be moved</hi>) that nothing less than the great
<pb facs="tcp:103047:24"/>
Vertue and Courage of this <hi>Pope</hi> appearing by his said <hi>Decree</hi> could secure
Vertue it self and the true <hi>Christian</hi> Morality; and give the World occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to say with some <hi>Alteration</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi> put to <hi>Esther,</hi> viz. <hi>Who
knoweth not that he is come to</hi> Rome'<hi>s</hi> See <hi>for such a time as this is?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mountainous</hi> heap of <hi>Rubbish</hi> in the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and other <hi>Casuists Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
(and even in the <hi>Canon</hi> Law) appears very stupendious to the World,
but considering the Christian Heroical Acts of this <hi>Pope</hi> (and who for his
severity against the abuses of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> hath been by some Papists called
the <hi>Lutheran Pope</hi> (as I said) and for his anger against the Jesuites Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
been called the <hi>Iansenist Pope</hi> by others) I think another great <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
in the Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> may be here not improperly applied, <hi>viz.
Who art thou O great Mountain before</hi> Zerubbabel?</p>
            <p>Little did the <hi>Iesuites</hi> think that when they Crowned the <hi>Papacy</hi> with
a <hi>double</hi> Crown, I mean of its infallibility in <hi>Law</hi> and likewise in <hi>Fact</hi> (a
Crown much more glorious than its <hi>Triple</hi> one) any Pope would ever
uncrown their <hi>Principles</hi> and expose their baldness to the World: and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
do they who fear that ever this <hi>Pope</hi> will occasionally dispense with any
mens practising these <hi>Principles,</hi> think of the security they have against
the same from his inflexible Virtue and perfect Antipathy to injustice, and
which are judged to be so inherent in his Nature that I shall here occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
say that as I was somewhat a Stranger formerly to the Character of
this <hi>Pope,</hi> so I believe some of the <hi>Plot-witnesses</hi> were that reflected on
him so ignominiously: for undoubtedly had it been understood by them,
they would never have thought their <hi>Credibility</hi> could have out-lived
their first attacquing it.</p>
            <p>It may possibly be here objected by some Critical Inspectors into the
late Papal Transactions that <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th (as this Pope observes
in the beginning of his said <hi>Decree</hi>) did first damn some of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1665, and that <hi>Guymenius</hi> shortly after
in that <hi>year</hi> appearing in <hi>Print</hi> as a Champion for the <hi>Principles</hi> so <hi>damned,</hi>
the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Sorbon</hi> shortly after that damned the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Guymenius</hi> in
the 11th of <hi>May</hi> the same <hi>year;</hi> and that in the latter end of <hi>Iune</hi> so short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
following in the same <hi>year,</hi> the same Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th, damned
that very <hi>Sorbon</hi> Censure of <hi>Guymenius;</hi> and that therefore 'tis possible the
great <hi>Scene</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> appearing in this <hi>Popes</hi> said <hi>Decree</hi> may with a short
turn of Apostolical Power receive too the Fate of <hi>Pageantry</hi> and presently
disappear, and that the great <hi>Mountain</hi> which his <hi>Faith</hi> hath <hi>removed</hi> into
the <hi>midst of the Sea,</hi> may in little more than the twinkling of an Eye
return to its old place.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Answer</hi> to which I shall do that right to the <hi>Papacy</hi> to clear the
<hi>mistake</hi> in the <hi>objection,</hi> and inform the <hi>Reader</hi> that tho <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th
did <hi>Ex Cathedra,</hi> damn that <hi>Sorbon</hi>-Censure as aforesaid, yet it appears
out of the <hi>Condemnatory Bull</hi> it self, that what that Pope there did was
not out of favour to <hi>Guymenius</hi> or the <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselves or their <hi>Tenets:</hi>
and that to satisfie the World in that point he there gives the reason for
his <hi>damning</hi> the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> Censure, namely, because it intermedled in
Censuring some other Propositions or Principles of the Jesuites that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> the <hi>Office</hi>
of the <hi>Parish Priests,</hi> and the <hi>Privileges</hi> granted by <hi>Popes;</hi> and but for
the <hi>Sorbons complicating</hi> which with their <hi>Censure</hi> of the other Scandalous
<hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> no doubt but the <hi>Sorbon Censure</hi> had stood as
a Rock unshaken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:25"/>
Let therefore such who fear every thing, fear that this great <hi>Pope</hi> will
after his said Condemnatory <hi>Decree</hi> appear, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi>
while I observe it for the honour of his <hi>Iustice</hi> that he made
that <hi>Decree,</hi> and for the honour of his <hi>Prudence</hi> that before <hi>Nature</hi>
had caused the detestable <hi>Principles</hi> therein censured silently to <hi>evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
he gave the World this loud warming of them, as it likewise may
be for the honour of that great <hi>Seminary</hi> of the <hi>Divines</hi> of our Church
of <hi>England,</hi> our University of <hi>Oxford</hi> observed, that before the Seditious
Principles and Tenets of <hi>Iesuites</hi> and some <hi>Dissenters</hi> came to be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exterminated out of the <hi>English</hi> World by fear and shame, they notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to this Age, and to Posterity.</p>
            <p>There is no Subject that hath since the year 1641, more employed the
<hi>English</hi> Press than that of <hi>Liberty of Conscience pro</hi> and <hi>con:</hi> and the
fiercest and sharpest of the Writings concerning it, were what passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> on the occasion of <hi>Presbytery's</hi>
great <hi>Effort,</hi> to make the <hi>English</hi> Nation by one short general turn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyted
to its <hi>Model,</hi> and when it pushed for the <hi>auspicious</hi> fate of former
great Religionary <hi>Conversions</hi> happening as it were <hi>simul</hi> and <hi>semel,</hi> and
when <hi>Nations</hi> seemed to be like the <hi>Hyena,</hi> which having but one <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi>
cannot turn except it turn all at once.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Independents</hi> observing the Kingdom and Presbytery frowning
on one another, thought they could do nothing more popular than to
take the Arguments they found in the many <hi>Pamphlets</hi> of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
lying on every Stall for toleration under the old <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and
turn them upon <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and every one then who had fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of the Arbitrariness of Presbytery, seem'd to be a well wisher to
those <hi>Books</hi> for <hi>Liberty of Conscience;</hi> and the destroying of the Credit of
Presbytery by Books that had so much contentious fire in them, was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an acceptable sweet-smelling <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the Nation.</p>
            <p>And after the King's <hi>Restoration</hi> tho some few Books were writ of that
Subject (and with much more Candour than the others) yet the <hi>Yoke</hi>
of the King's Ecclesiastical Laws was so easie to the People, as that the
Writing of Books against it was not encouraged by <hi>Popular</hi> Applause.</p>
            <p>The King's <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Indulgence</hi> afterward appearing (and as
not gained by <hi>dint</hi> of Pen but <hi>ex mero motu</hi>) was applauded by some few
particular Writers among the Popish and Protestant Recusants discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in <hi>Print</hi> at their ease, of <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as if <hi>Nature</hi> meant that <hi>Books</hi> of that Subject should no more here
divert the curious World, the Empire <hi>toleration</hi> had thereby gained, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
labour under its own weight, and the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> being jealous
of that <hi>Declaration</hi> proving a <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Prerogatives suspending
Acts of Parliament</hi> in general, and suspecting that the Popish Recusants
would have the better of that <hi>Game,</hi> as supposed to have many great
<hi>Court-Cards</hi> here and abroad in the World and likely to have more,
while the Protestant Recusants had not so good in their hands (tho yet
they had here what amounted to the point in <hi>Picquet,</hi> I mean the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their <hi>Numbers</hi>) did presently thereupon cause all the <hi>Cards</hi>
to be thrown up: but first had in <hi>Concert</hi> with the <hi>dealers</hi> provided for
the packing them to their own advantage in a new <hi>Deal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In plain <hi>English,</hi> some Loyal Persons and firm Adherents to the Church
of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> thinking that Declaration illegal,
(and whether justly or no, I here presume not in the least to question)
endeavoured <hi>tanquam pro aris &amp; focis</hi> to get that <hi>Declaration</hi> Cancell'd,
<pb facs="tcp:103047:25"/>
and knowing they could not effect the same without the help of the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi>
Party in <hi>Parliament</hi> engaged their help therein, by giving them
hopes to carry an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> for their <hi>Indulgence:</hi> but what a little
<hi>fore-sight</hi> would have made appear to them impossible to be gained, for
many Considerations too <hi>obvious</hi> to be named.</p>
            <p>And the natural result of this <hi>Fact</hi> (which is on all hands confessedly
true) cannot but be the making of the former <hi>fashion</hi> of Polemical writing
for <hi>liberty of Conscience to pass away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have since seen some few Florid Sheets published by some of the
Dissenting <hi>Clergy</hi> on that Subject, but they have made no other Figure
then that of the poor Resemblances of <hi>Flowers</hi> extracted by Chimical Art
out of their Ashes: and any little shaking them in the <hi>Glass</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> must
make them presently fall in pieces.</p>
            <p>I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> expressly owned my having no regret against
any <hi>due</hi> or <hi>Legal</hi> Relaxation of the Penal Laws against Recusants: but
what any <hi>due</hi> or <hi>legal</hi> way may be therein, I enquire not.</p>
            <p>The power of the King in <hi>dispensing</hi> with the <hi>Penalties</hi> in case of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Persons was not (that I hear of) in the least Controverted in the
Debates of the <hi>Commons</hi> about that <hi>Declaration.</hi> And <hi>Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Church
History</hi> relateth, that when Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> was Lord-Keeper, there was a
<hi>Toleration</hi> granted under the <hi>Great Seal</hi> to Mr. <hi>Iohn Cotton</hi> a Famous Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<hi>Divine,</hi> for the free exercise of his <hi>Ministry</hi> notwithstanding his
dissenting in Ceremonies, <hi>so long as done without disturbance to the Church:</hi>
and the lawfulness of which particular Indulgence (I suppose) none in
that Age controverted, as I think none would any thing of that kind in
this.</p>
            <p>But if this <hi>Question</hi> of <hi>Toleration</hi> had not here been at the end of its
Race, and if no such thing had happened as the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi>
and Dissenters thereby manumitted from Penal Laws saying, <hi>Soul take thy
ease,</hi>
and presently Acting the Part of <hi>felo de se,</hi> by effecting the Cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of that <hi>Declaration,</hi> and if the <hi>Controversy</hi> were now to begin to start
forward, I account it would cause but a very short fermentation among
us.</p>
            <p>For no Books need be writ to prove the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of what an <hi>Act of
Parliament</hi> hath permitted to every private Family, and to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

            <p>It is even ridiculous to suppose that any <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Dissenters</hi> would

will perhaps hardly think it possible for them to gain <hi>Toleration</hi> for
their further being called by that Name, without shewing the Title
of their Principles to it.</p>
            <p>As on the account of what I have said it would be a <hi>Persecution</hi> to the
World, for the most ingenious men to trouble it with <hi>Discourses of the
lawfulness of Toleration,</hi> so it would too be to trouble it with <hi>Discourses</hi> of
the <hi>unlawfulness of denying Toleration</hi> to men who either deny their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
or deny to give an account of them: a <hi>duty</hi> that can plead as clear
a <hi>jus Divinum</hi> for it self as any <hi>Form</hi> of Church Government, and by
Vertue of which <hi>Christians</hi> are to <hi>be ready always to give an answer to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man that asks them a reason of the hope that is in them, with meekness and
reverence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are some Principles to which it is by all agreed, that 'tis unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to give Toleration, namely, to those that disturb Civil Society; nor
would it appear otherwise than ridiculous to the hoodwink't <hi>sober Party</hi>
of any <hi>Sect,</hi> that when the Magistrates reprove them in those words of
our Saviour, <hi>yee worship yee know not what,</hi> the Magistrates by tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            </p>
            <p>I have observed it in the Course of my reading, that there is one great
point of <hi>Religion</hi> on which the <hi>hinge</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> doth very much turn,
that several Eminent <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> have not dared to speak
their plain agreed sense of, and as to which it may therefore seem very
rational that they should, and that is, <hi>How far the Civil Laws of Princes
or the Municipal Laws do bind the Conscience,</hi> a <hi>Point</hi> that the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> could not be brought to <hi>Define;</hi> and herein 'tis obvious to consider
that tho 'tis on all hands granted that in any thing contrary to the Divine
Law natural and positive, those Laws do not bind the Conscience, and
that the <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of the <hi>Papacy, Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Independency</hi> would
not be caught <hi>with a why not,</hi> on the holding the <hi>Question</hi> in the <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
that <hi>Humane</hi> Laws do bind the <hi>Conscience</hi> in things not contrary

and short in that point, and have hoped by their power and interest to
keep the <hi>World</hi> from calling on them to explain.</p>
            <p>But I have in my occasional Converse with some of the most learned
of the Non-Conforming <hi>Clergy</hi> observed them in Discourse to speak out
their minds plainly and <hi>Categorically</hi> enough that <hi>Humane</hi> Laws do not
<hi>bind</hi> the Conscience, and to account it an <hi>absurd</hi> thing to make any <hi>Penal</hi>

is no pretence of any things enjoyned concerning the Worship of God,

made a necessary ingredient in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of of those Churches by

that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Iohn Cotton</hi> B. D. who in a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> of his printed at <hi>London</hi>

               </gap>tuled. <hi>The true Constitution of a particular visible
Church proved by Scripture, wherein is briefly demonstrated by Questions and
Answers, what Officers, Worship and Government Christ hath ordained in
his Church</hi> (and in the <hi>Title-page</hi> whereof is this place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> viz.
Jer. 50. 5. <hi>They shall ask the way to</hi> Sion <hi>with their faces thitherward,
saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Come let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetual COVENANT
that shall not be forgotten</hi>) in p. 1st, makes his first <hi>Question,</hi> what is a
Church? And the <hi>Answer</hi> is, <hi>The Church is a mystical Body whereof Christ
is the head; the Members and Saints called out of the World and united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Congregation by an holy COVENANT, to Worship the Lord and
to Edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in another <hi>Book</hi> of his printed at <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1645 called,
<hi>The way of the Churches of Christ in New</hi> England, his third <hi>Proposition</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:103047:27"/>
this, viz. <hi>For the joyning of faithful Christians into the Fellowship and Estate
of a Church, we find not in Scripture that God hath done it any other way
than by entring of them all together (as one man) into an holy COVENANT
with himself to take the Lord (as the head of the Church) for their God
and to give up themselves to him to be his Church and People: which implies
their submitting of themselves to him, and one to another in his fear, and their
walking in professed subjection to all his Ordinances, their cleaving one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as fellow Members of the same Body in Brotherly Love and Holy Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
unto Mutual Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He there partly props up the Obligation of this <hi>Church Covenant</hi> on
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy mentioned in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> and other
places of the Old Testament.</p>
            <p>The reasonableness of <hi>Subjects</hi> not entring into Religionary <hi>Covenants</hi>
without the Consent of the <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> may be inferred from the old
Testament, where in <hi>Numbers c.</hi> 30 the Parent hath a power given for
the controuling of the Childrens Vows not enter'd into by his consent;
but since these Principles of a new <hi>Church Covenant</hi> may seem to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a new Ecclesiastical Law without the <hi>King's</hi> privity and consent (a
thing that if our very <hi>Convocation</hi> should presume to do, would bring
them within a <hi>Praemunire,</hi>) and since the whole power of reforming and
ordering of all matters <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> is by the Laws in express words <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Imperial Crown of this Realm</hi> (and particularly by the 1st of
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>) and since that it hath been said, that even without an <hi>Act of
Parliament,</hi> a new Oath or Covenant cannot be introduced among the
King's Subjects, and moreover since all the famous Religionary Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Protestant Churches abroad, assert nothing of any such <hi>Church
Covenant,</hi> and since <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Associations</hi> have lately heard so ill in
the Kingdom, I think the nature and terms of this <hi>Independent</hi> Covenant
ought to be laid as plain before the Eye of the Government as was the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterian one.</p>
            <p>Those words of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>the entring them all together as one man
into an holy Covenant,</hi> carry some thing like the same sound of <hi>one</hi> and <hi>all,</hi>
and tho their thus <hi>entring into it to take the Lord as the head of his Church
for their God, and to give up themselves to him to be his Church and People,</hi>
may be a plausible beginning of this new Church Covenant <hi>in nomine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
yet the following words, of <hi>submitting themselves to him and to one
another in his fear, and their cleaving one to another as fellow Members of the
same Body in Brotherly Love and Holy Watchfulness,</hi> are words that (I
think) the Magistracy ought to watch, and to see that <hi>Dissenters</hi> have a
very sound form of words prescribed to them in this Case, if it shall
think fit to have the same continued.</p>
            <p>I have found the <hi>Assertion</hi> of a Church Covenant as Essential to the
Form of a true <hi>Independent</hi> Church in many other of their <hi>Books,</hi> and do
suppose that this Covenant being laid as Corner-stone in the building of
their Churches by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> it must last as long as <hi>Independency</hi> it
self: and of its lasting still, I met with an <hi>Indication</hi> from a Loyal and
Learned <hi>Official</hi> of the Court-Christian, who told me that tho several of
the <hi>Dissenters</hi> called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have been easily perswaded to repair to
the Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that they were admonished to confer
with, and had upon Conference with them come to Church and took the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> yet he thought that some of another Class of Dissenters were
possessed with a Spirit of incurable Contumacy, by reason of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
having tied them together to one another by a <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:27"/>
And if it shall therefore appear to the Magistrates that they are thus
<hi>Conference-proof</hi> and (as I may say) <hi>Reason-proof</hi> by vertue of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
it will then be found that no one <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mber</hi> of a gathered <hi>Church</hi>
can turn to ours, without the whole <hi>Hyena</hi>-like turning, and perhaps
some of the <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> may think it hereupon proper humbly to
advise his Majesty to <hi>null</hi> by a <hi>Declaration</hi> the Obligation of this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
as his Royal <hi>Father</hi> did that of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Covenant.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Consideration of the Principles of <hi>Independecy</hi>
thus seeming to have cramp'd the <hi>Consciences</hi> of its followers with a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
(that is at least unnecessary, and must naturally be a troublesom impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to men of thought and generous Education who love to perform
Moral Offices without entring into <hi>Covenant</hi> or giving <hi>Bond</hi> so to do)
may serve to let men see how the <hi>Pastorage</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
treats them like Gentlemen, and may serve to awaken their Compassion
for their deluded Country-men whom they see fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghtened by their <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
into a fancy of the unlawfulness of a Ceremony, and yet embolden'd
by them into the belief and practice of a Covenant without the King's
Consent, and from which Persons we should perhaps quickly receive
Alarms of <hi>Persecution,</hi> if the Government should impose any <hi>Covenant</hi>
or <hi>Test</hi> on them in order to <hi>Loyalty,</hi> tho never so necessary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace.</p>
            <p>But the World is aweary of the <hi>umbrage</hi> Sedition hath found among
denominations of Churches, and of judging of <hi>Trees</hi> by their <hi>Shadows,</hi> or
otherwise than by their Fruit, that is by their Principles: and for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of the present State of <hi>England,</hi> after we have by many Religion-Traders
been troubled with almost as many <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false</hi>
Churches as there are of <hi>Merchants Goods,</hi> Nature seems to have direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the People to agree in this indeleble <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> of a false
Church, namely, one whose <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>Disloyal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is so bent upon Loyalty in this Conjuncture,
that a disloyal Principle doth jar in the Ears of ordinary thinking men
like a false string in the Ears of a Critical <hi>Lutenist,</hi> and the which he
knows that Art or Nature can never tune: and upon any Churches va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
themselves on the intrinsic worth or the weight of their <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
as most opposite to Falshood, men generally now take into their
hands the <hi>Touch-stone</hi> and the <hi>Scales</hi> of Loyalty, and do presently suspect
any <hi>Church</hi> that refuseth to bring its <hi>Principles</hi> to be touch'd and weigh'd,
and they will not now allow the Reputation of a <hi>visible</hi> Church to any
body of Men, whose <hi>Principles</hi> relating to <hi>Loyalty,</hi> shall not first be made
<hi>visible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be otherwise thought by the impartial, than that Mens
Consciousness of somewhat of the <hi>Turpitude</hi> of some of their <hi>Principles,</hi>
restrains them from bringing them to appear in publick View, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>de fin. bon. &amp; mal.</hi> answers <hi>Epicurus</hi> (who said that
he would not publish his Opinion lest the people might perhaps take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at it,) <hi>viz. Aut tu eadem ista dic in judicio, aut si coronam times,
dic in senatu. Nunquam facies. Cur; nisi quod turpis est Oratio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I who thus urge the Reasonableness and Necessity of mens being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi>
of their <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> have frankly exposed one of mine own
in p. 131. and which I say there that I account the great fundamental one
for the quiet of the World as well as of a Man's own Conscience, <hi>viz.
That no man is warranted by any Intention of advancing Religion, to invade
the right of the Sovereign Power that is inherent in Princes by the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb facs="tcp:103047:28"/>
Laws of their Countreys:</hi> and I have mention'd the same in p. 136.
as owned by the <hi>Non-conforming</hi> Divines in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time.</p>
            <p>Tho I believe as firmly as any man, that the Christian Religion doth
plainly forbid the <hi>Resistance</hi> of Authority, and that his Majesties <hi>Royal</hi>
Power is <hi>immediately</hi> from God and no way depends on any previous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
or Approbation of the people, yet since the Sons of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> are sufficiently taught both that Doctrine, and likewise that
<hi>human</hi> Laws in the point of their <hi>Allegiance</hi> do bind the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and
since other men who err in <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> may sooner be brought to
see the <hi>Absurdity</hi> of their Error by the known <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> than
by Argumentations from <hi>Scripture</hi> which may admit of Controversy,
and since his <hi>Majesty</hi> hath been pleased to expect the <hi>Measures</hi> of our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
from the <hi>Laws,</hi> and that our English <hi>Clergy</hi> while in the late
Conjuncture they have so universally preach'd up Loyalty, have so <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>
accorded with the Measures of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and have therein (as I may
say) shewed themselves <hi>Apostolical</hi> Pastours, and since the persons whose
Complaints of the danger of Popery are most loud, do joyn therewith their
Exclamations against <hi>Arbitrary</hi> or <hi>Illegal</hi> Power, and seem to joyn Issue in
the point that they are willing that the Power that is by <hi>Law</hi> inherent in
the <hi>Crown</hi> should be preserved to it, I thought it most useful in the present
<hi>Conjuncture</hi> to assert the <hi>Principle</hi> in these <hi>Terms</hi> I have done: and I the
rather chose to do it, because I thought that the security of the <hi>Crown</hi> is by
some <hi>Laws</hi> well provided for, whose <hi>Obligation</hi> admits of no <hi>Doubt,</hi> I mean,
<hi>those</hi> whereby Men have been obliged to take the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and
<hi>Supremacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But moreover as I consider'd it to be one great valuable <hi>Right</hi> inherent
by Law in our Princes to secure the Continuance of the <hi>Succession</hi> in their
<hi>Line,</hi> so I likewise judged the legal Right of Princes to Succeed according
to <hi>Proximity</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> to be unalterable, and therefore having my eye on
the prevention of further Scandal to Protestancy from the <hi>Exclusion,</hi>
I introduced that Principle so worded as aforesaid, that by dilating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as I have done, I might bring the <hi>Reader</hi> the better prepared to my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suistical
Discussion of the Oaths.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> will find at the end of this <hi>Discourse</hi> the <hi>Casuistical</hi> Discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Obligation to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> resulting from
the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> by me promised in <hi>p.</hi> 214, and
the occasion of my writing which is likewise there mentioned.</p>
            <p>It was wholly writ in the time that the <hi>Question</hi> of the <hi>Succession</hi> made
the greatest noise among us and was then by me Communicated to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of my Friends in Terms as herewith printed without any thing since
added or diminished, and both it and the <hi>Discourse</hi> (which contains so many
things naturally Previous to the Consideration of that <hi>Question</hi>) would
have been long since published<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but partly for the various Accidents of
Business and Sickness that necessarily interrupted me in the Writing of
the latter.</p>
            <p>And tho perhaps the <hi>Publication</hi> of the former in the time of the <hi>Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of our late <hi>Parliaments,</hi> might have been more significant, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Volly</hi> of Loyal <hi>Addresses</hi> shot of manifesting the general just
zeal against the <hi>Exclusion</hi> (of which <hi>Addresses</hi> I yet observed none to
mention any thing of the Obligations to Allegiance to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi>
and <hi>Successors</hi> from the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi>) it may be
said that the subsequent Births of Fate have not restrained the
possibility of its usefulness in future times: and tho Heaven may be
<pb facs="tcp:103047:28"/>
propitious to our Land in the blessing it according to the Loyal <hi>Style</hi> of
the <hi>Addresses,</hi> namely, in his Majesties <hi>Line</hi> continuing on the <hi>English</hi>
Throne <hi>as long as the Sun and Moon endure,</hi> yet many and many may be
the <hi>Conjunctures</hi> when a supposed Heterodox Prince shining like the <hi>Sun</hi>
in the Firmament of the <hi>English</hi> State, and regularly moving in the <hi>Line</hi>
of the Law and his own <hi>Religion,</hi> may attract the dull Vapours of Fears
and Jealousies again, as another glorious <hi>Prince</hi> hath done, and the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of which may cast such Mists before Mens understanding Faculties
as to hinder them from seeing their way in the observance of the <hi>Oaths</hi>
they took: and therefore as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>premuniment</hi> (as I call'd it)
against our being future Enemies to our selves, and against poor little
Mortals (as it were) standing for the Office of <hi>Conservators of Gods
glory,</hi> while they are <hi>losing</hi> their own Souls by <hi>Perjury,</hi> and against some
Loyal <hi>Timid</hi> People troubling themselves with <hi>falling Skies</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> of
<hi>Gods</hi> not upholding his <hi>Church</hi> (just as <hi>Galen</hi> tells us of a Melancholy
Man who by often reading it in the <hi>Poets</hi> how <hi>Atlas</hi> supported <hi>Heaven</hi>
with his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> was often in a <hi>Panic</hi> fear least <hi>Atlas</hi> should faint and
let <hi>Heaven</hi> fall on mens heads) instead of taking pains to uphold and
maintain their <hi>Oaths</hi> which they swore to God in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
it may perhaps be always of importance to our <hi>English</hi> World to
have right <hi>Notions</hi> of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of those <hi>Oaths</hi> left behind in
it.</p>
            <p>When I have read many of the late <hi>Pamphlets</hi> against the <hi>Succession</hi>
(the <hi>Venom</hi> of which was stolen out of <hi>Doleman</hi>'s alias <hi>Parson</hi>'s Book)
and have often considered that the Government in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
might well be apprehensive of the mischief that <hi>Book</hi> might do with
its <hi>Poyson,</hi> and perhaps with its <hi>Sting</hi> in following Ages, I have then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
why none was employed to <hi>Answer</hi> it throughly, a thing that I do
not find was ever done, unless it may be said that an <hi>Answer</hi> to the 1st
<hi>part</hi> of it was in the <hi>year</hi> 1603 published by Sir <hi>Iohn Haward,</hi> and that
its 2d <hi>part</hi> hath been confuted by some Loyal and Learned Persons since
the late Conjuncture of our <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and in which time that Book
of <hi>Parsons</hi> was <hi>Reprinted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sorry that that <hi>Book</hi> and some others of Father <hi>Parsons</hi> were in
some part of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time <hi>Answered</hi> as they were by the real Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of severity that then fell on some innocent <hi>Papists,</hi> and who (I
believe) were Abhorrers of the <hi>Sedition</hi> his <hi>Books</hi> contained, and on
whom Dr. <hi>Donne</hi>'s <hi>Pseudo-Martyr,</hi> printed in the <hi>year</hi> 1610, reflects in
<hi>The Advertisement to the Reader</hi> saying. <hi>That his continual Libels and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatory
Books have occasioned more afflictions, and drawn more of that Blood
which they call Catholick, than all our Acts of Parliament have done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with a just respect to the Learning in Sir <hi>Iohn Haward</hi>'s Answer
to the <hi>first part</hi> of that <hi>Book,</hi> and by him Dedicated to King <hi>Iames,</hi> it
may yet be wished that with less <hi>Pomp</hi> of Words and greater closeness
of Argument referring to the Principles of internal Justice and natural
Allegiance and the <hi>lex terrae,</hi> he had shewn the perfect <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating
the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Proximity</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Case,</hi> and instead of so
much impugning the <hi>Book</hi> by <hi>References</hi> to the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, and old <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors making for <hi>Monarchy</hi> in general, or even by the places
<hi>cited</hi> out of the old <hi>Testament</hi> favouring <hi>primogeniture:</hi> and indeed I do
not find among all our late <hi>Writers</hi> for the <hi>Succession,</hi> that so much as
one of them by so much as once quoting this Book of Sir <hi>Iohn Haward</hi>
(tho so common) hath thence brought any Aid to their Noble Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:29"/>
But however the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> having been enjoyned since the
writing of Sir <hi>Iohn Haward</hi>'s Book hath given an ordinary <hi>Writer</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of bringing the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of disturbing the <hi>Course</hi>
of <hi>Succession</hi> to a quicker hearing and speedier issue in the <hi>Court</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which is the <hi>point</hi> I have endeavoured to carry after the end of
this <hi>Discourse,</hi> leaving it to <hi>Candid</hi> Men to judge of the sincerity of my
performance therein, and of my fair stating of the Question and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
genuine <hi>Propositions</hi> from it so <hi>stated,</hi> and which shall yet be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed</hi>
by me when I come to <hi>Review</hi> this <hi>Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is when I began it, I observed the generality of Men who
writ against the <hi>Exclusion-Bill</hi> with a great deal of good <hi>Law, History</hi>
and <hi>State-policy,</hi> did shew both their Learning and their Loyalty, and did
very usefully set forth the dreadful Confusions it would introduce and
perpetuate in the State: and the <hi>Illegality</hi> and indeed <hi>Nullity</hi> of any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
(tho by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi>) was by them likewise usefully shewn:
but yet I think it would have been some <hi>scandal</hi> to the present <hi>Age</hi> if it
had passed away without transmitting to the next some instances of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
who had leisure to write, writing of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of such a
<hi>Bill</hi> with relation to our <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy;</hi> and I was
sorry to find that when the late <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> had
afterward appear'd as the first <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vine</hi> who in <hi>Print</hi> asserted, <hi>That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the Right Heir was contrary to the Law of God both Natural and Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and that such Exclusion was against the Law of the Land also,</hi> his judgment
in his <hi>Book</hi> called the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Winchester'<hi>s Vindication</hi> given so Learnedly
in the <hi>point,</hi> seemed to so many of our new pretenders to Loyalty and to
Conformity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be a kind of a Novelty.</p>
            <p>But yet I observed that that Learned <hi>Prelate</hi> thought not fit there to
strengthen his <hi>Assertion</hi> of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of such <hi>Exclusion,</hi> by the
<hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did I observe that among all the Loyal <hi>Writers</hi> for the <hi>Succession,</hi>
I had met with from first to last, any one had <hi>surveyed</hi> the <hi>Question</hi> of the
unlawfulness of the <hi>Exclusion</hi> resulting from our Obligation by the <hi>Oaths</hi>
of <hi>All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>giance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> (tho yet some <hi>few</hi> of them hinted the thing
in general and were still answered with the <hi>haeres viventis</hi>) till at last ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Divine,</hi> namely, Dr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> Vicar of <hi>All hallows Barking</hi> and Dean
of <hi>Worcester,</hi> honoured both himself and the <hi>Question</hi> by taking notice of
it in his <hi>Iovian,</hi> and in the <hi>Preface</hi> to a <hi>Sermon</hi> of his <hi>printed</hi> in the <hi>year</hi>
1684, and Entituled, <hi>The harmony of Divinity and Law in a Discourse
about not resisting Sovereign Princes:</hi> and he in the 3d <hi>p.</hi> of that <hi>Preface</hi>
observes, <hi>That some men did pervert the meaning of the word</hi> Heirs <hi>in the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, from its common and usual acceptation to
another more special, on purpose to elude the force and obligation of them,
which otherwise they must have had upon the Consciences of the Excluders
themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> had made himself <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> enough to <hi>Master</hi> the
true notion of the point, and did in his Preface exorcise the <hi>Fantom</hi> of <hi>hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
viventis,</hi> a <hi>Noon-day</hi> Spright raised by one who was thought a great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer,</hi>
and which had before haunted the Question, and had affrighted so
many from lodging their thoughts in it.</p>
            <p>And tho no other of our <hi>Divines</hi> (that I have heard of) writ of the
same, nor any of the <hi>Layety</hi> otherwise than starting the <hi>Notion</hi> of it in
<hi>Print,</hi> yet considering the great <hi>weight</hi> of his Learning and Reason with
which in his <hi>Iovian</hi> and that <hi>Preface</hi> he directed so many in the <hi>Obligation</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:29"/>
of their great <hi>Oaths,</hi> I will so far prefer his <hi>Labours</hi> to all that writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the <hi>Succession,</hi> as to say of him in those words of the <hi>Apostle,
He hath laboured more abundantly than they all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I have writ thereof was finished some years before what
the <hi>Doctor</hi> published about the same, as several of my friends know, to
whom I gave Copies of the same, and with an injunction of printing it,
in Case of my death: and I have since added nothing to what I writ, nor
shall till I proceed to the <hi>Review</hi> of the <hi>Discourse:</hi> but had otherwise for
the honour of my judgment, therein concurring with so learned a mans,
respectfully cited somewhat thereof in my <hi>Discussion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt but there were many loyal and judicious and learned men
that in the late Conjuncture had the same sense with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Obligation</hi> of those <hi>Oaths,</hi> tho they had not time to publish
the same by the <hi>Press;</hi> and I have in <hi>p.</hi> 269 referred to what a very
learned and honourable Person urged from the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and
<hi>Supremacy,</hi> in his <hi>Speech</hi> against the <hi>Exclusion-Bill</hi> in the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and to which I have mentioned somewhat of a reply there made
by Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> in that <hi>House,</hi> and of the prodigious <hi>Applause</hi> that <hi>Reply</hi>
found from many Persons there.</p>
            <p>But in that <hi>Speech</hi> of Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> there was another thing said, and which
being spread about the Kingdom, had the effect of <hi>Thunder</hi> from an <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
and kept thousands from daring so much as to deliberate of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
resulting from the <hi>Oath</hi> of Allegiance, to oppose the <hi>Exclusion.</hi>
His words I refer to for this, were to this purpose, viz. <hi>It is urged also
that we are sworn to the King his Heirs and lawful Successors. It is true
we are so: but not obliged to any during the Kings life but to himself. For
it were Treason if it were otherwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in vain at that time for any <hi>Discourser</hi> to hope by fair and gentle
Principles of Reason to open the Wards in the Locks of Mens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and to let in there a true <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Allegiance</hi> sworn to the Kings
<hi>Heirs and Successors,</hi> when so great a <hi>Pick-lock of the Law</hi> had made it
<hi>Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet never was I mortified with a greater <hi>Example</hi> of Humane Frailty
than by the Sense of so great a number of knowing Persons in that <hi>Loyal
Parliament</hi> being so suddenly infected with the Error of that Insinuation,
from a single <hi>Demagogue</hi> who had never been bred up to <hi>Logic,</hi> which yet
caught the understandings of the Majority of the Representatives of the
<hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Trap</hi> of a little <hi>Sophism;</hi> and when an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Lease</hi> drawn by a Lawyer's <hi>Clerk</hi> might shew one that the <hi>Lessee</hi> at the
time of the perfecting it, actually enters into a <hi>present</hi> Obligation both
in <hi>Law, Equity</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> to pay his <hi>Rent</hi> to the Lessor his Heirs and
Assigns as it shall become due to each respectively, and which when the
<hi>Lessor</hi> dies or assigns his interest, is to be paid to the <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Assign</hi>
then and not till then.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Tully</hi> who had as great a Veneration for the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Government, as I have for that of our <hi>English</hi> one, said in his <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pro L. Murena,</hi> that <hi>Nihil est fallacius Ratione totâ Comitiorum,</hi> the
same thing may happen to our great Loyal Body of Men assembled
while under a ferment of Passion; and then every mans anger influencing
another, <hi>Fallacy</hi> it self may pass for Reason: and as we see when many
Workmen are at once altogether crying, and pulling a great piece of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
forward to them with a Rope, if that doth not hold but break, they
all fall backwards together, so when any <hi>Caetus</hi> or Body of Men are
<pb facs="tcp:103047:30"/>
drawing with all their strength to bring any matter of weight in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to them, if the Principle of Reason they use for that purpose
will not hold, but proves a poor weak <hi>Sophism,</hi> they naturally fall down
together.</p>
            <p>I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> usually mentioned those <hi>Parliaments</hi> with the
<hi>prefixt</hi> name of <hi>Loyal,</hi> wherein I yet thought so many Persons were so
dreadfully mistaken in so great a <hi>point,</hi> and for which Charity (if extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant)
no <hi>Iesuited</hi> Papists can blame me, knowing how great an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusioner</hi>
of <hi>old</hi> their infallible <hi>head</hi> hath been: but which I was the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inclined to do (as any one may guess by the <hi>Current</hi> of the <hi>Discourse</hi>)
because I knew not but his <hi>Majesty's</hi> calling a New Parliament at
such time as he should think convenient for the same, might give many
of the mistaken Persons such an advantage of recollected thoughts as
would shew them the Errors of their former measures, and render them
afterwards averse from putting at once both their own <hi>Consciences,</hi> and
the very words of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> on the <hi>Rack,</hi> and from such a
<hi>squeezing</hi> of Blood out of that, contrary to the <hi>Grammatical</hi> Sense that
might occasion the flowing of blood through the Kingdom in after
times: and the sharpest expression I was naturally led to use where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
fell from me without any Reproach of the Persons erring when I
said in <hi>p.</hi> 209, viz. <hi>Thus just is it for Heaven sometimes to blind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
good men in their Counsels, when they abandon plain Principles and
Dictates of Reason, and when they will not do what they know, to suffer them
not to know what they do,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have somewhere read of one who writing of the <hi>Constitution</hi> of and
<hi>Rule</hi> for the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> saith, That for the firmer observance of that
<hi>Rule</hi> Christ himself was heard in the Air, saying to St. <hi>Francis, This
Rule is mine and not thine, and I will have it observed,</hi> Ad literam, ad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram,
sine glossâ, sine glossâ: and let any men be attentive to the <hi>voice
behind them, viz.</hi> That of <hi>Conscience</hi> about the <hi>Rule</hi> of the observing of
their <hi>Oaths,</hi> they will hear <hi>God</hi> there speaking much to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>Nor have I heard of the understandings of men of great Abilities
made Spectacles of shame to the World through the Divine <hi>Dereliction</hi>
in any particular point, more than in that relating to their natural <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi>
and their <hi>Oath</hi> to confirm it.</p>
            <p>Let any one consider somewhat in the <hi>Speech</hi> of Sir <hi>H. V. printed</hi> in
the <hi>year 1662, As what he intended to speak on the Scaffold,</hi> where having
mentioned <hi>by what steps he became satisfied with the Parliaments Cause he
was engaged in, and did pursue the same, and that the Parliaments Cause
did first shew it self in the</hi> Remonstrance, and <hi>Secondly, in the Solemn
League and Covenant,</hi> he addeth, <hi>That it shewed it self,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>in the
more refined pursuit of it by the Commons House in their Actings single,</hi> and
saith afterward referring to my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Arguile,</hi> viz. <hi>That Noble Person
(whose Memory I honour) was with my self at the beginning and making of
the Solemn League and Covenant, the matter of which and the holy ends
therein contained I fully assent unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have been as desirous to observe,
but the rigid way of prosecuting it and the oppressing uniformity that have
been endeavoured by it, I never approved. This were sufficient to vindicate
me from the false Aspersions and Calumnies which have been laid upon me of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitism
and Popery,</hi> &amp;c. And recollect whether (tho that <hi>Covenant</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi>) any thing yet could be more contrary
to that <hi>Covenant</hi> than that <hi>House of Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ons</hi> acting single, or any thing
<pb facs="tcp:103047:30"/>
could be more contrary to the plain <hi>literal</hi> Sense of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> than
that refined <hi>pursuit of the Cause,</hi> owned by a person of such refined and
real great Abilities, and within the Prospect of Eternity: and whether the
owning of the same then contrary to the <hi>literal</hi> Sense of the <hi>Covenant</hi>
was a proper <hi>Medium</hi> for him to use then, whereby to clear himself from
the aspersion of <hi>Iesuitism?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was another person of great Theological Learning and strong
natural parts who lived about that time, I mean Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin,</hi> the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
I before mentioned: and who in two Books of his, the one called
<hi>Redemption Redeem'd,</hi> and the other of <hi>The Divine Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
hath signaliz'd his great Abilities: but in the very <hi>Pamphlet</hi> where
he presumes to vindicate the very Sentence against the <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> and
to make the same Coherent with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenant, he in <hi>p.</hi> 51 saith,
<hi>Evident it is that those Words in the Covenant,</hi> in the preservation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom, <hi>import a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the Kings part, without the performance whereof the</hi> Covenant <hi>obligeth
no man to the preservation or defence of his Person or Authority:</hi> and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the <hi>Words</hi> to speak for themselves, they do not say in HIS Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and Defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in THE Preservation and Defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
plainly referring to the same <hi>Preservation and Defence of Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi>
which is before <hi>promised,</hi> and <hi>sworn</hi> to in this and the preceding
<hi>Articles,</hi> as evidently referring to the same Persons <hi>Preservation</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
of them here who are to preserve and defend them in the former
<hi>Clauses,</hi> and who are to preserve and defend the Kings <hi>Majesty's</hi> Person
and Authority in <hi>this,</hi> namely, the <hi>Covenanters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Covenant</hi> had intended to ground the <hi>Preservation</hi> and <hi>Defence</hi>
in this <hi>Clause</hi> upon another Person or Persons as the performers, beside
those to whom the same Actions are referred immediately before, it
would have pointed them out distinctly: but when it expresseth no other,
the plain ordinary <hi>Grammatical</hi> construction will attribute them to the
Parties before nominated, and cannot put them on any other.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Premisses</hi> notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> concludes that if that
his <hi>Anti-Grammatical</hi> Paraphrase were not the true meaning of those
words beforementioned in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> it was unintelligible by him: and
his <hi>Words</hi> are these, <hi>If this be not the clear meaning and importance of them,
the</hi> Covenant <hi>is a</hi> Barbarian <hi>to me, I understand not the</hi> English <hi>of
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus naturally is it even for the <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>unstable</hi> to <hi>wrest</hi> not only

               </gap>, <hi>to their own destruction</hi> and the <hi>destroying</hi> of common
<hi>Sense,</hi> when they recede from the common Principles of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was likewise another Person reputed one of <hi>first-rate</hi> Parts and
great <hi>Learning</hi> in the late times, who published a Book called, <hi>The lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of obeying the present Government:</hi> and in his 11th <hi>Page</hi> there directs
the World to make this <hi>Enquiry,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether there be any Clause in any</hi>
Oath <hi>or</hi> Covenant <hi>which in a fair and common sense forbids obedience to the
Commands of the present Government and Authority:</hi> and referreth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to the <hi>Clause</hi> of the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance and Supremacy, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of which 'tis said I shall bear faith and true Allegiance to his Majesty,
his</hi> Heirs and Successors, <hi>and in the latter. I shall bear faith and true Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to the Kings Highness his</hi> Heirs and Successors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:31"/>
He there goeth on very Childishly to <hi>sell</hi> the World a <hi>Bargain,</hi> by
trying to <hi>puzzle</hi> it with <hi>Questions,</hi> viz. <hi>If it be said that in the Oath of</hi>
Allegiance, <hi>Allegiance is sworn to the King his</hi> Heirs and Successors, <hi>if his
Heirs be not his Successors, how doth that Oath bind? Either the Word</hi>
Successors (saith he) <hi>must be superfluous, or it must bind to</hi> Successors <hi>as
well as to</hi> Heirs. <hi>And if it bind not to a</hi> Successor <hi>as well as to an</hi> Heir,
<hi>how can it bind to an</hi> Heir <hi>that is not a</hi> Successor? <hi>And if you will know
the common and usual sense (which should be the meaning of an Oath) of the
word</hi> Successors, <hi>you need not so much ask of Lawyers and Learned Persons,
as of men of ordinary knowledge, and demand of them who was the</hi> Successor
<hi>of</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror, and see whether they will not say</hi> W. Rufus: <hi>and
who succeeded</hi> Richard <hi>the Third, and whether they will not say</hi> Harry <hi>the</hi>
7th: <hi>and yet neither of them was</hi> Heir: <hi>so in ordinary acception the
word</hi> Successor <hi>is taken for him that actually succeeds in the Government, and
not for him that is actually excluded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May we not to this <hi>Questionist</hi> who was as I may say such a <hi>Mountebank</hi>
of a <hi>Casuist,</hi> put the Question of <hi>Tertullian, Rideam vanitatem, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrem
caecitatem?</hi> And may we not properly bring in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Casui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Decision as to things of this Nature, <hi>Haec tolerabilius vel ridentur, vel
flentur,</hi> i. e. A man is at liberty either to <hi>laugh</hi> at or <hi>lament</hi> them.</p>
            <p>I have in <hi>p.</hi> 41 of this <hi>Discourse</hi> mentioned <hi>D' Ossat</hi>'s Observation of
Father <hi>Parson</hi>'s <hi>often contradicting himself, and that very grossly in his Book
of the Succession, as it happens to all Persons in passion as able as they are who
are not guided by truth and reason, but transported by interest and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
and I shall here further remark out of the same <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>D' Ossat</hi>
by me there cited, that to those words last mentioned he there adds this,
viz. <hi>I will here name two of his Contradictions. He opposeth to the King of</hi>
Scots <hi>among other things to exclude him from the</hi> Succession <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>That
he was born out of</hi> England <hi>of Parents not subject to the Crown of</hi> England.
<hi>He likewise opposeth to</hi> Arabella <hi>among other impediments, That she is a
Woman, and that it is not expedient for the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>to have
three Women, Queens successively: and that often the Children of Kings have
been excluded for being Women: and yet not withstanding he adjudgeth the
said Kingdom to the</hi> Infanta <hi>of</hi> Spain, <hi>by preference even to the King of</hi> Spain,
<hi>her Brother, as if the said</hi> Infanta <hi>were not a Woman as well as the said</hi> Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgot to observe how the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The lawfulness of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the present Government,</hi> that useth such thick paint of <hi>Equivocation</hi>
in his <hi>sense</hi> of the word <hi>Successors,</hi> having <hi>pushed</hi> on his <hi>Question</hi> about
any <hi>Clause in any Oath</hi> or <hi>Covenant forbidding obedience to the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Authority,</hi> by <hi>adding</hi> to it the consideration of obeying it,
<hi>when no other Government can be had, and of the Common-wealths going to
ruine,</hi> if the present Government were not obeyed, and having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>insinuated</hi> that the <hi>Obligation</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> ceased, was so horribly <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick</hi>
as to prop up that <hi>insinuation</hi> by a <hi>passage</hi> cited for that purpose out
of a <hi>Popish</hi> Casuist, who saith, <hi>That when a thing sworn is too difficult, or
he that swore is by change of Abilities or Estate rendred less apt to perform:
or lastly, when the thing sworn is an hinderance to the swearer from consulting
the publick good, then there is a lawful Cause of</hi> DISPENSING <hi>in the
Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have here then found a <hi>Protestant</hi> and a <hi>Casuist-would-be exalting
himself above all that is called God</hi> to <hi>Dispense</hi> with <hi>Oaths,</hi> a thing that
<hi>Protestancy</hi> abhorreth, and a thing that the <hi>Oath</hi> had precluded in these
<pb facs="tcp:103047:31"/>
words, <hi>I do believe and in Conscience am resolved that neither the Pope nor
any other Person whatsoever hath power to absolve me of this Oath, or any part
thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus as the <hi>Author</hi> hath by his interpretation of the word <hi>Successor,</hi>
qualified an <hi>Vsurper</hi> to have the benefit of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to our
lawful Monarch, so he hath bare-faced made himself <hi>Successor</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and an <hi>Vsurper</hi> upon <hi>Oaths</hi> by <hi>dispensation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More <hi>instances</hi> need not be given of the hortor of <hi>Heavens</hi> withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its ordinary influences from particular men of extraordinary parts,
who after they have <hi>despised Dominions</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> and their <hi>Oaths</hi> to
them, would be <hi>Critical</hi> inventors of new <hi>Rules</hi> concerning the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi>
to Kings and the <hi>Oaths</hi> about the same, but who have thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
more despicable than the <hi>Pedants</hi> who call themselves <hi>Criticks,</hi> whose

            <p>When I was writing the former part of the following <hi>Discourse</hi> out of
my just Compassion to my Country, as well as to the Noble <hi>Lord</hi> and
others, who suffered so unjustly by <hi>Oaths</hi> Assertory in the time of the
<hi>Martyrocrasy</hi> (as I called it) when every single <hi>Witness</hi> was almost as

had continued to encrease and swarm as it began, it would in time have
scarce left any to be Judges or Jurors, and when some of them who were
<hi>bread-worshippers,</hi> were yet almost as much <hi>adored</hi> by the <hi>Mobile</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
as the Host is by the <hi>Papists,</hi> I had thoughts to have entertained
our <hi>English</hi> World with an account of the particularities of the usage that
<hi>Witnesses</hi> in the Case of Treason find in the World abroad, and to have
shewed how the Custom and Practice of Nations and their Laws have
with all the Critical <hi>Nicety</hi> of <hi>Politicks</hi> imaginable provided that such
Witnesses may neither be too much discouraged by fears nor encouraged
by hopes, and that it frequently there happened that in the discharge of
the Office of <hi>Witnessing,</hi> men were to expect so great an allay of trouble,
and so much exposed to depend on the next World for the reward of
their <hi>Veracity</hi> in this, as to prevent in this an <hi>allay</hi> of truth with falshood
in their Testimony, and that sometimes when <hi>Paupers</hi> come to be <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
in <hi>Criminal Causes,</hi> they have not Beds of Roses provided for
them, but are put to the <hi>Rack,</hi> and that ordinarily the bodies of such
<hi>Witnesses</hi> are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acked on their being found <hi>vacillant</hi> and <hi>halting</hi> in their
Testimony, and whereby they had given <hi>Iudges</hi> occasion to think that
such Witnesses had first tried the <hi>Rack</hi> upon their <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho I thought any <hi>Scene</hi> of that would appear horrid to an <hi>English</hi>
Eye, as it doth to the Eye of our <hi>Laws,</hi> I have yet in this <hi>Discourse</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
how the <hi>Iewish</hi> Law by God's <hi>express</hi> Command took care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
mens <hi>ambitus</hi> in standing for the Office of Witnesses, by <hi>tacking</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the standing <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Executioners,</hi> and I have in my <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous

our <hi>lex terrae</hi> being the allowed <hi>Land-mark</hi> for all <hi>to go by</hi> in matters <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial:</hi>

Accusation, and like a <hi>Crocodile</hi> never come to his full <hi>growth;</hi> and I have
not robbed him of his right of being an informer in Cases where the lives
of Princes are concerned: and have moreover represented such a <hi>Malefactor</hi>
capable by his <hi>penitence</hi> and subservience to the great influx of Providence
on the safety of Crown'd Heads, of being thought his Countries <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
and a piece of a Founder to it, and could have gone no higher without
following our <hi>profanum vulgus</hi> in making every Informer and <hi>Witness</hi> a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
a word that <hi>Cicero</hi> was much scandalized at and taxed <hi>Vèrres</hi> about,

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Moribus antiquis stat Res Britannica,</hi> and so I desire it may while
the World stands; and as I have occasionally mentioned <hi>Boccaline</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the best <hi>Reformer,</hi> viz. <hi>One who leaves the World as he finds it,</hi> so
I have took care to be no <hi>Propounder</hi> or <hi>Innovator</hi> about new <hi>Methods</hi> or
<hi>Systemes</hi> of Politicks in the point of <hi>Accusation</hi> or <hi>Testimony</hi> which is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
tender, and wherein I have found the wisest and greatest of
the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Princes, to whose Custody the <hi>depositum</hi> of their Masters
Crowns and Lives was committed, to appear undetermined as to their
measures.</p>
            <p>And of this <hi>D' Ossat</hi>'s Letter 150th, and to <hi>Villeroy</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1602,
hath transmitted to the World a remarkable <hi>instance,</hi> where he saith,
<hi>I have received advice from</hi> Lorrain, <hi>that an</hi> English <hi>Divine called</hi> Pitts,
<hi>having held Communication with a</hi> French <hi>Divine called St.</hi> German, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
killing the King, and the said St.</hi> German <hi>having dropped some words
whereby another came to understand it, the Bishop of</hi> Toul <hi>examining it
caused the said St.</hi> German <hi>as well as the said</hi> Pitts <hi>to be put in Prison, and
by the Party accused denying the Fact, his Condition is found better than the
Accusers, who hath no way to prove what the other said to him, none else being
present: which proceeding whether 'twas deliberate or by neglect, tends to this,
that no man hence forward to whom any one hath spoken of killing the King,
will dare to reveal it to any one for fear of being put in Prison, and punished:
for that he was willing to save the life of the King and preserve the whole
Kingdom: whereas in Cases of such Consequence it ought to be free to any
man to Accuse another, not only without fearing any thing, but further with
hopes of great Recompence: having a respect never the less not to believe too
lightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor to Condemn any Person upon the bare Affirmation of another without
good Indications and Proofs. I believe that the King advertised of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will at least take care of the Deliverance and Safety of him that could not
endure to hear any speak of murdering him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am apt to think that the horror of the <hi>Fact</hi> of such an Out-rage to
the Persons of <hi>Kings,</hi> so much astonishing the imaginations of the Loyal,
and the very <hi>Idea</hi> of it being so ghastly as to affright them from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
it, hath partly contributed to some Omissions in the Worlds
providing against it: and it hath been so incident to <hi>Writers</hi> to mention
it without thinking of its horror, that a late useful voluminous <hi>Collector</hi>
we had, began the first <hi>Edition</hi> of the first <hi>Part</hi> of his <hi>Works</hi> with a
very <hi>inauspicious</hi> Sentence, telling us of King <hi>Iames</hi> his declaring his being
so much disinclined to <hi>Popery,</hi> because it holds Regicide <hi>and other grosser
Errors:</hi> as if it were possible for any man of Sense to call such an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
outragious Treasonable practice, an <hi>Error,</hi> or to range it in the
<pb facs="tcp:103047:32"/>
Class of <hi>Errors:</hi> or as if even any damnable <hi>Error</hi> or <hi>Heresy</hi> either could
be more <hi>gross</hi> than that.</p>
            <p>In the next Edition he a little mended the matter by saying, <hi>and other
gross Errors:</hi> but he afterward mended the <hi>Book</hi> to better purpose by
causing that <hi>Sentence</hi> to be quite left out.</p>
            <p>My intended <hi>Review</hi> of this <hi>Discourse</hi> that I lately acquainted the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
with, is mentioned particularly at the end of it (where I observe the
Customariness of <hi>Authors</hi> of large <hi>Discourses</hi> bestowing on them a short
<hi>Review</hi>) and do think that the <hi>Corroborating</hi> some of the various impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<hi>Calculations</hi> therein, relating to matters Political, may perhaps be of
publick use.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble my self with <hi>Corroborating</hi> any thing of the <hi>Plot</hi>
which hath so much weakened the Nation, nor with strengthening any
sayings of <hi>Witnesses</hi> that have weakened the Plot.</p>
            <p>Let about 2 or 3 Lines that I think in this large <hi>Discourse</hi> may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the propping up any little matter by citing for it the <hi>Plot-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
in general, take their Fate to be either remembred or forgot by
others as much as they are almost by me, and but one of whom is on
the Account of Testimony so much as named, and whose name hath
been mentioned in this <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor shall I have occasion to <hi>choque</hi> any Party (or as I may rather say
<hi>all</hi> Parties) with any thing of Controversy that may be called <hi>Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary:</hi>
or matters that refer not to numbers.</p>
            <p>But the fixing of <hi>Political</hi> Observations on numbers in some things so
great as I have attempted, is a Task very difficult for a person much Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to me in intellectual endowments, to do so clearly and satisfactorily as
the matter will bear; and is not possible to be done by any without the
Expence of that time in consulting <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Registries</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of
<hi>Accounts</hi> and many particular Persons, which I hitherto could not spare,
but hope to be shortly able to do for my <hi>Readers</hi> satisfaction as well as
my own: and having so done, I shall publish a <hi>Review</hi> of this <hi>Work</hi> by
it self, making such <hi>Additions</hi> or other Alterations as to what I have
here observed, as I shall see cause.</p>
            <p>And as I have shewed that Reverence to the Age as not to expose my
thoughts <hi>Magisterially</hi> of matters relating to <hi>Numbers,</hi> but have therein
either cited <hi>Authors</hi> of Note about the same, (that so their <hi>Credit</hi> may
vouch for the thing asserted and not mine) or have fairly my self <hi>Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi>
the things, or if I have omitted either to cite <hi>Authors,</hi> or to make
<hi>Calculation</hi> when I have asserted any thing relating to <hi>Numbers,</hi> I have
still endeavoured to keep within <hi>Compass</hi> and <hi>Bounds</hi> in my reckoning,
and not to favour my assertion by exceeding them, so I shall most readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on occasion acknowledge my <hi>mistake</hi> in any point however, or from
whomsoever arising: nor can any man (I think) be tempted to do other
in a matter of this Nature, and wherein his mistake amou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts not to any
thing like the making of false Money, or the designed putting it off in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
but only to the false telling of true; and which I desire the <hi>Reader</hi>
to <hi>tell</hi> after me as often as he pleaseth, and do wish him if ever he hopes that
men would receive the belief of matters of moment upon his Authority,
that he would first satisfie them that he hath implicitly believed no man:
and for which purpose I once writ my mind by a poor plain <hi>Verse</hi> in the
<hi>Album</hi> of a <hi>German</hi> on his importuning me there to write my name
with some saying or other, viz.</p>
            <q>

Is nulli credat, credi qui vellet ab omni;</q>
            <p>Meaning it, as to matters that may be reduced <hi>ad firmam,</hi> by <hi>Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember not that I have <hi>cited</hi> any <hi>Authors</hi> extravagant <hi>Calculation</hi>
or <hi>Error</hi> without somewhat of a fair <hi>Remark</hi> on it, and do suppose any
one to labour under a Disease of <hi>Credulity</hi> who doth otherwise: and do
account that <hi>Cicero</hi> himself was therewith infected when as to the <hi>Error</hi>
in a <hi>Childish</hi> Report he saith so gravely in his 2d Book <hi>De divinatione,
Tages quidam dicitur in agro Tarquiniensi cum terra araretur, &amp; sulcus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
esset impressus, extitisse repente &amp; eum affatus esse qui arabat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> to tell us this of <hi>Tages</hi> that Famous <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvian</hi>
Sooth-sayer, was not so much to be wondered at.</p>
            <p>Our Excellent <hi>Historian</hi> therefore of <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th, when he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that <hi>Harry</hi> the 7th left in his Coffers a <hi>Million and 8 hundred thousand
Pounds</hi> Sterling <hi>to</hi> Harry <hi>the 8th,</hi> and such as might be thought effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quadruple to so much in this age, did but right to his own Credit by
inserting the <hi>Clause</hi> of, <hi>if we may believe Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in <hi>p.</hi> 109 mentioned that when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the
<hi>Crown</hi> (which was in the <hi>year</hi> 1558) the <hi>Customs</hi> made not above
36000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and which I was induced to believe partly on the
relation of some whose Ancestors were Officers of the <hi>Customs</hi> in
her Reign, and whose Papers and Accounts they now have. But I
found after the <hi>printing</hi> of that <hi>Sheet,</hi> that I had made sure of being
within the <hi>Compass</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and likewise <hi>Modesty</hi> as to my <hi>Estimate;</hi>
and looking into my <hi>Notes</hi> out of <hi>Cambden</hi> about it, I found that about
the <hi>year</hi> 1590 and after all her <hi>Glories</hi> of 88, her <hi>Customs</hi> were <hi>farmed</hi>
but for 14 <hi>thousand Pounds</hi> Sterling a year.</p>
            <p>One would wonder that our great <hi>Oracle</hi> of the Law Sir <hi>E. Coke</hi> could
err so grossly by his <hi>Credulity</hi> and inadvertence as he did, when he tells
us 2. <hi>Instit.</hi> and <hi>de statuto Iudaismi,</hi> that from <hi>December</hi> 17th, <hi>An. 50.
Hen.</hi> 3. till <hi>Shrove-tide 2. Edv.</hi> 1. (which was about 7 <hi>years</hi>) the Crown had
4,20,000 <hi>l. 15s. 6d. Sterl. de exitibus Iudaeorum.</hi> And he there attempts
to prove it by <hi>Records</hi> and refers to <hi>Rot. patent. An. 3. E. 1. m. 17. 26.
Middleton reddit Computa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at the rate of <hi>Silver</hi> being now thrice in value <hi>per Ounce</hi> to what

            <p>I hope to be able in my intended <hi>Review</hi> to give some such further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications
of the numbers of the People of <hi>England</hi> exceeding all the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
of cautious <hi>Calculators</hi> I have referred to, as may be variously useful
to the publick, as well as perfectly satisfactory to the <hi>Curious,</hi> among

               <pb facs="tcp:103047:33"/>
I have mentioned before how some men of great <hi>Name</hi> have <hi>published</hi>
it, that they think the People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> are but 2 <hi>Millions:</hi>
and shall here take notice that a <hi>Book</hi> lately <hi>printed</hi> Entituled <hi>Isaaci Vossii
variarum observationum liber,</hi> and <hi>Dedicated</hi> to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> doth in <hi>p.</hi> 66
represent somewhat of the Judgment of that <hi>Learned</hi> Person (and who
in various sorts of <hi>useful</hi> Learning is deservedly held not inferior to any
one in <hi>Europe</hi>) relating to the <hi>Numbers</hi> of People in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,
Italy, England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland, Denmark, Sweeden,</hi> &amp;c. and where
the People in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are represented to be Two
<hi>Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But had he been so fortunate as to see some of the Manuscript <hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
of Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> giving an account of the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be about
11 <hi>hundred thousand</hi> after he had <hi>Surveyed</hi> that Kingdom as <hi>Surveyor</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and after he had critically perused all the <hi>Books</hi> relating to the
<hi>Chimney</hi> Money and the late <hi>Poles,</hi> and found that of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>
who paid their <hi>Pole-Money</hi> in the year 1661, the <hi>Number</hi> was 3,60,000,
I doubt not but he would have concurred in opinion with him of the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
of the Number of the People in <hi>Ireland:</hi> and I likewise believe that
if he had seen some <hi>late Estimates</hi> of the <hi>Numbers</hi> of People in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
made by inquisitive Persons born and bred in that Kingdom, he would
have been easily inclined to judge the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to
be at least 2 <hi>Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I think that Learned Man was much short in his <hi>Estimate</hi> of the
Numbers of People in his Majesties Realms, so I likewise think that he
was in that of the numbers of the People in <hi>France,</hi> in accounting them
to be but <hi>five Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> (I think) did very judiciously estimate <hi>France,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
us a 3d <hi>part</hi> in the number of People, as I have mentioned in this
<hi>Discourse:</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The reasonable defence of the seasonable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi>
answering a <hi>Romanist</hi> who asserted, that <hi>Popish Countries were as
populous as the Reformed,</hi> hath clearly enough shewn, <hi>that</hi> Englands <hi>not
being fully peopled is not to be attributed to the Reformation, but partly to
our being drained by our Plantations,</hi> &amp;c. and he saith in <hi>p. 31, If</hi> Spain
<hi>which hath Plantations be compared with us we are much more populous,
as we are also than</hi> Italy <hi>which hath none at all. 'Tis true</hi> France <hi>exceeds us
not having had that drain of Plantations till of late, and that sparingly in
respect of us; and possibly somewhat of the populousness of</hi> France <hi>may be
owing to the Reformation, as not obliging any to caelibate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Learned <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Reasonable Defence</hi> (who doth so
well and carefully weigh the Nations there in the Balance of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
had considered what hath been by Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> remarked in
his Excellent <hi>Survey of the Constitutions and Interests of the Empire,</hi> Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Denmark, Spain, Holland, France, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz. <hi>That the common People
of</hi> France <hi>are as little considerable in the Government as the Children, so that
the Nobless and the Souldiers may in a manner be esteemed the Nation,</hi> he
would have agreed that tho <hi>France</hi> may exceed us in the <hi>Numbers</hi> of our
<hi>People,</hi> it doth not in the <hi>weight</hi> of our <hi>Numbers</hi> (as I may say) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the considerable <hi>weight</hi> of our <hi>Common People</hi> in the <hi>Balance</hi> of the
<hi>State:</hi> and especially if he had likewise considered what the ingenious
<hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> called, <hi>The power of Parliaments,</hi> mentions in p. 162,
<hi>of the</hi> English (<hi>man to man) as allowable to be a third stronger than the</hi>
French: and so I believe generally <hi>Northern</hi> Nations may be allow'd to that
proportion to exceed <hi>Southern.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:34"/>
And here by the way it occurring to me that the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Defence</hi> hath in <hi>p.</hi> 24 took Notice of his <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Adversaries
<hi>instance</hi> of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Munster,</hi> as upon which <hi>so many Papist and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Princes, Noblemen and Gentlemen have either Bishopricks, Abbies
or the like</hi> CONFIRMED <hi>to them by the Pope</hi> (and to make out what
he had said that <hi>none but the Author of The seasonable Discourse fancies the
Pope cannot be tied to an agreement as well as other Governors</hi>) and that the
<hi>Author of The Reasonable Defence</hi> hath <hi>impugned</hi> that instance by saying,
<hi>But if after all this there be no such matter, if the Pope have been so far
from confirming those Grants as to protest against them by his Legate in the
Treaty, and afterward in a particular</hi> Bull <hi>hath damned them to the Pitt of
Hell, what shall we say to the honesty and credit of the Author,</hi> &amp;c. I am
glad that by my Historical <hi>Scheme</hi> of the <hi>factum</hi> of that <hi>Peace,</hi> I have done
that which may prevent both these <hi>Authors</hi> and other Persons from being
further mistaken therein.</p>
            <p>Most certainly (as I have shewn) the Pope did not by any Grant
CONFIRM them: but they may be truly said to have <hi>Confirmed</hi> the
<hi>Papal</hi> Religion, as far as the prevention of the Ruine of the <hi>Empire</hi> and
<hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
may be judged to have amounted to the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But that the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> did as
perfectly slight Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 10ths <hi>Bull</hi> of the <hi>Nullity of that Treaty</hi>
cited in the <hi>Margent</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The Reasonable Defence,</hi> as I have
mentioned the thing with Historical Truth, Arch-Bishop <hi>Brambal</hi> in p.
178, of his <hi>just Vindication of the Church of</hi> England speaking of that
Peace, and how thereby <hi>freedom</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> was secured to Protestants,
and <hi>Bishopricks</hi> and other <hi>Ecclesiastical Dignities conferred on them, and
that many Lands and other Hereditaments of great value were alienated
from the Church in Perpetuity, and yet the Popes</hi> Nuntio <hi>protested against it,</hi>
and having there in his <hi>Margent</hi> referred to the aforesaid <hi>Bull</hi> of Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi>
saith, <hi>yet the Emperor and the Princes of</hi> Germany <hi>stand to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
assert the Municipal Laws and Customs of the Empire, and assume to
themselves to be the only Iudges of their own Privileges and Necessities.</hi>
And moreover Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> in his said <hi>Survey of the Constitutions and
Interests of the Empire,</hi> writ in 1671, mentioning <hi>The Domestick Interest
of the Empire to be the limited Constitution of the Imperial Power, and the
Balance of the several free Princes and States of the Empire among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
saith, <hi>that those Interests have raised no doubt since the Peace of</hi>
Munster.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Iesuites</hi> make the Pope <hi>infallible,</hi> and some <hi>Anti-Papists</hi>
generally make him a meer <hi>natural</hi> Agent. that must always Act <hi>Ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremum
virium,</hi> I fear not to take a middle way, and to suppose him to be a
rational <hi>Animal,</hi> and one that knows when the <hi>Papacy</hi> is not to exert its
former Principles against the Power of Kings and lives of Hereticks,
and for this reason, namely, <hi>Quia deerant vires,</hi> and one who will not
do it for the Future in all places, <hi>Quia deerunt vires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is not to learn the reasonableness of that <hi>Gloss</hi> in his <hi>Canon</hi> Law,
that <hi>Canes propter pacem tolerantur in ecclesiâ,</hi> and especially when the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
<hi>Dogs</hi> are there the most numerous, nor needed he or the <hi>Popish</hi>
or Protestant <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> to have been minded of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Proverb so well known there, viz. <hi>Veel Honden Zyn de' haez d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Many Dogs are the Hares death,</hi> and that the old sport of <hi>hunting</hi> down
Hereticks with <hi>Crusado's</hi> was hardly practicable when both <hi>Popish</hi> as well
<pb facs="tcp:103047:34"/>
as <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes were weary of it, and that therefore according to the
saying, <hi>Difficile est ire venatum invitis Canibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was either the Pope or the Popish Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to be taught
that if ever there was to be that wild thing of a <hi>Crusado</hi> against <hi>Hereticks</hi>
again, better <hi>use</hi> might be made of them then by killing them: and that it
would turn to better <hi>Account</hi> to deal with them as <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> tells us
on the year 1250 (the time about which <hi>Crusado's</hi> were most in <hi>fashion,</hi> and
when <hi>Popes</hi> that had a mind to ravish the Regal Rights of Princes would
take an opportunity to do it by sending them on Fools Errands to the <hi>Holy
Land</hi>) that the Pope dealt with the many <hi>Pilgrims</hi> who were <hi>Cruce signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>
in an Adventure for that <hi>Land,</hi> namely, that he very fairly sold those
<hi>crossed Pilgrims</hi> for <hi>ready</hi> Money, <hi>as the Iews did their Doves and
their Sheep in the Temple.</hi> And if the 100,000 <hi>Hereticks</hi> that I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as slain by one <hi>Crusado</hi> had been sold but for
20 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling <hi>each,</hi> a fond might have been thereby provided for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoding
the <hi>Turk</hi> very much more than by the taking from him the
<hi>Holy Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Pope</hi> and those Popish Princes are sufficiently sensible of their
want of Power for any such Nonsensical Outrage: and I wish that our
<hi>English</hi> Owners of the <hi>Doctrine of Resistance,</hi> and who with <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
have agreed in that being the Cause of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to shake the <hi>Empire,</hi> namely, <hi>because they had not strength to do
it,</hi> were but as sensible as the Papacy is of their wanting <hi>strength</hi> to do it
in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No marvel therefore that the <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus</hi> in his <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Nullity</hi>
did not discharge the old <hi>Artillery</hi> of the <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> of
<hi>Anathemas,</hi> and the <hi>greater Excommunications</hi> against the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick</hi>
Crown'd Heads and Princes concerned in the <hi>Munster</hi> Peace,
as I have shewn, nor according to the <hi>Expression in the Reasonable Defence,
damned them to the Pitt of Hell for it.</hi> No; both the World and the
Papacy were so <hi>Metamorphosed,</hi> and their old <hi>fashions</hi> so far passed <hi>away,</hi>
that those <hi>Popish</hi> Crown'd Heads found that there was in this <hi>Bull</hi> only
what partly resembled that which <hi>Ovid</hi> tells us of in his <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi>
viz.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Est aliud levius sulmen, cui dextra Cyclopum</l>
               <l>Saevitiae flammaeque minus, minus addidit irae,</l>
               <l>Tela secunda vocant superi, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>But as I just now expressed my wishes that some of our <hi>English</hi> Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the <hi>Doctrine of Resistance,</hi> were as sensible of their wanting strength
to subvert the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Monarchy in <hi>England,</hi> as the Pope was of
his wanting it to break the Measures of the Crown'd Heads relating to
the <hi>Munster</hi> Peace, I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> expressed not only my <hi>hopes</hi> but
<hi>belief</hi> that <hi>nature</hi> it self which is thus always <hi>Acting</hi> to the <hi>extremity</hi> of
its <hi>Power,</hi> will overpower the <hi>Arts</hi> by which they have been seduced to
<hi>Principles</hi> for endeavouring it: and will render the <hi>Principles</hi> of many of
our <hi>Protestant</hi> Recusants coincident with those of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians,
instead of those of the Jesuites: and that this <hi>Storm</hi> which the World
hath brought on the <hi>Irreligionary</hi> part of <hi>their</hi> Principles as well as of
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (both of which have brought so many dismal <hi>Storms</hi> on the
World) will make them come to an <hi>Avarage,</hi> and to submit to the casting
many of their Principles over-board as well as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
so to do by the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Vessel</hi> commanding the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:35"/>
And as in a <hi>Storm</hi> the very <hi>Victuals</hi> of the Mariners are often accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Maritime</hi> Law cast into the Sea to lighten the Vessel, it may
resemblingly be expected that many of our Dissenting Religionaries will
now part with some of those <hi>Principles</hi> that have in their Religion-Trade
afforded them a <hi>Subsistance;</hi> and that when they shall consider how this
present Pope, notwithstanding the <hi>Privilege</hi> of a <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Ship,</hi> by
which he may refuse to begin the <hi>Iactus</hi> by throwing out first his own
Wares and Goods, did about a year before he threw out the <hi>Lumber</hi> of
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Casuists,</hi> throw over-board a vast Treasure of Papal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi>
and by which the <hi>Ship</hi> of the Papacy was formerly <hi>victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was by the Popes <hi>Decree</hi> of the 7th of <hi>March</hi> 1678, that a <hi>Multitude
of Indulgences</hi> was <hi>suppressed;</hi> and the <hi>Names</hi> of 14 Famous <hi>Popes</hi> are there
mentioned as having granted some thereof: and great numbers of others
are by him quashed without mentioning the Popes by whom granted: and
there was a particular <hi>Clause</hi> in the <hi>Decree</hi> that did shake the whole Body
of <hi>Indulgences.</hi> And tho the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> hath been by many of the <hi>Vulgus</hi>
of Papists oftner pray'd to in <hi>Storms</hi> than the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and a printed Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<hi>Office</hi> called, <hi>The Office of the immaculate Conception of the most holy
Virgin our Lady approved by the Sovereign Pontiff</hi> Paul <hi>the 5th,</hi> had been
much in <hi>vogue</hi> in the <hi>Papal</hi> World, yet the Pope by his <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>February</hi>
the 17th, 78. damned that <hi>Office</hi> and (as I may say) threw it over board.
And of this the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Iulian the Apostate</hi> might have took notice if he
had pleased, when in his Comparison of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Paganism</hi> he instanced
in <hi>the transprosing</hi> of part of the <hi>Psalms</hi> to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> after the mode
of this Office that had been suppressed about 4 <hi>years</hi> before.</p>
            <p>The old stubbornness of Popes against the making any <hi>Reformation</hi> of
Abuses and Errors in their Church hath been commonly observed: but I
believe that considering the great Figure <hi>England</hi> makes in the World, it
may not be unlikely that the <hi>brisk</hi> Spirit of Opposition against Popery
that had displayed it self in <hi>England</hi> for about 8 years before the <hi>Plot-Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi>
and the sharp and learned Books that were in that Conjuncture print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here against the Abuses of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> might much contribute
to the laudable Proceedings of this Pope in those <hi>Decrees</hi> I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And therefore when Nature had thus enforced the Papal Chair in so
great a Measure upon Recantation, and a great deal of pretended infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libity
was thrown over-board, (and that even relating to some Principles
that might be called Religionary) it may reasonably be thought that the
same operation of Nature will produce among our little <hi>Protestant</hi> Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
a tacit renuntiation of the Irreligionary part of those very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that both the World and themselves must needs see they have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
from Popery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Complication</hi> of the Principles of Irreligion that hath <hi>joyned</hi> the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> Popery with that of our former <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Popery, hath long
been as <hi>visible</hi> as the great <hi>Isthmus</hi> (I spake of) that joyns the <hi>Mexican</hi>
and the <hi>Peruan</hi> parts of the new World: and as I being to <hi>explain</hi> as in a
<hi>Dictionary</hi> what I meant by <hi>Popery,</hi> I would not expose my self to the
Critical Religionary Controvertists by nicely <hi>defining</hi> Popery, (the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
being no less than a <hi>Rule</hi> in the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, that <hi>omnis definitio in
jure Civili periculosa est, parum est enim ut non subverti possit</hi>) but gave the
<hi>Description</hi> of my sense of it as before in this <hi>Preface,</hi> so if I were to give
a <hi>Description</hi> of our <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery as Covenanted to be here <hi>introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
I would take the said <hi>Description</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> and only <hi>mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:35"/>
say that by <hi>Presbytery</hi> I mean <hi>the power of our Presbyters in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Creeds and Doctrines and Rules of Divine Worship on men, and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
jurisdiction interloping in that of our Princes and their Laws, and the
doing this by the Charter of</hi> Jus Divinum <hi>and as they are Christs pretended
Vicars,</hi> and do account that its intended <hi>Arbitrariness</hi> here in <hi>England</hi>
justly appeared as <hi>terrible</hi> as that of Popery, and that our Consciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enslaved to a <hi>Foreign</hi> Bishop is not more inglorious than their being so
to our fellow Subjects, and that a <hi>blush</hi> being <hi>divided</hi> among <hi>ten thousand</hi>
Ecclesiasticks after they had out-raged our Laws and our Consciences,
would have here been no more seen by us than one at <hi>Rome</hi> on occasion of
any Popes there blushing after they had so done.</p>
            <p>I have observed in this <hi>Discourse</hi> how that part of Presbytery that
may (tho erroneous) be called <hi>Religionary</hi> as practised in some <hi>Foreign</hi>
Churches, hath here decayed and must so naturally more and more: and
was glad to hear, That since the putting the Laws in Execution against
Protestant <hi>Recusants,</hi> those of them who were called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have,
on <hi>recollection</hi> of thought, and after Conference had with our <hi>Divines</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
their former <hi>Schismatical</hi> Separation from our Churches, and that
particularly in our <hi>Metropolis</hi> they have in all things been <hi>ameinable</hi> to the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> except as to the submitting to
have their <hi>Children</hi> baptized with the use of the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> there,
and their <hi>Superstition</hi> in not complying with which will I hope not be
long <hi>lifed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The gradual encrease of the <hi>Christenings</hi> in some <hi>Parishes</hi> in the <hi>Country</hi>
that I have seen Accounts of, (and in which places the <hi>Dissenters</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were very numerous) hath been to a far greater <hi>Proportion</hi> than the
gradual Encrease by me remarked as to <hi>London,</hi> and within the same
years. And a Learned <hi>Divine</hi> who is Minister of a Parish not far
from <hi>London</hi> hath acquainted me, That the number of Communicants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there about the beginning of those <hi>years</hi> but a 100, hath since arisen
to 400: and I believe that generally the numbers of Conformists may
have much encreased in the Country beyond the proportion of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in the <hi>City,</hi> and may probably do so for some years.</p>
            <p>Tho there are several Merchants and rich Traders in our <hi>Metropolis</hi>
who are <hi>Dissenters,</hi> yet I have observed, that <hi>the gross of their numbers
consists there of ordinary Retail-traders:</hi> and as these have been naturally
Sufferers there by the Cities so much removing <hi>Westward,</hi> and by the
<hi>Retail-trade</hi> being so much gone to the other end of the <hi>Town</hi> (and
are likely so to be more and more) so it hath been and will be natural to
them to be more and more querulous: according to the saying of, <hi>Omne
invalidum est Querulum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this Case it will be natural to them both to support their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
Trade by Religionary Combinations, and perhaps to fancy <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
it self <hi>breaking</hi> together with their <hi>Bankrupsy,</hi> and both for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soling</hi>
one another as <hi>Socii doloris,</hi> and likewise relieving one another
thereby, to endeavour to keep Heterodox Religionary <hi>Societies</hi> as long
and as much as they can.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Necessity,</hi> the known Mother of <hi>Industry,</hi> must naturally in time
cure them of their Poverty and Temptation to <hi>Heterodoxy</hi> thereby.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Quakers</hi> are by many thought to be a kind of a <hi>Roma subterranea,</hi>
but whether <hi>justly</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> I enquire not: nor shall I give my opinion in it
till the <hi>Principles</hi> of their <hi>Light within</hi> shall be exposed to that <hi>without;</hi>
many of which <hi>Principles</hi> have hitherto been by them kept as hid from
<pb facs="tcp:103047:36"/>
the World as were the <hi>Subterraneous</hi> Lights preserved in the <hi>Roman</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and as to which <hi>Principles</hi> they are perhaps conscious that when
they shall be exposed to the Air and Light of the Sun, they will be as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
extinguished as those Monumental Lights were when occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought into the open Air.</p>
            <p>But one of their known <hi>Tenets</hi> being <hi>the unlawfulness of Oaths,</hi> I account
they have an advantage thereby beyond the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Independents</hi>
in their Claim to <hi>Indulgence,</hi> by demanding it in a <hi>Doctrinal</hi> point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gnus vindice nodus,</hi> by reason of some <hi>words</hi> in the 5th of
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and 5th of St. <hi>Iames</hi> seeming <hi>primâ facie</hi> very <hi>emphatically</hi>
and <hi>vehemently</hi> to forbid all manner of <hi>swearing,</hi> as the <hi>Commentators</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
observe.</p>
            <p>And in this <hi>point</hi> they are entituled to a very true and great Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
because, of the very false <hi>Comments</hi> so many <hi>true Protestant would-be's</hi>
Actions have made on their great promissory <hi>Oaths</hi> beforementioned:
and for that they have not out-raged their Natural <hi>Allegiance</hi> by <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,</hi>
as many other Dissenters have done. If therefore to those <hi>Yea and
Nay Men,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> should grant such a <hi>Charter</hi> as the men of <hi>Rippon</hi> had
from King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> namely, <hi>Quod homines sui Ripponienses sint credendi
per suum</hi> yea <hi>&amp; per suum</hi> nay, <hi>in omnibus querelis &amp; curiis licet tangentibus
Freed-mortel,</hi> &amp;c. I should not grudge it them.</p>
            <p>And to speak frankly, I know not but this their <hi>sullen</hi> Principle may be
subservient to some great Birth of <hi>Nature,</hi> that may happen perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an Age or two, when shame may in the more populous World have so
far exterminated <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Cozenage</hi> and the danger of <hi>Perjury,</hi> as that
the manner of our <hi>Oaths</hi> Assertory before Tribunals may grow obsolete:
a thing I account not altogether <hi>improbable,</hi> since I my self observed that
in a <hi>Case</hi> that happened before some of the greatest <hi>Peers</hi> of the <hi>Realm,
Authorised</hi> to <hi>give</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> as being the Lords <hi>Commissioners</hi> of <hi>Prizes</hi> in
the first <hi>Dutch</hi> War, it appeared that there was somewhat in <hi>Nature</hi>
that had greater <hi>weight</hi> than an <hi>Oath</hi> among some men, namely, <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
for many <hi>Merchants</hi> being present at a <hi>sitting</hi> of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one of them claiming a <hi>Ship</hi> and <hi>lading</hi> before them as wholly belonging
to <hi>Hamburgers,</hi> and shewing himself ready to <hi>swear</hi> the same before their
<hi>Lordships,</hi> one of the <hi>Lords</hi> asking him <hi>if he would on his Reputation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that no Subject of the States of</hi> Holland <hi>was as Proprietor therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi>
he refused to do it.</p>
            <p>But before this <hi>Golden</hi> Age of Morality may come, and the bending
<hi>Leaden-rule</hi> of <hi>Oaths</hi> hath been laid aside, I expect that the Names of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of our <hi>Religionary</hi> Parties will be forgotten, and be as insignificant
as the word <hi>Lollards</hi> and <hi>Lollardies,</hi> and to <hi>suppress</hi> which every <hi>High
Sheriff</hi> is still bound to by his <hi>Oath,</hi> and who perhaps may think that
the <hi>Lollards</hi> were <hi>Papists</hi> or some <hi>Heterodox</hi> People or other.</p>
            <p>And therefore were I Master of never so much leisure I would bestow
no part of it on the writing against those <hi>Religionary</hi> Errors that have
been so often confuted, and especially when I see the <hi>Circumvallations</hi> of
<hi>Nature</hi> so carefully wrought in its <hi>Siege</hi> against them, as that it cannot

all the <hi>Penal</hi> Laws against <hi>Protestant</hi> Recusants and <hi>Recusancy,</hi>
our pious <hi>Princes</hi> have without any general Relaxation or <hi>Suspension</hi> of
those Laws, shewn signal favours and indulgences to many particular
Persons who appeared to the Eye of the State to be really Conscientious
and to hold no <hi>Principles</hi> that would create disturbance to it.</p>
            <p>And as I have mentioned that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was particularly indulged, so I
might likewise Assign many other <hi>instances</hi> of this Nature, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the known Letter of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th to <hi>Cranmer</hi> to omit some
<hi>Rites</hi> in the Consecration of Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi> and of some Indulgences in

the First's, in favour of <hi>particular</hi> Protestant as well as <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants.
And to this purpose the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hildersham,</hi> one of the
most Eminent <hi>Divines</hi> that <hi>Puritanism</hi> had bred, mentions that on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of points relating to <hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> he was very frequently <hi>suspended
ob officio &amp; beneficio,</hi> and very frequently restored to the same: and the
same thing appears in the life of Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> an <hi>Antesignanus</hi> among them:
and both these <hi>Divines</hi> in their printed <hi>Writings</hi> asserted the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of their Loyalty and impugned the Doctrine of <hi>Resistance,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
some others of the Puritan <hi>Divines</hi> did, and were therefore particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
indulged. And Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> shewed himself extremely <hi>partial</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on the Government as he did in his Seditious Book called, <hi>The
Popish Royal Favourite,</hi> by not taking notice of the Relaxation of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws made in the Case of particular Loyal <hi>Puritans</hi> and Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
as well as in the Case of particular Loyal <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Government thought it so often necessary for its safety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
its <hi>particular</hi> Indulgences granted to <hi>Hildersham</hi> and <hi>Dod</hi> (for the
<hi>former</hi> being silenced in <hi>Iune</hi> 1590, and restored in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1591, was

<hi>Iune</hi> 1625 restored to preaching, was in <hi>March</hi> 1630 was again silenced; and
the latter of them found the like vicissitude of favours and punishments

their former Principle of the <hi>Doctrine of Resistance</hi> (and who did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the toleration of any Heterodox Religionaries in their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
restrain them to a number only of <hi>four</hi> other Persons to be
present) seemed with the mixture both of tenderness to the Consciences
of those Religionaries, and likewise to the publick Peace, to draw the <hi>Copy</hi>
of that <hi>Modus</hi> of their limited Toleration, in some sort after the great
<hi>Original</hi> of the old Decree at <hi>Rome</hi> against the <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> and by which
it was or dered that they should not as before be observed at <hi>Rome</hi> or

<pb facs="tcp:103047:37"/>
of <hi>four</hi> Persons being present any where that held any <hi>Principles</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of Monarchy, and that inclined them to <hi>sacrifice</hi> our Princes and
Laws as formerly, they would have accounted those <hi>four</hi> too many to be
tolerated. And the dreadful Out-rage the Government conflicted with,
when <hi>Venner</hi> and the other few <hi>Fift-Monarchy</hi> men came out of the <hi>Tiring
house</hi> of a private Religionary <hi>Meeting</hi> in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> to <hi>Act</hi> the part of

whose <hi>Principles</hi> are not known, being trusted together with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Yet after all this, as once in a little Nominal <hi>Parliament</hi> we had in the
the time of the <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> it was ordained, That <hi>all Persons that could
speak should speak the</hi> enjoyned <hi>words of Matrimony,</hi> and that <hi>all that had
hands should there joyn hands,</hi> so I believe that in any future Conjuncture,
<hi>particular</hi> Persons, who by the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and by their being ready to attend our <hi>Divines</hi> for <hi>instruction,</hi> can
make it appear, <hi>that they have Consciences,</hi> will have no cause to complain
of their being not <hi>free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by an <hi>Accident</hi> of Moment that hath offered it self to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our <hi>Protestant</hi> Recusants, since the <hi>Epoche</hi> of <hi>Plots and Rumours
of Plots,</hi> I doubt not but they will find an imminent necessity to make it
demonstrable to the World, that they own no Principles destructive of
it: and that particularly the easie access that <hi>Witnesses</hi> have found to
<hi>Credibility</hi> on their swearing Plots against <hi>Iesuitick</hi> Popish <hi>Recusants,</hi> by
the <hi>Precipice</hi> of the Principles on which they stood being so conspicuous
to the World (and from whence the very <hi>breath</hi> of their Adversaries, of
how mean and despicable parts and fortunes soever, hath served to throw
them down headlong into ruine so easily) will be an effectual <hi>Document</hi> to
all Recusants who would prevent the danger from <hi>Plot-Witnesses,</hi> that the
very next thing to be done by them is their <hi>bearing their Testimony</hi> against
Principles of <hi>Dis-loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (to the <hi>Character</hi> of whose <hi>Loyalty</hi> and
<hi>Learning Christendom</hi> is no stranger) having his thoughts on the Wing,
and ready to take their Flight to that Region of Bliss where none are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
but Souls that part hence with a noble disposition to Charity for
all Humane kind, thought fit in his Prospect of that World and in the
great <hi>Interval</hi> of his <hi>Preparation</hi> for it, to send to the Press his <hi>Book</hi> called
<hi>His Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>printed</hi> in 1683, and in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of it to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his opinion to the Age and Posterity that ever since the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
there have been <hi>two Plots</hi> carried on by <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and that
the same would long continue.</p>
            <p>He had there mentioned Mr. <hi>Baxters justifying the late War,</hi> and quoted
him for saying, that <hi>as he durst not repent of what he had done in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
War, so he could not forbear the doing of the same if it were to do again
in the same state of things.</hi> 'Tis true indeed (saith the Bishop) <hi>he tells
us in the same place That if he were convinced he had sinned in what he had
done, he would as willingly make a publick Recantation as he would eat and
drink when he is hungry and thirsty. But neither he nor any of the</hi> Non-Conformists
<hi>that I have heard of, hath as yet made any such publick Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and therefore we may rationally and charitably enough conclude, That
they are still of the same Iudgment they were then, and consequently that their
Practice will be the same it was then when any opportunity invites them
to it,</hi> &amp;c. And then proceeds to say, <hi>For mine own part I must confess as
<pb facs="tcp:103047:37"/>
I always have been, so I am still of opini<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n that ever since the Reformation
there have been and are</hi> two Plots, <hi>carrying on sometimes more covertly, and
sometimes more secretly, the one by those that call themselves the only true
Catholicks, the other by those that call themselves the only true Protestants,
and both of them against the Government as it is Established by Law both
in Church and State: and as there always hath been, so there will be Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by both those Parties until both of them be utterly suppressed: for as
for making of Peace with either of them, I take it by reason of the perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the one, and peevishness of the other, and the Pride of both, a thing
not to be hoped for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much my poor Measures of <hi>Futurity</hi> do differ from his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,</hi>
in the Case of our Popish and Protestant Recusants, the Current
of my <hi>Discourse</hi> shews: and am sorry that he, having used this harsh
sounding word of <hi>Plots,</hi> described not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>particulars</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
relating to the time to come, and that he innodated in this his
<hi>Censure</hi> (as it were) the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> Religionary <hi>Parties,</hi> without
any exception of the <hi>Loyal</hi> in both.</p>
            <p>But I have observed it in a printed <hi>Letter</hi> of this Reverend <hi>Prelate</hi>
to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Anglesy,</hi> of the Date of <hi>Iuly</hi> the 4th, 1672. where having
spoke of <hi>the keeping out of Popery now it seems to be flowing in upon us</hi> (as
his words are) that he saith, <hi>You know what I was for in the late Sessions of
Parliament, I mean (not a Comprehension) but a Coalition or Incorporation
of the Presbyterian Party into the Church as it is by Law Established; and
I am still of the same opinion, that it is the one only effectual expedient to
hinder the Growth of Popery and to secure both Parties: and I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that there are no Presbyterians in the World (the</hi> Scotch <hi>only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
that would not conform to all that is required by our Church, especially
in such a Conjuncture of time as this is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Scope</hi> by quoting this <hi>Letter</hi> is to shew that about 10 <hi>years</hi> ago,
the <hi>Bishop</hi> was not of opinion that Nature had condemned the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
to eternal <hi>Plotting</hi> against the <hi>State,</hi> but that a <hi>Coalition</hi> between
that Party here and our Church, would then naturally happen: and as
to which I have shewn how far he was fortunate in that his Conjecture,
by the late great advance of those called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> toward <hi>Conformity,</hi>
and that therefore his <hi>Opinion</hi> varying in 83 from what it was in 72, as
to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> it might (had he lived longer to have writ again)
<hi>vary</hi> perhaps as to the Papists being <hi>Plotters</hi> with a <hi>Continuando,</hi> and he
might have <hi>recanted</hi> that opinion as much as he would have had Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
recanted his. And I would from that his <hi>Letter</hi> shew, that we have
the less reason to be mortified with the fear of the continuance of these
2 <hi>Plots,</hi> or to be tempted to uncharitable thoughts of the whole Body of
the <hi>Papists</hi> upon this <hi>Bishops</hi> opinion, as delivered in what I have cited
out of <hi>his Vindication,</hi> because one expression of it includes so much of
Humane Frailty and Error, <hi>viz.</hi> his Lordships saying, <hi>That he was ALWAYS
of opinion, that since the Reformation these two Plots were and would be, till
both the Parties were utterly disabled and suppressed;</hi> for when he writ
the said <hi>Letter,</hi> his <hi>Opinion</hi> appeared otherwise.</p>
            <p>And there is another <hi>use</hi> I would make of this Pious and Learned <hi>Prelates</hi>
having given such an <hi>Alarm</hi> to the World concerning the <hi>Plots</hi> of these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox
Religionaries in future time, and of his having made them <hi>as to
Disloyalty</hi> to be in a manner <hi>damnati antequam nati,</hi> and that is this: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That the only substantial thing that could give weight to this <hi>Censure</hi>
of these <hi>two</hi> Parties being their <hi>Principles,</hi> and that the great allowance
<pb facs="tcp:103047:38"/>
of this Bishops <hi>Opinion</hi> as <hi>Oracular</hi> by so many, being likely to throw so
much lasting <hi>Odium</hi> on the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Recusants
as Hostile to Church and State (whereby any disloyal <hi>Practices</hi> charged
on them by their Adversaries, tho perhaps very unjustly, will naturally
be the sooner and more easily believed, as I before hinted) it may
hence appear necessary for men to go, or run, and even fly from <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of Disloyalty as soon, and as fast, and as far as they can.</p>
            <p>But as I have here <hi>observed</hi> it to be the <hi>Interest</hi> of our <hi>Heterodox</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionaries
to disclaim all Principles that I called <hi>Convulsive</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> Society,
and the Concern of every <hi>Country</hi> to have those <hi>Principles</hi> notified (and as
fairly and particularly delineated and described as are the <hi>Beds</hi> of Sands and
<hi>shoaly</hi> places and rocky <hi>Bars</hi> of its <hi>Harbours</hi> and <hi>Sea-Coasts</hi> by <hi>Hydrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>)
so I shall likewise observe that the sharp Execution of any of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Laws hath not to the <hi>Factious</hi> among the Protestant <hi>Recusants</hi> appear'd
so afflictive as the <hi>publication</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> and printed <hi>Sayings</hi> of their
<hi>Pastors</hi> since 41, and the which seemed to be like the <hi>Doom</hi> of the Priests
in <hi>Malachy,</hi> namely, to have the <hi>Dung of their Solemn Feasts spread in
their Faces:</hi> nor could they call such usage of their <hi>Tenets, any Tryal of
cruel mocking,</hi> nor the Publishers any of <hi>The Mockers that should
be in the last times,</hi> since their very <hi>Sayings</hi> and <hi>Tenets</hi> have been plainly
and briefly published in their <hi>Authors</hi> own words and without Additta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>As to the Papal <hi>Tenet</hi> in the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, dilated on in the following <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi>
I have there in <hi>p.</hi> 181. sufficiently shewed my Aversion to contribute
any grief or trouble to <hi>Loyal</hi> Papists by the notifying the same in the hot
time of the late <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and while some factious <hi>Anti-Papists</hi> were
so busy in senseless <hi>Narratives</hi> to load a great Body of them with the guilt
of its Practice; and when I had any inclination to shew my self unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly
or ungenerously disposed, as to the Persons or Religion of <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholicks, I might with the expence of an hour or two's time have easily
gratified such a corrupt Humour, by descanting on this <hi>Tenet,</hi> among
the <hi>Pamphleteers</hi> and <hi>Sheet-Authors</hi> whose feet were accounted <hi>beautiful</hi>
by the <hi>Mobile,</hi> for any dirt their hands threw at the <hi>Papists,</hi> before the
<hi>Epoche</hi> of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> after the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament. And after the
restoring of the <hi>English</hi> Genius, or as I may say, of the <hi>English under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
to it self, that thereby happened, I account that the Notifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any <hi>Tenet</hi> chargeable on the <hi>Papacy</hi> or <hi>Presbytery</hi> referring to the
Measures of Loyalty, or preservation of the Rights of Civil Society,
could bring no damage in the least to any Recusants Person whatever it
might to his Erroneous <hi>Principle.</hi> And I having accounted it a kind of
<hi>nauseous</hi> superfluity to confute at large any one of the old <hi>Religionary</hi>
Controversies between our Church and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> was willing thus
to reserve the <hi>discussion</hi> of this <hi>Irreligionary</hi> Tenet (how proper soever
to be known) till some <hi>healing</hi> Conjuncture of time; and when I might
hope by discussing the same and thereby effectually satisfying any Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<hi>Excluders,</hi> that I was no Papist, to bespeak their Approach with
more Candour to my great <hi>Casuistical</hi> point <hi>discussed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have sufficiently shewn in this <hi>Preface</hi> how much it imports our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and Loyalty, to have the <hi>Fantome</hi> of the <hi>Iudicial</hi> Law exorcised
out of mens understandings, and am ashamed to think that <hi>Christians</hi> do
yet no more know the certain time of the Burial of that Body of <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Laws, than the <hi>Iews</hi> do the place where his deceased natural Body was
laid. I know that some of the old <hi>Schoolmen</hi> have told us that that <hi>Law</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:38"/>
was given only to the <hi>Iews:</hi> but when so many Popish <hi>Vniversities</hi> and
<hi>Casuists,</hi> told our <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th, That his <hi>Marriage</hi> was against the <hi>Law</hi> of
God, the World wanted teaching in this point: and the <hi>Tutelar</hi> Angels
even of Protestant Countries are still in effect put to it to contend with
the <hi>Devil</hi> about <hi>the Body of</hi> Moses <hi>his Law:</hi> and if any one hath a desire
to see the dreadful impressions that that Law hath so lately made abroad
in the World and here in <hi>England,</hi> and that have much de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Peculium Dei,</hi> where he hath given us very Learned Remarks, <hi>That many
unsound Iudaising Christians have still dreamed that the</hi> Mosaic Code <hi>was
yet in force, and that</hi> Carolostadius <hi>and</hi> Castellio <hi>about the time of the
Reformation asserted the Doctrine of the validity and indispensable Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the</hi> leges forenses <hi>of the</hi> Jews: <hi>and that many, tho they did not
assert the validity of the whole</hi> Mosaic Code, <hi>have yet asserted the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
obligation of some particular Laws in it, to the great scandal of the
Protestant name, and particularly that against Idolatrous Persons and Places the</hi>
Mosaic <hi>Laws are still in force: and that for want of distinguishing in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue
and the Laws which follow after it, many men have run into many
gross unfortunate Errors;</hi> and he hath there referred to the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

League <hi>and</hi> Covenant, <hi>which some have equalled to the</hi> Covenant <hi>of
Grace, and were wont to express themselves about it in the Text and Phrases
of the old Testament, which concerned the making, breaking or renewing of
that Political Covenant which God made with the People, and afterwards
with his Vice-Roys the Kings of the</hi> Jews: and <hi>to the specious popular Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
used by the former and later Rebels in Great</hi> Brttain, <hi>for Deposing

            <p>And under this head we might refer to the <hi>Covenant</hi> mention'd among the
<hi>Independent</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> one of the best of our late <hi>Independents,</hi> quoting <hi>Deut.
13. 6. If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. of his <hi>Irenicum</hi>
saith, <hi>Let not any put of this Scripture saying, this is in the Old Testament,
for we find the same</hi> thing, almost the <hi>same words used in a Prophecy of the
times of the Gospel.</hi> Zech. 13. 3. He saith indeed <hi>that by those words in</hi>
Deut. <hi>the meaning is not that his Father or Mother should presently run a
Knife into him, but that they should be the means to bring him to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
even the taking away his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> likewise in giving his sense of that <hi>place</hi> of <hi>Zechary</hi> foresaw the
<hi>Odium</hi> of having any killed without going to the <hi>Iudge,</hi> and there saith,
<hi>Multò hoc durius est, propriis manibus filium interficere, quam si ad Iudicem
deferrent.</hi> But here Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> have Categorically enough
asserted what the <hi>Iudges</hi> duty is in the Case, and I have said what <hi>Calvin</hi>
effected by going to the <hi>Iudge</hi> about <hi>Servetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:39"/>
               <hi>Gundissalvus</hi> doth not determine the lawfulness of burning an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
City without going to the <hi>Iudge;</hi> and the lawfulness of Protestant
Princes judging the Persons or Cities of Idolaters to be destroyed by the
pretended Obligation of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law, is chargeable on the <hi>Anti- Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
I have mentioned: and I believe there are few of our <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
or <hi>Independent</hi> Enthusiasts, but who think it as lawful to burn <hi>Rome</hi> as
to roast an Egg.</p>
            <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> abhorreth this <hi>flammeum &amp; sulphureum evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium:</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Iovian,</hi> taking notice of the
Reasons <hi>which the Papists urge for putting Heretick, and the scotising Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
for putting Popish Princes to death,</hi> saith thereupon, <hi>I desire
Mr.</hi> J. <hi>to tell me, Whether he thinks in his Conscience, the Bishops of the
Church of</hi> England <hi>could argue so falsly upon the Principles of the Iewish</hi>
Theocracy <hi>to the like proceedings in Christian States?</hi> And saith, <hi>if this
way of arguing be true, then the Queen</hi> (meaning Queen <hi>Elizabeth) was
bound to burn many Popish Towns in her Kingdom and smite the Inhabitants
with the Sword,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have therefore thought it Essential to the advancement and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> to endeavour to have the <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Error as
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Laws exterminated.</p>
            <p>And the setling of this point is the more important to the Measures of
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> because the same <hi>Chapter</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> viz. the 13<hi>th,</hi> that hath
been the Popes <hi>Palladium</hi> for his power of firing Heretical Cities, hath
likewise been made use of by our deluded <hi>Excluders,</hi> as theirs to recur to
in a practice so scandalous to Loyalty and to the Protestant Religion,
and which hath too much appeared in the many Factious <hi>Pamphlets</hi> for the
<hi>Exclusion;</hi> and as I hinted that that <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> was impiously
applied in a former <hi>Conjuncture,</hi> for putting the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to death,
so the pretended lawfulness of the <hi>Exclusion</hi> by arguing from the greater
to the less, was by the deluded generally inferred from that <hi>Chapter:</hi> and
the place I just now referred too in the <hi>Preface</hi> of <hi>Iovian,</hi> mentions, Mr.
<hi>I's</hi> arguing from <hi>Deut. 13. 6. If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother,</hi> &amp;c.
in citing of which (saith the <hi>Dr.</hi>) it is evident on whom our Author
did reflect.</p>
            <p>The very <hi>exposing</hi> the <hi>absurdity</hi> of the Papal power of destroying He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Persons and Cities on the account of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law, will (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
as by <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>sober</hi> of all <hi>Parties</hi> much help to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the aforesaid Error, which hath cost the <hi>Papacy</hi> so dear, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tempted so many <hi>Calvinists</hi> to own the same Error, partly by way of
<hi>retaliation,</hi> and not altogether through defect of Judgment: and I doubt
not but if the <hi>Papacy</hi> were now to begin to claim the <hi>allowance</hi> of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Jurisdiction over all <hi>Christians</hi> in the World as the <hi>High Priest</hi>
did over all proselyted to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion (and as appears by not
only the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Palestine,</hi> but others of the most remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and particularly by the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subjection to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priesthood) it would stop at the Conquest of
that <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Power, and <hi>Tenths</hi> of the <hi>Levites</hi> thereby, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the <hi>Power</hi> to destroy Hereticks Towns, and to exterminate the
Persons of Hereticks by <hi>Crusado's,</hi> as other <hi>dependencies</hi> on it. But the
Papacy hath long ago passed that bloody <hi>Rubicon</hi> of the <hi>Iudicial</hi> Law,
and cannot in <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Politicks</hi> go back: nor will any Pope expressly
renounce the Power of compelling Princes to <hi>exterminate</hi> their Heretical
Subjects, tho yet the <hi>Fashion</hi> of the <hi>exercise</hi> of this <hi>Power</hi> be thus as I
<pb facs="tcp:103047:39"/>
have shewed, <hi>tacitly</hi> passed <hi>away,</hi> and as a thing necessarily <hi>impracticable</hi>
in the more populous World.</p>
            <p>And no <hi>Iesuited</hi> Papist dares <hi>disclaim</hi> this Power in the <hi>Pope's</hi> behalf
or impugn the same; however it was a thing that the Pope could not
but fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee, that his <hi>quashing</hi> the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Power to kill men by <hi>retail,</hi>
would render the <hi>Iesuites</hi> averse from writing for his Power to kill Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
by <hi>whole-sale</hi> and by <hi>Crusado's,</hi> or for the power to fire Heretical
Cities, if there were occasion to have any such power asserted in behalf
of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as I believe there neither is nor ever will be. But partly
according to my <hi>Conjecture</hi> of the <hi>Result</hi> of the <hi>Fermentation</hi> about the
<hi>Regale</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> I suppose that tho the Papacy will no more be
brought to <hi>disclaim</hi> its pretended Monarchy over other parts of the World
<hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> than the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> will the <hi>Title</hi> of their
being Kings of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> yet it will be neither able or studious to prosecute
its <hi>Claim</hi> of such power by disordering the World as formerly.</p>
            <p>All the personal Vertue and Probity of any Popes will never incline
them to pronounce against their <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> however they may thereby,
and by want of strength to execute it, be kept from the old injurious <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliating</hi>
it; and on this slippery <hi>Precipice</hi> the <hi>Papacy</hi> still remains, and
from whence through the natural Jealousie of <hi>Crown'd</hi> Heads and <hi>States</hi>
in the point of <hi>Power,</hi> it will probably fall down to its tame <hi>principium
unitatis,</hi> and its <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Figure, and in time to nothing.</p>
            <p>But by many of the Anti-papal Sects, and such as call themselves <hi>The
only true Protestants,</hi> still owning the Obligation of the <hi>Iewish</hi> forinsec
<hi>Laws,</hi> a Necessity is by God and Nature put on the <hi>Protestants</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to Combat such pretended <hi>Obligations</hi> by dint of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and thereby to support the <hi>Rights</hi> of their <hi>Princes</hi> without <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Reserve,</hi> and which no Jesuited Papists or Protestants either can or
will do.</p>
            <p>Nor is it safe for <hi>other</hi> Papists to own Principles that touch the Pope's
imaginary Monarchal Power. For <hi>Power</hi> how <hi>fantastick</hi> soever, would
seem a serious thing and will endure no <hi>raillery,</hi> and the honest Father
<hi>Caron</hi> whom I have mentioned as citing 250 Popish <hi>Authors</hi> who denied the
<hi>Pope's</hi> Power to <hi>depose</hi> Princes, doth tell us, that the Pope's <hi>Nuntio</hi> and 4
<hi>Popes</hi> condemned his Doctrine, and the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> damned his <hi>Book,</hi> and his
<hi>Superiours</hi> his <hi>Soul,</hi> I mean, they very <hi>fairly</hi> excommunicated him for it.</p>
            <p>There is another thing that may render the knowledge of this Papal
<hi>Tenet</hi> worthy of the entertaining our Curiosity, tho we are past its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and that is what occurs to me that I lately mentioned in a Discourse
I had with an intelligent Person of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who saying to
me that there was one <hi>part</hi> of the barbarous Out-rage of the <hi>Gun-powder
Treason,</hi> which was very scandalous to Humane Nature, and which he
thought could not be pretendedly legitimated by any Papal <hi>Principles,</hi>
namely that part of the Out-rage, that related to the designed destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of so many Magnificent Piles of Building, and of the adjacent
City of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the lifes of thousands of Men, Women, and
Children with one Cruel Fatal Blow, I gave him an account of the <hi>Tenet</hi> in
the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, grounded on the 13th of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> so fairly and fully
discussed in the following <hi>Discourse,</hi> and whereby I satisfied him about the
<hi>Principle</hi> that pretended to legitimate that part of the <hi>Out-rage:</hi> and do
assure any man that as arbitrary as the <hi>Papacy</hi> ever was, it yet was so just
as to inflict no kind of punishment on <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Communities</hi> that was not
in its <hi>Sanctions</hi> intimated and for what Crimes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103047:40"/>
I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> render'd some of our late <hi>Fift-Monarchy</hi>
men <hi>Principled</hi> for all Villany imaginable, and justly Convicted and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
for a design to fire our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and in which design they had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
contrived to have backed their Out-rage with the terror of Armed
Forces, nothing of which appeared in the <hi>Case</hi> of the two poor <hi>French</hi>
Papists charged with the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Fact, and beyond which least of
numbers it is not in this <hi>Discourse</hi> extended: and as to those two Persons,
there being then open <hi>War</hi> between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> it may be said,
that the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> might be out of the <hi>Case</hi> of any thing done
by such as were <hi>justi hostes,</hi> as the Laws term them, however I yet think
that none concerned in the Government of that Nation, would then be
so barbarous as to design us such an Out-rage.</p>
            <p>Moreover I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> said, that I will not charge the <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance</hi>
of this <hi>Tenet</hi> on the generality of Papists either at home or abroad,
and <hi>that no un-jesuited Papist nor perhaps some</hi> sober Party <hi>in that</hi> Order
<hi>would think the worse of me for calling the</hi> Decretum <hi>of the Popes Canon
Law, by reason of its empowring him thus to burn Cities,</hi> horrendum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretum.</p>
            <p>And because my knowing of this Papal <hi>Tenet,</hi> as founded on the <hi>Iudicial</hi>
Law, made me, after the beginning of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> to surmize, that more
Papists might possibly be concerned in this Out-rage than really were, and
so in my balancing the actings of some Loyal Protestant Recusants in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with some Dis-loyal ones of some Popish Recusants there and here,
I mentioned the Out-rage on the <hi>Metropolis</hi> as done by Papists, (<hi>i. e.</hi> by
<hi>Papists,</hi> and not by <hi>Protestants,</hi> and as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> mentioned that
<hi>Harry</hi> the 4th <hi>was murdered by the Papists,</hi> that is not by the <hi>Huguenots</hi>)
I yet thought my self bound in Christianity and Moral Justice to shew my
self so far from being in the least misled by the scandalous and incoherent
<hi>Narratives</hi> that reflected on a great body of the Papists, as concerned in
such a horrid Fact, and particularly by that whose <hi>Author</hi> in a <hi>Plot</hi> with
<hi>Booksellers</hi> had stole his <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>London</hi> out of old printed <hi>Examination</hi>
before a <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that I have shewn the <hi>ridiculousness</hi> of
the <hi>palmare argumentum</hi> of the <hi>Populace,</hi> and cryed up as so unanswerable,
to prove that very many Papists designedly fired the City, and which
<hi>Argument</hi> I have not met with exposed to contempt by any other Person,
and which had so far happened to work on the understanding of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
man who employed himself in writing the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
since the King's Restoration, that he had been likely, but for my shewing
him the Childishness of his Error, to have sent it to Posterity with a
<hi>Crown,</hi> instead of a <hi>Fools Cap</hi> on its head.</p>
            <p>And tho I have rendred the same <hi>Tenet</hi> of firing Heretical Cities, that
is in the Pope's Canon Law founded on <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> chargeable on our late
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> I have exempted the Persons of such our Protestant <hi>Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,</hi>
from any guilt of an Out-rage against our <hi>Metropolis</hi> as <hi>Idolatrous:</hi>
for whatever their <hi>Principles</hi> are, there is yet another sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi>
prevalent among them as all Religionaries (and which I have referred to)
namely <hi>Covetousness,</hi> that would secure them from firing their own
Nests.</p>
            <p>But here while I am troubling my self to do right to <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi>
I cannot without all the <hi>horror</hi> and <hi>detestation</hi> imaginable call
to mind how a vile traiterous Subject of his <hi>Majesties,</hi> who presumed to
call himself <hi>the Protestant Ioyner,</hi> was so far transported with Madness
and Fury, as to the scandal of Religion and Loyalty and common Sense,
<pb facs="tcp:103047:40"/>
with the guilt or that Fire to reproach his <hi>Prince,</hi> whose Reign had so
long signalized it self, with such a Father-like tenderness for all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
And yet in the TRYAL of that <hi>Monster</hi> of <hi>Calumny,</hi> his slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
his Prince thus with so much desperate and ridiculous Molice was
in <hi>proof.</hi> And ridicu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous it may well be called: for what could be more
remote from the least shadow of possibility, than a Prince of such Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Wisdom and known great Abilities, firing <hi>his</hi> own <hi>Chamber,</hi> and
destroying his Revenue, and vastly impoverishing the People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
weakening himself in the <hi>Flagrancy</hi> of <hi>War</hi> between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland?</hi> It is absolute dotage and <hi>Bedlam</hi>-madness
to imagine, that any one interested in the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and its being a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> could be in the least a well wisher to such
an Out-rage. The very <hi>Fift-Monarchy</hi> men, who designed it, were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>Paupers,</hi> and the two <hi>French-men</hi> were no better.</p>
            <p>But Justice found out that <hi>Shimei,</hi> who thus outragiously slandered the
<hi>Lord's Annointed:</hi> and may all such his incorrigible <hi>Enemies</hi> be <hi>cloathed</hi>
with <hi>shame;</hi> and let them see that tho Heaven doth not think fit always to
<hi>hide</hi> Princes <hi>from the scourge of the Tongues</hi> of men of <hi>Belial,</hi> yet at the same
time it sheweth some tender regard of the <hi>honour</hi> of Crown'd heads, by
abandoning the dis-loyal to reproach them with impossibilities.</p>
            <p>It was observed by the late <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Winchester</hi> in his printed <hi>Sermon</hi>
before the <hi>King</hi> on the 5th of <hi>November,</hi> p. 18. That <hi>the Doctrines among
the Dissenters that tend to Sedition and Rebellion, seem to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and borrowed from the Church of</hi> Rome: but his <hi>Lordship</hi> in the
same <hi>Page,</hi> having before spoke of those <hi>Doctrines,</hi> said, That <hi>if they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and practised they must necessarily produce Confusion among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet having a regard to the Piety and Peaceableness of some <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
and considering how long many of them had been trained up to <hi>Principles</hi>
of <hi>Loyalty</hi> before they went off from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
have the better hopes of their not being able to believe the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Resistance</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> convulsive of <hi>Civil Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we have of late found cause to judge, that that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and those
Principles have been believed and practised by others of them, and with
such <hi>Artifice</hi> to amuse and divert the <hi>incautelous</hi> Loyal from the <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
thereof, as was practised by several of the <hi>Papists</hi> a little before the
<hi>Gun-powder Treason:</hi> for as at the end of the Papists <hi>supplication to the King
and the States of the Parliament</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1604, they undertake <hi>that as
to the Loyalty of their Priests, they shall readily take their Corporal Oaths
for continuing their true Allegiance to his Majesty or the State, or in Case
that be not thought assurance enough, that they shall give in sufficient Sureties,
one or more, who shall stand bound life for life for the performance of the said
Allegiance; and further, that if any of their number be not able to put in
such Security, that then they will all joyn in such supplication to the Pope for
recalling such Priests out of the Land</hi> (and thus by the <hi>Offer</hi> of <hi>Security</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to lull the <hi>State</hi> in a secure sleep and dream of their Loyalty)
so have many of our <hi>Protestant would-be's</hi> by the publication of their
NO PROTESTANT PLOT, so lately before their plotted Out-rage,
done what was <hi>tantamount</hi> to keep our <hi>Country</hi> from being awake to
observe the <hi>March</hi> of their <hi>Principles,</hi> till it should be surprized with the
suddenness of <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Alarm when it came to be said, <hi>The true Protestants
are upon thee,</hi> I mean those who falsly call themselves so.</p>

I know no true Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> owning a greater propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to afford favour to Heterodox Religionaries, in points <hi>denominable</hi>
by <hi>Religion,</hi> than what my natural temper and habitual inclination
prompt me to. And tho some men are apt to have a sharper regret against
others for differing from them in <hi>judgment,</hi> than for a material <hi>injury,</hi>
I am naturally so far from such an humour, as to be more pleased with,
and to think my self better diverted by the Conversation of the Learned,
whose <hi>Sentiments</hi> differ from mine in most points <hi>Philosophical</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the ingenious <hi>Maimbourg</hi> would scorn to keep him Company.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>present</hi> State of <hi>Christendom</hi> making <hi>Loyalty</hi> a <hi>Vertue of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
here in <hi>England,</hi> (as I have shewn in this <hi>Discourse</hi>) I would abhor
the Conversation of any <hi>Dissenter</hi> I thought Dis loyal, as of a Person not
only <hi>wicked</hi> but <hi>stupid:</hi> and <hi>on this Rock</hi> (as I may say) of <hi>Loyalty</hi>
being likely so long to continue Essential to our continuing a Nation,
have I built my <hi>Conjecture</hi> of the <hi>future</hi> happy <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a possible thing that the serenity of its Future State may be for
some little time over-cast by Clouds of Discontent, if the <hi>Balance</hi> of
<hi>Trade</hi> should long continue to be against us, and that then forlorn <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>
instead of fearing <hi>Popery</hi> would for a while fear nothing at all:
for <hi>Nescit plebs jejuna timere.</hi> But I have cited the <hi>Observator</hi> on the
<hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> for accounting not above <hi>one</hi> in 4000 to have starved;
and I having in <hi>p.</hi> 185 cited the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Britannia languens,</hi> for saying,
that <hi>he heard of no new improving Manufacture in</hi> England <hi>but that of Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs,</hi>
did give my Judgment, that the <hi>Ebb</hi> of our <hi>Trade</hi> hath been at
the lowest point, <hi>and that Nature will necessarily hasten its improvement:</hi>
and having observed in <hi>p.</hi> 66, that <hi>after a long Age of Luxury a contrary
humour reigns as long in the World again,</hi> I have said that <hi>of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
humour I think we now see the Tide coming in,</hi> and have assigned <hi>one</hi>
late <hi>Woollen</hi> Manufacture, by which <hi>England</hi> hath gained <hi>double</hi> as much
as for 76 <hi>years,</hi> it lately did by the <hi>Balance</hi> of <hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any one of our <hi>true Protestant</hi> Plotters should be supposed ever
to inveigle any of the poorer <hi>Mobile</hi> to fly out into tumultuous Disorder
or Commotion, any such Commotion making an <hi>Exception</hi> from my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s necessary future <hi>pacific</hi> State, would both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>firmare regulam,</hi> and make the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Loyal <hi>Populace</hi> so
keen against all <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Resistance,</hi> as to <hi>exterminate</hi>
the same from our Soyl for ever, and to deter men as much from daring
to propagate the same in <hi>England,</hi> as in those two most Famous <hi>Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
of Heterodox Religionaries, I mean <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any one who will accord with me how necessary it was for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of <hi>Dis-loyalty,</hi> that I should point out the fatal time when our
<hi>Trade</hi> was confounded, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1648: and any <hi>Reader</hi> of this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
will find the obvious way mentioned, how a Child of <hi>ten</hi> years of
Age may know when the <hi>Balance</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> is against us, and how long
it hath been so, tho not to what proportion; and so whether I have been
too <hi>sanguine</hi> in my fancy by predicting in effect that it will be for us, and
long so continue, time will shew. But if I am out in my Measures as to
that <hi>point,</hi> I am sure the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will gain <hi>Cento
<pb facs="tcp:103047:41"/>
per Cento</hi> thereby, as to the <hi>point</hi> of their absolute usefulness; and necessary
encouragement under a Prince of what resolution soever; and upon a
wanton <hi>supposition</hi> that they had all withdrawn themselves to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
parts of the Earth, it would be any <hi>Princes</hi> interest to invite them
back again at any rate, and that for their persisting in the <hi>preaching up</hi> of
<hi>Loyalty</hi> as they have done for several years, and thereby so much helped
to preserve us from weltring in one anothers blood.</p>
            <p>It is excellently observed by <hi>Lucius Antistius Constans</hi> in his <hi>De jure
Ecclesiasticorum, that the CLERGY is necessary to console us with the
World to come, as to the hardships daily occurring to us in this, as well as to
direct us in our Course to that World.</hi> And if contrary to my expectation,
Heaven should think fit to punish the past <hi>Rebellions</hi> and present <hi>murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>
of so many of our Land, by any future diminution of our Trade
(and when we should be enforced to work the harder for the necessary
support of our Families and of the Government) 10000 <hi>Preachers</hi> of
<hi>Loyalty</hi> will be an useful Treasure both to the Prince and People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Church-History</hi> mentions, that in the <hi>year 1619, It was
complained of that the Grantees of Papists forfeitures generally favoured them
by Compositions for l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Prelate and the Prince,</hi> printed A. D. 1617. saith in the
<hi>Epistle</hi> Dedicatory to the <hi>English Catholicks, You have this long time suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as violent and furious a Persecution as ever the</hi> Jews <hi>did under an</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,
<hi>or the Primitive Christians did under a</hi> Nero, Domitian, Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,
Maximinian <hi>or</hi> Julian, <hi>and yet you see no end of this fury,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I would ask any Loyal <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, if a <hi>Clergy</hi> that could <hi>console</hi> such
<hi>Lachrymists</hi> and preach <hi>Loyalty</hi> to them, was not then necessary? And I
am sure he will say it was; for that the Doctrine <hi>preached</hi> by the <hi>Author</hi>
of that <hi>Book</hi> appeareth thus in the <hi>Contents</hi> of the <hi>Chapters</hi> after the end of
that <hi>Epistle,</hi> viz. <hi>Regal Power proceeds immediately from the Peoples Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Donation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By the Spiritual Power which Christ gave the Pope
in his Predecessor St.</hi> Peter, <hi>he may dispose of Temporal Things, and even of
Kingdoms for the good of the Church:</hi> and the many <hi>Republican</hi> and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<hi>Assertions</hi> in that <hi>Book</hi> are such, that any Asserters thereof would
in the judgment of our <hi>Loyal</hi> Populace, be thought to merit what the
<hi>Iews</hi> or Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> suffered as aforesaid. And that no man
dares now partly so <hi>fear</hi> of the Popular displeasure and being thought ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
say, that the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy is otherwise than from <hi>God</hi> and not
from <hi>Mens</hi> Election, just as <hi>for fear of the People,</hi> the chief <hi>Priests</hi>
and <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> durst not say that <hi>the baptism of Iohn</hi> was not
<hi>from Heaven</hi> but <hi>of men,</hi> is most eminently to be attributed to the late
Loyal Sermons made expressly of <hi>Loyalty</hi> by the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may draw toward an end of this long <hi>INTRODVCTION</hi>
or <hi>PREFACE</hi> (wherein yet if I have happened to acquaint any
<hi>Reader</hi> with any valuable <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> it will be the same thing to him as
the <hi>payment</hi> of a <hi>Bill</hi> of Exchange in the <hi>Portico</hi> or in the <hi>House</hi>) I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to say that by the <hi>inadvertence</hi> of an <hi>Amanuensis</hi> employed in
writing somewhat of this <hi>Discourse</hi> for the <hi>Press,</hi> there happened to be
several mistakes of words and names; and one of them I shall mention
here, and not trust to its being regarded among the <hi>Errata,</hi> viz. that
whereas 'tis said in <hi>p.</hi> 39, that <hi>Creswel</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> writ for King <hi>Iames</hi> his
<hi>Succession</hi> when <hi>Parsons</hi> writ against it, it should have been said that
<hi>Chricton</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> then did so: and so the latter part of the Volume of
<pb facs="tcp:103047:42"/>
the <hi>Mystery of Iesuitism</hi> relates it: and any indifferent man would think
that <hi>Chricton</hi> writ not in earnest, and that his <hi>Book</hi> appeared not on the
<hi>Stage</hi> of the World, but only to <hi>go off</hi> it, since so necessary a <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyson</hi>
to <hi>Parsons</hi> his Book, could never yet be heard of in any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</p>
            <p>Some little Omissions and Errors about Letters and Pointing, easily
appearing by their grossness, are not put into the <hi>Errata:</hi> and some the
<hi>Reader</hi> will find amended with the <hi>Pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover I am to Apologize for the carelesness of the <hi>Style,</hi> and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the <hi>Reader,</hi> that the <hi>Rule</hi> of any ones writing in any thing that
is called a <hi>Letter,</hi> being the way of the same Persons <hi>speaking,</hi> I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
justify the freedom I have taken in not polishing any <hi>Notions,</hi> or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
them out with the care employed on curious <hi>Pictures</hi> (and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
twice or thrice <hi>sitting</hi>) and in using that <hi>colouring</hi> of words, and such
bold careless <hi>Touches</hi> as are to be used in the <hi>finishing up</hi> any piece at <hi>once,</hi>
and which the Nature of Discourse necessarily implies, and in sometimes
using <hi>significant</hi> expressions in this or the other Language for any thing,
as I do in my common Conversation with those who understand those
Languages; and by the same Rule I have exempted my self from the
trouble of that nice weighing of things as well as of words, that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<hi>History</hi> or <hi>Discourse,</hi> otherwise then in the way of a <hi>Letter,</hi> would
have required, and the same excuse may serve for the Style of this <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Date</hi> of this <hi>Discourse</hi> had not at the writing of the <hi>first</hi> Sheet
been there inserted, a later one had been assigned it: but I thought
it not <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nti</hi> on the occasion thereof to have that Sheet reprinted.</p>
            <p>I hope to be able in my <hi>Review</hi> to gratifie the <hi>Readers</hi> Curiosity with
somewhat more of satisfaction as to the <hi>Monastic</hi> Revenue, and which in
<hi>p.</hi> 92 I mentioned as not adequate to the maintenance of 50000 <hi>Regulars</hi>
by my not considering how plentifully it was supported by <hi>Oblations</hi> of
<hi>various</hi> kinds, and other ways not necessary to be here enumerated.</p>
            <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 1. I say, I think it was St. <hi>Austin</hi> who said, <hi>Credo quia impossibile
est:</hi> and have since thought it was <hi>Tertullian.</hi> I care not who said it, as
long as I did not.</p>
            <p>I have in <hi>p.</hi> 13 mentioned the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Iesuites</hi> as invented by the Pope
in the year 1540, wherein I had respect to the time of its <hi>Confirmation</hi> from
the <hi>Papacy</hi> and not of its founding by <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other omissions and faults in the <hi>Press</hi> that the <hi>Reader</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the <hi>Errata</hi> for, without his consulting which, I am not accountable
for them.</p>
            <p>I am farther to say that there is one thing in this <hi>Preface</hi> that I need not
<hi>apologize</hi> for, and wherein I have done an Act of common Justice, namely,
in Celebrating the Heroical Vertue and Morality of this present <hi>Pope,</hi>
that were signalized as I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Almighty God can make the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Pestilence</hi> convey <hi>health</hi> to the
World, and can preserve any Person in it from its mortal Contagion.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, I was the more concerned to do the Pope the right I have
done, because I observed, that after that <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> began
to die, that depended on the Credit of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> several Persons
attempted to put new <hi>Life</hi> into it, by their renewed impotent <hi>Calumnies</hi>
cast on the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and as appeared by a bound 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>printed</hi>
in the year 1683, called <hi>The Devils Patriarch, or a full and impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Notorious Life of this present Pope of</hi> Rome, Innocent <hi>the</hi> 11th,
&amp;c. <hi>Written by an EMINENT</hi> Pen to <hi>revive the remembrance of the
<pb facs="tcp:103047:42"/>
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>most forgotten PLOT against the life of his Sacred Majesty and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>AVTHOR</hi> was meant by that <hi>EMINENT PEN,</hi> I
know not in the least. The <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Reader</hi> concludes with the
Letters of <hi>T. O.</hi> The vain <hi>Author</hi> having throughout his <hi>Book</hi> ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
accused the Pope of immorality and <hi>scandal,</hi> and of being <hi>a friend
to Indulgences, and of favouring the loose Principles of the Iesuites, and of
contriving the</hi> Popish Plot <hi>and carrying it</hi> on in concert <hi>with the Iesuites,</hi>
concludes by saying in p. 133. <hi>This Pope had great hopes of re-entry into</hi>
England <hi>by his hopeful Plot: hereupon</hi> Cottington<hi>'s bones were brought to
be buried here,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It was high time then for People to be weary of the <hi>Martyrocracy</hi> when
the <hi>Plot</hi> came to be staruminated by <hi>Cottington</hi>'s bones, and the pretended
<hi>immorality</hi> of so great an <hi>Example</hi> of severe Vertue as this <hi>Pope,</hi> and when
the belief of the <hi>Testimony</hi> against some men as Popish <hi>Ruffians</hi> was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be supported by the Childish Artifice of making a <hi>Ruffian</hi> of
the Pope himself.</p>
            <p>But indeed long before the <hi>Edition</hi> of that trifling <hi>Book,</hi> many
things had occurred so far to shake the testimony of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> as that
it grew generally the <hi>Concordant</hi> voice of the <hi>Populace,</hi> that on a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of several of the same Persons being again alive to be tryed on the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the same <hi>Witnesses</hi> before the same Judges, it would not have
prejudiced a hair of the heads that were destroyed by it, and particularly
in the unfortunate Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Case.</p>
            <p>I have in two or three places of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Papal</hi>
Hierarchy, called it <hi>Holy Church,</hi> its old known <hi>term,</hi> and by which I
meant no reflection of scorn: nor would I laugh at any <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
found among any <hi>Heterodox</hi> Religionaries that the dying groans
of the holy <hi>Iesus</hi> purchased them a liberty to profess.</p>
            <p>But 'tis no <hi>Raillery</hi> to say, that the Artifices of any dis-loyal <hi>Popish</hi> and
<hi>Protestant</hi> Recusants, that have so long made <hi>Templum Domini,</hi> usurp on
the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> and his <hi>Vice Gerents,</hi> that is, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi>
will support no Church: and that as it hath been observed of some Free
<hi>Stones,</hi> that when they are laid in a Building in that proper posture which
they had naturally in their <hi>Quarries,</hi> they grow very hard and durable
(and if that be changed, they moulder away in a short time) a long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may likewise be predicted to the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of reason appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to support a Church as they lay in the <hi>Quarry</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and where
the God of <hi>Nature</hi> laid them for the support of Princes and their People,
and <hi>è contrà.</hi> In fine, therefore since the Principles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
are thus laid in it as they were in that <hi>Quarry,</hi> none need fear
that they will be defaced by time, or that a lawful Prince of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
here will accost it otherwise than with those words of the <hi>Royal</hi>
Psalmist, <hi>viz. Peace be within thy Walls, and Prosperity within thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces.</hi>

            <p>AS to the <hi>Candour</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Nation that was formerly so very
extraordinary, and the <hi>whiteness</hi> and <hi>sweetness</hi> of the <hi>temper</hi> of
the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England</hi> that did adde to the representing it a <hi>Land
flowing with Milk and Honey,</hi> and to the making it like the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axy</hi>
to have one brightness from thousands of fixt <hi>Stars</hi> placed so <hi>high</hi> by
<hi>Nature,</hi> that they could not suffer the least <hi>Eclipse</hi> by the shaddow of the
whole <hi>Earth;</hi> we may well since the Publishing of the horrid <hi>Affidavit</hi> of
the <hi>Infamous</hi> Person, and so many <hi>valuing</hi> themselves as the best of Men
upon their believing what was sworn by the worst, lament the <hi>temporary</hi>
decay of so great a part of the Glory of the <hi>English</hi> good Nature.</p>
            <p>And they who knew your Lordship, (and consequently knew you to be
a steadfast approver of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>)
have reason more particularly to be sensible of what concern'd you in that
calumnious <hi>Affidavit,</hi> because the wretch presumed therein to fasten on your
Lordship the <hi>Sanbenito</hi> of a <hi>Court of</hi> Rome-<hi>Papist,</hi> and to represent you as
a favourer of <hi>Popery</hi> or the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpations that were in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th's
time hence exterminated, and as an endeavorer to <hi>stifle</hi> the <hi>Evidence</hi> about
the <hi>Plot</hi> notify'd by the Government for the <hi>recalling</hi> that kind of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho I know no Christian more tenderly inclined then your Lordship to
shew all Christian <hi>Indulgence</hi> to the <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,
and have sometimes observed your Lordship while you were wishing
that none of the <hi>New</hi> Articles of <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Creed were by any
believed, yet out of <hi>tenderness</hi> to the <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Devout</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Papists,
with great reason to wish likewise that no <hi>Odium</hi> might come to such from
the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>POPERY</hi> for their Profession of such <hi>Tenets</hi> as are held by the
<hi>Greek</hi> and other <hi>Churches</hi> who yearly <hi>Curse</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> and are so <hi>Curs'd</hi> by
him; yet none need doubt but that your Lordship will as much as any man
account it the <hi>opus diei</hi> by all due means to oppose all <hi>plotted</hi> Designs
whatsoever to retrive the <hi>Papal</hi> Power of Usurping over the <hi>Crown,</hi> or
<hi>Conscience.</hi> My Lord, there are some among us who would usurp on and
appropriate to themselves the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing</hi> of <hi>Protestancy,</hi> and would
be thought <hi>the only true Protestants,</hi> and would be <hi>Monopolists</hi> of all the
<hi>heat</hi> and <hi>light</hi> against <hi>Popery.</hi> But as I shall make bold to come in for my
<hi>share</hi> with them, so I shall yet acquaint your Lordship, that if I may in any
part of this <hi>Letter</hi> to you seem with any excess of Passion to reflect on <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103047:53"/>
I shall before I take leave of you afford you such a <hi>Patriotly</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly</hi>
reason of my warmth against it, (as I think) hath not by others
been given, nor particularly by some Pedantick <hi>Anti-Papists,</hi> who render
their Conversation <hi>nauseous</hi> by their eternal <hi>talking</hi> of nothing but <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
and while they are neglectful of all the due means to prevent its
growth.</p>
            <p>These things being therefore <hi>premised,</hi> I shall in <hi>despite</hi> of the <hi>Affidavit,</hi>
say that I will be the last man in <hi>England</hi> who shall believe that my Lord
Privy Seal can be such a Court of Rome-Papist. I think it was St. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
who meaning well in a pang of Zeal, cry'd out on one occasion, <hi>Credo quia
impossibile est:</hi> But I shall both as to the truth of any deposing or imposing
Doctrine, and of your Lordships believing it, ground my disbelief on the
<hi>impossibility</hi> of either. When I hear men say, they look upon it as an exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a miraculous Power Divine that the Globe of the Earth hangs in the
Air without falling, I interrupt not their thoughts of devotion, but know
that the Earth which is ballanced by its own weight, cannot fall but it
must fall into Heaven, <hi>Coelum undique sursum:</hi> And should any one tell me
of your Lordships falling into any gross erroneous doctrinal opinions, I who
have long observed the constant tendency of your understanding toward
the Center of truth, cannot apprehend any danger of your falling from it.
So likewise when I hear men impute it to the Divine Benignity that they
were not made Flies or Toads, I disturb not the Piety of their thoughts, but
know that it was not possible to make me, that is to say, endued as I am
with a Rational Soul, to have been a Fly or a Toad; which Creatures by
their very Natures are devoyd thereof. And thus tho sometimes some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
may turn such a Papist who hath an understanding sway'd by secular
Interests and sensual Appetites; yet in the condition of that excellent manly
understanding of your Lordships, which has so absolute a Soveraignty over
all brutish inclinations, whereby you and all others whom Heaven hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
with such Endowments, do as much transcend degenerate Mankind
as they do Beasts, the Errors of such Doctrines will be too gross for you to
be able to swallow.</p>
            <p>Nor is it more possible for your Lordship to believe such <hi>Popery</hi> accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
after you have surveyed the several parts of it with your penetrating
Judgment, unwearied diligence, and the incomparable Candor worthy of a
lover of truth, and indeed worthy of your self, then it was possible for
Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> after he had sailed round the Earth, to believe the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> who deny'd its rotundity. To cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
your Lordships accurate knowledge of, and constant Zeal for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion among the happy few that have the honour of your retired
converse, were to gild Gold, and to fear the possibility of its appearing upon
any <hi>Enquiry</hi> that you are not of that Religion, is to think or fear that Gold
can be destroyed.</p>
            <p>I have upon my occasional debates with some Persons that would make
you a <hi>Papist</hi> whether you will or no, call'd to mind some discourse I had
with you long since, concerning your Birth and Education, and thereupon
considering the closeness of your Education in the Protestant Religion, have
as much wondered at thinking how it was possible for any Principles of such
Popery to get into your Mind, as at Wild Beasts getting into Islands. While
I consider how the first thoughts of Childhood ripening into Youth, are like
the <hi>first Occupants</hi> claiming and generally keeping possession during life, I am
apt when I hear of any man's owning <hi>any Brutish or Savage Tenets,</hi> to think
of the <hi>Egg</hi> of such a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and from what <hi>Animal</hi> it came. And he that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103047:53"/>
shall look back on your Lordships beginning, will find you descended of Noble
and Renowned Parents, both by Father and Mother, who likewise were
esteemed (as I may say) <hi>Noble Bereans</hi> for searching into the Scripture,
and thereupon owning the Protestant Faith: In a word of a whole Family
of Consessors, if Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot Lord Deputy of Ireland,</hi> your Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
your Grandfather <hi>Annesley</hi> an Eminent Commander at Sea, and a
principal Undertaker in <hi>Munster</hi> in the Reign of that blessed Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
that great Statesman <hi>Francis Lord Mount Norris and Viscount of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
a Faithful Servant to the Crown in many great Employments, and
among the rest, Principal Secretary of State, Vice-Treasurer, and Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
at Wars in <hi>Ireland</hi> to two great Kings of Famous Memory, King <hi>Iames,</hi>
and King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and the Family of the <hi>Phillipses</hi> of <hi>Picton</hi> Castle
in <hi>Pembrokeshire,</hi> out of which your Mother came, have their just respect
allow'd them. Your Lordship being born in <hi>Dublin</hi> received there your
Name in Baptisme at the Nomination of your Noble Sponsor <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord
<hi>Chichester,</hi> who had been <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> Eleven Years, and for whose
Name the <hi>Protestants</hi> of that Kingdom have still a great Veneration.</p>
            <p>I remember you further acquainted me, that at your age of Ten Years
the Scene of your Education was removed to <hi>England,</hi> and that afterward
you spent Four Years in <hi>Magdalen-College</hi> in the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where
you enjoyed the Learned Conversation of Dr. <hi>Frewen</hi> then President of that
College, and since that <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and
from whom and other Persons of that University, many have been made
acquainted that your Lordship was then an Ornament of that place, and an
Eminent Proficient in all Academical Learning, and that you there perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Exercise for your Degree with the general applause of that place. And
there where you came to that great Mart of Knowledge with so great a
stock of Natural Reason, and improved the same with so much Logick, and
conversed so many Years with the great Champions of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I am sure (if I may without affectation use a <hi>School Term</hi>) your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
could have no <hi>Motus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> primo primus</hi> to approve any <hi>Papal</hi> imposition
upon <hi>Reason.</hi> I remember that you told me, That your Father transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you thence to the Society of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> where with unwearied steps
your diligence it seems overcame the craggy ascent of the Study of
the Common Law of <hi>England:</hi> But where the pleasant height of it
Compensated your pain in the way, and gave you not the <hi>Landscap</hi> of one
<hi>Valley,</hi> but the <hi>Prospect</hi> of all the Land of the People of <hi>England</hi> beneath
it, fenced in with the enclosure of <hi>Property;</hi> of men, (according to the
<hi>Scripture</hi> expressions) sitting under their Vines and Fig-Trees, and none
making them afraid, where the Pastures are <hi>cloth'd</hi> with <hi>Flocks,</hi> and the
<hi>Valley covered with Corn that they shout for joy, and sing, where our Oxen
are strong to labour,</hi> and <hi>no breaking in, nor going out, and no complaining in
our streets;</hi> and of a Numerous brave Nation not capable of being enslaved
by any Wills or Passions but their own.</p>
            <p>And sure where you learn'd the Science of this Noble Law, that is, a
Law of Liberty, your self and your Brethren in that Honourable Society
must needs eccho back that great <hi>exclamation</hi> of the <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>England, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus
Leges Angliae mutari,</hi> and not endure the servitude of the Law of the
Pope, or which is all one, his will.</p>
            <p>Yet moreover such was <hi>my Lord Mount Norris</hi> his Zeal that you might
by all means imaginable be confirmed in your aversion against the Papal
Usurpations and Arbitrary Government, that he then sent you to Foreign
Parts, that you might see those <hi>Monsters</hi> you had here but read of, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103047:54"/>
occasioned your travelling into <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> and many Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
I have been told that your Father the Lord <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> his Commands and
his Concerns both Domestick and Publick call'd you from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England</hi>
toward the Year 1640. when several Parliamentary Addresses and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances
against <hi>the Papists,</hi> and encrease of their Power and Numbers had
been made. The <hi>Thunder</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> had then at that time so
cleared the Air of <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>infection</hi> of Popery, that I suppose
none will think you could be then tainted with it. And the <hi>Civil Wars</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> afterwards breaking out, when both Parties appealed to God
for the decision of their Cause by the Sword, and contested with each
other in Publick Declarations, about which of them was the greater enemy
to Popery, it had not only been very <hi>impolitick,</hi> but extreamly <hi>ridiculous</hi>
for any man at that time, by being a <hi>fautor</hi> of the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpations, to
expose himself to the fencing with two enraged Multitudes, which would
have produced the same effect as would a <hi>Iesuit</hi>'s Preaching a <hi>Postilling</hi>
Sermon here against the Yearly burning of the <hi>Pope</hi> to the <hi>Populace</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in that <hi>Solemnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I find my self her engulfed in writing a long Letter; and the
truth is, having a great concern for your Lordship's Honour, I am willing
to take pains to satisfie my self exactly by thus tracing your Lordship's
steps on the Stage of the World, that I may satisfie others so about your
being as averse as any one can be from supporting any Papal Power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the rights of <hi>Conscience,</hi> or those of <hi>Princes.</hi> The <hi>Roman Historian</hi>
speaking of <hi>Nero,</hi> saith, <hi>Tyrannum hunc per quatuordecem annos passus est ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum
orbis.</hi> And it may truly be said, That <hi>England formerly has endured</hi>
the <hi>Popes Tyranny,</hi> and the Artifices of its Favourers for some Ages: But the
<hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> has bounds, and the Propagators of such Usurpation who
<hi>had</hi> so long maintain'd <hi>a separate Soveraignty here,</hi> the which <hi>is</hi> like an <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
living within <hi>an Animal,</hi> did find that as the lesser creature is evacuated
by the greater, or destroyed therein, or doth else destroy the greater <hi>Animal,</hi>
it was so held to be in the case of such <hi>Power</hi> among us, and as no doubt it
always will be by your Lordship.</p>
            <p>When your Travels were ended, and you had with the help of the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
your Father gave you, saved him by your knowledge of the <hi>Lex
terroe</hi> from falling as a prey to Arbitrary Power, and thereby shewed your
self both a good Son and great Patriot, the first Scene of publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein your Lordship appeared with Eminency, was as <hi>Governour</hi> of
<hi>Vlster</hi> by Authority under the Great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> a Charge of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
when the Forces from <hi>Scotland</hi> under the Command of <hi>Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Munro</hi> had so long ruled absolutely there, that the <hi>English</hi> Interest
had suffered a great eclipse and diminution. How you managed Affairs
during your Government there, and how by your Councils the most perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and potent <hi>Rebel Owen Roe O Neil</hi> was opposed, and his design to
swallow up that Province and the Province of <hi>Connaught</hi> disappointed,
and the Protestant Interest in both united and encouraged, and under
your Conduct and Command the Titular Popish Archbishop of <hi>Tuam</hi>
taken, and by the seisure of his Cabinet and Papers, the <hi>Popish</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
upon <hi>Ireland</hi> discovered and broken, in due time I doubt not
you will more particularly inform the World. From that Service your
Lordship was upon the ill success of those Commissioners who were first
sent to the then <hi>Marquess of Ormond,</hi> employed to make the <hi>Capitulation</hi>
with the said Marquess then <hi>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,</hi> for the Surrender
of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all other Garrisons under his Command, into the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103047:54"/>
               <hi>Parliaments hands</hi> for securing them from the <hi>Irish Rebels,</hi> who had invested
and streightned the same: Which happy work was effectually accomplished
by the Articles made with the said Marquess already published to the World,
And so the Protestants Interest in that Kingdom made entire, and so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that they daily gained ground of the <hi>Confederate Rebels,</hi> till at length
they were wholly subdued and vanquished. After those Articles concluded,
and reception of the said City and Garrisons, your Lordship was called back
into <hi>England,</hi> where being a Member of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> you shewed
your self no less useful to this Kingdom; And have since in Parliament and
Council, and other great Imployments in both Kingdoms shewed your self an
Eminent Instrument both in his Majesties happy Restoration, who entirely
trusted you with the Management thereof, and in other great Affairs of State
and Government to general satisfaction, being never by those that knew you
so much as suspected for Evil Council, or want of Zeal and Faithfulness to
your King or Countrey, but every day gaining more the Love and Esteem of
Protestants and Patriots, as you had incurred the implacable hatred of the
Popish and Arbitrary Factions. I cannot here but observe, That a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Kings Restoration, the spirit of the people universally shewing its
resentments so strong and vehement against <hi>Lambert</hi> and his <hi>Committee</hi> of
<hi>Safety,</hi> and against all the propounders of projects of Government, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his Majesties return to the Throne of his Ancestors could quiet the
people, and your Lordship then as <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> by your great
Wisdom Contributing highly to the dispatch of many arduous and intricate
Affairs requisite to make that great Revolution without <hi>bloudshed,</hi> when things
near their <hi>Center</hi> were moving so fast, it may well be reckon'd among <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
things, that your Lordship should now espouse the <hi>Papal</hi> interest,
when the Vogue, the Humour, the Sense, and Reason, and Spirit of the
People are bent against it, with as keen and strong and general an <hi>antipathy</hi>
as can be <hi>imagined.</hi> And when I consider that great real power you had in
the Kingdom at that time, testify'd not so much by your <hi>signing</hi> all the great
Commissions then for <hi>Military</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Employments, as by both the
King, and the best and wisest of the people in the Three Kingdoms putting
themselves in your hands, and having their eyes chiefly upon you as to the
management of the <hi>Political</hi> part of that mighty concern, I cannot but
thinking of your Lordship whom thus the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom delighted to
honour,</hi> apply to you these words in <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> where he speaks of
<hi>Agrippa Menenius,</hi> whom the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi> chose <hi>Arbitrator</hi> of their
<hi>differences,</hi> and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ompose matters between them, <hi>Quantus scilicet esse debuit
arbiter publicae salutis:</hi> Yet as great as this Man was, he could have no <hi>Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
unless the people had by a <hi>pole</hi> given the sixth part of a penny to defray
his Funeral Charges: But your Lordships case in one particular seems harder
then his, for they who unjustly go to take away your good Name, and to
make a Papist of you, go about to bury you alive.</p>
            <p>Had your Lordship after the King's Restoration aspired after the power of
a <hi>chief Minister,</hi> or suffered any such to be committed to you, you must have
took it with the concomitance of universal envy, that hath always in <hi>England</hi>
been fatal to such power, <hi>England</hi> having always thought such power fatal
to it. 'Tis the <hi>power</hi> it self of such a <hi>Minister</hi> that is look't on as a popular
Nusance; and tis impossible for such a great Man by raising his power only
to what he thinks a moderate height, to keep it secure and lasting. For tho
a Steeple be built with firm Stone, great Art, and but with a moderate height,
yet are there Clouds charged with Lightning and Thunder, and moving in
the Ayr sometimes not higher than the top of such a Steeple, and the <hi>Pryamid</hi>
or sharpness of such a Steeple then (as I may say) tapping or broaching such a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103047:55"/>
Cloud that comes that way, is instantly Burnt and Thundered down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
the Multitude of the <hi>Primier Ministres</hi> adorers, who are always pleasing or
troubling him with their sacrifices, do all with sudden confusion leave him
when he begins thus to fall, as if Thunder-struck from Heaven.</p>
            <p>We find in <hi>Rushworth,</hi> that <hi>Iune</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 4 <hi>Caroli,</hi> it was ordered upon
the Question, <hi>That the excessive power</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham, is the cause
of the Evils and Dangers to the King and Kingdom.</hi> And we may well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that if a Parliament doth still as one man set themselves against a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolist
but of one little pedling commodity, that they will look on a <hi>Chief
Minister</hi> as one that would, or in effect doth monopolize the Beams of the
Sun, I mean the Kings Eye, and as one that alone hath the Kings Ear, and
as one that is the great forestaller of the Court-market of preferments.</p>
            <p>And happy it is for a <hi>Chief Minister,</hi> that the way of Parliamentary Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath been in such antient usage, for that rids the people of the outrage
of that Minister, and that Minister of the outrage of the people. Our Stories
speak How barbarously Cruel the brutish Rabble was to Dr. <hi>Lamb,</hi> called the
Duke's <hi>Conjurer,</hi> and the reason why the people hate those they call Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
so much is, because, they think such have a power to hurt their Children
or Cattel; and the same reason makes them hate one that they look on as a
Kings <hi>Conjurer,</hi> who they think can hurt their Property, and one who on
occasion can raise up Domestick and Foraign Devils to molest them, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if he cannot lay those Devils when he has raised them, and who can if
he will put the People to charge, and to the danger of starving to <hi>feed</hi> his
<hi>familiar spirits.</hi> When once the people find by any mans power, the fence
of the Law begun to be broken down, they will go in at the gap, and 'tis
nothing but the Law that secures a chief <hi>Minister,</hi> and them against one another.

            <p>Your Lordship therefore when you had been a <hi>repairer of the breaches of
the Nation,</hi> and of the Law therein, and (in the Scripture expression) <hi>a resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of paths to dwell in,</hi> as easily and unconcern'd gave up the great <hi>deposit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m</hi>
of power the King and Kingdom entrusted you with, as ever you restored
the least to a private person, and have ever since among the Councellors of
your Prince both endeavoured to make your Country safe, by giving Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
against any Neighbour Nations being too powerful, and to make your
self secure by your not grasping more power than you saw in the hands of
each of your honourable Colleagues, as well knowing that any single <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
that shall here set up to be a Dispenser of the Soveraign Power, had need
either still wear a Coat of Male and an Iron Brest-plate, or bind the whole
Kingdom to the Peace. Your Lordship can hardly look into antient <hi>History</hi>
without meeting Examples of the <hi>People</hi> like the <hi>Leviathan</hi> playing in the
Ocean of their power, and <hi>spouting</hi> out their censures both with <hi>fury</hi> and
<hi>wantonness,</hi> when they are dooming the great. You know the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
did reprimand their <hi>Lyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgus</hi> because he went with his head stooping, the
<hi>Thebans</hi> accused their <hi>Paniculus</hi> for his much spitting, and the <hi>Athenians
Simonides</hi> because he spoke too loud, the <hi>Carthaginians Hannibal</hi> because he
went loose in his garments, the <hi>Romans Scipio</hi> because he did snore in his sleep,
the <hi>Vticenses Cato</hi> for his eating with both Jawes, the <hi>Syllani Iulius Caesar,</hi>
for wearing his girdle carelessly, the <hi>Romans</hi> were angry with <hi>Pompey</hi> for
scratching himself but with one finger, and likewise for wearing a garter
wrought with Silver and Gold on one leg, saying that he wore such a Diadem
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103047:55"/>
about his foot as Kings do on their heads, though yet it seems the only cause
of his wearing it was to hide a Sore place there. And in these above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
cases we are not to think that those <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> people who thought
the rest of the world barbarous, could censure those persons so barbarously for
those sensless reasons, but out of a hatred to the persons Censured, were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to strike at the first thing they met, how innocent soever in it self, in
persons they thought they had reason to represent odious.</p>
            <p>A late Great Man, who in a Public <hi>Speech</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> render'd the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
tongue as having the Monopoly of the term <hi>good Nature,</hi> found that
they had not <hi>engrost</hi> the thing when they imagined that his <hi>Ministry</hi> Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
much of the Regal power. And another eminent person, afterward a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to His Majesty, Suffered as a favourer of the <hi>French,</hi> at whose imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I have heard that the <hi>Lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re</hi> rang with as much joy and triumph as if
they had carried the point in a great fight at Land or Sea; and he likewise suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
obloquy as if concern'd in the infamous murder of Sr. <hi>Edmond Godfrey,</hi>
from which he was certainly as free as from having killed <hi>Iulius Caesar:</hi>
And how far the embroider'd garter about his leg, made him like <hi>Pompey,</hi>
Envyed, I know not; But as I said 'tis a chief Ministers power the people of
England strike at, who may not be unfitly resembled to <hi>Alexanders Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,</hi>
that would let none but <hi>Alexander</hi> ride him, nor could <hi>Alexander</hi>
himselfe do it till by holding him against the Sun he kept him from being
frighted with the sight of his Shadow. And when one Subject seems to be
the representative Shadow of the body of the whole people, the Sight of
him frights them so as to make them uneasie to be ruled, And therefore I
think his Majesty did rationally provide for the public Security when he sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
His pleasure in a Speech in a late Parliament about not Ruling us by
a single <hi>Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should not wonder if your Lordship were called a <hi>Papist</hi> if you had been
the possessor of any such power, that name being now the angriest the people
can throw at any one, as it was before the late Warres, when <hi>Archbishop
Laud</hi> who had writ so well, and so much against the <hi>Papists,</hi> fell under the
weight of that name, But really by the power of that <hi>chief Ministry</hi> he had
in the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England</hi> after the death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> And at
that time the currant definitions of a <hi>Papist,</hi> and of one who enjoyed <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power</hi> were the same, And the things made conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ble, or Devils dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in the same Circle. And so likewise the <hi>Vouge</hi> at this time obtains among the
<hi>populace</hi> who cannot see through the hard words and things in <hi>definitions,</hi>
and if you ask them <hi>what is a Papist,</hi> they will tell you he is one that is for
<hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and asking them <hi>what is one that is for Arbitrary Power,</hi> they
will say a <hi>Papist.</hi> And in cases where the people do not think fit to begin
with Execution, Common Fame goes for <hi>proof</hi> against such a <hi>Minister,</hi> and
the political whispers of other Great Men who inspire them, goe for <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi>
and they think knocking down <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> with Arbitrary
proof is a good <hi>baculi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um argumentum ad hominem,</hi> or rather a <hi>Monster</hi> of
power, for as such they look on one of the People, who is so by the head
higher then themselves. I know none to have observed the constitution and
customes of the Government of <hi>Venice</hi> better then your Lordship, and
there any one that is but <hi>Arbitrarily affected</hi> (as our term is here, <hi>Popishly
affected</hi>) is taken <hi>volly</hi> before he comes to the ground, or at furthest, at his
first rebound, and his head made a Tennis Ball before he comes to be bandi'd
among the people, I mean he is first <hi>Sumonarily</hi> dispatcht, or made away, and his
plenary process is dispatcht or made up afterward. Your Lordship hath in the
course of your travels been there in person, but my eyes have only beheld it
as a traveller in Mapps and Authors: one of whom, namely <hi>Boccaline</hi> in his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103047:56"/>
               <hi>Raggnagli di Parnasse</hi> Speaking of <hi>Venice</hi> saith that the <hi>dreadful Tribunal of
the Councel of ten, and the Supream Magistracy of the State-Inquisition, could
with three ballotting balls easily bury alive any Caesar or Pompey who began to
discover himself in that well governed State.</hi> And according to the Lawes of
that Country any aspirer of the first rate so sunk by the shot of the ballotting
balls, may be said to be kill'd very fairly, though there was no more Citation in
the case then in that of the <hi>Martyrdom of Sir Edmond Godfrey,</hi> who yet according
to the principles of the <hi>Canon Law</hi> was likewise killed very fairly. I here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
to the <hi>Style</hi> of the <hi>brothers of the blade,</hi> who when sworn at a Tryal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one murthered in a <hi>Duel,</hi> usually depose that <hi>he was killed very fairly,</hi>
And indeed I have by a Neighbour of mine, who is a Civilian, been shewn
it in a Civil Law Book called the <hi>Second Tome of the Common Opinions, in folio,
Book 9. p.</hi> 462. Printed at <hi>Lions,</hi> that <hi>Rebellis impunè occidi possit, &amp; tunc

rebellionis ad heresim,</hi> and with good reason according to the <hi>Popish hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi>
for that, he that is a <hi>heretic,</hi> is a <hi>Rebell</hi> or <hi>Traytor</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and therefore a <hi>Heretic</hi> by that Law may be destroyed before his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
is made. But the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> like those of <hi>Israel,</hi> are <hi>merciful
Kings,</hi> and in the Laws of <hi>England, Iustice and Mercy</hi> are still saluting each
other, and with as much kindness as they can possibly shew without embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
each other to death, and the meanest Commoners Life in <hi>England</hi> becomes
not a <hi>forfeit</hi> to the Law, but after a Tryal by his equals; and in this, our Law
agrees with that gentleness and equity inculcated by <hi>Grotius de Iure Belli &amp;
Pacis,</hi> Book 3. Chap. 14. <hi>Temperamentum circa captos,</hi> §. 3. where he saith,
<hi>Cato Censorius (narrante Plutarcho,) si quis servus Capital admisisse videretur, de

            <p>I must confess I was very much shock't with one expression used in a long
Speech by one of the managers of the House of Commons in the Trial of the
<hi>Earl of Strafford,</hi> wherein the saying That Beasts of Prey are to have no Law,
was applyed to the Earl. I am sure that Wolfs and Boars are Beasts of the
Forrest, as well as Harts and Hinds, and in the Kings Forrests where they
are in his protection, they are to have <hi>Law,</hi> and so likewise Foxes. To this
Metaphor of <hi>hunting of men</hi> in Parliament, there is an allusion in the printed
Letter of Mr. <hi>Alured</hi> in <hi>Rushworths Collections,</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 
               <hi>Caroli,</hi> where 'tis said,
<hi>That Sir</hi> Edward Cooke <hi>in the House protested, that the Author and cause of
all their miseries was the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>which was entertain'd and
answered with a cheerful acclamation of the House, as when one good Hound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the scent, the rest come in with a full cry: So they pursued it, and every
one came on home and layed the blame where they thought the fault was.</hi> But
yet by this saying of <hi>Alured,</hi> it seems they thought they were to give him
<hi>Law;</hi> and 'tis a brutish thing to suppose that wild predatory Beasts have in
the Kings Forrests more protection, and more exemption from being arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
hunted down, than his Liege people to whom he is sworn, have in the
whole Realm in general, and in his Courts of Justice in particular. That
time seemed not so much <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: But your Lordships know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in the Laws of the Land and in the Laws of Nations is so universal and
profound, that you can come to no Court in the World, but will either find
<hi>Law</hi> there or bring it: and your great knowledg of the Parliamentary
Transactions in all past Ages, cannot but secure you against any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of not finding Law. For it hath been rarely seen, that a House of
Commons has gone to hunt any man down tho with the Law, that was not
a <hi>Nimrod a Mighty hunter</hi> of our Laws themselves; and never was the House
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103047:56"/>
of Peers thought a Court of Rigor and Cruelty, and as the <hi>Tribunal of Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
was for its dire severity called <hi>Scopulus Reorum.</hi> In the end of the famous
Tryal of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the House of Commons foresaw that the Lords
would acquit him, and therefore they broke up the Judicial prosecution against
him, and proceeded by Bill of Attainder, and shortly after broke in pieces on
his Grave the Rule and Standard of Treason they proceeded by, as Heralds
break their Staffs at the Funerals of Illustrious Persons, and cast them into
their Tombes. Had I been one of that Lords Judges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should have consented
that after he had been hunted so long by the Prosecution for Treason, and was
not Judicially convicted of it, he should have had the priviledg of <hi>a Hart-Royal
proclaimed,</hi> of which <hi>Manwood</hi> in his <hi>Forrest Law</hi> speaking, saith, <hi>That
if the King doth hunt a Stag he is called a Hart-Royal, and that if he doth
hunt a Hart in the Forrest, which by chacing is driven out, and the King gives
him over, as either being weary, or for that he cannot recover him, then because
such a Hart hath shewn the King pastime, and is also</hi> Cervus eximius, <hi>and that
therefore the King would have him preserved, he causeth Proclamation to be
made in the adjacent Villages, that none shall kill, hunt, hurt, or chace him, and
hinder him from his return to the Forrest, and ever after such a Hart is called
a Hart-Royal proclaimed.</hi> But I think that an <hi>eximious man</hi> impeacht in
Parliament and there acquitted, will need no Herald to proclaim his worth,
nor his deserving to be restored <hi>in integrum</hi> to the Royal Protection and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
when that <hi>his own works have praised him in the gates,</hi> that is, in the
Jurisdiction where they were so strictly scann'd. My Lord, if any could
prove your Lordship to be a Papist, he need not call that <hi>accumulative Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in you,</hi> nor need he go about by torturing the Law to make it confess
many Felonies to be one Treason, many Rapes to be one false coming: But
<hi>Popery</hi> in you would be plain down-right, palpable and rank Treason by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Statute of 23 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Ch. 1. which makes it High Treason
for any person in the Dominions of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to be withdrawn
from the Religion then established, to the Romish Religion. That your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
hath been bred a Protestant, and been so (as it were) <hi>ex traduce,</hi> there
needs no other evidence then the contents of this Letter, and that you have
not been withdrawn to the Romish Religion, you have declared by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of your <hi>actings</hi> against it, that shew your Mind beyond the power of
<hi>words:</hi> and 'tis by the help of that great Wisdom God has given you, that
our <hi>English</hi> World expects that a way may be found how to make it more
clearly appear to the eye of the Law when any others have been or are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
to the Romish Religion, a thing perhaps at present of somewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
proof: For without supposing that the Pope can or will give them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations
to take all Oaths and Tests that can be devised, doth not a reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some fantastic sense to themselves, make nonsense of all Oaths, and that
one word Equivocation make them proof against all other words? Doth
not that with them sanctify, or at least justify all other words they can use?
May they not on these terms safely swear there is neither God, nor Man, nor
Hell, nor Devil, that is meaning, <hi>not in a Mathematical point, or in Vtopia,
and that they saw not such a Man such a day, that is, not with the eyes of a
Whale?</hi> And have not the late dying Speeches of some of these <hi>Imposters,</hi> and
particularly Father <hi>Irelands,</hi> shewn us, that in the points of mental reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and equivocation they persevere in the impudent owning of that which
would unhinge the World, and turn humane Society into a dissolute multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?
And do we not believe many to be Papists, who we know have taken
the Oaths and Tests? Hath not a Papist some Years since writ of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the taking of the Oath of Supremacy? I speak not this, my Lord,
to derogate from the Wisdom of our Ancestors that appointed these discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103047:57"/>
nations, and do think that when we have used all the lawful means we can,
to know who among us are Papists as certainly as we do what is Popery, and
to keep Papists from hurting us and themselves, we ought to acquiesce in the
Results of the Providence of God. But what all those means are, tho I know
not, yet I am apt to believe that your Lordships comprehensive knowledg
of men and things, and of the true interest of the Kingdom hath qualified
you to tell your Royal Master and His Houses of Parliament: nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the difficulty of either finding out such means and making practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
things be practised will blunt, but rather whet the edg of your Industry
in this case, as being of <hi>Quintilians</hi> mind who Judged that there was <hi>Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
in despairing of any thing that could be done. I think his words are

               </gap>Tis certainly the interest of the King
and Kingdom that the numbers of the <hi>Papists</hi> here, and especially of those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from Protestancy to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should be known, in the
case of which Apostates, tho it be impossible without seizing on the Papers
and Archives of one certain Priest to see the Original Acts of their Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Protestancy, yet is it most certain and on all hands confessedly true,
that Eminent Overt-Acts of abhorrency of Protestantisme are alwayes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at the admitting one who was of that Religion into the bosome of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Church: which any one will be convinced of who reads the
<hi>Letter of Cardinal D'Ossat</hi> to <hi>Villeroy</hi> of the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1603. from <hi>Rome,</hi>
where he gives his Opinion against the Queen of <hi>England</hi> being made God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
at the Baptism of Madam. That <hi>Cardinal</hi> who had incomparable
skill in the Canon Law, and the knowledg of all the Customs of the Papal
See, and who had lived at <hi>Rome</hi> above 20 Years, saith in that Letter, <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it my duty to write to you freely that that cannot be done without very
great Scandal to good Catholicks, nor without the extream displeasure and offence
of the Pope. You presuppose that the Queen of</hi> England <hi>is a Catholic: but Here
we know the contrary, tho some believe that she is not of the worser sort of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
and that she has some inclination to the Catholic Religion. And I will tell
you moreover, that tho she were in her heart of the Catholic Apostolic and Roman
Religion as much as the Pope himself, so it is that she having been bred up in
Heresie and outwardly persisting in it as she doth, she cannot according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
be held for a Catholic in public acts of Religion, till she hath first both</hi> viva
voce <hi>and by writing under her hand abjured all Heresie, and made profession of the
Catholic Faith.</hi> Nor was it ever known, that in the case of any Protestants
Apostacy to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> any Pope ever dispensed with those Canons,
and therefore it may well hence be inferr'd, That if evidence just so much as
the Law requires as to such Apostacy be given, that no <hi>superpondium</hi> or proof
of overt-acts more then necessary ought to be expected, for that overt
Acts almost impossible to be proved, may yet necessarily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed:
but this by the way. And therefore now further, my Lord, if <hi>fas est
ab hoste doceri</hi> be adviseable in the case, as strict Circumstances may be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the conversion of Papists to our Church, as are in the withdrawing of
any from our Church to theirs. Indeed if I were a Member of Parliament,
and any one there should be so happy as to invent a way, and propound it
whereby the present Lay-Papists in <hi>England</hi> might let us have a Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
that they neither consented to nor concealed the late Plot, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that they did really detest all those desperate Popish Principles that are
fundamentally destructive to the Safety of the King and Kingdom, and that
they would harbour no Priests born in the Kings Dominions, nor send any
of their Children to be bred in Forrain Seminaries; and on the contrary, that
on occasion they would discover to a Magistrate any such Priest, or one who
sent his Children to such Seminary, and likewise any one that owned any of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103047:57"/>
those Pernitious Principles that strike at the heart of the Civil Government,
and that they would presently give his Majesty an accompt of all their own
Names, Places of abode, and Numbers of their Families, and that they would
not live in nor come to the Court nor into any of our Cities or great Towns,
without leave obtain'd pursuant to the Statute of the 35<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Ch. 2.
(wherein 'tis Enacted under several Penalties, That they shall not remove
above Five miles from their dwellings, and to give in their Names to the
Constables, Headborough, and Minister, &amp;c.) and that the people might be
delivered not only from any danger by them, but any fears that might fall
on a wise man, either of their power or numbers encreasing I should joyfully
entertain such an invention; But what way of that kind is practicable, I
am altogether ignorant, But do suppose that the present Lawes, Oaths, and
Tests, ought to continue till with the Consent of His Majesty and Lords and
Commons in Parliament we are further secured.</p>
            <p>I know that we ought to be much more vigilant over <hi>English Papists,</hi>
then over any Forrainers, for that 'tis a kind of a <hi>Rule</hi> that <hi>Angli nil modicum
in Religione possunt,</hi> and therefore that no <hi>Popish Priest</hi> who is a Subject to
<hi>England</hi> can with the public safety live here. Your Lordship hath I think
as comprehensive a knowledg of the affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as any man can have,
and therefore I shall here tell you that a Gentleman of <hi>Ireland</hi> told me that
in the times of the usurpt powers 'twas in the <hi>Act of Settlement for Ireland</hi>
by the Parliament declared, that it was not their intent after almost a National
Rebellion to extirpate the whole <hi>Irish Nation,</hi> but that after an exception
of certain persons as to Life and Estate, the Act orders some <hi>Irish</hi> to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
the Kingdom, and other <hi>Irish</hi> to be transplanted to some part of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
allowing them such proportion of Land and Estate there as they should have
had of their own elsewhere in <hi>Ireland</hi> if they had not been removed. What
effect that Transplantation had I know not, but I suppose it easier to remove
a handful of men from one corner of the Land to another, then 'twas to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
almost a Nation: And do suppose there are some <hi>Papists</hi> in England as
innocent of this late Plot, as there were some in <hi>Ireland</hi> of that Rebellion,
The <hi>Dean of Canterbury</hi> doth in his incomparable Sermon before the House of
Commons on the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November 1678 acknowledg the Piety and Charity of
several persons who lived and dyed in the Roman Communion, as Erasmus, Father
Paul, Thuanus, and many others who had in truth more goodness then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of that Religion do either incline men to or allow of.</hi> And so I think my
self bound in justice to Judge in that manner of some <hi>Papists</hi> of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Thus the <hi>Epicureans</hi> of old tho their Principle of making happiness consist
in pleasure was detestable, gained this point, that many of their Sect were
honest men: And so much <hi>Tully</hi> acknowledged to be true, but with a <hi>Salvo</hi>
to his exception against their Doctrine Speaking of <hi>Epicurus and his Followers,
L. 2. De Finibus Boni &amp; Mali:</hi> he saith, <hi>Ac mihi quidem videtur quod ipse vir
bonus fuit, &amp; multi Epicurei fuerunt &amp; bodie sunt, &amp; in amicitirs fideles, &amp; in
omni vita constantes &amp; graves, nec voluptate, sed officio consilia moderantes.</hi>
It seems to me that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was a good man; and many of his Sect have
been and are faithful in their friendships, and constant and serious men in
every condition of life: and managing the conduct of their lifes by duty and
not pleasure. But then saith he, <hi>hoc videtur major vis honestatis, minor voluptatis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and afterwards he saith, <hi>atque ut caeteri existimantur dicere melius quam facere,
sic hi mihi videntur melius facere quam dicere:</hi> As much as if he had said, No
thanks to their Principles, but their honest inclinations, the force of honesty
shew'd it self more Predominant in them, then that of pleasure: and as other
mens Principles are accounted better then their Practises, these mens Practises
are better then their Principles.</p>

It is I think Gods standing Miracle in the world, (who is able to make
a divulsion between the formal and the vital Act, namely, to make fire not
burn) to keep some men from undoing themselves and Mankind by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
consequences of the Opinions they profess in matters of Religion: And
thus it is happy for the World, that <hi>Caliginosa nocte premit Deus nepotes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursus:</hi>
And he can by an Omnipotent easiness when he pleaseth, Divert a
mans understanding from seeing any first-born consequence from his opinion,
as well as a more remote one. Moreover, the Divine Power doth in the
Government of the World interpose it self sometimes between professed Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Principles themselves, and mans intellectual faculties. Good men
sometimes do not believe even the existence of that and of some other divine
Attributes, where the things to be believed are to be seen by the light of
Nature; And bad men habituated to lying sometimes do at last believe the
lyes and shamms themselves made, though yet for the most part it happens
(what is perfectly worthy of the Divine Power and goodness) when men are
with Candor and purity of mind seeking after Truth, that-Heaven does so
influence their understandings, as that they are not by false lights artificial
seduced to believe any thing against the light of Nature, nor given up by
<hi>weak</hi> arguments to <hi>strong</hi> delusions. These things considered, I think that
that great <hi>Divine</hi> of our Age, the <hi>Lord Bishop of Lincoln,</hi> hath with a Noble
modesty and charity in the Title of his unanswered and unanswerable Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Popery, exprest the Principles of that Religion <hi>when really believed</hi>
to be pernicious.</p>
            <p>And having said all this, I need not trouble your Lordship or my self
much further about finding a way to prevent the <hi>Papists</hi> from troubling us,
but do suppose that the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves are most concerned to labour in
such an invention. And instead of their being led by any hellish Principles
to destroy any City of Course by Sinister means, That is by burning it, they
may, if they please, in their Devotion, address to Heaven for that favour to
its old chosen People on Earth mentioned in <hi>Psalm. 107. v. 7. And he led them
forth by the right way, that they might go to a City of Habitation.</hi> I suppose,
that after so eminent a Person as the Lord High <hi>Chancellor of England</hi> in his

Power and Popery into this Kingdom,</hi> they will not think it strange that they
should not be permitted to live in any of our Cities again, till they have
shew'd how orderly they can live in one of their own: And therefore I think
we may without breach of Civility, or at least violation of justice, apply to
them some part of the words which I find quoted by <hi>Dr. Bramhall Lord
Bishop of Derry</hi> in his just vindication <hi>of the Church of England,</hi> out of <hi>Gers.

            </p>
            <p>How it is in the case of the People of <hi>Switzerland, Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi>
living apart by themselves in several <hi>Cantons,</hi> cannot be unknown to your
Lordship: Nor that the <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> when they there made their
League at first joyntly to maintain their Liberties against the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi>
then agreed upon this also, That if any of the Natives living in the
<hi>Cantons</hi> of either side should change their Religion, that then they should
be permitted respectively to sell their goods and transplant themselves to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103047:58"/>
               <hi>Canton</hi> whose Religion they embraced. But I shall tell your Lordship, That
of late the <hi>Popish Canton Switz</hi> did break this agreement, and would not
suffer some of their Native Inhabitants to partake of this freedom, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate
the goods of some Families that changed their Religion, and at the
instigation of the <hi>Fryars</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> they condemned some of them to death,
and others to the <hi>Gallyes</hi> which was the cause of a Commotion among
them.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman of <hi>Ireland</hi> who discourst somewhat to me of the <hi>Transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of the <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> told me, it was into the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Connaught,</hi>
and think into the In-land parts of that Countrey, for to have trusted them
to live in Maritine Towns there, whereby they might have let in an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Popish</hi> or other Forrainer, were to have trusted them with <hi>the power of
the Keys</hi> of the Kingdom: And he further told me, That the transplantation
was managed with much satisfactory tenderness to those <hi>Papists,</hi> and that as
to <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> it had partly the nature of a bargain that gave content
on both sides, and secured them against each other after all the mutual exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
that had passed, and when 'twas fresh in the memory of both
<hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> that 'twas the promiscuous and scatter'd dwelling of the
<hi>English</hi> among the <hi>Irish</hi> before the Rebellion that tempted the <hi>Irish</hi> to butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
them, and made the <hi>English</hi> Sheep for the Slaughter; and when it was
not likewise forgot, that in former Wars the partition or distinction of the
<hi>English Pale</hi> did secure the <hi>English</hi> inhabiting within its district.</p>
            <p>I askt the Gentleman if they were not stinted to a certain number of <hi>Priests,</hi>
and care taken that none of them should be <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and that the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Countrey should know their Names, and whether any <hi>Priests</hi>
Natives of that Country were allow'd them? as to which enquiries he did
not fully satisfie me: but I supposed, that since all Religions have a Priest-hood,
that somewhat of that kind was allowed them, and that since the Order of
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> was invented in the Year 1540. by the <hi>Pope</hi> as a Poysonous
<hi>Stumm</hi> to put a new fermentation into the Romish Ecclesiastical Rites and
Discipline, which were almost dead with age; and like <hi>vina vetustate eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi>
and quite dispirited with the Thunder of the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and
the lightning of Learning and Knowledg then flying through the World; and
that that Order of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> was (as it were) a <hi>Court</hi> erected to begin with
execution, and to confute gainsayers by cutting their Throats, No <hi>Iesuits</hi>
were permitted to officiate among those transplanted <hi>Papists,</hi> and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the <hi>Priests</hi> Natives of <hi>Ireland</hi> were the known fomenters of that
Rebellion, that both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> might rather consent to some Secular
<hi>Priests</hi> bred in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> being employed in the New <hi>Irish</hi> Colony,
and who had no knowledg of the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of the several Interests in that
Country, and would not by kindred or relation to any of the great Families
there perhaps be tempted into Factions.</p>
            <p>I have heard from that Gentleman of <hi>Mr. Peter Walsh</hi> a <hi>Fryar</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>
and of his endeavours in the Art of <hi>Cicuration</hi> of some of the Romish Clergy &amp;
Layety who there were Wolfes (and that without Sheeps cloathing) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
them to Principles and Practices consistent with civil society, and
what proficiency his Disciples have made therein, I being a stranger to that
Kingdom know not; but according to that saying, <hi>bonus est quem Nero odit,</hi>
have the better opinion of him for those endeavours of his having been <hi>Crown'd</hi>
with the <hi>Popes</hi> Excommunications.</p>
            <p>It was a noble saying, I have heard of one of the House of Peers this last
Parliament, <hi>I hate not the persons of any Papists, but I am an enemy to Popery:</hi>
In like manner I should be glad that all the <hi>Mercy</hi> were shewn them that were
not <hi>Cruelty</hi> to the Public; but they are to excuse any one that will not forget
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103047:59"/>
that when they begun the last outragious Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which no
words need or can aggravate) they enjoy'd there equal Priviledges with the
<hi>English,</hi> if not greater, the Lawyers were <hi>Irish,</hi> most of the Judges <hi>Irish,</hi>
and the Major part of the Parliament <hi>Irish,</hi> and in all disputes between
<hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> were sure of the Favour; and any one
would be inexcusable to this Kingdom, who forgot that <hi>King Iames</hi>'s
unparalel'd kindness to his Popish Subjects in suspending the execution of Penal
Laws against them, in sparing their purses, in remitting the arrears of what
they owed <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> for pecuniary penalties, nay giving into their hands
what money of theirs as his due was in the Exchequer, was but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to their intended Tragedy on the Fifth of <hi>November.</hi> And what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
they had to be ill wishers to the Life and Crown of the last King,
as appeared by the detection forementioned presented to His Majesty by <hi>Arch-Bishop
Laud,</hi> and a Charge given against them in Print by the Reverend
<hi>Dr. Peter Du Moulin,</hi> which he offer'd to make good; and <hi>ad quod non fuit
responsum,</hi> let any one Judg who further does look on the Parliaments Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
in <hi>Rushworths Collections.</hi> And unless some of them had loved ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for ingratitudes sake, they would never have enter'd into that Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
against his now Majesty, whose Life is the delight of all Mankind but theirs:
And yet since according to that expression, that God is not the God of the
<hi>Iews</hi> only, but also of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> so it being true, that the King is King of
the <hi>Papists</hi> as well as <hi>Protestants,</hi> King of the <hi>Irish</hi> as well as of the <hi>English,</hi>
and a common Father to them all, it may be worthy of His Royal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and a God-like thing in him to distribute to them all the Kindness that
would not undo themselves and others, as the Divine bounty dispenseth itself
to the Sinful, yet with respect to the Government of the World. And as
the love of an Indulgent Father may be measured more by the kindness he
would shew an obstinate son, (were he qualified to receive it) then by what
he doth, who tryes all methods to reclaim him, by his Will Disinherits him,
and goes down to the shades below without revoking such a Will, and yet
in his life-time with the tenderest bowels and softest language he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
bemoaning that Sons being not a Subject fit or capable to participate
in the Estate equally with his Brethren; Thus too may the love of the <hi>Pater
Patriae,</hi> and of the Country it self be demonstrated to these our obstinate
Brethren, more by the Favour we do not afford them, then by what we do,
having often seen the truth of what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, that the <hi>prosperity of fools
destroys them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as I said before, I would be glad that the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves would
try to find out what way of security the Wisdom of His Majesty and His
great Councel may acquiesce in, so that any bitter way may not be prescribed
to them by public Authority, as perhaps this of Transplantation or some other
may seem, and that persons of innocent Tempers and Principles may not be
carryed off, with those of noxious ones, as all strong purging Phisic dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
the body of some good Humours as well as bad: and I therefore wish,
that they may rather satisfie His Majesty that they have transplanted into
their minds some such Principles as are to be found not only in Protestant
but Heathen Authors to incline men to be <hi>Gods</hi> and not <hi>Devils</hi> to one another,
(and those Principles growing in the Soil of Nature when transplanted into the
mind of a Christian, are much more generous and improved, like the Vines
on the <hi>Rhine</hi> transplanted into the <hi>Fortunate Islands</hi>) and whereby a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
King may Sit securely in His Throne, and His <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects sleep
securely in their houses, and walk securely in the Streets without fear of the
fate of <hi>Sir Edmond Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Mr. Arnold,</hi> pursuing them upon a declaratory

then they suffered in the <hi>Dog-days</hi> of <hi>Queen Maryes Reign,</hi> (that <hi>Canicula

after a Tryal for their Lives and Liberty granted to recant at stake. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
when they consider the Popes <hi>Decree</hi> made at <hi>Rome</hi> the second of <hi>March
1679. condemning some Opinions of the Iesuits and other Casuists,</hi> (the which
in Latin and English was printed for <hi>Richard Chiswell</hi> at the <hi>Rose</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi>
in <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Church-Yard 1679.) and see thereby that the <hi>Augean Stable</hi> of the
<hi>Casuists</hi> being so full of Filth that it could hold no more, the Pope to avoid the
scandal of the World, and danger to those Souls who by the practice of those
Opinions were not at that time sent to the place from whence there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
(though yet as the excellent Author of the Preface to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
here printed judiciously observes, That the Pope treats those Opinions
very gently and mercifully, and indeed doth not declare them ill in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or such a Nusance to souls that he could not dispence with) and when
they likewise consider that most of those Opinions if not all were <hi>Rules</hi> allow'd
by <hi>Iesuits</hi> or other <hi>Casuists</hi> for <hi>Confessors</hi> and <hi>Penitents</hi> to go by in the securing
of the great concern of Eternity till that time, and that <hi>Guymenius</hi> with the
approbation and permission of his Superiors in the year 1665. favours most
if not all of those Opinions with a colourable gloss out of Councels, Fathers,
School-men and Divines, and endeavours to throw off the <hi>Odium</hi> from the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> for them, upon the whole <hi>Roman Church,</hi> they should now be so
awaken'd as throughly to examine both those and other points in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
supposing that some future Pope may declare the Souls left in the
lurch that hold some other Opinions recommended to them by their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
guides, without their having obtained a papal dispensation to hold
them.</p>

Antipathy against <hi>Caballing</hi> with any <hi>Papists</hi> as good old <hi>Iacob</hi> shewed he
had against that with <hi>Simeon and Levy,</hi> of which he said, <hi>O my soul come not
thou into their secret, unto their assembly, mine honour be not thou united,</hi> yet
their necessary applications to your Lordship in your administration of the
<hi>Privy Seal</hi> and their voluntary recourse to the hospitality of your noble
and constant Table, where any one in the habit of a Gentleman is allowed
to be your Guest, giving you opportunities of discoursing sometimes with
<hi>Papists,</hi> I suppose your advice to them to consult with one another in peace
how to satisfie His Majesty, that all bloody Consults being by them aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,
he himself may enjoy the <hi>Kings peace,</hi> and we his Subjects enjoy that
<hi>Peace of the King</hi> which his very Wild Beasts in the Forrest enjoy, (as I said before)
and where any of the Inhabitants if they have lights in their Windows that
may affright the Kings Deer are lyable to punishment by the Forrest law,
and <hi>that we being delivered from the hands of our Enemies, may serve God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear in holiness and righteousness all the dayes of our Lives,</hi> and not be in
danger of being in the Kings High-way knock't on the head like <hi>Weasels</hi> or
<hi>Polecats</hi> by <hi>base Ruffians</hi> not worthy to <hi>feed the Dogs of our Flocks;</hi> I say I
suppose your Lordships advice backt with those reasons against Popery that
you alwayes carry ready told, may especially at this time when the <hi>ecce duo
gladii</hi> or <hi>two Votes</hi> of the House of Commons in the last <hi>two Parliaments</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be forgot by any of them, occasion their offering that to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of His Majesty and his great Councel, that may render the Kingdom
safe from any hostility of their Principles or Practises. Your Lordship hath
one advantage in giving advice beyond most men I know, and perhaps no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103047:60"/>
man is Master of that advantage more then your Lordship, and that is your
advice to any of Mankind, is the advice of a friend; for both by your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
temper, and a habit that can plead the prescription of sixty years for its
continuance in your Soul, and a sharpe edge of Wit and Reason to justifie
your claim to it, so it is, that you are in a constant readiness to shew your
self a friend to every Member of that great Body, wishing his happiness as
your own, extending the arm of your beneficence as far as it can reach, to
the remotest object without hurting your self by the straining it, with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
Eye and a tender Hand, and forgiving Heart, guiding unhappy men
out of the very Labyrinths they had brought themselves into by injuring you,
accounting your mercy to be justice to Humane Nature, adorning greatness
both in your self and others with goodness, in the case of the injur'd poor
and weak making oft the great and the mighty asham'd of their oppression
by your reason (and alwayes with Language as soft as the yoke they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
was hard) when you could not make them afraid of it by your power,
and blushing your self for the degeneration of Mans Nature, when you
saw any that shame could not divert from the turpitude of injuring their
brethren of mankind, and by your compassion alleviating that burthen of
the miserable that they had sunk under but by your Fellowship in their
grief, and never dispensing either the Kings reproof or your own to offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
without moderation, and respect to the frail state of Humanity, and
without that mixture of benign advice that gave the <hi>Malheurevs</hi> a plank after
the Shipwrack of their Fame, and very often running the hazard of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your self by helping to save those that were sinking in the Favour of the
King and Court, and when their fate was such that all the rest of the herd
avoided them as a wounded Deer. In a word they that know your Lordship
know that by arguments hard to be answered and a softness of words and
Temper almost inimitable you have Proselyted several <hi>Papists</hi> out of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Principles, and have taught them goodness by your example, and by
your having that happy inclination that <hi>Hillel</hi> a Famous Jewish <hi>Doctor</hi> who
lived a little before our <hi>Saviours Incarnation</hi> so well advised, Namely <hi>Be of
the Disciples of</hi> Aaron, <hi>who loved Peace, and followed Peace, and who loved
Men, and brought them near to the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship by your being so well vers'd in our Statute Laws and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
is able to acquaint them with the Justice of our Ancestors in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of many fresh additional capital Laws (for sanguinary they ought not to
be called since just) against <hi>Papists</hi> upon the detection of several fresh horrid
Treasons, &amp; particularly those against <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>King Iames,</hi> and that
our Ancestors then having a great and violent indignation against Popery
and Papists made Laws with the dread of the <hi>Vltimum supplicium</hi> therein, and
further the anger of Man could not go. But it cannot scape your Lordships
observation that the violence of Passion not being capable of lasting long in
its highest rage how just soever and especially in the brest of an English Man
and a Protestant, those hot Statutes made only (as I may say) a <hi>hizzing</hi> like
a little fire thrown into Water, and as to their Execution went out presently.
Nor have I ever heard of any one that apostatiz'd from the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to that of <hi>Rome</hi> who was as those Statutes ordain punisht as a Traytor, merely
for so doing. And indeed since no Stratagems are to be used twice and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
such as did not succeed once, I am highly pleased that on the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the late detestable Plot there was so great a calmness in the minds, so
general a smoothness in the brows of the people, such an universal Spirit
of Patience forbearance and meekness every where visible in their Faces, even
greater then that which shone in the Minds and Faces of the <hi>Londoners</hi> when
with composed looks they saw their City newly made ashes, and had smelt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103047:60"/>
the <hi>Incendiaries</hi> almost as soon as the Fire, that none can imagine but who
as eye witnesses observed; And even on the fifth of <hi>November</hi> ensuing the
Discovery of the Plot, the two excellent <hi>Preachers</hi> desired to preach before
the House of Lords, and the House of Commons on that day when both an
<hi>Old</hi> and a <hi>New</hi> Plot were staring the Nation in the Face, happen'd to be with
the Peaceable <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> and of the People in that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture</hi>
inspired in the choice of that same part of <hi>Scripture</hi> that was their
<hi>Text</hi> and contain'd the calm yet severe reproof given by the <hi>Founder</hi> of
Christianity to some of his Disciples that would have been Commission'd to
call for Fire from Heaven to consume the inhospitable <hi>Samaritans,</hi> in one of
which Sermons, namely that of the <hi>Dean of Canterbury</hi>'s, 'tis for the Honour of
our Nation and Religion by him observed <hi>p.</hi> 31. of the Sermon, that <hi>after
the Treason of this day, nay at this very time since the Discovery of so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
a design, and the highest provocation in the World by the Treacherous
murder of one of His Majesties Iustices of the Peace a very good man and a most
excellent Magistrate who had been active in the Discovery of this Plot, I say af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this and notwithstanding the continued and insupportable insolence of
their carriage and behaviour, even upon this occasion, no violence, nay not so
much as any incivility that I have heard of has been offer'd to any of them.</hi>
Thus for the words of this good and learned man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that loves not his Brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom
he hath not seen?</hi> And the Religion that prompts them to destroy our bodies
that they see, makes them fearless in the damming of our Souls that they
have not seen, and even without giving us a minutes warning to make up
our accounts with God, and that too perhaps for <hi>extravagant</hi> lenity shew'd
to some incorrigibles among them, which was poor <hi>Godfreys</hi> case. But the
calm temper of the Protestants to them upon the Discovery of the Plot not
breathing out any Cruelty or new Severity against their Bodies or Souls shall
alwayes endear to me the Protestant Religion.</p>
            <p>And though those two great Votes of the House of Commons may seem
severe to the <hi>Papists,</hi> yet are they <hi>warning pieces</hi> only if they please, and
not <hi>murdring</hi> ones, and like the Arrows of <hi>Ionathan</hi> to <hi>warn David</hi> and not
to hurt him; And indeed only to warn them not to kill <hi>David,</hi> and not to
hurt themselves, and in effect a reasonable request or petition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wo Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to them only to make much of themselves, and like the lenity that
accompanied the Divine threatning of <hi>moriendo morieris</hi> restrain'd to their
eating of one tree, so that no Flaming Swords need fence up their way from
the Tree of <hi>Life</hi> unless they please.</p>
            <p>But though the Spirit of the people hath not on the occasion of the late
Plot shew'd its angry resentments against the persons of the <hi>Papists</hi> by any
outrage or rudeness, and though our Parliaments have not on that occasion
as those in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> made the Anger of
the Statute Book to swell with many Acts of Parliament against them, they
are not to infer that therefore the anger of the people diffusive or representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is over, but rather the contrary, from its not having appeared violent.
And indeed as that heat of the body that is acquired not by an approach to a
blazing fire, but gradually by gentle exercise of the parts is most lasting
and most agreeable to its constitution, so is it with that heat of popular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that is the Result of the exercise of mens mindes and of several laboured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
thoughts most durable and salutiferous to the body of the Kingdom. It
hath been observed by a Man of no Vulgar intellectual Tallents <hi>Mr. Philip
Nye</hi> (a Man indeed of great Sagacity in his Generation) as I find it in his Book
called <hi>Beams of former Light</hi> viz. <hi>We know that in near a hundred years the
Reformation gained little upon Popery and Superstition more then was gotten by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103047:61"/>
the first assault, nay it decay'd and Popery grew under it so fast as at last we
were almost returned into the same condition that we were reformed from, and this
(he sayes) may be the cause why the first Reformation prospered no better, there were
the like severe, impositions and Laws made upon occasion of difference among
the Protest ants and then advantages were taken thereby, and many put out of the
Master-Role for Nonconformity who were of greatest courage and most faithful
Resolution against Popery and Superstition the then common Enemy. The silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cing
and ejection of Ministers in Queen</hi> Elizabeths dayes, <hi>reformation being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begun and the Enemies to it many, the friends and those that faithfully engaged
few, was looked on by the godly prudent of that age as very unseasonable, yea the
their crimes had deserved it, because of the searcity of Preachers at that time.
There is nothing more frequent in our Suffering Brethrens writings that were
then published against the Hierarchy then a bemoaning the great loss to the cause
and people of God thereby. I will mention but one, considering the season</hi> (saith
<hi>Mr.</hi> Parker) <hi>though we were worthy, yet should we least be deprived now when
Popery riseth like the swellings of Iordan, yea maketh invasion like an Armed
man, when there are wanting many on the other side in many Parishes to stand up in
the gap against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doth not the Canon Law it self spare depriving for greater faults when there is
penuria sacerdotum &amp; quando utilitas ecclesiae exigit.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> who whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he has assigned <hi>non causam pro causâ</hi> or no, as to the Vigorous encreasing
of Popery after the Reformation, I shall not say, and shall forbear even with
the tenderest and gentlest hand to touch the sore place of the difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Protestants till we are secured against the Rough hands of any <hi>Esaws
touching Gods Annointed.</hi> Nor shall I now debate of which perswasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Protestants should strike Sail to the others, till we have put off the
Fire-ship that hath grappled us, but shall here say that I think one cause
why the Protestant Religion hath not since its first assaults against Popery
gained ground of it proportionably was what is necessarily incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, and even in the most generous, and particularly English Spirits
after a great overflowing of passion to find in themselves the lowest ebb to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the highest tide, and our boyling blood to be the more dispirited after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by reason of its former heat, and for us instantly to fall asleep when
our spirits are taken off from the wrack that passion extended them on, and
to try to recruit our spirits again by the passion of <hi>Pitty</hi> or <hi>Shame</hi> which we
had wasted by that of <hi>Anger,</hi> like men that after one excess refresh themselves
by another. And as the great expenses of War which is the passion of <hi>Anger</hi>
raging in the body of a whole Nation, Necessarily at last end in a peace that
continues till mens plenty blow them up into War again, so doth the spending
and wasting the Treasure of our Spirits by <hi>Anger</hi> necessitate us into a quiet,
that lasts till being thereby recruited we are again capable to take Fire from
a fresh provocation and to trouble our selves and others; But as men grow
older and wiser they grow abler to moderate their passion of <hi>Anger,</hi> and
make it like Fire, not a bad Master but good Servant to themselves and the
Public, not a Fire that acts as natural agents <hi>ad extremum virium</hi> and so as
anger acts and <hi>rests in the bosom of fools</hi> (who are so far natural agents only as
not guided by reason) but as in the Breasts of the Wise, where reason rests and
makes all passions as its Messengers and Ministers, not unresembling what is said
of the most <hi>High that he makes his Ministers a flame of Fire,</hi> and so by <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
men who love others like themselves, their passion of <hi>Anger</hi> is made like
a <hi>Guardian Angel to themselves and others:</hi> and by thus according to that
precept being <hi>angry and sinning not,</hi> the fire of <hi>Anger</hi> in the Protestants here
against Popery having long been light and restless, is at last got to its proper
<hi>Element</hi> where it doth not <hi>Levitate</hi> and where it hath no <hi>burning</hi> but only a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103047:61"/>
               <hi>purifying</hi> quality, and thus the <hi>hatred</hi> of the English Protestants against Popery
may be said to be as the Scripture expression is, <hi>a perfect hatred,</hi> being now
come to its height and proper <hi>Element,</hi> which perfect <hi>Hatred</hi> to Popery,
may always consist with a <hi>perfect love</hi> to Papists, and cinge not a hair of their
heads more then a <hi>Lambent Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I account that we do but Justice to the Persons of many of our
Roman-Catholick Acquaintance in pronouncing of them, that they have no
<hi>PLOT</hi> but to get to Heaven, and to follow the last <hi>Dictates</hi> of their <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical</hi>
understandings as to the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>God</hi> reveal'd in the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall tell your Lordship, that I entertaining my thoughts sometimes with
the great <hi>pacificatory</hi> ones of our <hi>Divines,</hi> have observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d things there said
with <hi>sharpness</hi> enough against the <hi>Errors</hi> of <hi>Papists,</hi> and yet with great
<hi>sweetness</hi> as to the <hi>persons</hi> erring, and not only <hi>exempting</hi> these from <hi>odium</hi>
in their holding Problematick <hi>Tenets</hi> contrary to ours, but asserting their
just liberty so to do.</p>
            <p>And because one of our <hi>Church of England-Divines</hi> who hath writ at that
rate, hath done it with a graceful mixture of <hi>wit</hi> and frankness, I shall here
entertain your Lordship with some of his passages about it.</p>
            <p>I intend here to refer you to an excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> of Dr. <hi>Ingelo</hi>'s, Preached
at S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and Printed <hi>A.</hi> 1659. and where in <hi>p.</hi> 129. he saith, <hi>I am
afraid that</hi> Christian Religion <hi>will not recover for a good while, that honour
which is lost by the</hi> uncharitableness <hi>of the</hi> present <hi>Age. God grant that we
may return speedily to the</hi> sincerity <hi>of the</hi> Protestant <hi>Principles. We know
not what the Christian Religion is but by the Scriptures, and by them we may
know, for there it is</hi> plainly <hi>and</hi> fully <hi>set down. In things doubtful, if every
Christian may not interpret for himself; how shall we justifie the</hi> Protestants
Separation <hi>from the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, not to have been a</hi> Schism, <hi>and,
as the Papists say, an</hi> Apostacy <hi>from the true Church?</hi> They <hi>interpret</hi> one
<hi>way, and</hi> we another. <hi>And was not the</hi> rigid <hi>imposition of their</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as infallible, <hi>one of those</hi> good <hi>reasons for which we departed from
them? But when we read these Scriptures,</hi> They shall kill you, and think
they do God service, <hi>and,</hi> By zeal I persecuted the Church, <hi>and,</hi> They
have a zeal, but not according to knowledge; <hi>we may perceive that</hi> hot
zeal <hi>may be accompanied with</hi> gross ignorance, <hi>and</hi> great cruelty. <hi>Some
that</hi> mean well, <hi>perhaps, may do</hi> shrowd mischief, <hi>and through</hi> impotence
of Spirit, Inconsiderateness, ill Nature, narrowness of Soul, want of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and converse with wise Men, <hi>&amp;c. may throw</hi> fire-brands <hi>into the
House of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a strange device of pleasing God, to <hi>sacrifice</hi> his <hi>Friends</hi> to him, when
as he <hi>desireth</hi> not the death of his <hi>Enemies.</hi> But those which kill them say,
<hi>O, but they are in errour.</hi> Really it may be so, for it is a very hard
matter for such <hi>fallible</hi> creatures as we are, not to <hi>erre</hi> in some things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But those are <hi>unmerciful guides,</hi> which kill <hi>plain-hearted Passengers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have missed the way, when as it is likely that they, <hi>poor men,</hi>
could not help it. <hi>I, but they will not go into the way when they are
bidden.</hi> Well, but will they do it, when you have killed them? If they were
out of the way, you have made them for ever coming into it again. Since the
<hi>wanderer</hi> did not hearken to you, it may be that he knew nothing to the
contrary, but that you were as <hi>ignorant</hi> of the way, as himself. <hi>No, you
had a Book of it, wherein it was fairly mapp'd forth.</hi> That is, the <hi>Bible;</hi>
and he had it too. <hi>But you understand it better then he did.</hi> I cannot tell
that. However, are you <hi>infallible</hi> also? If you be not, you may be out of the
way your self, and if it should chance to prove so, you would be loath to be
cudgell'd into it again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:103047:62"/>
               <hi>If you will</hi> glorify <hi>God, do as he doth.</hi> What is that? He declares his will,
teacheth us his Truth, engageth us with a thousand mercies, to do our duty;
and notwithstanding we continue our disobedience, he awaits our repentance
with a God-like patience. <hi>Wilt thou go and do likewise?</hi> No, because they
receive not Jesus Christ, I will call for fire from Heaven upon them.
<hi>Poor man! thou art of a</hi> hot <hi>spirit, and wouldest thou have it increased with</hi>
flames <hi>from</hi> above? <hi>that fire</hi> enlightens, warms, <hi>and so</hi> melts, <hi>but doth not</hi>
burn <hi>and</hi> fry <hi>men for their Salvation. Take heed what</hi> thou <hi>dost to others,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The common <hi>style</hi> in so many mens Writings of <hi>Religionary</hi> Controversie
is not more vexatious then that I have now entertain'd you with of this
learned Writer is charming. And indeed as <hi>turbid</hi> as this <hi>interval</hi> of time
is while Moral offices are calling upon us in our several Stations by all due
means to withstand <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpations (and which men of sense generally
mean by <hi>Popery</hi>) yet as to the <hi>Tenets</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and <hi>Purgatory</hi>
and others of that Nature, however so much <hi>disgusted</hi> by the <hi>bulk</hi> of the
Nation, such <hi>bulky</hi> and voluminous <hi>Controversial</hi> writing of them, as was
long ago in use, is nauseous to the age, and the time spent in reading Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> writ of such Subjects would now be judged as the diverting
Men from regular action in opposing any <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpations.</p>
            <p>Who is at all concerned about <hi>extension</hi> or <hi>divisibility</hi> being the <hi>formalis
ratio</hi> of <hi>quantity,</hi> or at there being <hi>demonstration</hi> on either <hi>side,</hi> that hoth
the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> is so? But 'tis one man's <hi>extending</hi> his Confines on
those of another man's Estate, or his <hi>dividing</hi> a <hi>quota</hi> of it from him, that
naturally makes Controversie so hot and loud. When a man by pretending
to <hi>illuminate</hi> another about the <hi>next</hi> World <hi>stands in his light</hi> in this, and when
a handful of men would grasp all the Dignities of this World because of their
expectance of monopolizing those of the next (and which indeed should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
allay their Ambition in this according to that Saying,—<hi>Si tam certa
manet gloria quid properas?</hi>) here the <hi>hinge</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi> turns so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily
between so many <hi>Protestants</hi> and so many <hi>Papists;</hi> tho yet I must here
acknowledge, that as I know <hi>Protestants</hi> enow, who neither repine at <hi>God</hi>'s
or his <hi>Vice-gerent</hi>'s choice of their <hi>Instruments,</hi> so I do <hi>Papists</hi> whose <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is known to all men,</hi> and who are far from affecting any excessive <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance</hi>
of <hi>Power</hi> in the Services of their Prince.</p>
            <p>And were I for my Life to give our Roman-Catholick fellow-Subjects the
best advice I could for their own Preservation, it should be their using all
means possible to convince the world, that they affected nothing of such a
Paramount <hi>Power,</hi> and aimed at no such thing. <hi>Aufer ut uterque securius
dormiat,</hi> was said by the <hi>Stoick</hi> to him that was taking away his Riches in
the Night. I am sure I shall never repine at it, if ever there should be a
<hi>due</hi> or <hi>legal</hi> relaxation of any Penalties that may seem sanguinary in making
their Purses bleed, but shall be content with its being out of the Power of
such among them who affect a <hi>growth</hi> of their <hi>interests</hi> under the <hi>Pope</hi> as a
<hi>fifth Monarch,</hi> to render others of them liable to Envy who only endeavour
their <hi>growing</hi> in <hi>Grace</hi> under the <hi>Pope</hi> as their chief <hi>Spiritual</hi> Pastor. And
tho perhaps to advise any <hi>hot-Spurs</hi> among them to part with <hi>Power,</hi> may
seem <hi>durus sermo,</hi> as much as cutting off a Right hand that has long offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselves and others; yet if it shall appear that by that means they will
secure all the <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of Protestants thereby for their defence,
they will gain more then <hi>Cent per Cent</hi> in the Exchange: as those who in
our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s time <hi>forsook Houses and Lands for him,</hi> did according to his
promise gain a Thousand Fold by it in this life, by the Houses and Lands of

Therefore in the 88<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>Advertisement</hi> of <hi>Boccalin</hi>'s <hi>Ragguagli, the Sheep send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Embassadours to</hi> Apollo, <hi>desiring that they may be allowed to have
sharp Teeth and long horns, and not seem abandon'd by that Divine Charity that
hath given offensive as well as defensive arms to hurtful animals, by whom they
often Suffered, and sometimes by their very Shepherds who in Sheering them
would cut their Skins,</hi> Apollo <hi>told them, that no Beasts were so much the Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of him and of men as they, for that whereas others with great anxiety were
forced in the Night, the time of rest and sleep, to seek their Food, that they could
not do with safety in the day, Men the Lords of the Earth bought at dear rates
pasture grounds for Sheep, and that tho men did make Nets, feed Dogs and lay
snares for hurtful Beasts, they employed Shepherds and Dogs to guard Sheep,
and that no Shepherds could deal ill with their Flocks without being chiefly cruel
to themselves, and that therefore their security lay in not being able to fright
their Shepherds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus every one is naturally abhorr'd who attacks a Naked man, and from
such a one <hi>Lions</hi> themselves either through fear or generosity have made their
Retreat. The <hi>holy Writ</hi> affords us a memorable Instance of the Divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
in the 38<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Prophesie against <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> who are
there branded as the Invaders of a defensless City, 'Tis there mention'd in
v. 10<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th. Thus saith the Lord God, it shall also come to pass, that at the
same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought;</hi>
and v. 11<hi>th. And thou shalt say, I will go up to the Land of unwalled Villages,
I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without
walls, and having neither Bars nor Gates;</hi> and in v. 12<hi>th, to take a spoil and to
take a prey, to turn thy hand upon the desolate places, that are now inhabited, and
upon the people that are gather'd out of the Nations which have gotten Cattel and
goods that dwell in the MIDST (or navel) of the land.</hi> But it then follows
v. 14. <hi>Therefore Son of man Prophecy and say unto</hi> Gog, <hi>Thus saith the Lord
God, in that day when my people of</hi> Israel <hi>dwells safely, shalt thou not know it?</hi>
that is, thou shalt know it to thy sorrow and by thy bitter experience of my
wrath, what it is to disturb my harmless and quiet people in the World. The
Comparing of the following 16<hi>th</hi> and 18<hi>th</hi> v. shew this to be the meaning
of v. 14<hi>th.</hi> And I believe if any of the people of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Law to live apart by themselves, they might in any defenceless Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be as secure from danger or fear of the <hi>Protestant Israel</hi> as they pleased.</p>
            <p>It hath been well observed by a great Enquirer into <hi>humane Nature,</hi> That
a restless desire of power after <hi>power</hi> that ceaseth only in death, is a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of all mankind; and the cause of this is not alwaies that a man hopes
for a more intensive delight then he has already attained to, or that he cannot
be content with a moderate <hi>power,</hi> but because he cannot assure the <hi>power</hi> and
means to live well which he hath present without the acquisition of more:
And from hence it is that Kings whose <hi>power</hi> is greatest, turn their endeavours
to the Assuring it at home by Laws, or abroad by Warrs. But as much as it
is the inclination of the unthinking or brutish part of Mankind, that <hi>power</hi>
should be like the <hi>Crocodile</hi> alwaies growing, the soberer few do know, that
<hi>power</hi> will destroy it self if it shall be still ascending and hath not a Center
wherein to rest and be quiet, just as fire would perish in nature and destroy it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103047:63"/>
self, if there were not an Element allow'd it wherein to leave burning: And
that therefore <hi>Augustus</hi> wisely designed a <hi>Law de cohibendis imperii finibus,</hi>
And that the experience of Antient and Modern times hath taught the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
part of mankind, That great Empires have sunk under their weight, and
have lost the length of their <hi>power</hi> by the widening it; and that Kings whose
power is greatest (as was said) sometimes turn their endeavours to the Assure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it at home by Laws, which by giving it some bound are like letters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the edges of our coyn, <hi>Decus &amp; tutamen</hi> to it, the which makes it so
Sacred, that 'twould be both Treasonable and Ridiculous to clip it, and that
as the Bees by their King have given the world an instance in Nature of
Kingly power, so they have likewise another of Kings governing by the power
of Laws. 'Tis a common observation, That tho Bees are little angry fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Creatures upon occasion, and leave their stings in the wounds they
make, <hi>Rex tamen apum sine aculeo est,</hi> the King of the Bees is without any
sting, and the curious work of the Hive goes on with a great deal of <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
and idle Drones are thence as it were <hi>legally</hi> expel'd who would there
invade property. Nor need the <hi>King</hi> of the Bees (say the Naturalists) have
a sting, for the whole Hive defends and guards him, as thinking that they
are all to perish if their King be destroyed.</p>
            <p>And this would be the case of the Papists, if they would be content so to
part with the sting of their <hi>Power</hi> that it could not hurt either King or
Kingdom, and might not come to lose it self by so doing, they would have
the <hi>Posse</hi> of every County to defend them, they would have the Laws and
the whole <hi>Hive</hi> of <hi>English</hi> men to guard them, the very Anger of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
would be a defensive <hi>Wall of Fire</hi> round about them. 'Tis true, that
wild <hi>Animals</hi> are by their constant fears of danger habituated to more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
then Tame ones of the same species, but all their little cunning renders
them not so safe as the great wisdom &amp; protection of the Law doth the other;
and ranging and out-lying Deer thrive not so well as those that are in the
Forrests. And here it falls in my way to observe, that the Kings caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Forrests,</hi> that the Mastiffs shall have the <hi>Power</hi> took
from them of hurting the Deer, may well insinuate into us the reason and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of all our Laws that hinder its being in the power of a man to be a
<hi>Wolf</hi> to another, and of the <hi>Power</hi> inherent by the Law of Nature in all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Princes to restrain any undue Power of Subjects from violating the
Public peace. As the Law of God and Nature command both <hi>Iustice</hi> and
<hi>Mercy</hi> to be shewn to <hi>Beasts,</hi> so doth the Law of <hi>England</hi> provide that any
mans person and Estate should be seized into the Kings hands in case of some
wild cruelty to his Beasts; for he would appear in the eye of the Law an
<hi>Idiot</hi> or a <hi>Lunatic,</hi> that should put his Horses or Asses to the Sword.</p>
            <p>That which I mention'd of the Laws providing that the Mastiffs of any
Inhabitants in Forrests shall not have Power to hurt the Deer, is called by
the Forrest Law, <hi>Lawing of Mastiffs,</hi> or the <hi>Expeditating them,</hi> that is the
three Claws of their Fore-foot to the Skin are to be cut off; and thus they
are to be <hi>law'd</hi> every three years for the preserving the Kings Game, and the
peace of his wild Beasts. The Regarders of the Forrest are to make a <hi>TRIEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIAL</hi>
enquiry about it <hi>&amp; tunc fiat per visum &amp; testimonium legalium homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
&amp; non aliter,</hi> that is not Arbitrarily, there must be legal Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
legal Testimony, and no <hi>Dog law'd</hi> without Judicial proceeding. This
<hi>Forrest Law</hi> made in the time of our Popish Ancestors, did suppose; that
the Kings Game could not be preserved, nor the Peace of his Wild Beasts,
by the Dogs being then either <hi>exorcised,</hi> or their lapping a little holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or any <hi>expedient</hi> (as I may say) without <hi>expeditation,</hi> which did <hi>ipso facto</hi>
destroy their Power of destroying the Kings Game and the Peace of his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103047:63"/>
wild Beasts; and therefore that's the only <hi>valuable Garranty</hi> we can have
from those who without <hi>Law</hi> and against <hi>Law</hi> would hunt down the King
himself and his Tame Subjects, that the <hi>excrescence</hi> of their power should be
<hi>hambled</hi> or <hi>expeditated:</hi> but the <hi>modus</hi> of this I do again say ought by them
to be tendered to the Consideration of his Majesty and the <hi>Triennial</hi> Regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of the Kingdom. I am sure 'tis worthy the consideration of us <hi>English,</hi>
what the Learned <hi>Frenchman Monsieur Bodin</hi> tells us in his Book <hi>de Republica
Lib. 5. Cap. 6. Vna est tenuium adversus potentiores securitatis ratio, ut scili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet
si nocere velint non possent, cum nocendi voluntas ambitiosis hominibus &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perandi
cupidis nunquam sit defutura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>my Lord</hi> to give your Lordship a <hi>home Instance</hi> of Jealousie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Fire in some meerly from the <hi>power</hi> of another to do them hurt, I will
instance in your self at this conjuncture of time. The nature of <hi>Iealousie</hi>
renders it to be a troublesom <hi>weed</hi> and yet such an one that growes in the
Richest Soil of Love, my meaning is, that 'tis a <hi>fear</hi> of Love not being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
when one doth <hi>love</hi> intensely with desire of being so <hi>loved. My Lord,</hi> in
the picture of your mind that I have already drawn in this Letter, I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done you a little right, and not at all favour'd you, and 'tis but Justice to
you to acknowledge that the Protestant part of your Country hath a singular
love for you, with a desire of being so loved by you; and 'tis in this <hi>Critical</hi>
conjuncture of time that your <hi>power</hi> makes them <hi>fear</hi> the love not to be <hi>mutual.</hi>
Your Lordship knows, that <hi>fear</hi> in people is an <hi>aversion</hi> with an opinion of
hurt from any object, and they soon <hi>hate</hi> those things or persons for which
they have <hi>aversion:</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of hurt by <hi>power</hi> disposeth men naturally to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate,</hi>
and not to stay for the <hi>first blow,</hi> or else to crave aid from <hi>Society</hi> and
from others especially whose concern may be the same or greater then theirs,
and who are their representatives, and to wish ill to those who make them
sleep in armour, or to <hi>stand</hi> in the posture of <hi>Gladiators</hi> with their weapons
pointing, and their eyes fixed on another, and to be still in <hi>procinctu,</hi> and all
those passions sprung from the Root of Jealousie, as far as they exceed the
bounds of reason, are degrees of <hi>madness.</hi> And tho mans life be a constant
<hi>motion,</hi> and for the most part in both a Rugged way and near Precipices, yet
during that <hi>madness</hi> men are still by their own Scorpions scourging it to make
it <hi>move</hi> faster then the regular and intended pace of Nature, and injuring
themselves with their passions, are content too to wound another through
their own sides. And thus <hi>my Lord</hi> give me leave to tell you, That 'tis a
kind of a <hi>Complement</hi> from people to a great good man of whose <hi>power</hi> and of
whom they are <hi>jealous,</hi> when that it may be said of them, that they are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
faln <hi>mad</hi> for <hi>love</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>One part of your Power, namely that wherein you are a Conduit-Pipe to
convey the grants of Honour and profit from your <hi>Royal Master,</hi> the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
of Honour, 'tis possible for you to quit, and that with pleasure too, that
you may have time to quench your great <hi>thirst</hi> after knowledge in that
great collection of waters into which so many Streams of learning have met
from all ages and Nations, I mean your vast and choice Library. And I may
well suppose that your Lordship hath now that sense of <hi>Greatness</hi> and of <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
by publick Employment, that <hi>Cardinal Granvel</hi> expressed at his retirement
from the same, <hi>That a great Man is like a great River, where many sorts of
Creatures are still quenching their thirst, but are likewise still muddying and
troubling the Stream.</hi> Your Lordship knows who said, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Complaints of <hi>Mimick Apes</hi> and <hi>grave Asses,</hi> of <hi>airy</hi> fools and <hi>formal</hi> fops one
against another: but in your <hi>noble Library</hi> you have the advantage of the
<hi>still Musick</hi> of the Tomb, you have the <hi>weight</hi> of many dead Authors <hi>making</hi>
no <hi>noise,</hi> you have <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> standing quietly by each other, and
some Authors content with the dust of your Library who thought one
Christian world not enough to trouble; 'tis there you will avoid any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by <hi>Authors</hi> of <hi>gilded outsides</hi> intruding, nor be molested as now by <hi>nonsense</hi>
in <hi>fine clothes.</hi> You cannot now quietly enquire after the fountain of <hi>Nile</hi>
for the noise of its <hi>Cataracts,</hi> nor appease your <hi>thirst</hi> after knowledge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then <hi>tanquam canis ad Nilum</hi> for fear of the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> of the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
you, nor have a view of the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi> without a <hi>Serpent</hi> of
envy circled about it, nor have <hi>time</hi> to look on the pieces painted for <hi>eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
nor to mind the <hi>Eclipses</hi> in the <hi>Heavens</hi> while you are preventing your
own being <hi>eclipsed</hi> in the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>my Lord,</hi> there is another kind of <hi>power inherent in</hi> you, and that you
cannot part with, such a power as <hi>King Charles the first</hi> in his <hi>Eikon Basil.</hi>
affixes to the Character of his <hi>favorite,</hi> when he sayes, <hi>he looked on the Earl
of</hi> Strafford <hi>as a Gentleman whose great abilities might make a Prince rather
afraid then ashamed to employ him in the greatest affaires of State.</hi> Your very
<hi>Reputation</hi> for <hi>power</hi> is <hi>power,</hi> for that engageth those to adhere to you, who
want protection. Your <hi>Success</hi> in your past conduct of publick affaires is
<hi>power,</hi> for it makes men promise to themselves good fortune while they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you. Your eloquence that fastens mens ears to your lips is <hi>power.</hi> Your
great knowledge in the <hi>Law</hi> whereby you possess that Engine by which you
can be only attacked, and whereby you have that fastness, where one-a-brest
can keep down a Multitude, is <hi>power.</hi> Your <hi>affability</hi> and <hi>good Nature</hi> that
endear you to so many, <hi>is power,</hi> and makes the <hi>hearts</hi> of men to be your
<hi>Pyramids.</hi> And all these sorts of <hi>power</hi> in you, which make every party wish
you to be <hi>theirs,</hi> make up so bright a beauty in your mind, as may well
cause <hi>jealousie</hi> in that party that by <hi>loving</hi> you, think they have Right to be
again beloved by you; I mean the English Protestants, who court you, and
to whom you have so long engaged your self, and especially when they shall
find their <hi>Rivals</hi> boast of the <hi>kindness</hi> you have for them; and that too at
such a time as this, when the Protestants seem to have the concern of one that
is playing his last stake, and which only can make him fetch back all he has
lost; a <hi>time,</hi> when any one who pretends to a cold harmless neutrality, doth
really intend an exulcerated hatred; <hi>a time,</hi> wherein he that <hi>is not with us
is against us,</hi> however it may have hapned, that in some <hi>lazy</hi> conjunctures
when Papists and Protestants were half asleep both here and in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Continent, that then <hi>he that was not against us was with us; a time,

that of the tempest that happen'd to the Ship that carried <hi>Iona</hi> among the

<hi>waking,</hi> some at work to save the Ship, and others to bore holes in it, as if
they were concerned to have it cast away as being not <hi>owners</hi> in it, and as if
they had secured their own merchandize in it which they purchased by the
money they took up at <hi>Bottomry</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> or its agents, and knew how to
secure themselves in the <hi>Cock-boat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have had dull and lazy conjunctures of time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heretofore, insomuch
that many years ago a <hi>Divine</hi> seemed to begin a <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Gun-powder
Treason day before</hi> a great Academick audience, as it were <hi>yawning</hi> and in his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103047:64"/>
               <hi>sleep</hi> with these words, <hi>Conspiracies if not prevented, are rather dangerous then
otherwise:</hi> And thus the ingenious <hi>Comedy</hi> tells us of a <hi>Hero,</hi> that as he was
in the height of his <hi>passion</hi> with the greatest zeal <hi>making Love,</hi> instantly dropt
down into a deep sleep; but 'tis no time for <hi>yawning</hi> when the Earth begins
to <hi>yawn</hi> under us. And tho times have been heretofore influencing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
cause like the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>March</hi> that could only raise the <hi>vapors</hi> of Popery
in the body of the Nation and not dissipate them, 'tis now supposed to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
and as I have heard that the <hi>Earl of Hallifax</hi> in his <hi>Speech</hi> in the
house of Lords having spoken of his hatred to Popery, excellently well added
somewhat to this effect, <hi>And we may now exterminate it if we will.</hi> And
therefore with that now, I think the <hi>ecce nunc tempus acceptabile festina &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare,</hi>
may be applyed to the Kingdom. And if as the <hi>School-men</hi> tell us, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
may <hi>dance</hi> upon the <hi>point</hi> of a Needle, we may imagine many both good
and bad ones dancing on <hi>this point of time;</hi> 'tis on <hi>this</hi> moment the Nations
eternity depends. Every one now is as good a <hi>Conjurer</hi> as <hi>Friar Bacon,</hi> and
can make a Brazen head say time is; by which words I believe the learned
<hi>Roger Bacon</hi> meant only, that in the vessel of Brass wherein the exquisite chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
preparations for the birth of gold were laboured, the nick of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was to be watched under pain of the loss of all the fire and Materials, and
art and labour, according to that of <hi>Petrus Bongus. Ibi est operis perfectio aut
annihilatio, quoniam ipsa die immò horâ, oriuntur elementa simplicia depurata quae

for it in his <hi>vulgar errors,</hi> where he further saith, <hi>Now letting slip this critical
opportunity, he missed the intended Treasure, which had he obtained, he might
have made out the tradition of making a brazen wall about</hi> England, <hi>that is, the
most powerful defence and strongest fortification which Gold could have effected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> my opinion was askt in a letter from a very honest Gentleman
and much your Lordships Servant, Whether you should not do your self and
your Religion a greatdeal of Right, by printing in this <hi>juncture</hi> some of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and large discourses you have formerly writ against Popery? and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the answer I gave him was to this effect, That tho I would not diswade
your Lordships now publishing any thing relating to the tenets of that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Religion that might import Protestants to understand more cleerly then
they did, in which way they have been advantaged by the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln's</hi>
Book against Popery, yet that I thought the great bulk of Popery could no
more be destroyed by notions and arguments, then a <hi>capital Ship</hi> could be <hi>sunk</hi>
with <hi>bullets,</hi> for that supposing they did all light between <hi>wind and water,</hi> the
Papists have thousands of Plugs ready to be clapt in there, and thousands of men
in that great vessel ready to apply them, and tho I thought there was a <hi>time</hi> for
writing of Books, it was when there was a time for reading them, that is, when
people <hi>had time</hi> to read them, but that now the most curious works of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akers,</hi>
and <hi>Iewels,</hi> and <hi>Rainoldses,</hi> would be no more regarded, then <hi>attempts</hi> of
shewing the <hi>longitude</hi> would be to Navigators while under the attack of a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as I said, or while they were making their way through the body of an
Enemies Fleet. I know that 'tis said to be an old <hi>Sybilline Prophecy,</hi> that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall be destroyed by paper</hi> viz. <hi>Antichristum lino periturum,</hi> but alas,
that way is now as insignificant in the case, as to think that the dominion of
the Sea can be built up by <hi>Seldens Mare Clausum,</hi> or destroyed by <hi>Grotius</hi> his
<hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> or any way but by <hi>thundring Legions</hi> in powerful fleers.</p>
            <p>Indeed our paper pellets that the press since its licence hath shot against
Popery, I mean the innumerable little <hi>sheet-pamphlets</hi> that have come out
against it may find time to be read, and to give us diversion, but the Papists
looking on their Church as a great <hi>First-Rate</hi> Mann'd with <hi>Popes</hi> and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
and <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> and innumerable Souls there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103047:65"/>
embarqued in the Sea of <hi>time</hi> for the great Voyage of <hi>Eternity,</hi> do account
our little Protestant honest <hi>Sheet-authors firing</hi> at them daily to be only like
the <hi>Yacht-Fan Fan</hi>'s attacking <hi>De Ruyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Lord, there is another Reason why a person of your Lordships
great Power and Abilities should not at this time embarrase your self with
writing, No not those defences of your innocency, which yet perhaps may be
necessary to be done for the use of those who know you not hereafter when
the heat of the day and your Services in this critical juncture shall be over,
and would now shew as meanly as if a <hi>General</hi> in the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Battel</hi> having
some dirt or dust lighting on his face, should while he was among the bullets
employ his barbers washballs to cleanse it, and that too when the fate of the
battel seems to <hi>totter</hi> and is near decision one way or other, and while there is
hardly room for the <hi>Quid agendum</hi> to wedge it self in, and <hi>he that saith consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is</hi> almost <hi>a foe,</hi> (and therefore once when a great <hi>Commander</hi> had no way
to save himself and his Army but by their swimming with their horses through
a River to attack their Enemy, he did only to that question of <hi>quid agendum</hi>
put to him by his Officers, suddenly eccho back the reply of <hi>agendum,</hi> and with
his horse took the River) and while now 'tis with us as on board a Ship in the
time of Fight, or of a Storm when they are Fighting with the Elements, and the
Master or Steersman orders any thing to be done, the case will bear no dilatory
answer of words, and the answer there is, <hi>Done it is;</hi> I say, after all this, that
there is a reason which in my opinion renders any mans writing unnecessary
now either to the World or himself, and that is this, That words and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
the which formerly having the stamp of common usage and of reason
on them passed as currant coine for the Signification of mens minds and as
a <hi>medium</hi> of <hi>commerce,</hi> are in this juncture as useless that way, and of as little
value as lether <hi>coine called in:</hi> and this Age wherein both the <hi>word</hi> and
<hi>thing</hi> called <hi>shamme,</hi> hath been brought in use, and <hi>shamme</hi> calls it self an answer
to that great question, <hi>What is wit?</hi> tho with as little reason as if a lye should
call it self an answer to that old great question, <hi>What is truth,</hi> hath inforced
those that do not love to be <hi>shamm'd upon,</hi> not to measure mens <hi>actions</hi> by their
<hi>words,</hi> but their <hi>words</hi> by their <hi>Actions.</hi> And tho a mans written <hi>books</hi> are
called his <hi>works,</hi> yet have I observed an occasion of <hi>Sarcasme</hi> given thereby,
when one speaking of a particular <hi>Divines</hi> excellent <hi>writings,</hi> said he loved
his <hi>works,</hi> but hated his <hi>actions.</hi> And written <hi>works</hi> are now indeed but act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as when a man doth <hi>agree gestum in scena</hi> on the <hi>Stage</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and
for them he finds but only a <hi>Theatrical</hi> applause, Nor so much as that, when
like the <hi>Actor crying O heavens,</hi> he looks <hi>down</hi> on the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he is alwaies accounted but a smatterer in knowledge who is a <hi>pedant,</hi> or
<hi>petty-Chapman</hi> in <hi>words,</hi> so he playes but at small games in <hi>politicks,</hi> who is a
<hi>pedant</hi> or trader in <hi>words,</hi> or who indeed will <hi>give</hi> any thing for them. He
who doth <hi>verba dare</hi> has <hi>bad morals,</hi> and who gives any thing else for them
has <hi>bad intellectuals,</hi> and according to that old <hi>Monkish</hi> verse they said,
<q>Res dare pro rebus, pro verbis verba solemus.</q>
The only <hi>real security</hi> therefore that the World hath for its <hi>quiet,</hi> is mens <hi>only</hi>
giving a <hi>seeming belief</hi> to <hi>seeming professions</hi> and <hi>protestations;</hi> for as <hi>Ayr</hi>
out of its place makes <hi>Earth-quakes,</hi> so if the <hi>articulate air</hi> of mens <hi>words</hi> gets
beyond my <hi>hearing</hi> into my <hi>belief,</hi> it may there raise those commotions of
passion that may make me trouble both my self and the World, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the passion of jealousie before-mentioned, on my desire where I have a
kindness that it should be mutual, and when positive words brought me into
the fools paradise of believing it possible, a thing perhaps not possible in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that two bodies and minds whose faculties must needs be different,
should have an equal intenseness of love for each other, no president of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103047:65"/>
particularly that of <hi>Ionathan and David,</hi> having shewn it, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
love the passions of the <hi>weaker</hi> Sex being observed to be the <hi>strongest,</hi> and
that of jealousie as well as Love jealousie particularly being most <hi>potent</hi> in minds
most <hi>impotent,</hi> and in persons most diffident of themselves. And this may in
some sort <hi>console</hi> your Lordship after all your restless endeavours to merit the
love of all your Countrymen if it be not exactly mutual. But this by the
way.</p>
            <p>The great names of <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> began to adorn each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>year of our Lord</hi> 1529, when some of the <hi>Electors</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of
the <hi>Empire</hi> with a <hi>protestation</hi> opposed the <hi>Decree</hi> relating to the <hi>Mass</hi> and
<hi>Eucharist,</hi> made at <hi>Spiers,</hi> and when some of the <hi>Capital Cities</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi>
joyn'd with them to <hi>protest</hi> the same thing. But every one knows that a
protestation is a revocable thing, and that a <hi>Protestation contrary to actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
it self.</hi> And that the word <hi>Protestant,</hi> hath not been in the World as
the Poets term is of calling grass green, or the like, <hi>otiosum epitheton,</hi> I believe
the Papists will grant: and 'tis not one <hi>Protestation</hi> made and not revoked ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by words or actions, that can make that term consistent with our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or render a man worthy to be call'd one. 'Tis not a good continual claim
to our Religion that yet is for land we are disseis'd of that is made only once
a year whilst we live: No; the <hi>Protestation</hi> that the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
is such a continual one as is reiterated, upon every fresh act and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the <hi>Papal</hi> Religion against ours; 'tis not a going to our Cells, and
saying, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> but 'tis our watching in our Stations, and
our shewing no <hi>mercy</hi> to the <hi>principles</hi> of Popery that are alwaies attacking
the quiet of the World either by Storm or Siege, or undermining; 'tis like the
<hi>Protestation</hi> required when the defendant hath declined a Judge, that
must be made <hi>toties quoties</hi> as any <hi>new</hi> Act is done by the Judge, without
which the <hi>first Protestation</hi> grows insignificant: 'tis not one Act of <hi>protesting</hi>
the <hi>Popes Bills</hi> of Exchange for good money we paid him, and his giving us
<hi>bank-tickets</hi> upon <hi>purgatory,</hi> or giving us some fantastick Saints pretended
Hair or Nailes (<hi>protested</hi> with so much scorn by our Popish Ancestors in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the 8th's</hi> time, that a piece of St. <hi>Andrews finger</hi> covered with an ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pawn'd by a Monastery for forty pound, was left unredeemed at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of it, which shewed that that commodity would even then yeild
nothing, and was a meer drug in <hi>Scotland</hi> (of which Country he is call'd the
Saint Protector) but 'tis further like a <hi>protestation against the Sea</hi> at the next
Port made <hi>toties quoties</hi> goods in a Ship are damnified by its rage, which the
law requires the <hi>Skipper</hi> to make, or else leaves answerable for the dammage.
And if a poor <hi>Tarpauling</hi> who must alwaies plough the Sea for his bread
during life, and there still contest with the angry Elements, shall when he
comes on shore by a <hi>protestation</hi> bid defiance to the <hi>pride</hi> of the whole <hi>Ocean,</hi>
he deserves not the name of a <hi>Hero</hi> that Safe-guarded by both the <hi>Land</hi> and
the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> shall not on occasions offered continually have the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to <hi>protest</hi> against the dammages both his King and Country have from the
<hi>Rage</hi> of Popery. My Lord, I have been the longer in discoursing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significancy
of <hi>words,</hi> or indeed ought, but the <hi>emphasis</hi> of <hi>works</hi> requisite to
shew a Protestant <hi>faith</hi> at this Juncture, because I am sure you are willing (as
you may well be) to <hi>joyne issue</hi> on that point, and to be judged a Protestant in
<hi>mans day</hi> by your works, as you must in Gods stand or fall by the <hi>Test</hi> of
them, at the last <hi>Audit,</hi> and to appear a Protestant too by works above the
poor <hi>level</hi> of a dull <hi>opus operatum,</hi> by works that represent the continual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of your life with an Heroical vigour, and your <hi>going from strength to
strength</hi> (as the Scripture expression is) in the defence of Protestancy, by works
that speak you like the heavenly bodies incessant in your influence, and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rest only in <hi>Motion.</hi> 'Tis not without wisdom ordered by the <hi>Pope,</hi> That
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103047:66"/>
no men shall be <hi>Cannonised</hi> till after <hi>death</hi> for fear of <hi>Apostacy;</hi> nor then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
unless it shall appear that they <hi>wrought Miracles.</hi> And the truth is, our
people were all so far born with <hi>Popes</hi> in their bellies, as to this point, that
they will not now <hi>Cannonize</hi> any Great Men for <hi>Protestant Saints,</hi> unless at
this time they do <hi>Miracles;</hi> and indeed I think they have reason to insist on
their doing as great <hi>miracles</hi> for our Religion, as any Papal <hi>Saints</hi> dead or
alive have done <hi>against</hi> it. And when I consider the real Great Things that
have been by the heads and hands of your Lordship and other Noble Persons
performed for the <hi>Statuminating</hi> of the Protestant cause, and enabling us to
say to our underminers with the confidence of the Psalmist, <hi>As a bowing wall
shall ye be, and as a tottering fence,</hi> I do think you may expect with Justice
that which is greater then our praise, the acclamations of our <hi>blessing,</hi> as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
saith, <hi>that to heroick qualities in men not praise, but pronouncing blessed is
due</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>it is more blessed to
give then to receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, my Lord, going by this exact Rule of measuring things by
things, and not by words, your Life hath enabled me to give the strictest
<hi>Aeropagus</hi> of Censurers the world can produce, and who would damn the use
of Proems and the art of moving passions by words, an irrefragable instance
how you have secured the Nation formerly from being enslaved to and by
Popery, and at that time when we seemed to our selves as secure from it as
from <hi>Mahumetanisme,</hi> which was when you were the great Conductor of
the Publick Councels in the Conjuncture that brought in the King, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Lambert</hi>'s usurpation of the <hi>English</hi> Scepter, who tho at that time he was
not generally suspected to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> was on very rational grounds believed
to be such then by many very knowing particular persons; and that too to be
not only a <hi>Papist,</hi> but a <hi>Iesuited</hi> one. He was at that time suspected by some
for having advised at a military cabal of the then great ones that the Cavaleers
should be Massacred, a cruelty that could enter into no breast but one aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
to Jesuitisme. And as on such a <hi>Monster</hi> your Lordship then had your
eye on him: and of his being such some of the <hi>depositions</hi> and <hi>examinations</hi> took
about the late plot have been very particular and satisfactory. Nor is his have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
petition'd some few years before the discovery of the late Plot, That he
might have his Liberty, and of a very great Roman Catholic Lord's having
then offer'd to be security for his quiet demeanor, Now unknown, so that
the Kingdom then scaped falling into Popery before the danger was by it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended;
like the Man who in the <hi>Night</hi> scaped <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Rochester Bridge,</hi>
and whom the light of the following day almost confounded with his <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi>
Your Lordships activity and prudence appearing in the <hi>public</hi>
Councels and in your <hi>Secret</hi> correspondences, to the defeating of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of that <hi>Romish Achitophel,</hi> and seisure of his person, will no more be
forgiven you by the Papists of <hi>England,</hi> then it either by the Papists of
<hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> will be <hi>forgiven</hi> or <hi>forgot</hi> that you shew'd your self a
true Father of your Country in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Conduct foremention'd of
that great Affair of the Metropolis, and many Garrisons of that Kingdom
being wholly put into the hands of the Parliament, rather than the Child
(as I may say) should be divided between any of his Majesties Subjects, and
the Pope the pretended supream Father of that Country, and that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it to come into the hands of the true Supream One.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship and other well-wishers to the Crown then were not of
the humour of some of our young vulgar Protestants, who as the Papists
parrots, have been by them taught to speak it commonly, That they love a
<hi>Papist</hi> better than a <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> 'Tis sinful not to love the persons of both,
but ridiculous to love the Yoke of either opinion; and it seems his late
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103047:66"/>
Majesty of glorious Memory, and his Councel, and his noble Lieutenant of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and your Lordship thought it safer for the Crown, for <hi>Ireland</hi> to be
trusted with that sort of disobedient Children that depended on no forraign
Ecclesiastical Head, then on such as did. And it is to be acknowledged to
your Lordships care of the freedom of your Country, that when you sat in
the long Parliament till you and other Members thereof were torn thence
by <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Souldiers, you crusht the <hi>Iure-divinity</hi> of <hi>Presbytery</hi> in the Egg
by its being ordered to be setled only for three years, so that it saw it was to
be <hi>expeditated</hi> at the end of <hi>three years,</hi> and had no power to trample upon
the consciences of others, and in effect had but a <hi>tolleration.</hi> I think that no
Church-Government at all is better then that rigid one of Presbytery intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then by some Zealots. As the good and learned <hi>Dean of Canterbury</hi> said
in his <hi>Sermon on the Fifth of November</hi> before the House of Commons, That
as to Popery, <hi>'twere better there were no revealed Religion, and that humane
Nature were left to the conduct of its own principles and inclinations, then to
be acted by a religion that inspires men with so wild a fury, and prompts them to
commit such outrages, &amp;c.</hi> and there renders Popery worse then Infidelity or
no Religion, and so indeed <hi>in fact</hi> the Kingdom had then <hi>no Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
paramount at all in it, and instead of the imagined fierce <hi>pedagogy</hi> of the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery that made every <hi>Levite a Rabby Busy,</hi> every Pulpit
<hi>Rhetor</hi> a <hi>Consul,</hi> and every <hi>Lay-Elder Major General</hi> of the <hi>Parish,</hi> we had a
tame insignificant Government admitted only to probation for three years,
and were no more hindered of the freedom of a Gentlemans Conversation
thereby then by the Government of the foremention'd <hi>Presbyter Iohn</hi> in the
<hi>East,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> was then not only free from the charge of <hi>Peter-pence, Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
levys, oblations, contributions for the Holy Land,</hi> and both charge and trouble
from all the Papal <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Masses Anniversaries, obits, requiems, dirges, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebos,
Trentals, lamps,</hi> but from all <hi>contumacy fees</hi> in spiritual Courts, and from
those Courts themselves of which yet the yoke is very easie compared with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that of the Papists or <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyters; and our condition, as to ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
discipline, was like that time or <hi>conjuncture</hi> of liberty, that <hi>Father Paul</hi>
in the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> refers to, speaking of the time when a
certain custome prevailed, saith, <hi>il, che come e un uso molto proprio, diove si go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verna
in liberta, quale era all hora quando il mondo era senza Papa,</hi> That it was
a custome very proper where they governed with liberry, which was when the
world was without a Pope.</p>
            <p>I never heard of any man that was <hi>gored</hi> with the <hi>horn</hi> of our Presbyters
<hi>excommunication,</hi> nor of any dissenter from them, that was tyed up for them
out of their horn of plenty of Church power to force a <hi>drench</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi>
down his throat, and much less of any dealt with <hi>in</hi> that way mentioned by
<hi>Spotswood,</hi> in his Observation, that the <hi>Devil would not be feared but for his
horn, referring to the horning in</hi> Scotland, <hi>that is, the seisure of all a mans goods
when the horn blew, after he was excommunicated by the Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but that some of the Divines of that persuasion were
brib'd to it by an expectation of <hi>power</hi> to oppress, when that the great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Church were denied them; And thus the <hi>Pope</hi> keeps his Guards
in <hi>Rome</hi> only with the <hi>pay</hi> of <hi>priviledges,</hi> but instead of their riding the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Parliament rid them, and with that caution as they of old did who
rid on Elephants in battel, which great animal being observed to be then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruely
sometimes and to endanger both the riders and their camp, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known that their receiving a Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>usion in one part about their head,
would presently dispatch them, their riders had alwaies a hammer with them
ready for that use on occasion.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:103047:67"/>
He therefore that saith he loves <hi>popery</hi> better then the Government of
<hi>Presbytery</hi> as it was <hi>de facto</hi> setled or rather permitted in <hi>England,</hi> and when
<hi>they that would have its maypole for them to dance about had it, and those that
would have none, had none,</hi> saith that he loves a fiery and tormenting furious
Church-Government that would make <hi>Mount Sion</hi> to be still <hi>belching out fire
like Aetna</hi> better then none at all: that he loves a <hi>Hirricane</hi> better then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a while <hi>becalm'd:</hi> that he loves the Church government that was like <hi>colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida</hi>
in the pot, rather then that of the Presbyter, which was here but
like <hi>Herb Iohn,</hi> and that he fears a <hi>Mastiff</hi> who was not only <hi>hambled</hi> and
whose <hi>jus divinum</hi> was <hi>lawd,</hi> and whose <hi>spleen was cut out</hi> by the <hi>State Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons</hi>
more then an incensed hungry Lion of <hi>Rome:</hi> that he likes a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
better that at best is like a <hi>Peacock,</hi> that is all <hi>Gaudery and damned Noise</hi>
and nothing else except <hi>pede latro,</hi> that is, <hi>all</hi> Ceremony, and devouring <hi>all</hi>
with ceremony, then a Government that with its looks can neither allure nor
fright, and which we could pinion as we pleased, and play with till we could
get a better in its Room. Whether a Papist was to be loved better then a
Puritan was a <hi>vex'd question</hi> in the time of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> and 'twas resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
then in the affirmative only by the Pensioners of <hi>Rome</hi> and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>
            <p>The Learned Author of the Book called <hi>Certain considerations tending to
promote Peace and good will among Protestants,</hi> doth in p. 13. quote our famous
<hi>Gataker</hi> for relating that <hi>Dr. Elmor Lord Bishop of London</hi> in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths
time,</hi> when one in a <hi>Sermon</hi> at St. <hi>Pauls Cross</hi> inveighing against <hi>Puritans,</hi>
rendred them worse then <hi>Papists,</hi> sharply contradicted that censure, saying,
<hi>that the Preacher said not right therein, for that the Puritans if they had me
among them would only cut my rochet, but the Papists would cut my throat,</hi>
and that his Successor <hi>Dr. Vaughan Lord Bishop of London,</hi> when another in
the same Pulpit too shew'd the same eagerness in representing the <hi>Puritans</hi>
worse then <hi>Papists,</hi> expressed the same sense with his predecessor concerning
it, <hi>and wished that he had had the Preachers Tongue that day in his Pocket.</hi> It
was (it seems) then the good fortune of <hi>London,</hi> to be blest with Bishops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd
for their great zeal for the Protestant Religion, and with such a one it
is at this time enriched and dignified, I will not say <hi>Bishop</hi> of it only by
<hi>divine permission,</hi> but <hi>miseratione divinâ,</hi> the Style I have seen of Bishops in
some antient Instruments, 'tis out of the <hi>Divine Compassion</hi> that such an <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
Protestant <hi>City</hi> has such a <hi>Prelate.</hi> Nor do I intend by the just praise
paid to this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> man, to lessen the worth of others of the <hi>Fathers</hi>
of our <hi>Church,</hi> of which number I have the honour to be acquainted with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who endeavour the extermination of Popery, with as couragious a
zeal as can be wisht, and no doubt but the text of <hi>Scripture</hi> in the <hi>Title</hi> of my
<hi>Lord Bishop of Lincolns</hi> book, namely, <hi>Come out of her my People lest ye be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of her Sins and Plagues,</hi> is by the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> lookt on as
a seasonable <hi>alarm,</hi> and no doubt many of this our Church who have writ with
so much various learning and strong Reason against <hi>Popery,</hi> know that if that
ever be <hi>de facto</hi> and by law paramount, the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be <hi>ipso facto</hi>
crusht thereby out of all its visibility. The thought of this brings that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to my mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Matthew 21 <hi>v. 44. and who soever shall fall on this Stone,
shall be broken, but on whom soever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</hi> And
if the Church of <hi>England</hi> by only falling <hi>super hanc Petram,</hi> I mean heretofore
by the Empty <hi>Project</hi> of some for the Uniting <hi>Rome</hi> to us, was broken and
disjointed, therefore if ever it shall come <hi>under the Stone</hi> of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion, and it be thereby made possible for the Stone to <hi>fall on it,</hi> the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will then grind it to powder. Its former <hi>falling on the
Rock</hi> could only break it into the pieces of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:103047:67"/>
and other <hi>seperate</hi> Churches, but that <hi>Rocks falling on it</hi> will not <hi>break</hi> it into
<hi>pieces</hi> but grind it to <hi>powder</hi> as was said; and perhaps Papists then from this
place of Scripture would form as good a <hi>title</hi> by <hi>divine right</hi> to <hi>crush</hi> our
Church, as they did from the <hi>super hanc Petram</hi> in the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Matthew</hi> for
the <hi>building</hi> of theirs. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>And now putting the Question who are to be loved best, either the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<hi>Priest and Levite</hi> that help'd to <hi>wound Ireland</hi> formerly when <hi>it fell
among Thieves</hi> and Rebels, or those compassionate <hi>Samaritans</hi> who put it
on their own Beast and poured Oyl into its Wounds, and took care of it
till it was restored to its true Owner? I suppose a Protestant will say the latter,
and will account that no <hi>fire should be called to fall on the heads of such hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Samaritans,</hi> and that others should be spared, who instead of powring
Oyl into our <hi>Wounds,</hi> did it into our <hi>flames</hi> when they burnt our Citie.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship hath shewn your self a compassionate <hi>Samaritan</hi> to Two
Kingdoms to which your <hi>heali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g</hi> principles and practices have been bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
and in this you have out done him in the <hi>Parable</hi> who did <hi>not stay to
see the effects</hi> of the gentle Medicaments of <hi>Oyl and Wine</hi> he bestowed on
his Patient's Wounds, but your Lordships long <hi>attendance</hi> on the affairs of
the Public brought you to see the Languishing Kingdom revived, and to
have at once both its Head and Senses restored when Providence made our
<hi>Sovereign</hi> to be his <hi>repenting</hi> Peoples choice. But, <hi>my Lord,</hi> these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
have not yet done with your Skill, and may have Wounds that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
your Wine and Oyl, the <hi>Lyons Heart,</hi> and <hi>Ladies Hand;</hi> I mean such
<hi>Tenderness</hi> and such <hi>Courage,</hi> and so great Judgment as you have formerly
shewn, A Raging Acute Disease that hath been long not only besieging but
storming a mans vital parts, and with extream difficulty at the long run
repell'd by Nature, doth yet commonly leave such <hi>dregs</hi> in his spirits that
<hi>depress</hi> and enfeeble them in the remainder of Life, and a man come to
himself after a long madness, labours still under a dejection of his spirits
both by grief and shame, thinking of the arrear that he is in to God, the
World, and himself, by his former madness: and this is <hi>the present state of
England</hi> after its former <hi>state of distraction;</hi> and men with shame now look
on their former <hi>Physitians,</hi> and some are apt with that Merry Mad-man in
the Poet, to be angry with those that took pains about their being cured.
'Tis true indeed, the Kings Restoration cured us of our Civil Wars, yet
may a man be cured of his Wounds, and afterward dye of the Feaver his
Wound put him into; and our condition is such, that 'tis some degree of
Heavens Mercy to us, that our Feaver is continuing, for no man can dye
in a Feaver, as no man can dye without one: And our spirits are so sunk
under the weight of the Disease we have long languisht under, that our
Stomach cannot endure any Cordials, or especially the same long: &amp; certainly
that strong Physic that would at first have cured us, would now kill us.
Yet now in this conjuncture several of our Political Physitians seem by
their retirement to have given us over, as if they were of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his
mind, who said, that <hi>a Physitian should not discredit his generous Medicaments
by employing them on a desperate Patient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks 'tis pity that any of our Pilots should quit the Helm in a Storm, and
that they should not (as <hi>Cicero</hi>'s expression is) <hi>Sententiam tanquam aliquod navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium
ex Reip. tempestate moderari.</hi> Those words in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. A man of <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
shall attain to wise Councels;</hi> some read, <hi>Vir saepiens gubernacula possidebit;</hi>
I presume not to Censure any man, but I hope that no cross Winds will ever
make your Lordship leave the Helm, but rather invite the continuance of
your Skill in <hi>beating</hi> and <hi>tiding it out</hi> (as the Sea phrase is) and in not <hi>overshoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Port.</hi> Your <hi>pacific</hi> Genius and great Wisdom have in several angry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103047:68"/>
produced an unexpected calm by your offering unexpected <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients,</hi>
a <hi>Talent</hi> that is indeed very <hi>rare</hi> and conducive to the quiet of the
World, as leading Potent Parties from their declared Opinions without the
shame of a seeming retreat.</p>
            <p>It happens still in Navigation, that what makes the Passenger merriest,
makes the <hi>Steers-man</hi> most thoughtful, Namely the sight of Land: And
therefore tho I and others who <hi>make no figures</hi> in the government of the
Kingdom seem to be glad at our <hi>sight</hi> of <hi>land,</hi> that is the extermination of
Popery from <hi>England</hi> after we have been so long <hi>nauseated</hi> and Sea-sick with
it, yet 'tis now our occasion for the skill of such a Pilot, as your Lordship is
greatest when we are endanger'd by some Protestants of narrow Spirits and
Principles as by Shelfes or <hi>brevia &amp; syrtes,</hi> shallow waters, and by little Rocks
or <hi>breaker's</hi> just covered with water and which are only to be discovered by
the swelling roughness of the water they occasion. It has pleased Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to cast your Lordships whole life of Action into <hi>difficult times</hi> such
as are called in the New Testament <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and translated <hi>perilous
times,</hi> And such as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls <hi>Maxima Reipublicae tempora,</hi> and <hi>difficillima
Reip tempora.</hi> Your life hath been a continual contestation with principles
pernicious to man-kind, and you have been under your Prince a <hi>Nutritius
pater</hi> for the most part to men who have like froward and unquiet
Children been <hi>crying</hi> for each others <hi>properly</hi> in things civil, and in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and have thought themselves <hi>persecuted</hi> when they could not <hi>persecute</hi>
others; Nor have you been <hi>too much</hi> a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> as to Church discipline,
Nor of too <hi>narrow</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi> or principles as to any Protestant <hi>Dissenters.</hi> And
I think Envy never charged you for giving any advice that tended to the
injuring the <hi>ballance</hi> of Christendom, or the power of <hi>England</hi> in setling it,
or the persuading us to love some of our Neighbours better then our selves.
You who are so far from <hi>offending any weak brother,</hi> That you are ready with
the Apostle rather to <hi>abstain from eating flesh while the World stands,</hi> and
therefore will much less kill or devour him, and lest of all will you offend a
<hi>weak Brother-Protestant Country</hi> or help any else to devour it: and will not
injure any of those Countreys that you visited abroad (when the world and
you saw one another) by projecting their Mischief. And therefore as I find
in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> of <hi>Grotius de jure belli &amp; pacis</hi> that <hi>Themistius,</hi> speaking to
<hi>Valens the Roman Emperor</hi> he told him that <hi>Kings if they would be guided by
the Rule of true wisdom they must non unius sibi creditae Gentis habere rationem,
sed totius humani generis, &amp; esse non <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> tantum aut <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> sed</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so it may be justly said that the <hi>Counsellors</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<hi>advise</hi> them, not to take care only of the concern of their own people
but of the happiness and quiet of all man-kind, and not only to be <hi>lovers of
the Macedonians,</hi> or <hi>lovers of the Romans, but to be lovers of Men.</hi> I never
heard your Lordship reproacht for having any interest contrary to that of
your Country or indeed to the repose of Christendom. And as in Nature we
see all heavy bodies tend by their <hi>own</hi> Center to the Center of the <hi>Universe,</hi> so
have I still thought that your Lordship alwaies endeavoured by the pursuing
your own good to pursue that of the Kingdom, and that your endeavours of
promoting the good of your own Country have tended to the good of the
World: And that in every Scheme of your Politicks whether Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
pollicy you have took your <hi>Model</hi> from the <hi>Great Architect</hi> of
<hi>Nature</hi> doing things <hi>fortiter</hi> and <hi>suaviter</hi> and with regard to his works of
which 'tis said in the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Wisdom, Mightily and Sweetly doth she order all
things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he that builds so, is a <hi>Workman that need not be ashamed</hi> either of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
or of his work, that is both strong and fair: such a <hi>Councellor</hi> need
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103047:68"/>
not be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hamed of his <hi>Councel.</hi> 'Tis one of the worst sort of Reproaches to
which a Councellor at Law can be exposed, to be called a <hi>crafty Counsel,</hi> that
is, one who secretly gives advice for the perverting of Justice and the law;
and to do that vile thing is more odious in a <hi>Counsellor</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> And of
this subject when I formerly discoursed to your Lordship, I remember you
were pleased to say it of your self to me, That you had a great aversion from
giving <hi>whispering</hi> Councel, to your Royal Master, and that it hath been your
humble motion to him, to command his Councel to give him their advice in
writing.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship is by one particular accident a necessary subject for the
Worlds compassion, namely by your having out-lived most of the eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the many memorable things you have done for the World. If the
people of <hi>England</hi> your Contemporaries were <hi>six Millions</hi> at the time of your
birth, <hi>five</hi> of those <hi>Millions</hi> are now lodged in graves, persons above the Age
of <hi>Sixty</hi> making but a <hi>sixth part</hi> of Mankind. I reading lately in <hi>Tully de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectute,</hi>
was pleased with what he saith of old men both <hi>de facto &amp; de jure</hi>
praising themselves: he saith there, <hi>videtisne ut apud Homerum saepissimè
Nestor de virtutibns suis praedicet? Tertiam enim jam aetatem hominum vixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat:</hi>
he had lived almost 300 years when he went with the other <hi>Grecians</hi>
to the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and where he gave such weighty advice, that <hi>Agamemnon</hi>
said he should make quick work of the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> if he had ten such <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi>
as <hi>Nestor</hi> was; <hi>Quod si acciderit non dubitat quin brevi Troja sit peritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
He never wish'd, saith <hi>Tully,</hi> to have <hi>ten Ajaxes.</hi> It seems the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
thought that an old Commander would be weighed down with a <hi>tenth
part</hi> of an old wise <hi>Councellor.</hi> But <hi>Nestor</hi> had bury'd all those <hi>thrice</hi> over
who were born with him, and he lived to see his Country-men <hi>doubled</hi> once
and a half (200 years being the space judged for a Nations doubling) and if he
would have his Atchievments in his <hi>first Century</hi> Celebrated and witnessed, he
must be his own Herald and witness in his own cause. I will not apply <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
case to your Lordships, as to your doing right to your self by praise, for
you have no more occasion to do that then <hi>Tully</hi> had who saith there, <hi>Nihil
necesse est mihi de meipso dicere, quanquam est id quidem senile aetatique nostrae
Conceditur:</hi> But do think that any Protestant Prince who can say he hath
ten such Councellors, and resembling your Lordship in the experience of
near <hi>fifty</hi> years spent in the affairs of <hi>State</hi> in <hi>critical</hi> times, and with success,
and equal to you in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orts of Learning, and in the knowledge of the <hi>Law</hi>
and publick <hi>Records,</hi> and in Eloquence and Courage, as well as in the hatred
of Popery, he may add, <hi>Quòd non dubitat quin brevi Roma sit peritura.</hi> i. e.
without such dilatory <hi>Troy Sieges</hi> as have been formerly laid to it. He saith
elsewhere, <hi>Apex senectutis est autoritas. Quanta fuit in L. Caecilio Metelio!
quanta in Attilio Calatino, in quem illud elogium unicum, Vno ore plurimae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiunt
Gentes, populi primarium fuisse virum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Authority</hi> or Reverence of old age is so weighty, that it seems
reasonable that in the criminating one that hath this badge of Nature there
should be what <hi>Tully</hi> calls <hi>authoritas testimonii,</hi> and any <hi>single</hi> witness had need
to have an allowance <hi>se primarium fuisse virum</hi> that would convict such a
man; for diamonds are not to be cut but with the dust of diamonds. 'Tis
not for nothing that the <hi>Scripture</hi> cautions the <hi>not receiving an accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an Elder but by two or three witnesses,</hi> and I am told that the <hi>Canon-Law</hi>
requires seventy two Witnesses to convict a Cardinal who is a Bishop ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of any crime but heresie, and forty four in the conviction of a Cardinal
Presbyter, and twenty six to convict a Cardinal Deacon, and seven to convict
any Clerk. And therefore I think that it was a commendable tenderness and
worthy of English Judges in a Trial at the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> to acquaint the Jury,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103047:69"/>
that they are to weigh and consider the credibility of witnesses pardon'd for
perjury; and both the Judges of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> resolved
it, That the credit of such a person was left to the breast of a Jury. <hi>The Bishop of
Rome</hi> who claims that <hi>Monarchiall</hi> power which is <hi>potestas restituendi in inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum
Sententiam passos, &amp; quandoque absolvendi paenam &amp; non infamiam quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
&amp; poenam &amp; infaniam abolendi,</hi> and who as <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith (2. 2<hi>ae</hi> q. 68. ar 4.)
<hi>potest infamiam Ecclesiasticam remittere,</hi> yet allows the <hi>School-men</hi> to apply
<hi>distinctions</hi> to that priviledge of his, and to interpret it of <hi>infamia Iuris,</hi> not
<hi>Facti,</hi> for <hi>labem illam quae turpi facto annexa est, nemo delere potest,</hi> as <hi>Soto</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>De Iustit. &amp; Iure l. 5. q. 5. ar.</hi> 4. No man who ever he be can wash out
that stain of infamy which by Nature is inherent in a foul wicked Act, because
(saith he) <hi>ad praeteritum non est potentia,</hi> when the infamy is inherent by the
<hi>Nature</hi> of the fact and not <hi>positive</hi> by Law. But still our merciful Laws of
<hi>England</hi> allow a person after a pardon for the infamy of perjury, to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
reserving his credibility to the Jury, and who may after the former crime
obtain to be belived by them, when they shall have found that he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
an habit of virtue by the <hi>series</hi> of many actions in his following Life,
no man being supposed able in a <hi>desultory</hi> way to leap out of a rooted habit of
Vice into an heroical habit of Vertue, and so <hi>è contra;</hi> for that <hi>nature</hi> doth
not pass from one extreme to another, but <hi>per medium.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, in
case of Treason where the life of both the King and Kingdom is struck at, and
of which there is rarely any detection made but by participants in the Crime,
one who would be repell'd from being a Witness, is welcome as an accuser, and
the barking of a dog is allowed to alarm us of thiefs; and as we say against
Pirates, <hi>omnis homo miles est,</hi> much more may every man be an accuser against
Traitors. Thus I have heard that in the case of <hi>heresie</hi> in the which (as I said
before) the <hi>Canon Law</hi> orders the same proceedings and rules as in Treason,
a Lay-man is allowed to be a competent accuser of a Clergy man: And as by
all Laws any man is allow'd to be an accuser who prosecutes an injury done to
himself or his Kindred, so I am told, that by the Canonists <hi>Haereticum accusans
dicitur suam suorumque injuriam prosequi</hi> (and in that case a notorious enemy
is allowed to be an accuser) for that a <hi>heretick</hi> is said to strike at the Foundation
of all Lawes divine and humane. Nay according to the <hi>Canonists,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>
who cannot be accused of any <hi>crime</hi> but <hi>heresie,</hi> may be accused of <hi>that,</hi> and
even by a <hi>heretick,</hi> and that with good reason according to their <hi>hypothesis;</hi>
for that the Pope being a Bankrupt in the Faith by <hi>heresie,</hi> attempts to <hi>break</hi>
all the innumerable <hi>Priests, Monks, Friers, Nunnes,</hi> &amp;c. that get their
bread by that Religion. No wonder therefore that the <hi>Canonists</hi> agree that
<hi>heresie</hi> is to be <hi>cut off</hi> in the beginning; and they cite out of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that <hi>it
doth eat as a Cancer,</hi> and the <hi>eating of heresie</hi> even in the <hi>breast</hi> of a <hi>Pope</hi>
must needs be troublesom to the whole body of Clerical and Monastical Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as a <hi>Cancer</hi> or <hi>Wolfe</hi> that would eat up all their bread, and therefore
in the single case of <hi>heresie</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> himself according to his own law may
be convicted by two Witnesses, and be thereupon deposed. But tho it may
be supposed that as the Civil and Canon Laws do leave the credibility of
witnesses very much to the Judges, so our common Law does to Juries, and
that in many actrocious Criminal causes, every man is not allowed to be an
accuser of an illustrious person, and that we ought to be very tender and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the <hi>taking up an ill report against</hi> the meanest of any of our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi>
of mankind; yet its otherwise as I said before in the case of Treason,
which is like a <hi>pestilence walking in the dark,</hi> and seldom known before tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
and before 'tis ploughing up the whole Land of a Country into
graves. We are not to quarrel with the <hi>birds of the Air</hi> who tell who in
his Bed-Chamber curses the King, because they are not Eagles. We are to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103047:69"/>
be glad of the happy Augury, and to thank God and them for their saving the
<hi>Imperial</hi> Eagle; and to be well pleased with either Tame or Wild-geese that
save our <hi>Capital.</hi> If any Fleet comes to invade us, we are not to be very
nice in diffecting the Morals or outward estate of him who fired the <hi>Beacon.</hi>
Your Lordship hath heard how <hi>Owen o Conally</hi> an <hi>obscure person</hi> (as Sir. <hi>Iohn
Temple</hi> styles him in his <hi>History of the Irish Rebellion</hi>) came to the <hi>Lord Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
Parsons about nine of the Clock at Night before the intended seising of</hi> Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin
<hi>Castle, that was to be on the following day and discovered the detestable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
to him, with the names of the chief Conspirators, when the disguise of wine
had made him seem hardly intelligible or credible.</hi> And when it falls out that
a Country is faved by <hi>wholesale</hi> through a detection of Conspiracies presented
by persons who cheated their Country-men formerly by <hi>retail,</hi> that is, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who had been vile and infamous, it ought to be accounted as an instance of
the divine benignity to some of the most wretched and sinful Members of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who have been long industrious in tearing out of their hearts what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
they could there find of the divine image, and who had long acted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Devils</hi> parts on the <hi>Stage</hi> of the world in punishing and being punished,
then to invite them to an opportunity of changing the Name of <hi>Malefactors</hi>
into that of being <hi>blessings</hi> to the World, and not only of being their Countries
<hi>benefactors</hi> but (as it were) <hi>founders,</hi> and to gain good Consciences, and good
names, and what rarely happens to others to have an <hi>after-game</hi> allowed
them to play for <hi>Reputation,</hi> and to have it said of such an one on the occasion
of the shame of his past life stimulating him to bring both glory and safety to
his Country, <hi>si non errasset fecerat ille minus.</hi> By the account that I had sent
to me from <hi>London</hi> of Matters in some <hi>affidavits</hi> relating to your being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Papist, your Lordship hath the greatest advantage that any man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
who has any things sworn against him, by persons how credible soever,
namely the incredibility of the things themselves. For can it be thought
that your Lordship would out of your own Mouth judge your self a Traitor,
that is, one reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and forfeit your Life and
Estate, and attaint your blood in the presence of a young man you had never
seen before? and is it likely that the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, who, as Sir <hi>Iohn Temple</hi>
observes in <hi>his</hi> said <hi>history, have such a kind of dull and deep reservedness, as
makes them with much silence and secresie to carry on their business, and whereby
the design of the last Rebellion which was so generally at the same time and at so
many several places to be acted (and therefore necessarily known to so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
persons) was without any Noise brought to such maturity, as to arrive at the
very point of Execution, without any notice or intimation given to any two of
that huge Multitude of persons who were generally designed (as most of them did)
to perish in it; And the</hi> Irish <hi>Papists having been then (as he saith) tongue-tyed
by an oath of Secresie,</hi> I say is it likely that they now designing Mischief if
they did hope by your Lordships help to promote it, that they would <hi>trumpet</hi>
forth your Lordships name in their publick <hi>Masses,</hi> and use such speaking
trumpets about your name and their enterprise as should be heard all over
<hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England?</hi> And who can believe it to have the shadow of Veri-similitude
that your Lordship should give Commission to any to offer one of
the Kings witnesses (and particularly Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>) your house as an <hi>Asylum</hi> to
retreat to after they had for the <hi>turpitude</hi> of <hi>lucre</hi> retreated from their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
their Consciences, their Oathes? I never see any man <hi>sworn</hi> as a Witness
in a cause, but I think of the saying of <hi>St. Austin</hi> upon those words of St. <hi>Iames,
Above all things my Brethren swear not,</hi> Namely <hi>Falsa Iuratio exitiosa est, vera
Iuratio periculosa est, Nulla Iuratio secura est;</hi> and I have as it were a little
cold shivering on me, while I see a man about what he knoweth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of a <hi>tenement</hi> staking his title to a Heaven and a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Glory;</hi> I have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103047:70"/>
then such a concern for another, as I have when I see a great Ship just
launching off the Land into the water, and do then apprehend an immortal
Soul launching it self into the great Ocean of Eternity, and am afraid of its
being overset. But when I think of a mans having honestly sworn already
and in the greatest concern, namely in the detection of a Conspiracy against
his Kings Crown and Life, and consequently having invoked the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
God to be conditionally his Revenger, his Executioner as well as Judge,
and further think of any one that shall tamper with such a witness and offer
him a great Sum of money as his <hi>viatical expences</hi> to <hi>hell</hi> to swear contrary
to his former oath, and by that New Oath to renounce his expectation of a
Crown of Glory in Heaven, and to endanger his Princes Crown and Life on
Earth, and to attempt a Mortal wound on <hi>Gods Vice-Roy</hi> in the dominions of
his Soul, I mean his Conscience, I have both all possible horror overwhelming
my thoughts on such a <hi>tremendous</hi> instance of the degeneration of Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and I have all the <hi>compassion</hi> imaginable for your Lordship on one of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindes
pretending to think it possible that your house should with your
consent be turned into a <hi>denn</hi> for such a <hi>Monster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Areopagite</hi> was discharged from the Seat of Judicature, because he
threw away from him a small bird that fled to him from the pursuit of a great
one; and it was therefore supposed that such a judge alwaies carried cruelty
in his breast for that <hi>charissimum Deo animal</hi> call'd <hi>Man:</hi> and such is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
tenderness of your Lordships mind toward injured and persecuted
Mankind, that one of those may be allowed to Nest within your house as
freely as a poor bird without it, But birds of Prey, I mean <hi>Romes</hi> Vultures,
and either suborners or witnesses suborned to recant, have no plea for your
Shelter; and I am confident rather then your house should be a cage for any
such <hi>unclean birds,</hi> you would be content as the <hi>expressions</hi> of the <hi>Prophet</hi> are,
<hi>that the Satyr should there cry to his fellow, and that the Schrich Owle should rest
there, and that the wild Breasts of the Desert should also meet there.</hi> Your
Lordship sees what a <hi>preferment</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> designed you: for that after (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to some of the <hi>Narratives</hi> of the Plot) Sir <hi>W. G.</hi> was designed <hi>Lord
Privy-Seal,</hi> you were to be a <hi>providore</hi> for a suborned <hi>cast</hi> witness, and a <hi>Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
or provider for the <hi>roaring Lion that walks about seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:</hi>
In fine, <hi>my Lord,</hi> they designed your Lordship to be an entertainer
or an <hi>Host</hi> for the <hi>Devil.</hi> But your Lordships name being taken in vain by
those who would have retained Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to take Gods so, and the Devils
tempting any to undertake for your house being a Sanctuary to a devil, are
not new things for wonder, when you please to consider that the <hi>Devil</hi>
presumed to <hi>undertake</hi> for Almighty <hi>Gods</hi> protection, when he tempted the
<hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It seems the shewing to <hi>Dugdale</hi> the <hi>several Kingdoms of the
Earth</hi> where he should be safe, could not prevail with him to be a fugitive
from his Conscience; and tho it appeared in several <hi>Trials,</hi> and particularly
my Lord <hi>Staffords, the temper desired to have him,</hi> and that he <hi>was sifted,
winnowed as wheat,</hi> Yet neither his <hi>Faith</hi> nor the <hi>faith</hi> of his Testimony <hi>fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him,</hi> after all the <hi>cribration thereof,</hi> and all that was gained by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
suborning him against himself, as well as others against him, was only
the <hi>fate</hi> of the <hi>Thrush,</hi> who is sometime birdlimed and took by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
            <p>Is it not then an example of rare modesty, that the diabolical <hi>tempters</hi>
should be the <hi>accusers</hi> of <hi>the Brethren,</hi> I mean of some of the <hi>Kings witnesses</hi>
that would not be Bribed from attesting the truth in the case of their Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Father? The Age wants not the instance of an honorable Person, who
courting a Lady in order to marriage, thought her at last not worthy his
farther amours, yet who because he did once profess to love her, he fought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103047:70"/>
one who reproach'd her vertue: But his example is not more herocial than
is the practice infamous, for such who courted some of the Kings Witnesses
both by importunity and gold to espouse their interest, and when both were
totally and finally rejected, make it the the most study'd part of the <hi>Romance</hi> of
their Lives to dishonour them, and to <hi>shamme</hi> inventions of New Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comic
<hi>Plotts</hi> upon them, but Plots so damn'd <hi>dull,</hi> as to be seen through in
the opening of the first <hi>Act,</hi> and <hi>Plots</hi> that were most <hi>thin</hi> where the Actors
cryed to themselves like <hi>Bayes</hi> in the <hi>Rehersal, Now the Plot thickens,</hi> and
where nothing of the <hi>three Vnities</hi> was regarded, and which no marvel if
they brought such confusion still to the <hi>Actors,</hi> as the Story makes to have
once happen'd to the old <hi>Red-Bull Players</hi> at the <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Doctor Faustus,</hi>
when they complained that <hi>they had one Devil more than their Company,</hi> and

Dr. <hi>Morton Bishop of Durham writing of the progress of the Popes power, and
entitling their Books, one of them, The Mystery of Iniquity, the other, The
Grand Imposture, were both in the Right; for I believe there was never such
another Cheat in the World</hi>] the Mercury of that cheat being <hi>sublimated</hi> into
the invented <hi>cheat</hi> of that Plot, was too nauseous and strong for the belief
of the Kingdom to be able to swallow. We may therefore be very well allow'd
to put the old great <hi>interrogtory</hi> of <hi>Cicero</hi> to these <hi>Catilines, How long do

we have had the just advantage of Plaintiffs against them and whereby their

in their own defence, and at worst but <hi>Catilines</hi> accusing of <hi>Cethegus,</hi> and

            <p>But from the said last Cited proposition of <hi>Guymenius,</hi> the proposition that

there is a <hi>par</hi> or <hi>proportion</hi> between a good name and life, that such who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it lawful for a particular Clergy-man to Murder even a Popish Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

            <p>And it seems as men try experiments on Creatures they account vile, they
experimented both these propositions on <hi>Godfrey,</hi> for after they had basely kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

trade of butchering and shamming, and then in effect Stabbing their own
Shamms of Plots, I shall Entertain your Lordship with one egregious <hi>instance</hi> of
a Priest of theirs being abandon'd to a <hi>reprobate</hi> or <hi>injudicious sence</hi> of <hi>shamming,</hi>
in making by a ridiculous Lye a famous Cardinal and profound States-man
perhaps as the World has bred, and one of singular Piety and great modesty,
to render the <hi>Gun-Powder-Treason</hi> a <hi>Sham Plot,</hi> and thereby wounding the
Fame of both the understanding and morals of their great dead Church
Hero, as barbarously as they did the Corps of <hi>Godfry.</hi> And this instance I
refer to, is in a Book called <hi>The Advocate of Conscience liberty, or an Apology for
Toleration rightly stated,</hi> and writ with Learning and Wit, and Artifice enough
<hi>ad faciendum populum</hi> by a <hi>Priest</hi> of <hi>Romes</hi> Church an <hi>English man,</hi> and printed
in the year 1673. In <hi>pag.</hi> 325. He represents the <hi>Gunpowder-Treason</hi> to be a
<hi>Sham Plot</hi> contrived by <hi>Cecil,</hi> and to prove this, Cites <hi>D'Ossats Letters,
Book 2d. Letter</hi> 43. And the date of that Letter was from <hi>Rome, March</hi> the
29. 1596. And the date of the last Letter there is from <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>December</hi>
that year. The <hi>Gunpowder-Treason</hi> Plot was to have been on the 5<hi>th of
November</hi> 1605. And on <hi>D'Ossats</hi> marble <hi>Tomb</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> his Epitaph men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that he dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1604. so then he is made by that <hi>Author</hi> to have
known that Treason to have been a <hi>Sham-Plot</hi> Eight years before it was to be
executed, and to have permitted many Papists for want of his sending a line
of News of the Shamm, to be shamm'd out of their lives, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
to be <hi>shammed</hi> and <hi>anniversaried</hi> out of its credit in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they reproach any as they did <hi>Cecil</hi> on the pretence of the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some of their wild principles into the <hi>decoy</hi> of a plot, a thing I think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
as what implies a tempting or inviting of a Man to degenerate from
himself, they have no reason to be angry with but only to pitty men that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
infection from their principles, and from this particular one, That 'tis
lawful for a good end to ensnare men into acts of Sin. Many <hi>Casuists</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
are brought by <hi>Guymenius</hi> for this purpose, <hi>p. 184. in the</hi> 9th <hi>proposition

that may be lawfully used is assigned, it being there said, that <hi>non peccat mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
occidens propria authoritate uxorem in adulterio deprehensam:</hi> the which he
saith <hi>Sa</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> represents as a <hi>probable opinion,</hi> And which <hi>Hurtado</hi> he saith
positively defends, <hi>Tom. 1. resol. moral. tr. ulti. res.</hi> 5. §. 7. <hi>n.</hi> 204. so that if a
Protestant States-man had inveigled them into a plot and then hang'd them
for it, his <hi>politicks</hi> had squared exactly with their <hi>Morals.</hi> And even as the
calling of a Rat-catcher is a lawful calling, tho some of that profession have
had no certain way to take Rats but by the use of one experiment, namely,
first, to provoke them to fly in the Artists face; according to the said
principles is the calling of a States-man both lawful and laudable who deals so
with such as he judgeth to nibble at Treason. But this by the way. And
now to let your Lordship see how some of their Divinity is particularly but a
laboured Sham in the case of <hi>Treason,</hi> and even but a <hi>mocking</hi> at Sin, I shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
you with a known Author among them making men play with the <hi>bait</hi>
of Regicide, as he is <hi>hooking</hi> them into it: And 'tis <hi>Mariana the Iesuit,</hi> as I
find him Cited by <hi>Dr. Donne</hi> in his forementioned <hi>book p.</hi> 135. He quotes
there <hi>Mariana de Rege l. 1. c. 7. for cautioning against a King being a self-homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
by drinking poyson prepared and ministred by another he being ignorant; for
after he concluded how an heretical King may be poisoned he is diligent in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[That a King be not constrained to take the poison himself, but that some other
may administer it to him, and that therefore it be prepared and conveyed in some
other way than meat and drink; because else, saith he, either willingly or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
he shall kill himself] so that he provides that the King who must dye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sins of Tyranny and heresie; must yet be defended from concurring to his
own death; tho ignorantly, as tho this were a greater Sin.</p>
            <p>Is not this pleasant to see any of them catching of Kings in a <hi>Theological
Mousetrap,</hi> and playing with them like Mice before they devour them? to
see them sweeten a Cup of poyson for a King with their damn'd Church
Sophistry, and to sham men as licorish Flies to be Swallowed up in the
Cup? I wish that some of the most considerable of the Grandees of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could Answer this accusation of their <hi>shamming,</hi> otherwise than
by committing it <hi>de novo:</hi> for if they say that some of their Doctors write
against this and other crimes as well as some for them, as particularly some
write against the use of equivocation; And as <hi>Father Parsons</hi> the Jesuite
writing against King <hi>Iames</hi>'s succession, another English Jesuite namely <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
writ for it, and so that when some of their Doctors break the Churches
head, others presently gave it Plaisters, is not this a fearful, shall I say, or
Contemptible <hi>sham?</hi> Do we not know that the discipline of their Church is
as exact as any <hi>Military</hi> discipline can be, by which alone it hath preserved it
self so long in being, and that none among them can publish books without
passing several Courts of Guards of <hi>Superiors,</hi> nor contradict one another in
rules of practice, more than Trumpeters of an Army dare sound a charge or
a retreat but when commanded to it? And what a face of something like
<hi>sham</hi> the present <hi>Popes declaration</hi> about some opinions of the <hi>Casuists</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with it, I have already mentioned; and doth not every one know their
avowed doctrine <hi>de opinione probabili,</hi> Namely, that tho an opinion be false, a
man may with a safe conscience follow it by reason of the Authority of the
teacher, and that a <hi>Confessor</hi> is bound to absolve the <hi>penitent</hi> when there is but
one opinion for his being absolved, tho, he believes that opinion not only <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable</hi>

In Sum, according to the old observation of Poperies prevailing, by have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in it which may fit the temper and humor of every individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and to be like <hi>Manna</hi> answering every mans tast, whether he hath a <hi>gusto</hi>
for miracles, or even for starving or abstinence, for business, or retirement
for Life or for death, for Honor or for begging, it may to these be added, that
if any one affects to be a <hi>Ruffian</hi> or one of the Popes <hi>Sheriffs</hi> as aforesaid, there
is a most ample field in the killing of Kings, firing of Towns, Massacring their
Inhabitants for the <hi>talent</hi> of such a <hi>Pavure diable,</hi> and indeed <hi>incarnate</hi> one to
expatiate in, and if any account it a <hi>luscious</hi> thing to be cheated or to be sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as some few, or to cheat or sham as many think it, behold a Religion made
for the <hi>nonce</hi> in that point too. But while they are thus playing with all
things Sacred and profane, <hi>he that sits in the heavens has them in derision</hi> and
leaves not the Protestants to fall finally as <hi>a portion to Foxes,</hi> such who turned
tail to tail carry firebrands between them, and their <hi>shammes</hi> do <hi>only enter</hi> on
the <hi>Stage</hi> of the World to be instantly <hi>hissed off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I have not been <hi>rash</hi> in Censuring either the principles or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of some Roman Catholicks as aforesaid. And particularly I well know,
that even the most ingenious of our <hi>English</hi> Papists cannot now in this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture</hi>
endure to hear of <hi>Father Parsons</hi> his <hi>book writ by him to Invalidate the
Right of King Iames to succeed Queen Elizabeth, principally because he was</hi> (as
Father Parsons thought) <hi>an heretick.</hi> A very <hi>great Man</hi> that <hi>Iesuite</hi> was, and
so <hi>Considerable,</hi> that one of our eminent <hi>Divines</hi> in his Sermon in print, gives
him this <hi>Character; That he was perhaps one of the greatest men that the order
of the Iesuits has produced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And methinks 'twas pitty he should play at such <hi>small game</hi> of <hi>sham,</hi> when
he publisht that book, as to entitle it to <hi>Doleman,</hi> an <hi>honest secular Priest</hi> whom
<hi>Parsons</hi> hated, and to make him <hi>odious,</hi> laid the <hi>brat</hi> at his door.</p>
            <p>Moreover, a kind of inglorious sham it was, that <hi>Creswel,</hi> who was <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
his <hi>fellow Iesuite,</hi> writ (as I said) at the same time for <hi>King Iames</hi> his
Right to the <hi>Crown,</hi> not out of any desire he should enjoy that Right, but that
on all events they might have something to say in <hi>apology</hi> for their <hi>Society,</hi>
and bring Grist to its mill. For if King <hi>Iames</hi> had not come to the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> the honour of hindring his Succession had been attributed to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>
and <hi>Creswel</hi> the Jesuit expected the Credit for his writing on the Event
falling as it did. <hi>Thus</hi> I remember to have heard a Passage of two <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
who on the day before the former great <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> was to throw
the die of War, agreed together to predict luck to him perfectly contrary to
one another, that so they might save the credit of their <hi>art,</hi> by one of the
<hi>artists</hi> being in the Right.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the book called the <hi>Catholick Apology, with a Reply &amp;c.</hi> (and
which book I think the <hi>Author of the Compendium</hi> mentions as one of the <hi>books
writ by the Roman Catholicks of England since the Kings Restoration</hi>) saith <hi>p.</hi>
366. speaking of <hi>Dolemans book, For Dolemans book who wrote it God knows,
Parsons deny'd it at his death, and I believe he was not the author, because in
several of his works he speaks very much to the advantage of King Iames.</hi> But
as to <hi>Father Parsons</hi> having in that <hi>Conjuncture</hi> been of the <hi>Spanish faction,</hi> and
having apply'd his whole soul and strength to hinder King <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Succession,</hi>
and his having writ that book the <hi>Great</hi> foremention'd <hi>Cardinal,</hi> namely
<hi>D'Ossat,</hi> (who in several of his Printed <hi>Letters</hi> gives the World a more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
and particular Scheme of the whole design to hinder that Kings Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than I know any or all else to have done)
saith among his letters (printed in <hi>folio</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> 1664.) in that in <hi>book 7th
Anno</hi> 1601. a <hi>letter</hi> to the <hi>King, letter</hi> 131. what may be thus render'd in
English, <hi>viz. It may please your Majesty to remember, that since the year</hi> 1594.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103047:72"/>
               <hi>there was a book printed in the English language that the Spaniards caus'd to be
made by an English Iesuite call'd Parsons, and 'twas by the way of the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
dispersed about England &amp;c.</hi> And further in the 7<hi>th book p. 301. in the
letter to Villeroy, letter</hi> 133. what he saith of that book of <hi>Parsons,</hi> may be
thus made <hi>English, and from that book of Father Parsons one might draw rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in favour of his Majesty, which would be more weighty then those he deduceth
for the King of</hi> Spain <hi>and his Sister, the said Father Parsons does contradict
himself very often and very grosly, as it happens to all persons in passion as able as
they are, who are not guided by truth and by reason, but transported by Interest
and by passion.</hi> And in the last <hi>letter</hi> of the 8th <hi>book,</hi> and <hi>to Villeroy from
Rome</hi> the 30th of <hi>December 1602, he speaks of Father Parsons having made
application to himself to desire that there might be a treaty prepared from Rome
between the Pope, the King of</hi> France, <hi>and the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>to agree among
themselves of a Catholick, that may Reign in</hi> England <hi>after the Queen, be it
the King of Scots if he will turn Catholick, or be it some one else &amp;c.</hi> But there
in p. 367, <hi>year</hi> 1603, letter 174. from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and on <hi>April 21st,</hi>
it appears that all the <hi>Machinations</hi> of the <hi>hot Iesuitical</hi> heads against King
<hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>Succession</hi> were overturn'd by <hi>providence,</hi> for he there saith that the
<hi>Queen</hi> was no sooner dead, then that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was in <hi>England</hi>
peaceably received, and the <hi>Controversie of King Iames his title evaporated;</hi>
and for the honour of our <hi>English understandings</hi> he there saith, <hi>Les gens de
cet Isle là ont bien Monstrè qu' ils scavoient faire leurs affaires entr' eux tost &amp;
seurement, &amp; que ceux de dehors se sont fort mescontez en leurs desseins &amp; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</hi>
i. e. <hi>the people of</hi> England <hi>have well shewn that they knew how to do
their own business among themselves quickly and safely, and that others abroad
took very wrong Measures in their designs and hopes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here said enough to entertain your Lordship with the View of their
unreasonableness, who would impose on us, That Father <hi>Parsons</hi> wrote
not that Impious and Treasonable Book, and likewise with the more pleasant
View of Gods <hi>Confuting</hi> it (as I may say) by the happy determination of his
over-ruling Providence.</p>
            <p>And Now because I would make it appear to your Lordship, that I have
not been unjustly severe to the Jesuitical Principles, in rendring them such as
are the sturdy extravagances of those <hi>offals</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> call'd <hi>Bullyes</hi> and
<hi>Hectors,</hi> I shall entertain you with one Instance of a <hi>Bravado</hi> of threatning
from one <hi>English Iesuite</hi> to all Protestant <hi>Crown'd Heads,</hi> a <hi>bravado</hi> that is
like the High Water Mark, to shew in words how high 'tis possible for the
foam of the raging Sea of Anger to reach, and 'tis in a Letter of <hi>Campian</hi> the
<hi>Iesuite</hi> to <hi>Queen Elizabeths Privy Councellers, printed afterwards at Triers,</hi>
1583. as I find it Cited in that most learned <hi>Preface</hi> of my Lord Bishop of
<hi>Lincoln</hi>'s to the Book concerning the <hi>Gunpowder Treason,</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1679,
and 'tis thus in English, <hi>viz. That all the Iesuits throughout the World have
long since enter'd into a Covenant, to kill heretical Kings any manner of way:
and as to our Society know, That we Iesuites who are spread far and wide throughout
the whole World, have enter'd into an holy Covenant, that we shall easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all your machinations, and that we shall never despair of it as long as any
one of us remains in the World.</hi> Lo here a <hi>Drawcansir,</hi> that will not only <hi>snub</hi> all
Protestant <hi>Kings,</hi> and take the <hi>bowles from their mouths,</hi> and beat out their
Brains with them himself, but he saith there is a <hi>Society</hi> or Corporation of
such <hi>brethren</hi> of the <hi>bladed</hi> Ecclesiastical, who have enter'd into a <hi>Covenant</hi> or
<hi>Association</hi> to murder all Protestant Kings, and that every single Member of
the Corporation should have that <hi>dead-doing</hi> talent of Valour that should awe
and subjugate the Protestant World. And here then, <hi>my Lord,</hi> every Jesuite
values himself on being a <hi>Mutius Scaevola;</hi> and more than Three hundred of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103047:73"/>
these new <hi>Romans,</hi> or so many thousands of them, I mean <hi>all</hi> of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

who fear'd not the terror of these <hi>Huffes,</hi> but with his secrecy and silence
did reduce these mad dogs into the Condition of neither barking nor biting
in <hi>England,</hi> I mean Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> of whom 'tis said in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s
<hi>Posthuma, That his bountifull hand made his intelligences so active, that a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
could scarcely stir out of the Gates of</hi> Rome <hi>without his privity.</hi> And
no wonder then if <hi>Campian</hi> was soon brought to the end of a <hi>Traytor</hi> here in
<hi>England</hi> by the Care of <hi>one of Queen Elizabeths Privy Councellers</hi> in the Year
1581. who did both <hi>defie</hi> and <hi>scorn</hi> that <hi>Rhodomantado address,</hi> wherein the
<hi>Iesuite</hi> did <hi>Goliah-like, defie All Protestant Kings and their Armies,</hi> and as if
<hi>he would give their flesh to the Fowls of the ayr;</hi> but the event shew'd his own
flesh was so given as a Traytors, to that use here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a kind of a <hi>bravado</hi> in the great <hi>Archimedes,</hi> to say, <hi>Give me where
to stand, and I'le shake the Earth.</hi> He well knew no such place could be found.
The <hi>Iesuits</hi> it seems would have every <hi>one</hi> of their Order to be an <hi>Archimedes,</hi>
and able to <hi>shake the Earth</hi> as he pleas'd, and the <hi>hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> they
know offers them a place divided from the Civil and Imperial Government
where to stand with their Engines, namely the Ecclesiastical, but <hi>things will
not be ill administred,</hi> and holy Church it self will sink into the Earth, if its
Foundation be not laid as God and Nature would have it, and the Man who
stands for the place to be an <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and to <hi>Move the Earth,</hi> will soon
find his fate of being dissolv'd into his <hi>own</hi> little <hi>dust,</hi> and that among the
artificial <hi>lines</hi> he is making. It seems that boasted <hi>association</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> of
the Jesuites did help to occasion another among the Protestants in Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, which was ratify'd by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> in the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi>
which was about three years after the death of <hi>Campian,</hi> who was Convicted
of High Treason by vertue of the <hi>Statute</hi> made in the time of our Popish An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
namely in the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and thereupon executed, and
yet by the Romish Church made a <hi>Martyr,</hi> tho (as I said) convicted on that
<hi>Statute.</hi> But according to this thundring <hi>denuntiation</hi> of War against all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Kings by <hi>Campian</hi> as the Jesuites <hi>Herald,</hi> and his <hi>boasting when he did
put on his armour</hi> that every <hi>one</hi> of his Order should be like an <hi>Alexander</hi> an
adequate match for at least <hi>one World</hi> of hereticks, the author of the <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
needed not by his Rhetorick to reflect on my Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln's</hi>
Candour &amp; gentleness in saying <hi>yet if it be a breach of Christianity to crush the
bruised reed and of generosity also to trample upon the oppressed, I wish his Lordship
may be found guilty of neither &amp;c.</hi> for <hi>behold</hi> any <hi>single</hi> Jesuite according to
<hi>Campian</hi> tho but like a <hi>reed shaken with the wind</hi> is <hi>able</hi> to <hi>bruise</hi> all <hi>Protestant
Scepters,</hi> and any little toe of that Order can trample all Heretical crowned
heads to dirt, and the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>England</hi> if reduced to the <hi>least</hi>
of <hi>Numbers</hi> is not according to <hi>Campian</hi> to be slighted, if <hi>one</hi> of them be a
<hi>Iesuite,</hi> for that that <hi>one</hi> Jesuite will carry the advantage of <hi>odds</hi> against <hi>all</hi>
Protestant Kings and Princes; that <hi>one</hi> may say <hi>my Name is legion, for we are
many:</hi> but as that <hi>legion-spirit</hi> could not without the <hi>Divine</hi> permission ruin
a herd of Swine <hi>off</hi> from a <hi>Steep</hi> place, so neither can all the <hi>legions</hi> of <hi>Iesuited
evil Spirits</hi> in the World drive a King &amp; Kingdom from Precipices at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
And <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> in spight of all the arts and power of <hi>Rome</hi> outlived
eight Popes, and lived to change all her Counsellors but one, all her great offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
twice or thrice, some Bishops four times, and <hi>died full of years,</hi> and <hi>did see
and leave peace upon</hi> Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now I shall Entertain your Lordship with a further Reason of my
charging the present Popes declaration aforesaid about some opinions of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103047:73"/>
Casuists, as carry with it a face of some thing like</hi> shamme: <hi>and my reason
is grounded on what was said in a</hi> publick Sermon <hi>before an honourable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
namely,</hi> that the propositions of the Casuists therein were not Condemned
by the Pope in the Consistory, which would have made the Censure more authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but by the Pope and Cardinals of the Court of the Inquisition, upon which a
remarkable thing follow'd: the Iefuites in <hi>France</hi> who were much provoked at this
Censure, moved the Procureur de Roy, or Attorney general at <hi>Paris</hi> to put in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against the publishing that Decree, since it came from the Court of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
which not being acknowledg'd in <hi>France,</hi> nothing Flowing from that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
could be received in that Kingdom: upon which the decree was prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and suppress'd.</p>
            <p>And may not the <hi>English</hi> Popish Priests say the same thing, the <hi>Inquisition</hi>
was never received in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore that declaration of the Popes
obligeth us not here, and we will prohibit and suppress it as much as we can!
No doubt but the present Pope fearing that the Noysome and Infectious smell
of those Opinions of the <hi>Casuists</hi> being more offensive to the minds of Men,
then any snuff of a Candle can be to their Nostrils, they were ready to cry
<hi>for the removing of the Candlestick of his Church out of its place,</hi> went about
to extinguish them in the most <hi>Summary</hi> Manner that he could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
attempted to do it by the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Inquisition;</hi> well knowing, that in
the <hi>Consistory</hi> of <hi>Cardinals</hi> all proceedings are so dilatory, and the old <hi>magi</hi>
there so used to do every thing <hi>pian piano,</hi> that they would consume many
pounds of new Candles in debating whether or no and how the old snuff should
be removed, and perhaps would have thought to have contented the World in
the mean time with giving it some <hi>perfumes:</hi> but the <hi>Pope</hi> being afraid of the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> perhaps as sometimes the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> is of his <hi>Ianisaries,</hi> doth not
for fear himself should be extinguished by them, so far (as I may say) follow the
light within him, as to throw away or tread out that <hi>snuff</hi> of those opinions as
containing a <hi>malum in se,</hi> or declare any of them to be <hi>ill</hi> as contrary to the
principles of the <hi>law of nature,</hi> in which case neither <hi>he</hi> nor <hi>God</hi> himself indeed
could have dispens'd with them, tho yet any honest and ingenious <hi>Heathen</hi>
would on the least occasion given, have declared them so, As <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and many others have done; and which had the <hi>Pope</hi> done and the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
or any Papists persevered in the making those <hi>principles</hi> the <hi>Rules</hi> of
<hi>practice,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom</hi> had thereby been <hi>ipso facto divided against it self,</hi> and a
diffinitive sentence had been thereby given by the Pope, that all who had dy'd
owning those principles and practices, had been sunk for ever into the burning
lake. Therefore, as I said before, I hope this <hi>declaration</hi> of the Popes such as it
is, will give an alarm to our <hi>English</hi> Papists to deal seriously with their Souls,
and to consider as if it were for their <hi>eternities,</hi> these and other Principles of
their Religion, and that if they will not be thereby perswaded to be <hi>almost</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<hi>Christians,</hi> yet to be <hi>altogether</hi> Masters of as good <hi>Moral Principles</hi> as
the <hi>Heathens</hi> I named; and If any of them can but give us a <hi>Moral</hi> certainty
of their Principles being but such, I shall never repine at any favour that any
new Law may afford to such of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If therefore any of our Lay Country men Papists not guilty of the late</hi>
Plot <hi>shall desire to be</hi> heard, <hi>and to say any thing</hi> toward this effect, some of us
have heard of these principles before mention'd as own'd by our Casuists and Priests
and Confessors, that are now thus condemned by the Pope, and we did not believe
that those our spiritual guides did own such Principles, but now our Eye seeth by the
condemnation thereof that they were before own'd and made rules of Practice;
Wherefore we hope that who ever do own them, will abhor themselves and repent in
dust and ashes; and others of us did formerly think them Consistent with the
Christian faith and the peace of Kingdoms and with humane Society, but we now
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103047:74"/>
abhor those principles and repent in dust and ashes; We are ready to let the King
and Kingdom and the World have a moral certainty, that we desire no power to
change the Religion in <hi>England</hi> by Law establish'd, and we are willing to receive
Instruction from any that shall be appointed by publick Authority, to give it to us,
concerning what other principles beside these Condemned by the Pope are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with Religion or the publick Peace; and in case any shall offer to give us dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
either for principles or practices contrary to those, we renounce as inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with the publick peace; we shall be so far from accepting of such dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we shall detect the offerer thereof before a Magistrate, as much as we
would an enemy to His Majesty; We are ready to give active or passive obedience
as to all the Laws in being; We believe not the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to have more
power in His Majesties Realms by Gods word, then any other forraign Bishop, as
was by Acts of Parliament and publick Recognitions declared in the Reign of
Henry the 8<hi>th.</hi> We are willing to render the Kingdom as secure from fear of us
and our obtaining power, as are the States of the Vnited Provinces from those of
our persuasion in Religion among them; We are willing to let you see, that the same
Basis that shall be your security, shall likewise be ours.</p>
            <p>A great part of our number has we fear given too much cause of jealousie to the
Kingdom of their affecting pre-eminence therein, we are sorry for it, and hope it
will be so no more;</p>
            <p>I say such <hi>Papists</hi> as <hi>these</hi> are the <hi>bruised reeds,</hi> I would not <hi>trample on,</hi> and
would make no noise to interrupt their being heard to the effect above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.
And since <hi>what has been done, may be,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> in his
Impartial Observations <hi>on the Vnited Provinces of the Netherlands, chap.</hi> 5. saith
of the Roman Catholicks there, <hi>that tho they are very numerous in the Country
among the Pesants, and considerable in the Cities, yet they seem to be a sound piece
of the State, and fast jointed in with the rest: and have neither given any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
to the Government, Nor expres'd any inclinations to a Change, or to any
forreign power, either upon the former Wars with Spain, or the latter Invasions of
the Bishop of</hi> Munster; 'tis I say <hi>possible</hi> therefore for them to become <hi>sound
pieces of the state there.</hi> And if the end of all their <hi>shamme Plots</hi> be what is
usually that of Comedies, and <hi>Romances plots,</hi> a <hi>Marriage,</hi> I mean their <hi>espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
the <hi>true Interest</hi> of the Kingdom, I for my part shall never forbid the <hi>bannes</hi>
of the <hi>Matrimony,</hi> nor enter any <hi>Caveat</hi> against the <hi>license</hi> for it granted by
lawful authority; <hi>provided</hi> they give due <hi>security</hi> as in that case against such
a <hi>precontract</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> that may <hi>null</hi> their <hi>contract</hi> with us.</p>
            <p>'Tis an old Common Observation, That <hi>whelps</hi> without any care bestowed
on them will see at the end of <hi>nine</hi> days, tho born blind, and that if they are
much <hi>tamper'd</hi> with by <hi>art</hi> to be forced to see sooner, they are blind for ever:
and therefore I hope that the forbearance of our Church in this latter Age to
tamper with them, by disputes, or Catechising, or Compelling them to be
present at the publick worship, will with the help of Time and Nature, and
their experience of their inability by all their <hi>shamme Plots</hi> to put out our
Eyes, conduce to the opening of theirs.</p>
            <p>Alas, what advantage is it by all their <hi>artifices</hi> that they can hope both to
<hi>gain</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> here, I mean for any considerable time. A trick of <hi>art</hi> is like
a Monster in <hi>Nature,</hi> ill-lookt, and short lifed; and 'tis obvious to every
Eye, that the <hi>higher Scale</hi> got up by <hi>accident,</hi> is more ready to <hi>pop down again,</hi>
then it was before, while it hung in its <hi>due poise.</hi> And while they do by
<hi>art</hi> and contrary to <hi>Nature</hi> in any <hi>Conjuncture</hi> hoist up their Interest high in
the Air, the artificial motion endures not there long to be gazed at, and
while it is there visible, 'tis beheld by thousands of vigilant Marksmen, who
know 'tis easier to hit the mark shooting upward then downward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:103047:74"/>
               <hi>We find 'tis notorious out of the present</hi> Pope<hi>'s said</hi> Decree <hi>of the Second
of</hi> March <hi>last, That the</hi> Iesuits <hi>and other</hi> Casuists <hi>were Encouragers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of</hi> Calumny, <hi>by those</hi> Principles <hi>of theirs he therein</hi> Condemns, <hi>and
namely, That</hi> Probabile est non peccare mortaliter qui imponit falsum crimen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri,
ut suam justitiam &amp; honorem defendat: &amp; si hoc non sit probabile, vix ulla
erit opinio probabilis in Theologia: <hi>i. e.</hi> It is probable that he doth not Sin Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
who fastens a false Crime on another, that he may defend his own Iustice
and Honour; and if this is not probable, there is scarce any Opinion probable
in Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Iesuits <hi>have by this Opinion given us the</hi> alarm <hi>that they make</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
<hi>not</hi> contrary <hi>to the</hi> Law of God, <hi>but only</hi> beside it, <hi>for that is the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
account of a</hi> Venial <hi>Sin; and moreover, that it</hi> is a small and very pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Offence against God or our Neighbour, and no more than an Idle word, and
that it Robs not the Soul of life, and that it may be remitted without hearty
Pennance and Contrition, and only with the Sacraments, Holy Water, <hi>and the
like; these being the Popish</hi> Received <hi>Doctrines of the Nature of</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Sin.</p>
            <p>And thus they may be false Imputations and Testimonies rob the <hi>Bodies</hi>
of Protestants of life, without bereaving their own <hi>Souls</hi> thereof, and this is
own'd by them as a <hi>first Rate</hi> probable <hi>Opinion</hi> in that Great <hi>Science</hi> call'd
<hi>Divinity,</hi> that Great <hi>first Rate</hi> of all <hi>Sciences,</hi> as relating to the honour of
God; but most certainly we have very great Reason to pity the Persons of
those who have such <hi>low</hi> and groveling and ridiculous Conceptions of the
<hi>Supreme</hi> Being, as to think to add any thing to the <hi>brightness</hi> of his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by that Sacrifice with whose <hi>smoke</hi> they endeavour to blind the <hi>eyes</hi> of
<hi>some</hi> of their Brethren; while they are with its <hi>flames</hi> consuming the <hi>Bodies</hi>
of <hi>others,</hi> and to think to <hi>tickle</hi> him with the <hi>straw of Praise,</hi> while they
rob Men, and that the using of <hi>Fraud</hi> can be worthy of <hi>God,</hi> which is scorn'd
not only by <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> but even <hi>generous Beasts</hi> (it being proper to <hi>Foxes,</hi>
and not to <hi>Lions</hi> to practise it) and that tho the <hi>Dice of the Gods always fall
luckily</hi> (according to the old Adage) that false ones are to be used for their
Honour, or that any one is to be a <hi>falsarius</hi> for the Glory of the <hi>true</hi> God,
and that since the Roman Heathens thought it Essential to the Justice of
their Laws, and the honour of Human Nature to term him a <hi>falsarius</hi> who
but <hi>conceal'd Truth</hi> in the Case of <hi>Men,</hi> it can be <hi>worthy</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature
to encourage <hi>false</hi> asseverations in <hi>Ordine ad Deum,</hi> and that it can be any
Honour to <hi>infinit Wisdom</hi> to <hi>out-wit silly Mortals,</hi> or to <hi>infinit Goodness,</hi> to set
it self off by the <hi>putative</hi> or <hi>real</hi> faults of any one, and that since as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
said long ago, 'tis the greatest Scandal to a Governor imaginable
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to lay snares for those that he Governs,</hi> to think
that the Great <hi>Governor</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> can have <hi>honour</hi> from the laying of Nets
and Springes by <hi>Man Catchers;</hi> In fine, to think that after the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to Men had under the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Dispensation so long signaliz'd it self
against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> because 'twas a Cheat, and for that <hi>an Idol is nothing,</hi> it can
be consistent with the Divine goodness now under the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Gospel
(of which the Restoring of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> was the Great intent) to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<hi>inhumane Arts</hi> and <hi>Artifices,</hi> to make it degenerate to the old Cheat of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> again, and which was the worst extremity of it, the <hi>immolation</hi> of
Men under the pretext of Religion, a Cheat of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that the Blessed
<hi>Iesus</hi> design'd by the offring of himself to exterminate out of the World as an
unnecessary thing, and by his dying breath to make it evaporate for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was no guile found in his mouth,</hi> and his followers were only then <hi>wise
as Serpents, while they were innocent as Doves:</hi> and the first <hi>Crying</hi> in the
Cradle of the <hi>Puer Hebraeus of the holy child Iesus,</hi> was as Thunder to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103047:75"/>
strike the old Equivocating Oracles Dumb, that had so long cheated the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
World.</p>
            <p>When he branded the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> with sharper language, he calls
them <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> He alarms us of <hi>false Prophets</hi> coming in the <hi>Masquerade
of Sheeps clothing;</hi> tells us, That <hi>he who calls his Brother fool, shall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of hell fire,</hi> and therefore he may much more fear that danger who
makes a Fool of him, and plays the Knave with him; he Commands us not
to <hi>Calumniate or kill,</hi> but to <hi>bless those that curse us,</hi> which is more than to
praise them, as I said before of <hi>blessing</hi> being the <hi>tribute</hi> due to Men <hi>heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
Virtuous.</p>
            <p>To shew that he intended nothing of <hi>Artifice</hi> in the Propagation of his
Doctrine, a hated <hi>Publican,</hi> and a few poor Fishermen, and a Tent-maker
are used in his <hi>Embassy</hi> to the World, men not likely to be able <hi>Mentiri
pro patriâ coelesti,</hi> if such a Commission as <hi>Go Cheat all Nations,</hi> had been
given them.</p>
            <p>And lest it might be thought that with Oratorical <hi>Harangues</hi> that he or
they led Men by the <hi>Ears,</hi> as an <hi>implicit faith</hi> is said to lead them by the <hi>Nose,</hi>
he us'd no <hi>hony</hi> of Phrase, or <hi>sting</hi> of Epigram, no Politic Remarks, nor
scarce more <hi>lenocinium</hi> of words, than is in <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let
him hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells us, That <hi>for every Idle word we must give an account,</hi> and therefore
certainly abhorr'd <hi>Equivocation,</hi> which makes all words and speech <hi>Idle,</hi> and
of no effect; and since, as I think, 'twas truly said, <hi>Eloquentia non nisi stultos
Movet, Eloquence moves none but Fopps;</hi> he did, as I may say, put that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Complement</hi> on mens <hi>understandings,</hi> not to Commission his <hi>Ministers</hi> to
try to <hi>sooth</hi> men out of one belief into another by <hi>bribing</hi> their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<hi>with the excellency of speech, or the inticing words of man's Wisdom,</hi>
but the contrary.</p>
            <p>He thought it worthy of <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>worship'd</hi> by the world <hi>in Spirit and in
Truth,</hi> and not to encrease the number of his <hi>Homagers</hi> by <hi>Lies, Legends,</hi> and
<hi>Impostures.</hi> It was for the honour of the Christian Religion that the Son of
God chose to take flesh in the time when <hi>Augustus</hi> Reign'd, when the <hi>Roman</hi>
World being freed from a long Civil War, had leisure to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ltivate the Arts
of Wit and Reason, and had brought them to their highest Perfection, and
took not the advantage of a dark and barbarous Age to surprize the World in,
as afterward both <hi>Papism</hi> and <hi>Mahumetanism</hi> did, and 'tis therefore no Marvel
if either of those two <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> did in one Point so much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Christian Religion, in so soon with its ferment <hi>levening</hi> so Great a
<hi>lump</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>But the Christian Religion came not into the World like a <hi>Fireship</hi> with
prepar'd smoke to blind mens eyes, as it was assailing them: No, for to the
end that the <hi>Christian</hi> reveal'd Doctrine might like a great <hi>Pyramid</hi> be <hi>conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous</hi>
to the whole world, and last together with it, and reach from Earth to
Heaven, the Divine Providence was long laying its Foundation very deep in
<hi>Nature,</hi> and very <hi>wide</hi> in the <hi>world;</hi> I mean, <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> so agreeably
to Humane Nature then at their height appearing in the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi>

of Nature first imprinted on Man's heart, were by the Care of Heaven used
as <hi>previous</hi> in qualifying the World to receive the Glorious <hi>Superstructure</hi> of
the Christian Religion, the which would certainly not have been so much as
<hi>res unius aetatis,</hi> if at that time when the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws inculcating <hi>the Natural
Cognation between all Mankind,</hi> and placing <hi>Actions that wound Piety or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or good Manners in the Number of things Impossible,</hi> and intimating

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:103047:75"/>
things done thereby, and branding of those acts that do <hi>fraudem facere legi,</hi>
and rendring that <hi>to be but a pittiful innocence that is but as good as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and making him in the eyes of the Law to be still in Possession of any

made the Scene of its motion to be in the <hi>Dust,</hi> and <hi>it</hi> to be more <hi>accurs'd</hi> than

after they have been by their subtle Casuistical distinctions so long <hi>nibbling</hi> at
the Sacred <hi>word,</hi> a thing the old <hi>Serpent</hi> did, and tempting Men in a fool's
<hi>Paradise,</hi> according to their several Palates by their <hi>Tree of the Knowledge of
Good and Evil,</hi> I mean the <hi>Experiments</hi> of <hi>Vice,</hi> by their pretended <hi>Moral

were imagin'd that a general Counsel of Devils were by their Chief call'd to
debate of a Model of <hi>credenda</hi> and <hi>agenda</hi> for the world, 'tis likely they would
unanimously agree to set up this, and no other; for no doubt they would
pass no <hi>Article</hi> to deny the <hi>existence</hi> of a God, for they <hi>believe that, and
tremble,</hi> nor yet any Article that might be controul'd by Natural light, or
of which any Matter of Fact would be over-rul'd by Authentic History; but
they would among the unwary Judges of things, and such whose Judgments
are choak't up with the <hi>fumes</hi> of <hi>lust,</hi> try to <hi>puzzle</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> of Religion,
and by distinctions to make Golden Bridges for Men to retreat from Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And this Course the <hi>Iesuits</hi> have took. By their Casuistical <hi>distinctions</hi>
they have <hi>broke</hi> both the Tables of the Moral Law into innumerable <hi>pieces;</hi>
they have <hi>broke</hi> not only the <hi>least,</hi> but <hi>greatest of the Commandments, and
have taught men so to do,</hi> and how to do it with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to them, and how
<hi>Salvo metu &amp; fide peccare;</hi> and by being Casuistical <hi>Splitters</hi> of Sin, have
been as troublesome to the World, as <hi>Splitters</hi> of <hi>Causes</hi> are to a Country.
The Christian Religion that great <hi>Tye</hi> intended by Heaven to be like a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial

hope, they have made it their great business to untwist by their <hi>nice</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and to make it so <hi>fine</hi> that it will not <hi>hold,</hi> and by encouraging <hi>Lies</hi>
and <hi>Calumnies</hi> for the honour of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> they have help'd the
<hi>Politic-Atheists-would be</hi> to a new occasion of trying to insinuate that old
<hi>impotent-Slander</hi> that Religion it self is a <hi>Cheat;</hi> and moreover, since it is on

the World, and that every Ligament of Humane Society without Religion,
is but like a rope of Sand, 'tis probable that the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Morality being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive

are <hi>Witnesses</hi> in any <hi>Cause,</hi> to have their whole <hi>Deposition</hi> rejected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Discovery of one falsity therein. And since 'tis confessed to be the
Doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, and particularly of the <hi>Trent-Council,</hi>
that the <hi>intention</hi> of the Priest is necessary to the validity of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
who can promise to himself safe anchoring in the Depths of a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits

lawful for him so far <hi>to fear those that can kill the Body</hi> as by his Dissembling
<hi>his making of thy Body,</hi> to <hi>destroy anothers Soul</hi> by Idolatry? 'Tis among both
Papists and Protestants confessedly true, that if the <hi>Host</hi> I worship should
not be the Body of Christ, I were a great Idolater; and therefore if a Priest
by that incident Passion of fear may lawfully forbear to <hi>intend</hi> to <hi>make</hi> the
Body of Christ, I may well have such a constant fear as do's <hi>cadere in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantem

of my being an Idolater: and since a <hi>Miracle</hi> is Heaven's <hi>Broad

Miracle that can be thought of, I may well conclude that God will not
commit the Power of making Millions of Miracles every day to men that

wiser sort, it being only a supply of Ignorance among the Ruder and worse
kind of Statesmen. Beside it appears so much worse in Public Affairs, as it
is never almost hid or unrevenged. Reputation again is still lost thereby, which
yet how much it concerns Princes, none can better tell than such as Imagine them
without it.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:103047:76"/>
But to use Fraud in or for that great concern of Mankind call'd <hi>Religion,</hi>
is more absur'd: and 'tis the vilest Nonsence imaginable, <hi>for Men to talk
deceitfully for God,</hi> and that style of a foreign Monarch of <hi>Dissembling his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,</hi>
need not be used by him who made the World with a <hi>fiat,</hi> and
can unmake it with a <hi>thought,</hi> and whatever Religion in the World is true, I
am sure that is and must be false that attempts to support it self by falshood
or fraud, and by the Violation of Faith given. For I am sure that to stand
to Promises, to abhor Deceit, is a thing in its own nature simply good,
and <hi>that it is impossible that God should lye,</hi> and if it be simply good in God,
it is necessarily so in Man, whom he hath made after his own Image, the
Image being to answer the Archetype: and that Religion therefore that doth
approve of <hi>falsarii,</hi> and which cannot have the true God for its Founder,
and in which every honest man may justly say to the <hi>Deity</hi> of its worshippers,
<hi>Stand by thy self, come not near me, for I am holier then thou,</hi> (as the Scripture
expression is) must expect to be exterminated out of the <hi>Knowing</hi> World.
Such worshippers can be no more judged parts of the <hi>Ecclesia Catholica,</hi> than
<hi>Pick-pockets</hi> in <hi>Churches</hi> are of the <hi>Coetus fidelium</hi> there, and as when these
<hi>petty Larceners</hi> are there discovered, they are glad silently thence to steal
themselves away, such perhaps will the fate of those grand Impostors too
be after their detection to march out of the Church, and that without the
<hi>Parade</hi> perhaps of <hi>noise of Trumpet,</hi> or <hi>beat of Drum.</hi> There needs no batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ram against Fraud, but Detection. And these <hi>Arbiters</hi> of <hi>Calumny,</hi> that
like the Month of <hi>March</hi> came into the World as a <hi>Lion,</hi> may perhaps go out
of it like a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and their Morallity <hi>naturally</hi> come into the number of
<hi>Pancirols, Res deperditae,</hi> and as not worthy of any Humane care to conserve,
after it has with so much violence been labouring in vain to destroy that old
great <hi>invention</hi> of God, the Law of Nature. Let any great <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West-India
Company</hi> in the World, but once as a Public <hi>Society,</hi> renounce the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Faith, or Patronize Cheating, and no other Company need en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
their growth or Continuance, or pick holes in their Charters, and retain
the loudness of Lawyers to dissolve them. And such is the fate like to be of
any Religionary <hi>Society.</hi> None need ask where are the Fighters, or where
are the Disputers of this World, to confound an order whose Casuists make
Lying lawful; and yet make it lawful to kill one that gives the Lye.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, it is already through the Providence Divine, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Providence and Circumspection of Men so effected, That these
<hi>lewd Moralists,</hi> that call themselves the <hi>Fellows</hi> of the <hi>Holy Iesus,</hi> these
<hi>crafty Companions</hi> are so detected in the Church, not only as <hi>Cheats,</hi> but as
having the <hi>Plague,</hi> that they are avoided by many of the <hi>Orders</hi> that own
the Pope as their <hi>Chief,</hi> who will neither admit them to <hi>Prattique</hi> nor
<hi>Quarrentine,</hi> and they are in a manner reduced to the state of those Princes,
who force a Trade at home, and only drive one with their own Plantations
abroad. They are already come to the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Bessus</hi> his <hi>Collegues</hi> in the

they had took from so many, did support their Credit only by this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined</hi>
Determination, namely, <hi>that they were valiant among themselves:</hi> and
this is the <hi>present state</hi> of these <hi>expos'd</hi> Casuists of the Church Militant that
have been so long <hi>imposing</hi> on the World by force and fraud, 'tis agreed on by
them that <hi>they are Iust among themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the help of all that Nature and Art can do, they can never recover
the wounds that have been given them, by the publication of the <hi>Les Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciales,</hi>
or <hi>the Mystery of Iesuitism discovered in Certain Letters written

their Casuistical Tenets as infamous, they are after an Impeachment

of Fathers, Schoolmen, Divines of other Orders by <hi>Guimenius:</hi> who in that
Book of his before mentioned, brings in a multitude of <hi>great names</hi> of those
<hi>great ranks</hi> not only to Justify, but even to Sanctify the Crimes charged on
them in those Letters: and as 'twas said of old, <hi>Citius efficies Crimen honestum,
quam turpen Catonem,</hi> so in <hi>Guimenius</hi> we do not see any rascall Deer who
were Justly markt or wounded, thrown out of the herd of the Jesuits, but we
see Men who were besmear'd with their own filth and the Dirt the World
threw on them, out-braving the light, and to cleanse themselves from impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
guilt running into the Crouds of Casuists of their own and other Orders,
as likewise among the Fathers, Divines and Schoolmen; and so Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
Impious was he, as to make Acts of Cheating and Calumny to be
patroniz'd by <hi>holy Church,</hi> and openly to excuse the putting Gods <hi>Mark</hi> on
the Devils <hi>Merchandize,</hi> and to stamp in effect a legitimacy on them with an
<hi>effrontery</hi> only to be parallel'd with that which <hi>Tully</hi> tells us concerning <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi>
the <hi>Oratour, who being to defend a Person accus'd of Sedition, boldly went to
prove that Sedition was no Crime, but a very Commendable thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all their long Casuistical <hi>weighing</hi> of the <hi>Dirt</hi> of <hi>Vice in Aurificis

will turn with the thousandth part of one, it Can never be forgot that they
tell us this <hi>Dirt</hi> is <hi>Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can or will the bold Artifices of the Jesuits before mentioned in eluding

and of which <hi>Declaration</hi> the Cloud contains Thunderbolts of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against their Tenet of lawful Lying and Perjury, and Equivocating, and
of Dissembling in the administration of the Sacraments, be ever forgot even
by many thinking Papists, or indeed the thinking part of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And Protestants may well ask all Papists that Call those damn'd Tenets of
the Jesuits by the Name of Religion, <hi>Where was your Religion before the birth

that the setting up of those unmoral Casuistical Tenets in <hi>France,</hi> was the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Pillar of ignominy against God, I will ask if one who is <hi>revera</hi> an incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Iudge shall go to demolish any such Pillar set up against my Father, and I have
already own'd that that Iudge doth infallibly know the bounds of his Iurisdiction,
and have obliged my self to him by the foremention'd fourth Vow, that what thing
soever he shall Command that belongs to the profit of Souls, <hi>and the</hi> Propagation
<hi>of the</hi> Faith, <hi>I will without any tergiversation or excuse execute, as far as I
am able (for this is the Jesuits fourth Vow to the Pope) shall I then be active
in the</hi> hindring a Decree of this Nature, <hi>given by this Judge from being exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
at the</hi> same time, I Protest against it, shall I make no Protestation
for the honour of my Father? And do you think in this Inquisitive Age the Cheat
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103047:78"/>
of an Inquisition, will elsewhere pass long, since that Court that is used by
ordinary Inquisitors for the torturing the Bodies of Christians, and mutilation
of the Image of God, cannot be allow'd to shew severity to the body of Sin, to the
Image of the Devil in depraved Minds, and that while your unerring Iudge of
Law and Fact is in Person there praesiding? Are not you that surpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>All our Jesuited Papists must still expect Expostulations of this Nature.</p>
            <p>Their Head was before at <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Brains too; but if they now
make a <hi>Schism</hi> from the Pope himself, they will come under the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Acephali</hi> (the Name of some ancient Heretics) that is, the People
without a Head, unless they will own the <hi>Hydra</hi> of the Jesuits for their
Head, which it seems the <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> could not subdue. I believe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them will consider what <hi>sure footing</hi> they have where they are, while
they see their <hi>Moses</hi> flying from his own <hi>Staff when made a Serpent,</hi> I mean his
Order of Jesuits, and see the Collusive or Sham-Serpents of the Jesuits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
those of their <hi>Moses,</hi> and Juglers by <hi>Deceptio Visus</hi> and lying to impose
on the eyes of the World against the <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and even of
the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and 'twill be very ridiculous for them, who have been
cheated out of their own Religion, to think that some who are the Jesuits
<hi>Bubbles</hi> can cheat us of ours, and that while they are grown <hi>Seekers,</hi> they
should make us <hi>loose</hi> our <hi>Church;</hi> and that when the Spiritual <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the
Pope is in a manner Run Down by the <hi>Republic</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> they
should think to cheat us of our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> and that our Religion can
be run down by such <hi>Spiritual Outlaws,</hi> and Rebels against the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and such as perhaps the Pope may in time be induced to oblige the World
by suppressing after their Injuring all Morallity, and the most vital parts of
Christian Religion, and the great avow'd use of his Power in the whole
Christian Common-wealth, by their Suppression of his said <hi>Decree.</hi> I hope
while the <hi>Fan is in his hand he will throughly purge his floor,</hi> and esteem the
Disposals of rich Benefices in <hi>France</hi> to be poor <hi>Regalia sancti Petri,</hi> for him
to vindicate in Comparison of the lives of the Souls of his Flock, that he, and
all ingenuous Knowing Mankind, Know must be destroy'd by such Casuisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles; and without his doing which, he cannot in the least deserve
the Title of <hi>his Holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the determining the truth about such Principles, he need not say as
one of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> did about the <hi>Iansenian Speculations, that he had no skill
in Divinity.</hi> A very little skill in <hi>Natural Divinity</hi> (and such as may be had
by the Reading a few Lines in <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi>) would accomplish any one with
what would demonstrate the things allowed by the <hi>Casuists</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
both of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Nature; and all the Jesuit's
<hi>Skill</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> will never be able to render them otherwise to the
World.</p>
            <p>I must seriously profess, that <hi>one</hi> saying of the Great <hi>Cicero</hi> in that little <hi>Book,</hi>
viz, <hi>Ea deliberanda omnino non sunt, in quibus est turpis ipsa deliberatio,</hi> i. e. <hi>Those
things are not at all to be deliberated wherein the Deliberation it self is filthly;</hi>
has in it I think more <hi>frank</hi> generous <hi>Morality</hi> included, and that which is
more worthy of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> and Primitive <hi>Christian simplicity,</hi> then
what all the Libraries stuff'd with <hi>Bauny, Escobar, Layman, Le Moine, Navarrus,
Azorius, Molina, Tanuerus, Lessuis, Emanuel Sa, Henriquez,</hi> and other Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Casuistical Jesuits have furnished the world with, wherein they do so
<hi>nicely</hi> and <hi>infinitely divide</hi> the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Sin in semper divisibilia,</hi> and indeed
make it an <hi>infinite Nothing.</hi> But the world I think will not long <hi>deliberate</hi>
what to do with this Casuistical Divinity, of which no truer Description can
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103047:78"/>
be given, then that <hi>'tis a Deliberation of Sin.</hi> I do not know any that
would eate or drink with another that he thought did <hi>deliberate</hi> to Poison
him. <hi>Dum deliberant</hi> (saith <hi>Tacitus) desciverunt:</hi> i. e. <hi>While they do deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
whether they should revolt, they have revolted: their very deliberation
and consulting was</hi> ipso facto <hi>a Revolt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but many Pious Christians of the Roman Catholic Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
have Complain'd of the effect of their subtle and innumerable distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
destroying Christianity, in that <hi>style</hi> of the <hi>Woman in the Gospel, They
have taken away My Lord, and I know not where they have Layd him;</hi> and that
Considering those Casuists had so far sear'd their Consciences and brazen'd
their Foreheads as in the Patronizing of <hi>Calumny</hi> and other Impieties to defy
not only <hi>Christs Gospel,</hi> but the <hi>Pope</hi>'s own <hi>Canon Law,</hi> many <hi>Papists</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
the <hi>Pope</hi> with their Zeal sutable to that of the <hi>Psalmist's,</hi> to give that
decree, saying, <hi>It is time for thee to work, for they have made void thy
Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>notorious</hi> that the Canon Law (as bad as it is) is very severe against
<hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Calumniators,</hi> and especially against Clergy-men that are such,
and pronounceth a Clergy-man <hi>infamous</hi> who is convicted of defaming an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
and 'twas very well worthy the Vigilance of the Pope, not to let the
Jesuits steal away his Canon Law from him.</p>
            <p>But this must needs be very <hi>diverting</hi> to this <hi>inquiring</hi> Age, to see Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
as well as Papists accounting the Popes reducing some immorallities
to the <hi>Test</hi> of his own <hi>Canon Law,</hi> a piece of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the Pope strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
to effect it, and hindred by the Jesuits therein.</p>
            <p>According to the former expression, <hi>it is time for the Pope to work</hi> and to
<hi>Null</hi> that <hi>Order</hi> that thus <hi>nulls</hi> his aforesaid <hi>Decree</hi> in the sight of an <hi>awaken'd</hi>
World, and is else likely to Null his Church, the <hi>Patience</hi> of Mankind being
the less able longer to bear the weight of Jesuitical <hi>Calumnies</hi> by its having
endured them so long.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Great and Original Cause of the founding of that <hi>Order</hi>
being to cut Heretics Throats, (for at this plain rate we must speak and call
a Spade a Spade when they are digging our Graves with it) it was necessary
for them to use the art of <hi>blackening</hi> of Heretics by Calumnies as the Prologue
to that Tragedy, the which would cause the Heretics to fall unpity'd; and
'twas necessary to make that <hi>black art</hi> as lawful as they Could, that so they
might have their <hi>quietus</hi> from the World for the arrear of their pass'd frauds,
and not fear accounting for future ones.</p>
            <p>But as these men <hi>will not recede from their Art,</hi> so neither will <hi>Nature
recede</hi> from it <hi>self,</hi> and our Critical English World now having occasion to
pass Judgment of their Calumnies, is <hi>naturally</hi> enforced to Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ider their
former <hi>Shammes</hi> in States and Kingdomes to aggravate their present ones, as
Judges still in the Case of Malefactors are obliged to take notice of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been formerly branded for the same Crimes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The execrable</hi> Shamme <hi>made against the</hi> Admiral <hi>and others as conspiring
to kill the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> France, <hi>and giving provocation to the</hi> Parisian Massacre,
<hi>will never be forgot; nor the</hi> Shamme <hi>that was provided to have charged
the</hi> Puritans <hi>with the</hi> Gun-Powder Treason; <hi>nor that of the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebels, who
were so outragiously impudent as to pretend the Commission of our</hi> Royal
Martyr <hi>for their Butcheries: Nor yet that of the Jesuites having effected
heretofore in</hi> Bohemia, <hi>and lately in</hi> Hungary, <hi>that</hi> Counterfeit <hi>and</hi> forged
Letters <hi>should be found in the Custody of the Protestants, to charge them
with Crimes against</hi> Caesar. <hi>The</hi> Memorial of the Sufferings of the Protestant
Ministers in <hi>Hungary</hi> at the Instigation of the Popish Clergy there, printed
for <hi>William Nott,</hi> in the <hi>Pallmall, 1676. shews it at Large, where 'tis said,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:103047:79"/>
They did not (against the Ministers) insist much on the Particulars that relate to
Religion, but great endeavours were used to prove them Complices of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
the which their Advocates and Councel did manifestly disprove, and the
Resident of the States of the Vnited Provinces at <hi>Vienna</hi> did afterward in a
Memorial to the Emperour fully and solidly refute. Tho the Ministers were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in form of Law, for having assisted the Rebels by their Councel, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
them with Provisions, and for having Made way for the <hi>Turks</hi> to Come in
and wast that Kingdome, yet none of them (as that Discourse sets forth) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
thereof, nor one clear Testimony brought to prove that any one was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
of that Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That discourse shews that the</hi> Advocatus Fisci did exhibit everal Letters to
prove all the Ministers Complices of that Rebellion, but that many and great
presumptions evinced that these Letters were never produced, tho it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
demanded by the Ministers and their Advocates that they might be, and
that yet they could never obtain any thing but a printed Copy of them; and thô
the Advocates for the Ministers did often press the Fiscal to declare when, where
or how he came by these Letters, yet that was never done.</p>
            <p>That Author having p. 10. mentioned the vile art of Calumny, That the
Jesuits try'd to <hi>exterminate</hi> the Protestants out of <hi>Hungary</hi> by, speaks in p.
11<hi>th.</hi> of the effects of their endeavours, saying, that <hi>upon a Iust account it can be
made appear that at several times before and after the Citation against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
(meaning the Citation to that vile Process) <hi>there were above 1200
Chruches of them suppressed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must needs then appear very Ridiculous to the World, that when there
is not a third part of <hi>Hungary</hi> (that old <hi>Bulwark</hi> of <hi>Christendom against the
Turks</hi>) remaining in the Emperor's hands, (for so Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his late Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
there Computes it) that these <hi>Nominal</hi> fellows of Christ by <hi>nominal</hi>
crimes charged on real Christians, should endanger the <hi>exterminating</hi> of
<hi>Christianity</hi> out of the <hi>European</hi> World, and the making the Emperor not long
so much as a <hi>Nominal</hi> King in <hi>Germany</hi> it self, and that the Emperor should be
more afraid of the <hi>Itch</hi> of his remote Subjects, then of the <hi>plague</hi> of his nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Foes, and that the Jesuits disliking the <hi>Itch</hi> after new <hi>Doctrines</hi> in the
<hi>Hungarians</hi> should be reputed good advising Doctors, who counsel him to
pass the time in scratching and lancing with his nails his own members, when
many Thousands of armed men are designing against his Life and Crown, and
when his Empire is brought to such a state, that as 'twas said of the <hi>Roman
Empire</hi> when devolv'd on <hi>Germany,</hi> that one might <hi>quaerere Imperium in Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi>
that the danger now hangs over it of the <hi>German Empire being there sought
too,</hi> and all by the true Real <hi>Imperium in Imperio</hi> of the Jesuits there.</p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>biceps aquila,</hi> which is the <hi>Insigne</hi> or <hi>Arms</hi> of the Empire,
might be properly of late referr'd to the <hi>divisum Imperium</hi> the Emperor had
with the Jesuits, whom to every <hi>abecedarian</hi> in <hi>Politics</hi> 'tis known to be
more his interest during the present grandeur of <hi>France,</hi> to dismiss from his
<hi>Councels,</hi> than ever 'twas the <hi>Venetians</hi> to deal so with the <hi>Ecclesiastics.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I should not have thought it good manners to have been so
copious in the exercise of your Lordships Patience with the particularities of
the unmoral or unmannerly doctrine of the Casuists as to the Point of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,</hi>
but that I thought some <hi>Oyl</hi> of these <hi>Scorpions</hi> that you have not the
leisure to extract out of their dead <hi>Authors,</hi> might be useful to you in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the venom of their stings sooner then you are aware.</p>
            <p>And indeed as 'tis observed, that the <hi>Last</hi> bitings of some <hi>dying animals</hi> are
most fierce, so is it likely to be with their last efforts, namely those of their
Calumnies against Protestants, which I believe will likewise be their <hi>derniers
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103047:79"/>
Resort;</hi> and 'tis therefore your Lordships and every Protestants Concern,
who is a Lover of Justice, to know that you wrong'd any Jesuited Papists, if
in Capital Causes you did believe them not to <hi>practice</hi> in that case the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
they <hi>profess,</hi> namely the making <hi>Calumny</hi> venial, a thing so expressly
own'd in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Letter of the Les Provinciales,</hi> that they were Call'd by some
of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> on that account <hi>Quintadecimani,</hi> in allusion to the <hi>Quartadeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Heretics</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis said in that 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> Letter, That this is so notorious a Doctrine of their
Schools that they maintained it not only in their books but also in their public
Theses, which certainly is the height of Confidence, as among others in their
Theses of <hi>Louvain</hi> of the Year 1645. in these termes, It is only a venial Sin to
Calumniate, and impose false Crimes, to ruine their Credit who speak ill of us:
<hi>quidni non nisi veniale sit, detrahentis authoritatem tibi noxiam falso crimine
elidere?</hi> and this doctrine is so much in vogue among you, that you treat him as
an Ignorant and Temerarius person, who presumes any way to oppose it: <hi>and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after, tis related how Father</hi> Dicastellus said, that to prove that twas no
Mortal Sin to use Calumny though grounded on absolute falsities, against a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator,
he had brought a Cloud of their Fathers to witness it, and whole Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
Consisting of them all whom he had Consulted, and among others the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father <hi>John Gans</hi> Confessor to the EMPEROR, all the public and ordinary
Professors of the Vniversity of <hi>Vienna,</hi> (consisting wholly of Iesuits) and that
he had likewise on his side Father <hi>Pennalossa</hi> a Iesuit Preacher to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the aforesaid <hi>probable opinion</hi> of <hi>Calumny</hi> will never be received in this
<hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and since the old Roman Laws enjoyn a <hi>Iuramentum
Calumniae, an Oath of Calumny,</hi> (as was before remark'd) whereby every liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
was to invocate God as <hi>Witness</hi> and <hi>Revenger</hi> about his not using any
<hi>false proof Knowingly,</hi> the Christian World in this Knowing Age will Know
those who make the use of false proofs <hi>knowingly</hi> to be a <hi>Venial Sin,</hi> and it
must certainly appear ridiculous to <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iurors</hi> to give the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to such gamesters <hi>Oaths</hi> who trumpet forth that Principle that 'tis a
Venial Sin to use false Dice of the Law to make true ones of Protestants
Bones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I am not so unjust and uncharitable as to cast a brand on the
Body of the Papists, as not being capable of the <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Witnesses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but there are in the external Communion of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> very many Thousands who by Divine Grace are kept from Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
with that Church in many of its Principles and Practices, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
ignorance may render many of them excusable, and that the great
mortifications and austerities and zealous devotions not only among many
persons of their Religious Orders, but of the Common people, shewing them
heroically Vertuous, do entitle them to have their testimony in any matters
of fact received with honour equal with that of the best Protestants.</p>
            <p>And as to many of our Papists in <hi>England</hi> it must be with Justice acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that their having descended from antient Families, and having had
ingenuous Education, and plentiful Fortunes, and their having seen the World
abroad, where they have observed many of the Principle, of the Jesuits as
much detested by <hi>Papists</hi> as they can be by <hi>Protestants,</hi> and their generous
inclinations to serve Vertue and Morality, may well secure us from fears of
their being imposed on by <hi>Iesuits</hi> to use little or great unholy Shammes and
<hi>Calumnies</hi> for the good of <hi>holy Church,</hi> a sort of <hi>Penance</hi> that must needs seem
odious in Nature to well-bred Gentlemen and Men of <hi>Estates,</hi> not tempted
like little <hi>hungry Greeks to leap up to Heaven,</hi> or down to Hell for <hi>bread,</hi> under
the which mean <hi>classe</hi> of Mankind (according to my <hi>intelligence</hi>) those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103047:80"/>
have generally fallne who have been famous for Shamming and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as to the late Plot.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore no wonder that <hi>Papists</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> are not tempted
to use any <hi>Shammes</hi> to promote their Religion, it being necessity that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
men to turpitude, and the very <hi>Alms-men</hi> there not being <hi>ad incitas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And against some of our <hi>English</hi> Papists, being allowed to be dignitaries
as to faith of testimony, whom I have before described, I shall never except.</p>
            <p>But for any <hi>English</hi> Papist who is a believer of the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi>
and some other <hi>Casuists</hi> to Expect to be believ'd against any that honors not
their Society, (which none that upholds humane Society and would not have
Mankind trick'd out of the Light and Law of Nature can do) is to render a
man irreverent to himself and his Maker, and to shew his want of a <hi>Curator</hi>
by the <hi>prodigallity</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi> especially when he shall call to mind how
<hi>Del Rio the famous Iesuit</hi> affirm'd that <hi>the Dominicans</hi> ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
as <hi>witnesses</hi> against the <hi>Iesuites, a charge</hi> that <hi>Guymenius</hi> p. 127, &amp; 128.
in vain Contends to evade.</p>
            <p>But this their <hi>dernier Resort</hi> (as I call'd it) of their <hi>use</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of
their <hi>erroneous</hi> or rather <hi>diabolical doctrine</hi> of <hi>Calumny,</hi> must certainly be
<hi>fatal</hi> to them; according to that <hi>Proverb</hi> in the <hi>Gospel</hi> about the <hi>last error,
&amp; erit novissinus error pejor priore.</hi> The <hi>High Priests and Pharisees</hi> came to
<hi>Pilate</hi> saying, <hi>Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive,
After three dayes I will rise again; Command therefore that the Sepulchre be
made sure till the third day, lest his Disciples come by Night and steal him away
and say to the people he is risen from the dead: So the Last error shall be worse
than the first:</hi> and they Judged right enough of the <hi>Last</hi> error Confounding
more than the <hi>First,</hi> as it is the force of the Last motion from a <hi>Precipice</hi> that
breaks a man in pieces; and this effect of the <hi>last</hi> error was presently exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify'd
in themselves; for they having caus'd the holy Sepulchre to be very
strongly guarded, and the Door of it to be barricado'd with a very great
Stone, and that Stone to be seal'd, and the Lord of Glory after all this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring
the Grave and Guards, they had a Consult and gave the Guards
Money to spread that <hi>Shamme</hi> in the World, that his Disciples did steal him
away while the Guards slept, and saith St. <hi>Mathew, this is reported among the
Iews to this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lo, as Christ did <hi>rise for our Iustification,</hi> so did this Subornation used
by those <hi>Impostors justify</hi> the truth of his Resurrection, which else could not
so well have confronted the Worlds incredulity: for if after his Resurrection
his Disciples believed not <hi>Mary Magdalen, Ioanna,</hi> and the Mother of <hi>Iames,</hi>
who told them that he had appear'd to them, and if the two Disciples that
told the Rest that he had appear'd to them going to <hi>Emmaus</hi> were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by them, and if when he appear'd in the midst of Ten of them at once
and shew'd them his hands and his side, <hi>they believ'd not for joy,</hi> and if when
he appear'd to the Women and bade them tell the Disciples and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that
according to his Promise they should see him in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and if the Eleven
Disciples went into <hi>Galilee</hi> to a Mountain which he had appointed them, and
yet when they saw him there <hi>they worship'd but some doubted,</hi> and if Christ
almost in his Last words <hi>upbraided</hi> them with their <hi>unbelief,</hi> because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
not them who had seen him after he was risen, the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi>
World would not have been brought to easily as they were to the belief of
his Resurrection, the great <hi>hinge</hi> on which the Christian Religion turns, and
without which the Preaching of the Cross would not so much have seem'd

was extracted by the Divine Power out of the Hellish act of Murdring
the <hi>holy Iesus,</hi> so was the propagation of the truth of his Resurrection out of
the Calumny, Subornation and Bribery used to suppress it, those artifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so odious in the eye of the Law of all Nations, that they make any that
uses them to gain infamy and loose his Cause, and to make sure of the hatred
ofone very Considerable Enemy, namely Mankind; and justly, for against
that great Body is every one that professeth <hi>Calumny</hi> an <hi>aggressor,</hi> and has <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd</hi>
War.</p>
            <p>And Granting that Nature is Constant to it self, and that conslusions of
the working of the Passions in humane Nature in future times may be made
from the pass'd, Our <hi>Quintadecimani</hi> (thô their Order seems in many politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles to be <hi>close compacted</hi> like the <hi>scales</hi> of <hi>Leviathan,</hi>) by the
publishing of the Tenets before mentioned and constant practice of them
have brought themselves into the <hi>shallows,</hi> and they are like <hi>Whales</hi> on ground
gazed on by the Critical World, and there labouring under the fatality of
their own weight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It has been observed by that deep Enquirer into Nature,</hi> Monsieur Descartes,
<hi>that</hi> Le bon sens est chose du monde, mieux partagè <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nothing is more equally
distributed by Nature among Meu than Vnderstanding and Reason, for every
Man thinks he has enough: <hi>and of this opinion was Mr.</hi> Hobbes <hi>in that</hi> Chapter
<hi>in his</hi> Leviathan, <hi>of the Natural condition of Mankind, Where he saith,</hi> That
as to the Faculties of the Mind there is a greater equality among men then that
of strength: for prudence, <hi>saith he,</hi> is but experience which equal time bestowes on
all men in those things they equally apply themselves to.</p>
            <p>That which perhaps makes such equality incredible, is but a vain conceit of ones
own wisdom, which all mortal men think they have in a greater degree than the
Vulgar, that is then all men but themselves and a few others whom by fame or for
Concurring, with themselves they approve: for such is the Nature of men, that
howsoever they may acknowledg many others to be more Witty or more Eloquent
or more Learned, yet they will hardly believe many so wise as themselves: for
they see their own witt at hand, and other mens at distance.</p>
            <p>But this proves rather that men are in that Point equal than unequal: For
there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of any thing, then
that every man is Content with his share.</p>
            <p>Admitting this great observation of those two great Masters of Witt and
Philosophy to be true, One would suppose that <hi>Nature</hi> did not in vain <hi>implant</hi>
in men such a <hi>general</hi> notion of their equality in Wisdome, nor without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of promoting the good of humane Society thereby. The God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath not only not given us any members of our bodies, but not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>hair</hi> of our eye-browes, nor even the <hi>hairs</hi> of our <hi>eye-lids</hi> in vain; for
our eye-lids are fortify'd with those little stiff <hi>bristles</hi> as with <hi>palisado's</hi> against
the assaults of <hi>Flyes</hi> and such like bold <hi>animalcula:</hi> and I may say, that that
<hi>general</hi> Notion doth defend the <hi>Eyes</hi> of mens Minds from being too easily
imposed on by particular Notions and Shammes occurring to us from
any.</p>
            <p>And as to that notion so <hi>universally</hi> planted in mens Souls by Nature, one
may well imagine that what a Gardiner plants in every bed of his Garden,
is no <hi>weed;</hi> and perhaps one great End of Nature in the general implanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this principle in men may be The shewing them the folly and danger
of their attempts, who think to <hi>engross</hi> that great <hi>Staple</hi> Commodity of the
<hi>intellectual</hi> World call'd <hi>Wisdome,</hi> and to force others to buy that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of which they think they have enough of their own by them, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they see that others would force a trade on them by counterfeit
Wares, and have been already branded for so doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:103047:81"/>
The truth is, every man's life who pretends to a greater share of Wisdome
than his Neighbour, is in the better state of security by this Notion before-mentioned;
for if a man thought others by their Wisdom could render his
ineffectual for his preservation, he would fear and hate them for their ability
to hurt him: and as Toads thô not Known to do any hurt are kill'd some
times for the imagin'd pretious Stones in their heads, such might be the
fate of men for the value of their Brains, and which <hi>depretiate</hi> the worth of
others. I conclude therefore that any Order or Society must take what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
from being thought <hi>Nusances</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> to Mankind, and prepare
for a political death or dissolution, who think themselves able by artifices to
devest men of the property they have in their Understandings, and to <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit</hi>
their <hi>wisdome,</hi> and who both hang out to the World a new light, and
proclaim a new Law of <hi>Nature</hi> contrary to the old, (notwithstanding the
out-cry of Nations that <hi>nolumus legem naturae mutari,</hi>) and who <hi>Calumniate</hi>
all that allow not the doctrine of <hi>Calumny,</hi> and <hi>invent</hi> Crimes to Cut off the
heads that will not ly at their feet, thô yet they can invent no crimes (even
Regicide not excepted) but what the <hi>Invention</hi> of their <hi>Theology</hi> has made
lawful, and think that an <hi>hypothesis</hi> may <hi>renitente mundo</hi> call it self <hi>Religion</hi>
or <hi>Politics,</hi> which if it were universally receiv'd, would not leave the World
one minute out of a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Warr,</hi> for it <hi>ipso facto</hi> dissolves all <hi>Pactions,</hi> and
cancels all <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and nulls all hopes of <hi>Protection;</hi> insomuch that in a
<hi>Gaming-house</hi> that <hi>agreed</hi> on <hi>cheating,</hi> the <hi>play</hi> could not be worth the <hi>candles</hi>
at a days end, and each of the cheaters must be reduced <hi>to cheat by himself;</hi>
and thus too any one that makes fraud venial, cannot be sure that any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipants
with him in Sedition will keep their word; and he must rebel by
himself too against an irritated world, that was never made only for any to
play in and with, and which must needs with inconceiveable regret see those
men who make all accusations and testimony in nature <hi>uncertain,</hi> instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in the inflicting of the punishment of <hi>Certain</hi> death thereupon, and see a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that is dying a <hi>Natural</hi> death, make any Religious men dy by a <hi>violent,</hi>
and observe that its inventors do in a <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>dictatorian</hi> way propound
Principles that such <hi>sturdy propounders</hi> cannot themselves believe, till like
<hi>Geta,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> who having long as a <hi>disguise</hi> wore a patch over
one of his Eyes, he lost the use of it for ever, they have by habituating
their Understandings long to <hi>dissimulation,</hi> lost the use of their faculty of
discerning.</p>
            <p>And this is the Case between Mankind and the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> neither better nor
worse, and is like to be the fate of these, and especially Considering that
their Principles have both Weight and Numbers to Contest with, I mean
the weight of Arguments, and the Numbers of their own and our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>There is no Resisting the Power of Nature where those two things
meet.</p>
            <p>We see by frequent observation in our own Land, that the very <hi>breath</hi>
of the people like that of a <hi>Canon Bullet</hi> proves destructive, aud what then
will not the breath of incensed Mankind do?</p>
            <p>They have Numbers to Contest with that their Principles have infected
with <hi>Calumny,</hi> who think it scarce a <hi>Venial</hi> Sin to pay any man in the false
Coyn that was received from him, and who will be making it as lawful as
they Can, not to play upon the square with false Gamesters: and as the
strong are naturally apt to repel force by force, so are the weak, to repel
fraud by fraud, and will be tempted to make an ill use of the <hi>lex talionis,</hi> and
to account the pursuing of them with wild defamatory Reports to be but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

            <p>They and other Casuists and Jesuited Papists have complain'd of Shammes

no doubt if they have not suffer'd in that kind, they may expect it, all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
having not attain'd to the temper of <hi>St. Michael the Arch-Angel to

            <p>
               <hi>I have read of an Antidote against the Poyson of</hi> Calumny <hi>and</hi> false testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<hi>beyond what Protestants could Compass, namely,</hi> an Indulgence granted
by Pope Innocent the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to every man and woman that bears upon him or her
the length of Christs Nails wherewith he was fastned to the Cross, (the Iust length
of which was Nine Inches) and worships them daily with five Pater-Nosters, and
five Aves and a Creed, that he or she shall have granted them, these great gifts:
the first is that he shall never dye a sudden, nor evil death: the second is that
he shall never be slain with the Sword or weapon: the third is, his Enemies shall
never overcome him: the fourth is poyson, nor false witness shall never grieve
him.</p>
            <p>By my Consent every Protestant and Papist shall in this Pestilential time
of Shammes Carry this Antidote about him; but whether this be a <hi>Shamme-Indulgence</hi>
or no, and put upon the Pope, and invented by Some non-Papists;
I know not. My Author for it is Mr. <hi>Iohn Gee, Master of Arts</hi> of <hi>Exeter
Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> Call'd <hi>New Shreds of the Old Share,</hi> p. 103.
<hi>Printed at London</hi> in the Year 1624. In any such wretched Contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>faex Romuli</hi> and any of the Protestants here who should become most
impure by Calumny, as the Protestants being much more Numerous than
the Papists would be able to out-shamme them, and to make the more plain
detections of the Shammes contriv'd by their Adversaries, it would likewise
go the harder with any Sect, that the Majority of Numbers would thus run
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103047:82"/>
down with Shammes in this Nation at this Conjuncture of time, when the
many swarms of those who <hi>offer</hi> at <hi>Wit,</hi> and think they merit the being call'd
<hi>Witts,</hi> by doing the exercise in a Coffey-house, Call'd <hi>Baldring,</hi> that is, with
a serious grave face, telling idle feign'd Stories <hi>farced</hi> with particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
to ensnare the belief of the Credulous, which kind of ungenerous
triumphing over weak Understandings by ridiculous <hi>Shammes,</hi> is a false sort
of <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>humour</hi> below not only the gravity of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, but the
levity of the <hi>French,</hi> and used by none but <hi>Fools</hi> who stand for the place of
being <hi>Knaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but the talent of these foolish Shammers as their interest
and dependances or humors incline them to wish well either to Popery or
Protestancy extending to abuse the belief of the unthinking Vulgar with little
<hi>romantic Stories</hi> concerning those Religions, helps to Convey them into the
<hi>Press</hi> which gives wings to these Shams presently to fly round the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>If the Papists think the Press hath not in any of the Pamphlets it dayly
spits, charged them with <hi>Calumny,</hi> and of Such a Nature as to bring univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
odium on them by alarming the Kingdom almost as much as it could be
by forrain invasion, and occasionally laying a Tax on men to buy what Arms
for their defence the Law allowes, I will ask them what they think of one of
our <hi>printed Intelligences</hi> that Came out on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1680/1, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
'tis said, <hi>Last</hi> Fryday <hi>came a Letter from</hi> Stafford, <hi>directed to one</hi> Bacchus
<hi>Tenant to the Lord</hi> Stafford <hi>from one</hi> Wilson <hi>in</hi> Cheshire, <hi>but ordered to be
left with one</hi> Finny <hi>of</hi> Stafford <hi>to be sent to the said</hi> Bacchus: <hi>but</hi> Finny <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Letters so directed to pass through his hands, and apprehending they
might relate to some dangerous Correspondence, took the liberty to Open this, and
therein to his great surprize found directions to</hi> Bacchus <hi>for burning of</hi> Stafford
<hi>and several great Towns: upon which making a speedy discovery to a Magistrate,</hi>
Bacchus <hi>was sent for, who after some evasions did confess he had received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to that purpose. And just now the said</hi> Wilson <hi>is apprehended and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and confesseth he was by the order of a Certain Lord, to fire</hi> Stafford,
Drayton, Shrewsbury, Nantwich, Chester, Congerton, New-Castle Under-Line,
<hi>and two more, and that he was to have 900 l. for fireing those Nine
Towns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I having never heard of any Proclamation or proceedings either of the
Magistracy or Lievtenancy of this Kingdom after such an alarm of public
hostility and of a Rebellion hatch'd in the Kingdom, nor of the last punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inflicted on the pretended Certain Lord that was the General of those
<hi>Incendiaries,</hi> did look on them under the Notion of an <hi>Army in disguise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever ground the Protestant Religion hath got or shall get by
these poor means, I desire that it may go to the Next occupant; for not only
the ayr it exhales is Pestilential, but it includes that ayr in it which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Earthquakes, which dangers therefore the New Popish or Jesuited Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
must be exposed to by the ayr of Shams and Calumnies.</p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>I shall here entertain your Lordship with somewhat very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
out of the</hi> Book <hi>of</hi> Father Parsons <hi>of the</hi> Succession, <hi>whereby you
will see that instead of Allowing the</hi> oportet esse haereses, <hi>he doth in effect tell
us, that while the Kingdom has two Religions in it,</hi> oportet esse Calumnias:
<hi>that</hi> great <hi>Jesuite having with much agility danced on the high rope as to
the</hi> Casuistical <hi>part of the</hi> Question <hi>of the</hi> Succession, <hi>affects to do it too in the</hi>
Politics, <hi>but miss'd his</hi> Center <hi>of</hi> gravity <hi>in his motion both as a</hi> Divine <hi>and
a</hi> States-man, <hi>and did shamefully</hi> fall <hi>in either Capacity, as your Lordship
will find by the reading of his words. He saith,</hi> p. 217. <hi>being near the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the</hi> first <hi>part of his Book,</hi> And thus much now for matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103047:82"/>
But if we Consider Reason of State also and worldly Policy, it Cannot
be but great folly and oversight for a man of whatsoever Religion he be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
to a Kingdom in which himself must live one of a Contrary Religion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
for let the bargains and agreements be what they will, and fair promises
and vain hopes never so great, yet seeing the Prince once made and settled, must
needs proceed according to the Principles of his own Religion, it follows also, that
he must Come quickly to break with the other party, tho he loved him never so
well (which yet perhaps is very hard if not impossible for two of different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
to love sincerely) but if it were so, yet many jealousies, suspicions, accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Calumniations, and other aversions must needs light upon the Party that is
of different Religion from the State and Prince under whom he lives, as not only
he Cannot be Capable of such Preferments, Honours, Charges, Government and
the like, which men may deserve and desire in their Commonwealth, but also he
shall be in Continual danger, and subject to a thousand molestations and injuries,
which are incident to the Condition and state of him that is not Current with the
same Course of his Prince and Realm in matters of Religion; and so before he be
aware, he becomes to be accounted an Enemy or backward man: which in Mind he
must either dissemble deeply, and against his own Conscience make shew to favour
and set forward that which in his heart he doth detest, which is the greatest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
and Misery of all other, tho yet many times not sufficient to deliver him
from suspicion; or else to avoid this everlasting perdition, he must break with all
the temporal Commodities of this life, which his Country and Realm might yield
him; and this is the ordinary end of all such men, how soft and sweet soever the
beginning be.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Iesuite</hi> (who was before mention'd to have been Call'd <hi>one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Men that his Order has produced</hi>) was here (it seems) a <hi>States-man in his
heart,</hi> and no More: and has very honestly foretold all Protestants that shall
live under a Prince of another Religion, how dishonest Roman Catholics will
prove to them. The Jesuite was here an <hi>Almanac-maker,</hi> who predicted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Protestants but <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder,</hi> and too the Continual <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Snares upon them during</hi> such a Conjuncture, and the causing each of
them to be with the <hi>darts</hi> of <hi>Calumny</hi> and obloquy forever stuck round like the
figure of the <hi>man</hi> in the <hi>Almanac:</hi> but how foolish <hi>Father Parsons</hi> was to write
this when the <hi>Protestants</hi> had the Ball at their foot, and when he could not
be sure that the Papists would ever arrive at the state, to have it alwayes at
theirs, let any one Judge. He had before used that rhetorical expression, that
<hi>so the Ship be well and happily guided, I esteem it not much important of what
Race or Nation the Pilot be,</hi> but he was extremely impolitic, by so early and
public an alarm to notify it to many who thought that <hi>embarqued</hi> in the
Civil Government of a Prince of any Religion, they might be safely tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
from this World to the Next, that Popish <hi>Masters</hi> of the Ship have
determin'd before-hand to throw all heterodox Passengers <hi>overboard,</hi> and
their own Oaths and engagements to them likewise.</p>
            <p>But what ever person takes a <hi>promissory</hi> Oath with an <hi>intent</hi> of not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, may well be Concluded as actually guilty of perjury in the Court of
Heaven, as he who knowingly takes a false <hi>assertory</hi> Oath. They have both
equally presumed to try by solemn lying to <hi>weather</hi> the fear of Divine Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience
and Omnipotence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and both their <hi>assertory</hi> and <hi>promissory</hi> Oaths are
of equal weight in the ballance of humane judgment.</p>
            <p>And because I think the Argument will hold from the falsity of their
Oaths <hi>promissory</hi> in this their <hi>dernier Resort</hi> aforesaid, to the obtaining the
Worlds Sentence against the truth of their Oaths <hi>assertory,</hi> I shall entertain
your Lordship with an instance of one of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom it
may be said, that a <hi>Greater</hi> than <hi>Father Parsons</hi> is here, to vindicate the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103047:83"/>
making of Oaths <hi>promissory</hi> with an intent of breaking them, and 'tis <hi>Pope
Clement</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, of whom <hi>Danaeus</hi> saith in his <hi>Chronology</hi> of Popes, that he
was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the 'O <hi>Politician,</hi> as I may say, of whom <hi>D'Ossat</hi> in his Third
<hi>Book, Letter 81, viz.</hi> to <hi>Villeroy</hi> in the Year 1597, speaking there how <hi>he
had discover'd the Popes Inclinations, that the King of</hi> France <hi>should break with</hi>
England, <hi>and that he told his Holiness that the King's making a particular
profession to keep his word would not suffer him to break that Alliance that had
been so lately renew'd and sworn,</hi> saith, <hi>that the Pope thereupon reply'd, That
that Oath was made to a heretic, and that his Majesty had made another Oath to
God and the Pope:</hi> And further mentions <hi>what the Pope had told him at other
times and in the precedent audience, That Kings and Soverain Princes did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to themselves all things that turn'd to their profit, and that none blamed
them for it or took it ill from them, and alledged to that purpose a Saying of</hi>
Francisco Maria <hi>Duke of</hi> Urbin, <hi>who was wont to say, That if a plain Gentleman
broke his word he would be dishonour'd by it; but that Soveraign Princes for
Reason of State without any great blame might make Treaties and break them,
and</hi> Mentir, trahir, &amp; toutes telles autres choses, <hi>i. e. Ly, and betray, and do
all things of that nature:</hi> whereupon saith <hi>D'Ossat, I had but too much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to that, but I did not think it my duty there to stay my self in a place so slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
But toward the close of the <hi>Letter</hi> he adds, <hi>By what is abovesaid you
see tho the Pope has no disrespect for the King of</hi> France, <hi>nor any love for the King
of</hi> Spain, <hi>yet the hatred that he has for Heretics, transports him so far, that he
lets fall from his Mouth (tho under the Name of another) some pernicious Maximes
unworthy of an honest man, and that the Pope accounts all ways good for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to break with his Allyes, because they are not Catholics, altho those ways
are infamous.</hi> I am so far a Concurrer with that Pope, as to think that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of Nature and Nations, the Oath and Promise to the first
of any Prince's Allies is most obligatory; and therefore the Pope doth very
honestly notify his opinion, that <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> intended not to keep any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missory
Oath Contrary to that made to God and himself. But the <hi>Pope</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
the <hi>factum</hi> of that Great <hi>Prince</hi>'s Oaths; and 'tis for the honour of the
Roman Catholic Religion, that it has left to Posterity so great an instance
of a Protestant Prince turn'd a Papist, and Continuing kind to the persons of
Protestants. But they owed no thanks to the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Iesuites</hi> for his making
or keeping Promises and Alliances with Protestants. The <hi>Bohemian History</hi>
tells us how <hi>Ferdinand</hi> about the <hi>Year 1617, before he was possest of that Crown,
did by Oath bind himself, that</hi> Matthew <hi>being alive he would not meddle with
any of the affairs of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>much less with Religion: but immediately after
his Coronation, he going into</hi> Moravia <hi>to receive homage, the Iesuites erected at</hi>
Olumacium <hi>a Triumphal Arch, and painted on it among the Arms of</hi> Austria,
<hi>the Lion of</hi> Bohemia <hi>tyed to it with a Chain, and the Eagle of</hi> Moravia <hi>with a
sleeping Hare lying with open Eyes, and this Emblem writ under it,</hi> I have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed.
<hi>But the Year following, a new erected Academy of Iesuites spoke out in
Print, that tho</hi> Ferdinand <hi>at his Coronation took an Oath to the Heretics, yet
first he left it in the Vestry of the Church, that he would not suffer Heretics to
prejudice the Rights of holy Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I believe I may without offending any Candid Papists, say of that
<hi>Pope,</hi> that when he discours'd as that <hi>Letter</hi> mentions; the <hi>glory</hi> of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
shined not out of his Mouth, as <hi>Porphry</hi> said that <hi>Plotinus his Soul
did when he spake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Story</hi> is <hi>trite</hi> concerning a <hi>Popes</hi> Excommunicating a <hi>Bishop</hi> of his
Church, for owning that there were <hi>Antipodes;</hi> but there is a sort of <hi>greater
Excommunication</hi> that any Jesuited Papists are to expect that are the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi>
to <hi>ingenuous</hi> Mankind, and who make <hi>Assertory</hi> or <hi>Promissory</hi> lying to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103047:83"/>
be venial, or lawful, and that is thus to be <hi>excluded</hi> from the <hi>Communio fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi>
(tho without the Ceremony of lighting Torches and extinguishing
them), namely, by Gentlemens forbearing to keep them Company, and
<hi>esteeming them worse than Publicans or Heathens,</hi> and accounting it neither safe
nor honorable to Correspond with the Enemies of Mankind; and this is the
Sentence, namely that of a kind of <hi>Civil Excommunication</hi> or seclusion from
ingenuous mens <hi>Conversation</hi> that they are likely to obtain in <hi>England</hi> after
all their charge and pains in their <hi>dernier Resort,</hi> and the having seen the
<hi>birth</hi> of their Plott confounded, and the <hi>after-birth</hi> of it, namely its Shams
thrown away.</p>
            <p>Since No <hi>injury</hi> wounds so much as a <hi>Contempt,</hi> and since they by tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on our Understandings with More pride than ever <hi>Bajazet</hi> walk'd over
the dead heads of Christians, affect to try to bring us implicitly to believe
their Shammes, they are to thank themselves for our not giving decent
burial to any of their undecent Plotts, and for the exasperating any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
by <hi>despising</hi> them, and endeavouring to <hi>impose</hi> on their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as some did on a <hi>raw</hi> young Country Gentleman, whom one day treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a <hi>Puppet-shew,</hi> they persuaded that the Puppets were living Creatures,
and after he had found out his gross ridiculous misconceit therein, they on
the following day attending him to the <hi>Theatre,</hi> engaged him to believe that
the <hi>Actors</hi> were <hi>Puppets: I mean,</hi> their endeavoring to make us believe that
Sham-Plots were real ones, and that a real one was <hi>Shamme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall never wonder at the encrease of the passion of anger incident to
humane Nature even in great and generous Souls, on the occasion of gross
Calumnies invented against them about a matter of weight, when I consider
the Example of the Great <hi>Royal Prophet,</hi> a Person of a great Understanding,
and of so great <hi>Courage, that he was not afraid of Ten thousands of men who set
themselves against him round about, and tho an Host should encamp ogainst him,
his heart would not fear,</hi> and a Man that had in his Nature and temper the
Gentleness of a Lamb mixt with the stoutness of a Lyon, and one to whom
the Divine Promise had ensured a Kingdom; and yet was he by the <hi>Sycophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
and little <hi>Shammes</hi> rais'd against him by <hi>Saul</hi>'s great Courtiers, wrought
to so high a pitch of anger, that he did with exquisite forms of <hi>imprecation,</hi>
and such as perhaps are not to be found in any other Story, frequently devote
those Calumniators to the most dire Miseries his fancy could lead him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.
But the Cause of his being so highly provoked by those <hi>that would
turn his glory into shame, and did seek after leasing, and whose deceitful tongues
used all-devouring words, as he saith to</hi> Doeg <hi>the</hi> Edomite <hi>in one of his Psalms,
(and whose tongue he there sayes did devise mischiefs, like a sharp razor working
deceitfully</hi>) may be ascribed to the <hi>Shammes</hi> of his Enemies wounding him in
the most <hi>sensible</hi> Part, namely the Reputation of his <hi>Loyalty</hi> to his <hi>Prince,</hi>
whose Life he spared when 'twas in his power to destroy him, and who was
so far from the use of Shammes against him, that he doom'd the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite</hi>
to dy, that shamm'd himself the author of <hi>Saul</hi>'s death.</p>
            <p>And therefore No marvel if the Calumnies of Jesuited Papists attaquing
Protestants in that Case too of their Fidelity to their King, render the passion
of anger in them against those Shams so intense and vehement. And tho
the <hi>English</hi> Courage or a very little Philosophy would help them to bestow
only a generous neglect on other Calumnies, they can never forget those that
strike at the heart of their allegiance, and consequently of their Religion that
so strictly enjoyns it. Nor if according to the Example of that <hi>great man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gods heart,</hi> who said, <hi>Away from me all ye that work vanity,</hi> and who would
have <hi>No lyer tarry in his sight,</hi> is it to be admired if every true <hi>English</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103047:84"/>
shall say too, <hi>odi Ecclesiam malignantium,</hi> and shall feclude all <hi>dictators</hi>
of Calumny from his company, and banish them home to their own.</p>
            <p>And tho the abuse of Excommunication by the Papal Church and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
hath been so horrid, that the primitive use of it is in a manner lost and
grown obsolete, yet will that which includes somewhat of the Nature of it
be still kept alive in the World by <hi>private</hi> persons who practice the Christian
Religion they profess, (and to whom tho the Precepts of the New Testament
have not given that hateful thing to humane Nature in charge, namely to be
Informers, or Promoters, or judicial accusers of any of Mankind, accordingly
as under the <hi>Mosaic</hi> oeconomy 'twas said, <hi>Tu non eris criminator,</hi> yet have
they obliged them <hi>to withdraw themselves from men of corrupt minds, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the truth, and not to eat with any one who is call'd a Brother and is a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and to turn away from men that are truce-breakers, and to mark those who
cause divisions, and to avoid them, and to reject a Heretic who is subverted and
self-condemned,</hi>) and by men of Cultivated educations and tempers, who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
themselves on the Company they keep, and on it are valued by the
World, and will therefore abandon or excommunicate from their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
such <hi>Monsters</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> who have renounced the obligations of humane
society, and who are guilty of Notorious <hi>Contumacy</hi> in matters that concern the
very Salvation of Souls, and the Safety of Kingdoms. The being <hi>staked</hi> down
therefore to a Narrower <hi>Tedder</hi> in Conversation, or being Civilly Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
from Protestants Company, must by necessity of Nature, in my
opinion, be the <hi>fate</hi> of our Jesuited <hi>make-bates</hi> and <hi>criminators</hi> of Protestants
that have been so unweary'd in raising Jealousies between the King and his
People, and between Protestant and Protestant; and all such that go to part
<hi>whom God and Nature and Interest have joyn'd,</hi> will probably come at last to
be the <hi>derelicts</hi> of humane Society when they shall Come to be <hi>understood,</hi>
and especially when there shall be that good <hi>understanding</hi> between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
here of several persuasions that may be expected to arise from their
having found out the authors of their divisions, and seen how ridiculous <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
have been in the view of the World while they have appear'd like the
<hi>Cat</hi> to draw one another through the Pool, and the Jesuits and their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
stood behind undiscern'd, and pull'd the Rope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I know we may justly fear that <hi>Popery</hi> may during some <hi>turbid</hi>
intervals gain ground in <hi>England,</hi> and as the Renowned Historian of our
Reformation hath in a public Sermon Judiciously observed, that <hi>Sure none
believed themselves when they say we are not in danger of Popery, and none can
think it but they who desire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But without presuming to make my self one of Heavens Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and without pretending to a spirit of Prophecy, I shall on the <hi>basis</hi> of
the Course of Nature ground this affirmation, <hi>That whatever alterations Time
can Cause, yet while the</hi> English <hi>Nation remains entire and defended from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Conquest, the Protestant Religion Can never be exterminated out of this
Kingdom, nor the public profession of it suffer any long interruption therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will grant it possible that hereafter under a Prince of the Popish Religion,
Popery may like the <hi>vibration</hi> of a <hi>pendulum</hi> among Certain persons have the
greater extent in the return of it, as <hi>Becket's Image</hi> was by <hi>Gardiner</hi> set up
in <hi>London</hi>

its being pull'd down in <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth's, and himself unsainted, and some
people may undertake devout Pilgrimages hereafter to some such Images and
Reliques as my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> saith were in <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth's <hi>time exploded,</hi>
and we may again hear of our <hi>Lady's Girdle shewn in eleven several places, and her

Canterbury, <hi>and a piece of his Shirt much reverenc'd by great belly'd women; the

Ear, and the paring of</hi> St. Edmund'<hi>s Nails, and likewise the trumperies of the

                  </gap>
as trumperies</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 495, and 496, by <hi>Herbert</hi> in that <hi>History,</hi> and as <hi>adjudged</hi>
to be such by <hi>H.</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no doubt but the Number of such would be very great, who having
great Summs of Money given them, would be content to offer small ones in
Devotion to such Images; and many Candidates for preferment, among some
that now look big for, and among Dissenters that look big against the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> would produce <hi>Certificates</hi> of their <hi>Constant good affection
and Zeal</hi> for the Roman Catholic Church; and any <hi>Legate</hi> that came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
us to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would be thought by many to have brought
the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> in his <hi>Sumpters,</hi> thô we know what the Inside of <hi>Campegius</hi>
his was made of.</p>
            <p>It is moreover possible that Protestant writers may come not to have that
freedom of the Press that Popish now have, and all the luxury and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and humor of the Press in sending forth innumerable Pamphlets against
Popery, in this Conjuncture, may perhaps prove but like the jollity of a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nival</hi>
to usher in a long melancholly <hi>Lent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will grant, that 'tis possible the Writ <hi>de haeretico Comburendo</hi> being now
Abolished that destroyed so many Protestants by <hi>retail,</hi> certain bloody men
may find some Invention to destroy them by <hi>wholesale,</hi> and to something of
that nature Bishop <hi>Vshers</hi> Prophecy referred, of the Raging Persecution of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
yet to come and not lasting, and when their enemies will <hi>ipsam saevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
fatigare:</hi> and in the <hi>violence</hi> of such predicted cruelty not being <hi>long
lasting,</hi> that great Prelate erred not from the Nature of things more then he
did when he Prophecy'd of an <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion Forty years before it hapned,
for that usually happens once in so many years through the force and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Irish</hi> within that time outgrowing the <hi>English,</hi> and their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves the repossession of their Estates by that time as a <hi>Iubile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will further grant, that the <hi>discipline</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> (of which I think
the <hi>Constitution</hi> is the best that the world can shew) may be Crusht, as I said
before, and our <hi>Dissenters</hi> then in vain wish that they had the <hi>tolerabiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eptiae</hi>
(as your Lordship knows who imperiously call'd them) in the
Room of the intollerable abominations of the Mass; and <hi>'tis possible</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> may permit the doctrine as well as discipline of our
Church to be supprest totally and finally in this Realm, and that the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of that Great <hi>Man of God</hi> whô since his death has been as generally
styl'd <hi>the Iudicious,</hi> as <hi>Lewis the Iust</hi> was elsewhere so vogued (I mean Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi>) may impress a deep horror and a too late repentance on us, who in
his 5th <hi>Book of Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> in the end of the 79th <hi>Paragraph p.</hi> 432.
of the <hi>old Edition,</hi> speaking of the ill affected to our Church, saith, <hi>By these
or the like suggestions receiv'd with all Ioy and with all sedulity practiced in Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
parts of the Christian World, they have brought to pass that as</hi> David <hi>doth
say of Man, so it is in hazard to be verify'd concerning the whole Religion and
Service of God, the time thereof peradventure may fall out to be Threescore and
Ten years, or if strength do serve, unto Fourscore: what follows, is likely to be
small joy to them whatsoever they shall be that behold it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> did first
print his 5th <hi>Book</hi> in the year 1597. (the first four of his <hi>Polity</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
printed in the year 1594) and so the <hi>period</hi> of <hi>Fourscore Years</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
was in the <hi>Year</hi> 1677.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:103047:85"/>
Thô that good man pretended not to be a Prophet, yet according to the
old saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> i. e. <hi>he is the best Prophet who can
guess well,</hi> both our <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> too
have found that Mr. <hi>Hookers prudence</hi> had so much <hi>divination,</hi> and his <hi>divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
so much prudence, that the small joy with which they have beheld the
external face of Religion here since 1677. hath shew'd us that he <hi>guess'd</hi>
shrewdly.</p>
            <p>I have only affirm'd, that <hi>humanly speaking,</hi> and according to the common
<hi>course</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> Popery cannot be the overgrown <hi>National Religion</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but am not ignorant that the <hi>sacred Code</hi> hath given us instances of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
<hi>power</hi> punishing even Heavens <hi>peculiar</hi> people by the Course
of Political and Ecclesiastical Power running out of the common Channel of
the <hi>Nature</hi> of things, and particularly by a succession of Ten evil Kings one
after another. For thô humane Nature is so inconstant, and men generally
so apt to reel from one extream to another, that the World growes as weary
of the prevalence of Vice as of Virtue, and after a long age of Dissoluteness
and <hi>Luxury,</hi> a Contrary humour reigns as long in the World again, a humour
that then excludes all <hi>Voluptuaries</hi> from Public Trusts for an Age together;
(and a humour of which I think we now see the Tide Coming in) and thus
ordinarily scarce any Kingdom hath more than two or three good or bad
Princes successively for any considerable space of time; Yet after the <hi>Ten
Tribes</hi> had made their <hi>defection</hi> from the Line of the House of <hi>David,</hi> they
were punish't by a Succession of Ten Kings, and not one good one in the
whole number, thô some of them were less ill than others; so that no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
if the <hi>weight</hi> of the impiety of so <hi>many</hi> successive ill Princes sunk them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the power of the <hi>Assyrians:</hi> and to this their doom, that passage in the
<hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Hosea</hi> refers, which the vulgus of the <hi>Scriblers</hi> against <hi>Monarchy</hi> so
Miserably detort and <hi>wracke</hi> (as I may say) <hi>to their own destruction,</hi> namely,
<hi>I gave thee a King in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath;</hi> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
there had not his Eye on <hi>Saul,</hi> or on a particular Person, but on the
whole succession of <hi>Kings</hi> after their Rent from <hi>Iuda,</hi> from <hi>Ieroboam</hi> to the
Last under whom the Catastrophe of their Captivity was. Such Kings were
given them by Heaven as were proper Instruments of <hi>Divine</hi> wrath; and
when they were took away from the Stage, 'twas that other worse might
enter and make their Condition more Tragical.</p>
            <p>But <hi>secret things belonging to God,</hi> I pry not into the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
my sentiments alone to the Book of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an <hi>Excellent Sermon</hi> of the <hi>Dean</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> 'tis with great Piety and
Prudence said, <hi>We have liv'd in an Age that has beheld strange Revolutions,
astonishing Iudgments, and wonderful Deliverances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What all the Fermentations that are still among us may end in, God alone
knowes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I only as a Philosopher Considering that the Properties of humane Passions
have as Necessary effects in Minds, as gravity or lightness have in Bodies,
and that let men intend what</hi> male administration <hi>they</hi> will, things <hi>will not
be</hi> ill administred, <hi>do think that the</hi> fermentation <hi>now in the Kingdome will
not</hi> end <hi>but with Popery it self here</hi> ending. <hi>And that I may not seem to stand</hi>
alone <hi>in this my opinion, I shall entertain your Lordship with that of An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi>
Philosopher <hi>and</hi> Divine, <hi>the</hi> Author of the History of the Royal Society,
<hi>who there having said,</hi> that experimental Philosophy will enable us to provide
before-hand against any alteration in Religious affairs which this Age may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
<hi>he goes on thus,</hi> If we Compare the changes to which Religion has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
subject with the present face of things, we may safely conclude, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Vicissitude shall happen about it in our time, it will probably be neither to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103047:85"/>
the advantage of implicit Faith, nor of Enthusiasme, but of Reason: the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of violent inspiration is in good Measure departed: the Remains of it will be
soon chaced out of the World, by the Remembrance of its terrible footsteps it has
every where left behind it.</p>
            <p>And although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> still preserves its Pomp, yet the Real au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of that too is apparently decaying. It first got by degrees to the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Power, by means of its Spiritual, but now it upholds some shadow of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
by the strength of the Temporal dominion it has obtain'd. This is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of Christendome: It is impossible to spread the same Cloud over the
World again.</p>
            <p>The Vniversal disposition of this Age is bent upon a Rational Religion. And
therefore I Renew my affectionate request, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> would
Provide to have the chief share in its first adventure, that it would persist as
it has begun to encourage Experiments which will be to our Church as the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Oake is to our Empire, an Ornament and Defence to the Soil wherein 'tis
planted.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Author</hi> therefore with such Vigour of Reason passing his sentence
concerning any Vicissitudes here not happening that will probably Conduce
to the <hi>advantage</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> I hope your Lordship will acquit
me both of <hi>Singularity</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> as to the <hi>opinion</hi> I have given, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since I only profess it to be founded on Natural Reason, and do only
Consider the <hi>God of Nature,</hi> when I think that a <hi>Religion</hi> that is <hi>of God will
stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not unknown to Your Lordship, that <hi>Columbus</hi> being in chace of the
<hi>New World,</hi> and Cast among some barbarous <hi>Ilanders</hi> that deny'd him the
<hi>hospitality</hi> of their <hi>Port,</hi> and freedom of Commerce, he Knowing that they
worshipt the <hi>Moon,</hi> and that it would shortly be <hi>Eclips'd,</hi> thô he was neither
<hi>Prophet nor Prophet's Son,</hi> aw'd them out of their inhumanity, by <hi>foretelling</hi>
that the <hi>Moons</hi> deity would be shortly obscur'd: and when ever I acquaint
any Roman Catholics with my Judgment of the Nearness of their Religion
to an <hi>Eclipse,</hi> I intend no more enthusiasme in my prediction, then <hi>Columbus</hi>
did in his, and design nothing worse neither by mine then he by his, namely
the reconciling them to humanity and a fair entercourse with Mankind.</p>

Church of <hi>Alexandrias's</hi> Mathematicians for directions as to the week <hi>Easter</hi>
was to be kept in.</p>
            <p>And during this long <hi>night,</hi> Millions of mankind were brought into the
World only to sleep out their span of time, and to have day-dreams of
Knowledge, or rather a profound <hi>Docta Ignorantia;</hi> and men were by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
rewarded proportionably for their sleeping longest: according to what
the <hi>Chronicon Frideswidae</hi> mentions of <hi>Guimundus</hi> a <hi>Chaplain</hi> to our King
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> who in the Celebration of holy offices reading before the

why he red so, he answered <hi>quia vos in ita tantum legentes beneficia

            </p>
            <p>No marvel then if during that <hi>long</hi> gross and palpable Darkness of the
World, the <hi>Pope travesty'd</hi> those words in <hi>Scripture</hi> about Gods <hi>making the
two great lights,</hi> to serve his turn against the <hi>Emperor,</hi> thô yet the attempt to
prove the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy out of the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> is as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
as his who would prove the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the blood out of the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Litleton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Roman <hi>Breviary</hi> tell's us of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> very <hi>gravely,</hi> that when
once he was vehement in prayer before a <hi>Crucifix</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> he heard this
voice <hi>bene de me scripsisti Thoma,</hi> none likewise in that age <hi>laught</hi> at the Pope
for saying <hi>bene de me scripsisti Moses.</hi> The world then brought no <hi>quo warranto</hi>
against the Popes <hi>Charter</hi> derived thus in his Canon Law from <hi>Moses,</hi> nor
that <hi>gloss</hi> on it which says <hi>Since the Earth is seven times bigger then the Moon,
and the Sun eight times bigger then the Earth, the Papal Power must Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be fifty seven times bigger then the Regal dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>English</hi> World will no more allow of the logical Consequence of that
<hi>doughty</hi> argument of <hi>Bellarmine (Lib. 1. de Pont.</hi> ca. 2. <hi>sect. denique, &amp; sect. sed.)
There is one King among Bees, therefore there ought to be one Commander, chief
Teacher and visible Monarch in the Vniversal Church,</hi> then they would allow
that <hi>argument</hi> of the <hi>Bees</hi> to give our neighbour Monarch a right to an <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi>
Temporal Monarchy. The Popes vociferating of that Text <hi>Behold
two Swords,</hi> and while their adherents held so many Thousands in their hands,
might then pass muster for as good an argument of his <hi>right</hi> to Spiritual and
Civil power, as the words, that <hi>the Lillies spin not,</hi> did for the <hi>Salic</hi> Law with
the help of another Army then one of <hi>Commentators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Renewall</hi> of the Popes <hi>Charter</hi> by <hi>Pasce oves,</hi> was not then disallowed
either for the <hi>fleecing</hi> of many <hi>Millions</hi> of Christians or killing some <hi>hundreds
of thousands</hi> in the <hi>German Empire,</hi> according to what has been observed by
the <hi>famous Erastus</hi> in his <hi>Theses,</hi> p. 72. <hi>&amp; propter excommunicatos Imperatores
&amp; Reges, aliquot Centena millia hominum trucidata sunt in imperio Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:103047:86"/>
And perhaps the <hi>Popes plea</hi> for making the <hi>World</hi> a great <hi>Slaughter-house,</hi>
might then be admitted by the authority of the <hi>Text, Arise</hi> Peter, <hi>kill and
eat.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Conculcabis super aspidem &amp; basilicum</hi> then went for a claim of Divine Right,
to make the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> to be trampled on by the <hi>foot</hi> of a bald-pated
Fryar.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Papacy,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> that was in the World <hi>then was darkness</hi> (as the
Scripture Expression is,) <hi>How great was that darkness!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Popes continued <hi>art</hi> was then to Conceal <hi>Nature,</hi> so 'twas not

the honour of the <hi>light that rules by day,</hi> if he could have <hi>illuminated</hi> the

<hi>Hobbs,</hi> have <hi>wooed</hi> with very great <hi>passion</hi> and could not <hi>enjoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But during the <hi>Egyptian plague</hi> of <hi>darkness</hi> that many Ages then lay under,
our famous Countreyman <hi>Wicliff</hi> alarm'd the Lethargic World: and he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail'd
several gross Errors of Popery with its own weapons of <hi>Metaphysics</hi> and
School Divinity, and by means of the noise his Two hundred Volumes made
in the World, he dispers'd a great <hi>terror</hi> in that dark Age; and as one saith,
Sir <hi>Iohn Old-Castle,</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and the <hi>Lollards being awaken'd out of
their first sleep, were desirous to rise before it was day, and before the appointed
time was Come for the Reforming the abuses in the Church: and between that
time and morning, most men fell asleep again as fast as ever:</hi> but yet long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>dawn</hi> of the Reformation, the doctrine of <hi>Wicliffe</hi> had made such a
<hi>fermentation</hi> in our <hi>English</hi> World, that in the <hi>Year</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1422, that
great States-man <hi>Chichley</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in a <hi>Letter</hi> to Pope <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the Fifth, Complain'd, <hi>That there were then so many here in</hi> England <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the heresies of</hi> Wicliff <hi>and</hi> Husse, <hi>that without force of an Army they
could not be supprest:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Pope</hi> sent two Cardinals to the Arch-Bishop
to Cause a <hi>Tenth</hi> to be gather'd of all Spiritual and Religious men,
and the money to be Laid in the Chamber Apostolic; and if that were not
sufficient, the residue to be made up of Chalices, Candlestics, and other imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Church, as the <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> Attest.</p>
            <p>And it is not unknown, that long before, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Harry</hi> the Fifth's time,
<hi>Chichley</hi> foreseeing that a Storm was coming from the <hi>Commons</hi> on Church-Lands,
diverted it, by engaging <hi>England</hi> in its darling popular War with
<hi>France,</hi> and caus'd the <hi>Clergy</hi> to contribute very liberally to it.</p>
            <p>But that fermentation that <hi>Chichley</hi> said could not in the Year 1422 be
checkt in peoples Minds otherwise then as aforesaid, soon out-grew the power
of any Army to allay; for in less than Thirty years afterward, the <hi>Invention</hi> of
<hi>Printing</hi> came into the World, by which one man could transmit more
notices of things in a Day, then another could by writing in a Year, and which
did as much out-do the publication of notions by the Goosquill, as the
<hi>invention</hi> of <hi>Gun-powder</hi> did the killing Force of the <hi>gray-goose-wing,</hi> and which
did, as it were, revive the old <hi>Miracle</hi> of the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> (and <hi>Cloven</hi> too I
may Call them, for their being <hi>divided</hi> from the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of the Papal
Holy Church) and made Learning begin to <hi>fly</hi> like <hi>lightning</hi> through the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103047:87"/>
World to the Controuling and detecting of the Popes Excommunicating
Thunder, and which shew'd the World its true face in the stream of time,
and shew'd the greet <hi>Fisherman</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> dancing in the Nett, and which was
the true <hi>speaking</hi> Trumpet, whereby a single Author could preach to the <hi>dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi>
of the World.</p>
            <p>And that great birth of Fate the taking of <hi>Constantinople</hi> within three
years after the <hi>Invention</hi> of Printing, occasioning the World's acquiring the
knowledge in the <hi>West</hi> that it lost in the <hi>East,</hi> and dispersing the <hi>Learned</hi>
Greeks, <hi>Theodore Gaza, Iohn Lascaris, Manuel Chrysaloras,</hi> and many others
to teach the Greek Tongue where they went, the <hi>Press</hi> was thereby fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
with <hi>Glad</hi> tidings for the Curious World, and <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and many
learned Papists, did soon imbibe the knowledge of that learned Language,
and he complained in a Letter to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Mentz, That the Friars
would fain have made it Heresy to speak Greek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So pleasant was it then to consider that that barbarous Generation instead
of knowing Heresy to be <hi>Greek,</hi> voted <hi>Greek</hi> to be Heresy, and that they
who had murdered so many thousands for being <hi>Heretics,</hi> knew not what
the very word in its original language imported.</p>
            <p>The Sagacity of <hi>Erasmus</hi> could not then but easily see through the <hi>Cobwebs</hi>
of the <hi>School-Divines: totam Theologiam a Capite usque ad Calcem retexuerunt,
&amp; ex divina Sophisticam fecerunt aut Aristotelicam,</hi> saith he <hi>in vitâ Hier. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixâ
ipsius operibus. And Doctor</hi> Colet <hi>the Dean of St. Paules, (whom</hi> Erasmus
<hi>often</hi> in his <hi>Epistles</hi> calls <hi>praeceptorem unicum &amp; optimum</hi>) did as <hi>Erasmus</hi>
saith in his <hi>life,</hi> account <hi>the Scotists dull Fellows and any thing rather then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
and yet he had a worse opinion of</hi> Aquinas <hi>then of Scotus.</hi> And tho
<hi>Luther</hi> had angred <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th. by speaking contemptibly of <hi>Thomas
Aquinas</hi> whom that King so highly magnifyed that he was call'd <hi>Rex Thomisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
Collet</hi> was not afraid to Pronounce in that case as <hi>Luther</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And here it may not by the way be unworthy of your Lordships observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as to the <hi>concert</hi> that is between the <hi>Genius</hi> of one great <hi>Witt</hi> and another,
that <hi>Erasmus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had the same sense of School-Divinity and School-Divines:
For Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in his <hi>Behemoth or History of the Civil-Wars</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> saith, <hi>That any ingenious Reader not knowing
what was the designe of School-Divinity</hi> (which he had before siad was with
unintelligible distinctions to blind Men's eyes while it encroach'd on the
Rights of Kings) <hi>would judge them to have been two the most egregious block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
in the World, so obscure and sensless are their Writings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>New Testament</hi> was no sooner open'd and read then in <hi>Erasmus</hi> his
translation and in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, but the Popes <hi>Cards</hi> were by the
Clergy that playd his game thrown up as to all claim of more Power here
by the word of God then every other forreign Bishop had; and both our
Universities sent their judgments about the same to the King, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
might make our Papists approach a little nearer to us without fear of
infection; for we allow the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to have as much Power by the
Word of God as any other <hi>Bishop;</hi> and 'tis pitty but that Judgment of our
Universities were shewn the World in Print, and sent to the <hi>French</hi> King, and
particularly the <hi>Rescript</hi> or <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any where in Print (that I know of) but in an old Book of Dr. <hi>Iames</hi>'s
against <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel</hi> the <hi>Vicegerent</hi> to <hi>H.</hi> the 8th. had (as <hi>Fuller</hi> saith in his <hi>Church-history)
got the whole New-Testament of</hi> Erasmus <hi>his translation by heart:</hi> but
the sore Eyes of many of the Clergy were so offended with the <hi>glaring</hi>-Light
the New-Testament in Print brought every where, that instead of Studying
it as that great <hi>Primier Ministre</hi> did, they only study'd to suppress it: and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103047:87"/>
thus <hi>Buchanan</hi> in his <hi>Scotch History</hi> saith that in <hi>H.</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> time, <hi>

writ a <hi>model</hi> of <hi>Doctrines</hi> against <hi>Iustification</hi> by works, and <hi>redeeming</hi> our
vexation from wrath divine by Summs of Mony, and against implicit <hi>Faith</hi>
and many gross Papal Errors, he could not possibly have writ against them
<hi>in terminis terminantibus</hi> more expresly then the Writers of the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
did.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>New Testament</hi> was then <hi>newly</hi> opened, and the <hi>legatees</hi> permitted
to read the whole <hi>Will</hi> over translated into a language they understood, after
they had been long by fraud and force kept out of their <hi>legacies</hi> by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

<hi>Will:</hi> and that inestimable <hi>legacy</hi> of <hi>liberty</hi> from all impositions humane
being particularly shewn to Mankind, there was no taking their Eyes off
from this <hi>Will,</hi> nor taking it out of their hands, nor suppressing the study
of the <hi>Greek</hi> language it was originally writ in.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> had received his Legacy thereby, who before was but
a <hi>Royal Slave</hi> to the Pope; and the triumph of an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> was eccho'd round his
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> like that of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> when he had detected the <hi>Imposture</hi> that
had mingled so much dross in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Crown.</p>
            <p>'Tis true he retained the profession of several Papal Errors, and such as he
being vers'd in School-Divinity knew would still keep themselves in play in
the World with a <hi>videtur quod sic, &amp; probatur quod non,</hi> accordingly as the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> therefore did in his Contest with the Papacy <hi>Ferire faciem,</hi>
and <hi>did fight neither against small and great but the King of Rome,</hi> as I may say.
He attaqued the Pope in his claim of authority over all Christians, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

            </p>
            <p>'<hi>Tis therefore very well said in a</hi> Book <hi>call'd</hi> Considerations touching the true
way to suppress Popery in <hi>England,</hi> Printed for Mr. <hi>Broome</hi> in the Year 1677;
Whatever notions we have of Popery in other things, the Pope himself is not so fond
of them, but that to gain the point of authority, he can either connive, or abate, or
part with them wholy: though no doubt he never doth it but insidiously, as well
knowing that whatever consession he makes for the establishing his authority, he
may afterward revoke, <hi>&amp;c. And so the Author saith,</hi> p. 12. That <hi>Harry</hi> the
8<hi>th</hi> for having cast of his obedience to <hi>Rome</hi> was therefore judged a heretic, and
that was look't on by <hi>Rome</hi> as worse than if he had rejected all its errors together.
He was a thorough Papist in all points but only that of obedience, in comparison of
which all the rest are but talk.</p>
            <p>I account therefore in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> time Poperies most <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>vital</hi>
part, viz. the <hi>Popes supremacy</hi> did end in <hi>England per simplicem desinentiam.</hi>
The radical heat and moisture it long before had was gone: like a <hi>senex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontanus</hi>
it was held useless in a wise <hi>Senate.</hi> He establish't the doctrine of his
own supremacy without a Battel fought, nor did any Rebellion rise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
but what he confounded with a general Pardon.</p>
            <p>Many of the Scholars of the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> did <hi>mutinously</hi> oppose
the introducing the knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue there, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
call'd <hi>Trojans,</hi> and others of the Schollars were as <hi>rohust</hi> and loud for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103047:88"/>
that Language, who were therefore called <hi>Graecians:</hi> but by a <hi>Letter</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it by
<hi>Sir Thomas More</hi> to that University and by the Kings Command (which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

admonished to lay by those names of <hi>distinction,</hi> and likewise all <hi>animosity</hi>
against the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, and to encourage the learning of the same, it
was there at last peaceably receiv'd.</p>
            <p>The day-break of learning then in the world had put a period to the
<hi>night</hi> of ignorance in which the Beasts of Prey had domineer'd, and to their
Monastic <hi>denns</hi> themselves. The enlighten'd part of mankind was weary of
growing pale among papers and sometimes red hot with arguing about <hi>terms</hi>
of <hi>art</hi> (and all those barbarous too, that had formerly hid the God of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
and would no longer account <hi>implicit</hi> faith the only <hi>justifying</hi> one, and
could not more esteem the imposing of such a <hi>blind</hi> faith commendable that
was made previous to mens quest after <hi>pabulum</hi> for their Souls, then that
practice of the <hi>boy</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> who did put out the eyes of birds, and then expose
them to fly abroad for food.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Learning</hi> then introduced into the world shew'd that the hierarchical
<hi>grandeur</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was not extant formerly in the learned times
when the old Roman Empire flourish'd, but was contrived in the times of
ignorance between the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Leaders or Princes of the
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> and that it had its beginning from the Inundations of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
people (so that with Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> leave by the way, <hi>Popery</hi> may be
call'd too a pestilent <hi>Northern heresy</hi>) and that to the end that those <hi>Barbarians</hi>
might not find out the original of the papal power, and see how narrow the
stream of it was at its fountain when every Bishop was call'd <hi>Papa</hi> (as
every woman is now with us call'd <hi>Madam</hi> and <hi>Lady</hi>) that the <hi>Pope</hi> by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
the <hi>Emperors</hi> power effected a strangeness between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Latines,</hi> by means whereof the <hi>Barbarians</hi> being brought up in prejudice
against the <hi>Graecians</hi> neglected their Language, to the decay whereof in the
world not only the decay of the purity of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue may be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but also of <hi>History, Geography, Geometry, skill in antiquity,</hi> and even
the worlds not knowingly then conversing with the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers.</p>
            <p>It was in an age of <hi>non-sense</hi> when a <hi>Canonist</hi> venturing to be a Critic told
the world concerning the Greek word <hi>Allegoria, istud vocabulum fit ex duobus
vocabulis; ab allo, quod est alienum, &amp; goro sensus;</hi> and when an old <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Thomas de Argentina,</hi> thus gave the derivation of <hi>latria, istud vocabulum
fit ex duobus vocabulis, à La, quod est laus, &amp; tria, quod est trinitas: quia la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,
est laus trinitatis.</hi> But the very understanding of two ordinary
Greek words, namely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>equal priviledges</hi> in ecclesiastical matters
to the <hi>Bishops of Rome and Constantinople</hi> allow'd by a General Councel, that
were obvious to every enquirer into <hi>history,</hi> did quite <hi>blow</hi> up all pretences of
the Popes <hi>supremacy;</hi> and one <hi>versicle</hi> in that long unknown <hi>Greek Book</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
viz. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. which shews, <hi>that the teaching of Repentance and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins in the name of Christ by his own order began at Ierusalem,</hi> did sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<hi>thinking</hi> men with amazement, when they heard a <hi>Pope</hi> and General <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi>
calling <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Mother and Mistress of all the Churches, and anathematising
all who think otherwise,</hi> and saying further <hi>extra hanc fidem nemo potest esse sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi>
for this the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel did.</p>
            <p>Thus then the abolition of the papal power here brought the world at the
first step out of a blind <hi>Chaos</hi> into a <hi>Paradise</hi> of Knowledge, and help'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to demonstrate to themselves and to Jews, and Pagans the truth of the
Christian Religion, for the certainty of the doctrine of which during that
time of papal darkness the world had only the assertion of the present age
that call'd it self the <hi>tradition</hi> of the Church; but by the introduction of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103047:88"/>
               <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue and other learning, Christians had the sense of the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latine Fathers,</hi> and those <hi>historical Records</hi> that brought down to them the
certainty of the Miracles that were wrought in the founding of Christianity;
from the Primitive Christians, who saw them. 'Twas the restoration of learning
in general, help'd them to say with <hi>Tertullian fidem colimus rationalem,</hi> and with
St. <hi>Paul, I know whom I have believed,</hi> and without the introducing of humane
learning, the Protestant Religion could no more have been advanced to its
height in the world, then men can be perfected in <hi>Astronomy</hi> without the
knowledge of <hi>Arithmetic. Luther</hi> came into the field arm'd with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues, when he was to contest with the
Errors of the Papacy; and he having for his Antagonist Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi>
who was the Legate in <hi>Germany</hi> and an eminent School Divine, and who
made a home thrust at <hi>Luther</hi> out of the Scripture according to the <hi>Vulgar</hi>
Latine translation, <hi>Luther</hi> told him in plain terms, That that translation,
was false and dissonant to the original: and hereupon the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> thô he
and the Papacy too had one foot in the grave, <hi>Cato</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>like fell eagerly on the
studying of <hi>Greek,</hi> that he might be able so confute <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers
out of the Scriptures, and was put to it to make his weapon when he was in
the field.</p>
            <p>And can any one think now that in this present state of <hi>England,</hi> when we
see so many that are Critical Masters of Experimental Philosophy, and who
by means of the great useful pains formerly taken by <hi>Erasmus,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas
Moore</hi> and others, in restoring Philological Learning, have now entire lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to devote their Studies to the substantial Knowledge of <hi>things,</hi> and
whose Motto is, <hi>Nullius in verba,</hi> and who know, that if they would have
every one trust them, they must take nothing on trust from any one;
and who know, that since truth doth always sail in sight of error, they must all
the way go <hi>sounding</hi> by <hi>experiment;</hi> I say, can any one think that it was
less easie for the <hi>Sun</hi> to go back Ten degrees on <hi>Ahaz</hi> his <hi>Dial,</hi> then 'tis to
make this Age run back to implicit faith and ignorance and barbarisme?</p>
            <p>And is it to be thought that men who weigh <hi>Silver</hi> in Scales, will not
weigh <hi>Gold;</hi> I mean, not examine notions of Religion with care, when they
are so cautious in others? Can we think that men who will not part with
those Notions that <hi>salve</hi> the <hi>phaenomena,</hi> will quit those that <hi>save</hi> their <hi>Souls,</hi>
and especially considering the proverbial addiction of the English <hi>genius</hi> to
Religion, and considering too, that men by long use and Custom have been
habituated to the profession of a rational Religion, and that it can plead
here a hundred years prescription?</p>
            <p>It is certainly more easie to unteach men the use of the <hi>Sea-Compass</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi>
then the use of Reason in Religion; and the inclination of the
Needle to the <hi>North,</hi> is not likely to be more durable then the tendency of
mens affection in <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Northern heresy</hi> so call'd; and it is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to teach all Mankind the use of Letters, then to unteach it to any one
man; and when the temper of an inquisitive Age is like a <hi>Trade-wind</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men toward Knowledge and toward a rational Divinity, they may by
some accidents be made to cast Anchor, or they may be sunk, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be forced to go back.</p>
            <p>When a man hath long been compell'd to creep with Chains on him
through a toilsome dark <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> and having extricated himself out of it
and being come to enjoy his liberty in the light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the persuasion of
words cannot make him go back again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I lately mentioned the <hi>Motto</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
of which your Lordship is a Member, and I look on the very constitution of
that <hi>Society</hi> to be an inexpugnable <hi>Bulwark</hi> against Popery: In which <hi>Society</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:103047:89"/>
many of our choice <hi>English Witts</hi> have shew'd as much subtilty and curiosity
in the Architecture of <hi>Real</hi> Science, and such as tends to the edification of
the world, as any of our Countrey men heretofore did in those curious but
useless Cobwebs of holy Church call'd School Divinity.</p>
            <p>And the constitution of that <hi>Society</hi> hath not only been useful in encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Trade of Knowledge among its members by a joyned stock, but
moreover hath tended to the raising in the Kingdom a general inclination to
pursue <hi>Real</hi> science, and to contemn all <hi>science falsly so call'd:</hi> and the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of this inclination I will call a <hi>Spirit</hi> that can never be <hi>Conjur'd</hi> down,
nor can the knowledge that depends on number, weight and local Motion,
be ever <hi>exterminated</hi> by <hi>Sophisms</hi> or <hi>Canting,</hi> or <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Art;</hi> Nor will they
who have from this <hi>Society</hi> learned to <hi>weigh</hi> Ayre, give up their Souls to any
Religion that is all <hi>Ayre</hi> without <hi>weighing</hi> it, or (notwithstanding any hard
name that may come to be in <hi>vogue</hi>) ever forget that <hi>bread</hi> is <hi>bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Majesty</hi> by the founding of this great Conservatory of knowledge
presently after his Restoration (wherein his great <hi>Minister</hi> then the <hi>Earl
of Clarendon,</hi> was an honourable Member) did convey real knowledge and
a demonstration of his being an Abhorrer of Arbitrary Power, to all that
can understand Reason, and affect not the ridiculous Treasonableness of <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>'s
Court, to say, <hi>that they will not hear reason;</hi> for had he like the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi>
King's affected Arbitrary Power, he would have used their artifice
of endeavouring to cast mists before the understanding faculties of his
Subjects, and to detain them from knowledge by admiration, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of <hi>sight,</hi> like horses that are still to drudge in the <hi>Mill</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by blind obedience; But to shew that he abhorr'd both such obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and implicit Faith, and that he intended to establish his Throne as well
in the heads as in the hearts of his Subjects, he presently setled this Great
Store-house of Knowledge, that shew'd it was his desire and ambition by the
general Communication of Knowledge in his Dominions, to Command
Subjects whose heads were with the <hi>Rays</hi> of <hi>Science</hi> crown'd within.</p>
            <p>And therefore I think His Majesties Munificence to the Royal Society in
giving them <hi>Chelsey-Colledge</hi> at their first institution, was very Consistent
with the Primary Intention of the erecting that <hi>Colledge,</hi> which was to be a
Magazine for Polemical-Divinity wherewith to attaque the Writers for Popery:
for the very planting of a general disposition to believe nothing contrary to
Reason, is the cutting of the gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s under Poperies feet; and His Majesty
providing for the growth of reason did apparently check the growth of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
as well as of Arbitrary Power, without the <hi>prop</hi> of which, Popery
can never run up to any height more then the <hi>Sun-flower</hi> without a supporter:
and the setling in men an humour of <hi>Inquisition</hi> into the truth and nature of
things is, as I partly said before, an everlasting barricade against the Popes
darling Court of the <hi>Inquisition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That great and noble notion of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>blood,</hi> took its first
rise from the hints of a common persons enquiring what became of all the

               </gap>d out of the heart, seeing that the heart beats above Three
Thousand times an hour, thô but one drop should be pump'd out at every
stroke: and if any one shall tell me that he believes that Popery with its reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of implicit faith and ignorance can over-run us, I will ask him what
will then become of all that knowledge the vital blood of the Soul, that
hath issued from the heads of inquisitive Protestants, and been <hi>Circulating</hi> in
the World for above a Hundred and Fifty years, and I doubt not but it will
be in mens Souls as long as <hi>blood</hi> shall have its <hi>Circular</hi> Course in their bodies;
and <hi>maugre</hi> all the Calumnies cast on the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
for being fautors of Popery, I shall expect that our learned <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>

of Popery being here the <hi>State-Religion,</hi> to say that in little
more then Twenty years time Four great changes in Religion happen'd in
<hi>England,</hi> and that the generality of the people then like dead Fishes went
with the stream of the Times: but I ask, if the generality of the people
had been throughly enlighten'd in the rationality of the Protestant Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Twenty years together, would they have return'd to the belief of the
Popish? Will they now do it after the establishment of a <hi>Rational</hi> Religion for
above a Hundred years together? Can Popery now find the way into most
Mens brains here presently after the whole <hi>Nation</hi> almost were <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>

had been free in <hi>Turky</hi> for a Hundred years, and a <hi>libera Philosophia</hi>
and <hi>Theologia</hi> had been there in fashion for a Hundred years, and every man
had been allow'd his Judgment of discretion so long about the sense of the
<hi>Alchoran,</hi> or of the holy Scripture, and of all Books of Religion, could ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
even there come into play again? or if the <hi>Turkes</hi> had drank Wine
for a Hundred years together, could any one Conjure the glasses out of
their hands by telling them there was a <hi>Devil</hi> in every grape?</p>
            <p>If that Law in <hi>Muscovy</hi> that makes it death for any Subject to travel out
of that Kingdom without the Emperors <hi>Licence,</hi> lest his Subjects having
seen the freedome of other Countreys, should never again return to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power in their own again; I say, if that Law had been repeal'd for
a Hundred years, and multitudes of oppress'd mankind had thence found
the way to breath in the ayre of Liberty like men, could they be persuaded
to return to the <hi>Yokes</hi> of <hi>Beasts</hi> again?</p>
            <p>When a <hi>floating</hi> Island has been a Hundred years fixt to the Continent,
can any teach it to swim again? <hi>Consulitur de Religione,</hi> is likely to be the

            </p>
            <p>The very <hi>humour</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> Nation long hath and still doth run against
what they think but like Popery, or makes for it, and that with such a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
current of Antipathy, as is never likely to be stem'd: and nothing is
more out of fashion then a kind of <hi>Sir-positive,</hi> or <hi>Dictatorian</hi> humour in

be digested here, while he makes himself a <hi>St. Positive.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>gentile</hi> humour of the Age here that abhorrs <hi>hard</hi> words as loathsom

could not pass to their <hi>Palaces</hi> but by his leave, and on his terms.</p>
            <p>An <hi>English</hi> King then was but the Popes <hi>Primier Ministre,</hi> and yet paid
great wages too for the being a Servant to the <hi>Servus Servorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iohn</hi> used to say, That <hi>all his affairs in the World were unprosperous,
and went cross and untowardly after he had once subjected himself and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the Church of</hi> Rome: His words were, <hi>Postquam me &amp; mea Regna</hi>

And 'tis obvious to consider on the other hand, what a great figure <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth made in the World, after he had manumitted himself and his
Kingdoms from the Papal Usurpation: And how he held the <hi>Balance</hi> of the
World in his hand, and <hi>trod</hi> on the <hi>Basilisc</hi> of the Papal Supremacy, and
notify'd it to the Nations of the Earth that <hi>England is an Empire,</hi> that being
the <hi>Style</hi> of the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>H. 8. c. 12. Viz. That this Realm is
an Empire, and that the Crown thereof is an Imperial one:</hi> And the words
of <hi>Kings and Emperours of this Realm,</hi> being then attribued in our <hi>Statutes</hi> to
the Monarchs of <hi>England;</hi> and as the great expression in the <hi>Prophesie</hi> of
<hi>Ezekiel c. 16. v.</hi> 13. is applyed by God to the <hi>Iewish</hi> state, <hi>And thou didst
prosper into a Kingdom,</hi> it may be justly said that <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth's defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Popes Usurpation, made <hi>England prosper into an Empire.</hi> 'Twas his
doing that made him <hi>hors de page,</hi> and 'tis only the doing it that will make
the <hi>French</hi> King truly so too: For 'tis only Air that any feed a Monarch's
fancy with, who would <hi>amuse</hi> him with an <hi>Vniversal</hi> Empire abroad, till he
hath obtain'd one first at home; as no Man is to expect to govern his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Family, who is <hi>Control'd</hi> in his own.</p>
            <p>And like a Master who imagines himself great, while he is feared by none
but some of his own Servants, so how little terrour did <hi>Queen Mary</hi>'s Reign
give to any parcel of Mankind, but a few of her own Subjects, of which the
number that she burnt and made to languish in Prisons, and such as left her
Kingdom by <hi>migration</hi> to forreign parts, would easily have kept <hi>Callais</hi>
for her, and prevented the ignominy of her <hi>Politics,</hi> in losing the <hi>Real
Key</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> while she was finding the Imaginary <hi>Keys</hi> of the Church!</p>
            <p>But 'tis a truth not contestable, That Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign (in which her
persecution of her Subjects was so barbarous, and such a <hi>scandal</hi> to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That Dr. <hi>Heylin himself</hi> applyes to it in the <hi>Title Page</hi> of his <hi>History
of Queen Mary</hi> that passage in <hi>Paterculus, Hujus temporis fortunam, ne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flere

only as a <hi>foile</hi> to the lustre of <hi>Queen Elizabeth, whom all Generations since
have called blessed;</hi> and who was not more lov'd by the <hi>English,</hi> then she
was feared by the <hi>French,</hi> and was offered <hi>Calice</hi> if she would but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
at the continuing of the <hi>French</hi> forces in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and who sent to
the great <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth a <hi>Mandamus</hi> to build no more Ships, and had
more money offered her by her Subjects then she would accept; and yet
(as is said in <hi>Towsend</hi>'s <hi>Historical Collections) had spent a Million of Money
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103047:91"/>
in her Wars with</hi> Spain, <hi>and laid out</hi> 100000 l. <hi>to support the King of</hi> France
<hi>against the Leaguers, and</hi> 150000 l. <hi>in defence of the Low Countries, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
a debt of Four Millions she found the Crown indebted in.</hi> Nay, our
<hi>Historians</hi> tell us, that <hi>She payed the very Pensions that were in arrear in her
Father's, and Sister's time to divers of the Religious persons ejected out of
Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> who by all her <hi>Alliances,</hi> and especially her Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
and Defensive one with the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> in the
<hi>Year</hi> 1578. laid such a deep and sure foundation for a vast trade of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Nation to be built on, that it's <hi>overbalance</hi> is said to have brought to be
Coined in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> from the first of <hi>October</hi> 1599, in the 41<hi>st
Year</hi> of her Reign, to <hi>March 31st</hi> 1619, (being 19 years) 4,779, 314 <hi>l. 13 s.
4 d,</hi> And from <hi>March 31st</hi> 1619, to <hi>March 31st,</hi> 1638 (being 19 years)
6,900,042 <hi>l. 11 s. 1 d,</hi> And from <hi>March</hi> 1638, before <hi>May</hi> 1657 (being
19 years) 7,733,521 <hi>l. 13 s. 4 d; England</hi> alone by verture of that her
<hi>Alliance,</hi> having till the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Munster</hi> 1648, enjoyed almost the whole
Manufacture, and best part of the Trade of <hi>Europe:</hi> And it was but just for
Heaven to punish in <hi>England</hi> the greatest villany that could be wrought on
Earth, I mean the murder of the best of <hi>Kings,</hi> by suffering the Trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to have its fatal decay in that year 1648. For then, I count, our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance
of Trade for the last mentioned <hi>Nineteen</hi> years had its <hi>Period,</hi> and
'twas by the effect of that <hi>Peace</hi> that both <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonized
the power of our Trade, and the most Soveraign of our Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Till that black year 'twas to be ascribed to the result of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
politics, and not to the conduct of the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did, as to Trade, both do its business and play, and as to its Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Trade of the World, did <hi>Sail</hi> with a <hi>Trade-wind;</hi> and during that
Wind, it could not happen that any should meet us, or overtake us in our
motion, whatever mean <hi>Pilots</hi> were at the <hi>Helm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was for the completing the last <hi>ternary</hi> of the Coinage, that I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

               </gap>, or <hi>nineteen years,</hi> ending in 1657. For I believe that
both <hi>Astrea</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> left our Land in that fatal <hi>Crisis</hi> of 48, of which the
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Arraignment, and Martyrdom of that matchless Prince.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore not to be admired, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s provident <hi>Ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
such a plenty of Traffick and Riches to her Kingdom, both for her own
and future time, she had what <hi>praemium</hi> of <hi>Taxes</hi> from her Parliaments she
pleased, accordingly as King <hi>Iames</hi> tells the Parliament <hi>Anno 1620, That
Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>had one year with another above</hi> 100000 l. <hi>in Subsidies; and
in all my time I have had but four Subsidies, and six Fifteenths; and he said his
Parliament had not given him any thing for Eight or Nine years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> did thrive apparently while it was to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a <hi>Puteus
inexhaustus:</hi> But while it was such an one to the <hi>Pope,</hi> was in a miserable
and consumptive state, as any one must necessarily conclude, who considers
that the <hi>nutritive juyce</hi> of the wealth of the Kingdom was diverted from che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
its own <hi>Head</hi> to pamper the <hi>Bellies</hi> of Forreigners. Deplorable
then was the condition of the <hi>English</hi> Crown, when (as we are told by the
<hi>Antiquitates Britan.</hi> f. 178.) in the Reign of <hi>Hen. 3d. Repertus est Annuus
reditus Papae talis quem ne Regius quidem attigit:</hi> And when according to
<hi>Matthew Paris</hi> f. 549, in the <hi>Reign</hi> of that King, <hi>Anno 1240, it was complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of, That there remained not so much Treasure in the Kingdom, as was in three
years extorted from it by the Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is more strange, we are told in <hi>Cotton's Collections</hi> p. 129 of
the times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>That the Taxes paid to the Pope for Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103047:91"/>
dignities did amount to five times as much as the People paid the King</hi>
per annum. One would wonder that so martial a Prince, the Scene of
whose Reign lay almost in continual War, should be so careless of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news</hi>
of it, as to permit so much of the wealth of the Kingdom to be mis-applyed,
and that too while all manner of <hi>Experiments</hi> of Taxes were tryed
on his Subjects, who payed him toward his charge of the War with <hi>France
Wool</hi> and <hi>Grain,</hi> as not having Mony enough to supply him wholly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
and when, as it is said in <hi>Cotton's Collections, A long Bill was brought
in by the Commons against the Usurpation of the Pope as being the Cause of All
the Plagues, Murrains, Famine and Poverty of the Realm, so as thereby was
not left the third Person, or Commodities within the Realm as lately were, and
the Commons did desire that it might be enacted, That no Mony might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
forth of the Realm by Letters of Lombardy, or otherwise on pain of forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and imprisonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Pope</hi> knew, it seems, there was mony to be had out of <hi>England,</hi>
though the Commons grudged it him, and that a complaint of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the decay of Trade was no proof of it, but rather in his case an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the contrary, for that 'tis <hi>Proverbial</hi> with Rich Men when they
have no mind to part with their mony, to say, <hi>they have none;</hi> and it appears
out of <hi>a balance of Trade</hi> on <hi>Record</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that in the 28<hi>th</hi> year
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the <hi>Sum</hi> of the <hi>over-plus of the Exports above the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi>
amounted to 255214 <hi>l. 13 s. 8 d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This however shews sufficiently the <hi>Indignation</hi> of a Popish <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
at the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Lombard-street Bankers,</hi> who convey'd his mony
for him hence by <hi>Bills of Exchange;</hi> and if our late Parliaments have not
thought fit to comply with the demands for satisfaction of Protestant <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
there, much less will future ones favour any of the Popes <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Pope</hi> formerly had as much mony here from the publick as the
King, we may well believe possible, since 'tis generally held that <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
equalled <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> tells us, <hi>Anno 1240, Misit Papa Pater noster sanctus quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

            </p>
            <p>Nothing less then <hi>infinity</hi> of Treasure out of one Island could supply the
great <hi>exacter</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who it seems resembled him that <hi>Cicero</hi> brands by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>infinitum genus invenerat ad innumerabilem pecuniam Corripiendam.</hi> But
there is now no <hi>catching</hi> a Nation in <hi>Mouse-traps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Pope has never thought it worth his while to send Emissaries to
<hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and some other <hi>Northern</hi> Countreys, to spunge Mony
out of them, which he knows that great <hi>spendor</hi> called <hi>War</hi> that so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infests them, makes them have none to spare for the Popes use (and <hi>Curia</hi>
Romana <hi>non vult ovem sine lana</hi>) so will the future vast charge too likely to
be for ever incumbent on <hi>England,</hi> and other parts of the World, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
and maintaining <hi>Capital</hi> Ships, effectually provide against the <hi>profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of any on the <hi>Projector</hi> of Religion at <hi>Rome,</hi> and against <hi>Romes</hi> being
to us as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> called it of old, <hi>barathrum proventuum.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:103047:92"/>
And any who considers that his Majesty hath not without difficulty
obtain'd <hi>Supplies</hi> of Mony from late <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and that they
have been all <hi>appropriated</hi> to certain publick uses, may well give the
Pope <hi>City-security,</hi> that he shall have no Mony from <hi>England;</hi> and no Man
I think now supposeth that any thing that time can cause, can make the Pope
get much Mony out of the Exchequer of <hi>England,</hi> but one who (as <hi>Charo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
says) was <hi>born in a Bottle, and never saw the World but out of a little hole.</hi>
But if according to the <hi>Calculations</hi> that have been by some made, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Coin of the Nation doth not now exceed <hi>Six Millions;</hi> and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Revenue in times of Peace has amounted to somewhat near one Third
of that, and if the <hi>Pope</hi> should be allow'd here to have a <hi>spiritual income</hi> equal
to the <hi>King</hi>'s, and the restored Abbots and Monks, and the other <hi>Clergy</hi> be
allow'd another <hi>Third,</hi> (for so the <hi>accounts</hi> of their <hi>proportion</hi> were <hi>totted</hi> by
some Critical <hi>Calculators</hi>) the whole Laity would be <hi>nichil'd,</hi> as the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi>
word is.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, as the <hi>Antiq. Britan.</hi> mention, sent some of his
Courtiers to treat with the <hi>Clergy</hi> about the <hi>Quota</hi> of their supplying him,
<hi>viz, Misit ex aula suâ Nuntios qui suo nomine agerent cum clero, quoniam eorum
&amp; tranquillitas Major &amp; fructus atque reditus annui tunc essent longe uberiores
quam populi, ut ad Regem in his bellicis angustiis adjuvandum se ostenderent
promptiores.</hi> And it appears out of <hi>Cotton's Collections,</hi> That in the fourth <hi>Year</hi>
of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>The Clergy confess'd they had a Third part of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of the Kingdom, and therefore then consented to pay a Third part of the Taxes.</hi>
But in those ancient times of Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beside the Clergies share in the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi>
of <hi>Land,</hi> it might be justly added to the <hi>Inventory</hi> of their Wealth, That
they generally engrossed the highest and chiefest <hi>Offices</hi> in the Kingdom, and
that from the Office of Lord High <hi>Chancellor,</hi> to that of the very <hi>Clerks</hi> in
<hi>Chancery.</hi> and other <hi>Clerks</hi> places (whence to this day the officiating <hi>Registers</hi>
of Courts are called <hi>Clerici</hi> or <hi>Clerks</hi>) whereby they <hi>caught</hi> in a manner
the whole Kingdom in a <hi>Purse-net.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis therefore no wonder that the great affluence of the Riches of the
Clergy drew to them that Popular esteem, that (as the <hi>Antiquaries</hi> observe)
the <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Sir</hi> was affixed to the <hi>Christian Names</hi> of Clergy-men, from
King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time down to the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and which was
also express'd in <hi>Latine</hi> by the word <hi>Dominus,</hi> as for example, in the witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of a Deed, <hi>Testibus Domino</hi> Willielmo de Massy, <hi>persona de</hi> Bowden,
<hi>Matheo Hale,</hi> &amp;c. And of the people calling their <hi>Parish Priests</hi> by the name
of Sir <hi>William Massy,</hi> and the like, as in ordinary Communication we call
Knights, we have the instance of the first <hi>Christian</hi> on whom here for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<hi>incineration</hi> was practised, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>William Sautre, Parish Priest</hi> of the

            </p>
            <p>Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> who in his <hi>profession of Divinity</hi> was greater then any

in the Pulpit, though it was not of a point of Theology, that every
thing he there said has a Title to be regarded: And he in his <hi>Sermons in fol.

This profession is God be thanked long since suppressed: There is nothing of

            <p>But though it hath been truly observ'd, That the not providing for the
<hi>augmentations</hi> of the poorer Livings in <hi>England,</hi> was a scandal to our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
in that it made so many scandalous Livings, and consequently
so many such Ministers, and it has been in one of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
notify'd by Dr. <hi>Iames</hi> (as <hi>Townsend</hi>'s <hi>Collections</hi> mention) that <hi>of
Eight Thousand and odd Parish-Churches then in</hi> England, <hi>but Six Hundred
did afford a competent Living for a Minister:</hi> And it has been publickly
aver'd by Archbishop <hi>Whitgift, That there were Four Thousand Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Benefices which are not worth above Ten Pound a Year in the King's
Books;</hi> yet the dispersing of so much of the Church Revenue among the
Laity hath had this effect, namely, to engage the possessors of so great a
proportion of the Land of <hi>England</hi> to be Champions against Popery; and
one other good effect within my own observation it produced in the late
times, when <hi>Tithes</hi> themselves were thought <hi>Delinquent,</hi> namely, that the

of Livings (the which mostly were in Cities and Corporations in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey)
hath not however prov'd any <hi>augmentation</hi> to the interest of Popery:
For though the Reliques, and Images, and Shrines of Saints there, that
brought a concourse of Offerers and Offerings thither enrich'd those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Churches, and had the effect of <hi>Staple</hi> Ecclesiastical <hi>Commodities,</hi>
and <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth's abolishing them, reduced the value of the Livings
there almost to nothing, they grew by occasion thereof afterward to be
receptacles for heterodox <hi>Divines,</hi> who seiz'd on the Livings there in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>derelict,</hi> and finding the <hi>Genius</hi> of Trading people averse from Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
did represent the few and innocent, and indeed decent ones of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> as odious to them, and therefore were sure of pleasing their <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi>
by constant declaiming against those of Popery, that were so many,
and cumbersome, and had caused so much blood-shed, and were known to
be <hi>Ceremonies</hi> both <hi>mortuae</hi> &amp; <hi>mortiferae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Doleman</hi> alias <hi>Parsons</hi> observed in his time, that the strength of the
<hi>Puritans</hi> lay in those Corporate Towns and Cities, there will the hatred
of the Principles of the Papists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> probably for ever encrease.</p>
            <p>I have for this purpose found it truly observed in a <hi>Discourse</hi> in octavo,
concerning <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> Printed for <hi>Nath. Brooks</hi> at the <hi>Angel</hi> in
<hi>Cornhil:</hi> That <hi>the</hi> Puritan <hi>Preachers by their disesteem of Ceremonies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Pomp in the worship of God, were the more endeared to Corporations,
and the greater part of persons engaged in Trade and Traffic, who hate Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in general, and what does unnecessarily take up time: And that persons
who nauseate Ceremonies in Civil things, will loath them likewise in Religious,
as a man who has an antipathy against Muscadine in his Parlor, cannot love
it at the Sacrament. And that if we reflect on those who did most love Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
heretofore in our Nation, we shall find them to have been persons of the
greatest Rank and Quality (who did effect Ceremonies in Civil things) or of
the poorest sort, who did get their daily bread by the Charity of the other. So
natural is it for men to Paint God in Colors suitable to their own fancies, that
I do not wonder at Trading Persons who hate Ceremonies, that they thus think
God in respect of this hatred altogether such as themselves.</hi>

what looks like luxury, and is apt to occasion unnecessary expences to them:</hi>
And therefore no humane <hi>Art</hi> will ever Reconcile them to one <hi>Casuistical
Tenet</hi> that is <hi>so so</hi> branded in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s said <hi>Decree</hi> of the second of <hi>March,</hi>
viz. <hi>Servants of either Sex may secretly steal from their Masters, for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of their service, if it is greater than the Salary which they receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Iesuitism, letter 6, pag.</hi> 80, cites for this <hi>Tenet</hi> Father <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s
Summary <hi>p.</hi> 213, and 214 of the sixth <hi>Edition,</hi> viz. <hi>May Servants who
are not content with their Wages advance them of themselves, by filching and
purloining as much from their Masters as they imagine necessary to make their
Wages proportionable to their services? On some occasions they may, as when
they are so poor when they come into service, that they are obliged to accept any
proffer that's made to them, and that other servants of their quality get more
elsewhere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the rate of this Moral Theology no Tradesman knows what Mony
he has either in his Pocket, or Compter, or what Cash in his Closet, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any King what Treasure he has in his <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the aversion of many persons of high Birth and
Breeding, and who are lovers of Pomp and Ceremony in matters Civil, and
likewise in Religious, from the contrary humour of Trading Men, yet is
there one thing that hath and always will (in spight of all differences in
Religion) occasion an entercourse of Civility between the former <hi>Class</hi> of
Mankind here, and the latter, and 'tis, that necessity of nature that makes
<hi>the Borrower a Servant to the Lender,</hi> namely, that the expensive former
<hi>Classe</hi> taking up Mony at interest from the more frugal latter, obligeth them
to give the Lenders the respect of fair quarter: And thus according to that
<hi>Bull</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> That <hi>in some parts of</hi> Scotland <hi>the Sun shines all night long,</hi>
there will still during the contrariety of their tenets, and humours, and
which are as opposite as light and darkness, occasionally arise a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
between them.</p>
            <p>And of the Redundance of Money, the <hi>Puritans</hi> party had in the late
times, and of their designed employing it for the greatning the interest of
their party, the establishment of <hi>Feoffees</hi> by them for <hi>purchasing Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
is a great instance: Of their great progress wherein we have an account
in <hi>Pryn</hi>'s <hi>Compleat History of the Tryal of Arch-bishop</hi> Laud, where he saith,
<hi>And had they not been interrupted in this good work, they would probably in
very few years have purchased in most of the great Towns and noted Parishes Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
in</hi> England <hi>in Lay-mens Lands:</hi> And which had they effected, they
might have settled such a <hi>Bank of Land</hi> on the <hi>Fond</hi> whereof to have brought
into their possession the greatest part perhaps of the mony Currant in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that party without any but Silver weapons, have acquired such
an <hi>arbitrage</hi> of the interests of all others in <hi>England,</hi> as to have usurped <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Eighth's Motto of <hi>Cui adhaereo praeest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though the <hi>Livings</hi> in these great Corporate Towns are so small, and
the value they had by oblations be evaporated every where but in the <hi>King's
Books,</hi> (where it remains still to enhance their payment of <hi>first Fruits and
Tenths</hi>) the heterodox <hi>Divines</hi> there find Harvests of oblations rich enough,
and so will the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if ever a storm of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

               <hi>State-favour</hi> that call'd out some of the inward one of Religion, being aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they will probably grow more exemplary in austere vertue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
attract so much reverence from their flocks as to become <hi>Confessors,</hi> as
well as <hi>Preachers</hi> to them, for so the Non-conformist Divines there now
in a manner are; and as <hi>Confession</hi> under Popery proved the only <hi>Guaranty</hi>
to the Priests for their being paid their <hi>Personal Tithes,</hi> and as then people
at their deaths expiated their omissions in the payment of their Tithes, by
valuable <hi>Legacies,</hi> thus too will it probably happen to the Ministers of Christ's
<hi>New Testament,</hi> and often, to be <hi>Executors,</hi> or at least <hi>Legatees</hi> in <hi>Christians
Wills;</hi> the very <hi>dust of whose feet is thought beautiful</hi> by all Men, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
when their return to their own dust is approaching.</p>
            <p>And the persecution design'd them will but reduce their state in the Eye
of the World, to look and be like that of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians, who
made the <hi>Apostles</hi> their <hi>Bankers,</hi> and the depositaries of their wealth; and
whose Successors likewise in the administration of the Gospel during the

And as for <hi>Tithes</hi> we hear nothing of them for many <hi>Ages</hi> in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive

            <p>Of the <hi>Oblations</hi> of the people here in <hi>England</hi> decreasing toward the
<hi>Pastors</hi> of <hi>Independent</hi> Churches, when <hi>Independency</hi> became the Darling
Religion of the <hi>State,</hi> we had an indication in the late times, when some of
the most eminent of them obtain'd the possession of great Livings and their
Tithes, and others of them retreated from their Churches to <hi>Headships</hi> of
Colledges. Nor has there been any failure of the return of the old Exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of <hi>Oblations</hi> from such <hi>Churches</hi> to such <hi>Divines,</hi> who have again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to them when they were dislodged from those preferments.</p>
            <p>I find not that the Piety of our Ancestors had established any Revenue to
the Church from Tithes in <hi>England,</hi> till about the end of the Eighth or
middle of the Ninth <hi>Century;</hi> nor was the <hi>division</hi> of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Parishes</hi>
before the time of <hi>Honorius</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the year 636, till
which time there could not be Parochial Tithes. About that time as 'twas
said that the <hi>measure</hi> of <hi>donations</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> was <hi>immensitas,</hi> so was the
<hi>modus</hi> of their Artifices to preserve them <hi>sine modo,</hi> it being incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, to be restless in the acquiring of riches, for without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
acquiring of more, no Man is sure to preserve the <hi>Quota</hi> of what he
hath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:103047:94"/>
'Twas thence that <hi>Sacriledge</hi> of the <hi>Monks</hi> arose, that tore the Bread out
of the Mouths of the Parish Priests by the Name of <hi>Appropriations,</hi> which
shewed the <hi>President</hi> to <hi>Wolseys alienation</hi> of Religious Houses, that was the
<hi>President</hi> to <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth's. And it may well be supposed that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Monks in robbing the Parochial incumbents by <hi>Appropriations,</hi>
was to propagate ignorance among the Laity thereby, and to leave the Age
as dark as they found it, or rather to be able generally to let in or keep out
what quantity of light they pleased.</p>
            <p>Yet had those <hi>Appropriations</hi> been made in an Age of knowledge, they
would then have met with that Nick-name of <hi>Impropriations,</hi> that was born
many years afterward: and it would then have appeared <hi>improper</hi> to all
that the Monks should <hi>Muzzle the mouth of the Ox that did tread out the
Corn;</hi> and that old natural Zeal for Religion, so anciently radicated in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
minds, that <hi>Popes</hi> have formerly complained they were addrest to with
more questions about Religion from <hi>England</hi> than from all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
would have inclined the respective Parishioners according to their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to contribute a liberal maintenance to their Parish Priests; and even in
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>To have plucked out their own Eyes, and have given them,</hi>
but that they saw that devotion that brought the fore-mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Spectators, and Offerers to the Images and Shrines, and to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
there made the Vicars at least competently to <hi>live by the Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if that <hi>Classe</hi> of heterodox Pastors in <hi>Corporations</hi> who as to skill in
<hi>Theology</hi> and the <hi>Encyclopaedy</hi> of Arts and Sciences, requisite to Crown a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
are generally but <hi>Images</hi> in comparison of the excellent Divines of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> have been how ever so much <hi>adored</hi> there, and had such
<hi>offerings</hi> from their adorers, the substantial and learned <hi>Divines</hi> of our Church
there, may on occasion well say, <hi>quid non speremus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During that late persecution of the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in
the times of the Usurped Powers, who therein exercised all the cruelty they
durst, it might be truly said of the Doctrine of that Church, and the fire
of the zeal of the Laity in providing for the liberal maintenance of many of
its Clergy, as it is of <hi>Lime</hi> in the <hi>Emblem—Mediis accendor in undis.</hi>
What <hi>burning and shining lights</hi> then in the midst of a perverse Generation
were among others of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> Bishop <hi>Gunning,</hi>
Bishop <hi>Wild,</hi> Bishop <hi>Mossom?</hi> Nor did their numerous Congregations in the
least, for want of plentiful <hi>Oblations</hi> to them, starve the Cause of Religion.
The last forementioned person at the <hi>Funeral</hi> of Bishop <hi>Wild,</hi> in a Printed <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric</hi>
of his <hi>Life,</hi> takes occasion to speak of the <hi>Oblations</hi> in those times
afforded him, and saith, <hi>p. 7. And whereas some good</hi> Obadiahs <hi>did then hide
and feed the Lord's Prophets, it was his care to Communicate to others what
himself received for his own support. Many Ministers sequestred, many Widows
afflicted, many Royalists imprisoned and almost famished, can testifie the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive
bounty of his hand, dispensing to others in reliefs of Charity, what himself
received of others in offerings of Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as if that Iron Age had been the Golden one of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he doth so pathetically represent the internal glories of that Church
in that conjuncture, that any one who would draw an Historical Painting
of the State of the Primitive Church to the exactness and bigness of the life,
might best do it by the Church of <hi>England</hi> sitting in that posture he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes.
These are his words, <hi>p. 6, And here I cannot but recount with joy
amidst all this Funeral sorrow, what were then the holy ardours of all fervent
devotions, in Fastings and Prayer, and solemn Humiliations: Ay, in Festival
and Sacramental Solemnities. O the lift up praying, and yet sometime down cast
weeping Eyes of humble Penitents! O the often extended, and yet as often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103047:94"/>
arms of suppliant Votaries! Vpon days of Solemnity, O how early and
how eager were the peoples devotions, that certainly then, if ever, the Kingdom
of Heaven suffered violence, so many with</hi> Jacob <hi>then wrestling with God in
Prayer, not letting him go till he gave them a blessing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus was that great Magazine of Learning and Piety Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in
the late time of the Persecution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Magazine
then likewise of mighty Alms, insomuch that <hi>Serenus Cressy</hi> saith, in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Apologetical</hi> Printed in the year 1674, <hi>p. 48. Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>in those
days inviting me into</hi> England, <hi>assured me I should be provided of a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
place to dwell in, and a sufficient subsistence to live comfortably, and withal,
that not any one should molest me about my Religion and Conscience. I had
reason to believe that this invitation was an effect of a cordial Friendship, and
I was also inform'd that he was well enabled to make good his promise, as having
the disposal of great Charities, and the most zealous promoter of Alms-giving
that liv'd in</hi> England <hi>since the change of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus while as noble <hi>Confessors</hi> they forsook <hi>Houses and Land,</hi> they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Evangelical promise, received the effects of <hi>Houses and Lands,</hi>
and praedial Tithes <hi>an hundred fold in this Life,</hi> with the Gospel <hi>Salvo</hi>
(as I may call it) of <hi>Persecutions:</hi> And as in the primitive and best times,
when the Christian Pastors had no <hi>Tenths</hi> but the <hi>Decumani fluctus,</hi> or <hi>Ten
Persecutions,</hi> and many Christians were <hi>decimated</hi> for Martyrdom, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Goods that was never read of to be practised but in <hi>Vtopia,</hi>
and that Renunciation of that dear thing called <hi>Property,</hi> (for the defence
whereof Political Government is supposed to have been chiefly invented)
did so much glorifie the Christian Morality, to the confounding all exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the most sublime Morals of the Heathens, that the Pastors had the
Christians <hi>All</hi> at their Feet, and did tread on Oblations at every step they
took, so likewise those great <hi>Divines</hi> beforementioned, and many others,
found that <hi>Primitive</hi> Temper, revived in some of the Lay-Members of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> by their generous Offerings and Contributions, which
<hi>adorn'd the Gospel,</hi> and supported its Ministers, and which Laity, though
cruelly <hi>decimated</hi> by the Usurpers, yet were then <hi>Rich in good works, ready
to distribute, and willing to Communicate,</hi> and by their forementioned great
liberality in Oblations, exceeding the rate of <hi>Tenths,</hi> did <hi>lay up in store
a good Foundation against the time to come</hi> for the Pastors that shall be
their <hi>Successors</hi> in Persecution, that may secure their expectations of good
<hi>Pastures</hi> in our <hi>Cities,</hi> and of <hi>having a Table prepared for them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of their Enemies,</hi> come what can come from <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover by such an accident only can the great <hi>Cities</hi> in <hi>England</hi> be freed
from some illiterate Pastors of gather'd Churches, who without having their
Quarters beaten up by Penal Laws, will disappear there, when the excellent
try'd <hi>Veterans</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> shall come to Garrison them. Those
little <hi>Sheep-stealers</hi> of others <hi>Flocks</hi> will then no longer attempt there to
have <hi>Common of Pasture without Number,</hi> but will by all be <hi>numbred, and
found too light.</hi> 'Twill be visible to all that the Divines of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> can with ease Preach in as plain a manner as the other, and that
the other can not, with pains, Preach as Learnedly and Rationally as
they.</p>
            <p>We see that many ridiculous Lay-Preachers, who in the late times did
set up a kind of <hi>Religion-Trade</hi> in great Cities, and did gather Churches,
and likewise gather there some maintenance, have thence silently took their
march on the occasion of the more Learned Presbyterian Divines ejected
from their Livings, retiring thither, and there having constant auditories,
partly resembling the <hi>guise</hi> of gathered Churches: And the disproportion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103047:95"/>
in intellectual Talents being generally as great between them and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as is that between them and the Lay-Preachers,
they must there prove Bankrupt necessarily as the others
did.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> in his Book called, <hi>The Zealous and Impartial Protestant,</hi> did
but right to the Episcopal Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> when he ascribes to them the
honour of having by their Learned Writings <hi>Confuted, exposed, triumph'd
over the numerous Errours of Popery,</hi> and there names Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> Bishop
<hi>Morton,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi>
Archbishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> Bishop <hi>Cozens,</hi> Dr.

Dean <hi>Lloyd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Henry More,</hi> Dr. <hi>Brevint:</hi> And speaking of the Episcopal
Clergy of the City of <hi>London,</hi> saith, <hi>How many Learned, Substantial, Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Sermons have they Preach'd against the Popish Doctrines and Practice since
our late fears and dangers? 'Tis true, some few others have written something,
Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>and Mr.</hi> Pool <hi>have laboured worthily: Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>hath said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

            </p>
            <p>The Conjuncture of the <hi>few and evil days</hi> of Popery would occasion ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good effect, a thing that is always to be wished, but (considering the

never else to be hoped for, and that is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the common Calamity would

which has so much <hi>horrour</hi> in it, that all those subtle miscreants who have
been able to cause it here, and make so many of them almost ready with
the <hi>ferity</hi> of the <hi>canes sepulchrales</hi> to devour one another, can never in words
express. Nor can my imagination paint out to me any thing of the kind
like it in the past course of time, without my recollecting the description
of the fears of the <hi>Doctor of the Gentiles,</hi> given by himself concerning the
<hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> to which he applies the words of <hi>debates, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings,
wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my considering the <hi>fermentation</hi> in the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> when near its
fatal destruction. But there will be a <hi>finalis concordia</hi> among the now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Protestants, if ever Popery should set up to be the State-Religion:
And then any one who will give <hi>advice to a Painter</hi> to draw <hi>The present
state of the Protestant Church of</hi> England, may make a good Copy from the great
Original of that <hi>Prophesie</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> The <hi>Wolf and the Lamb shall feed
together,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain,</hi> &amp;c. And
perhaps without going so far for a <hi>Mountain</hi> that may represent to ones
fancy that <hi>State</hi> of <hi>English</hi> Protestants, he may find one in <hi>England</hi> to do
the work, one that several of our <hi>Historians</hi> speak of, telling us that in the
<hi>Year 1607, When by the Irruption of the</hi> Severn <hi>Sea, the Country in</hi> Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <hi>shire
was overflown almost Twenty Miles in length, and Four Miles in breadth;
it was then observ'd that Creatures of contrary natures, as Dogs and Hares, Foxes
and Conies, yea Cats and Mice getting up to the tops of some Hills, dispensed at
that time with their antipathies, remaining peaceably together without sign of
fear, and without any violence used toward one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do Men in great Towns supposed qualified only as <hi>the Children of
light,</hi> but as the <hi>Children of this World, and as wise in their Generations,</hi> and
as projecting their own wealth, and the encreasing of their Trade, and of
the <hi>value</hi> of their <hi>Rents,</hi> by eminent <hi>Oblations</hi> provide for such Divines plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there; and 'tis obvious to every thinking Man, that the erecting of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103047:95"/>
               <hi>Free-Schools,</hi> and encouraging excellent <hi>Divines</hi> to live in any particular
Town, turns sufficiently to Mens account in this World as to the ends afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
by attracting inhabitants. For it will be natural to Christians there,
when they do not barely hear of a Christ <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> into a dull Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
but see one (as I may say) <hi>Transfigured and shining as the Sun</hi> in the
Preaching of the Gospel, to say <hi>Lord it is good for us to be here,</hi> and for
them there <hi>to make Tabernacles,</hi> and provide Oblations not for dead but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Saints; and as <hi>a living Dog is more valuable then a dead Lyon,</hi> so I be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lieve
that in any times of Popery here that can come, any one Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and a holy learned <hi>Divine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will get more by
one another, then all Towns where Shrines and Images of dead Saints shall
be set up, will mutually gain thereby.</p>
            <p>Then will the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>People</hi> being <hi>benefactors</hi> to each other be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ready to <hi>pray</hi> for each other, and the former being believed from their
hearts to say <hi>O Lord save thy people,</hi> will find both an <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Cordial</hi>
Response from the latter, <hi>And bless thy Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while I am thus accompanied by the <hi>Guide</hi> of Natural reason, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
in the Region of future time, the time that only is the object of
humane sollicitude, and from which anxious minds are too apt to fear that
every days birth may be a Monster,: I have by considering the former
Revenue accruing to the Church by Oblations, took occasion to Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
my great affirmation, of its not being naturally possible for Popery to
exterminate the Protestant Religion in <hi>England,</hi> a Religion that Popery can
never take by <hi>assault,</hi> or making of its professors Martyrs, nor yet by <hi>Siege,</hi>
in <hi>starving</hi> its <hi>Pastors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that such a great impost as Popery may occasion to Protestants
by Oblations, may in one sense seem to have the nature of a punishment,
namely, because 'twill not be a burden to which all Subjects, or indeed all
Protestants will be equally liable, and it will chiefly light on the devouter
sort of Protestants: And in like manner it may be said that the gain that
arose from Oblations in the times of Popery to the Parish Priests of great
Towns, was in effect an unequal impost on the Popish Laity, as being a
<hi>Tax</hi> only on the more Ignorant and Superstitious of them. But any one
who has in the least considered matters of State cannot but know that any
great inequality of Taxes, that lights on the Subject as a mischief, doth
prove to the Prince an inconvenience, to whom the Subjects pressure makes
him unable to afford that <hi>Subsidium</hi> he otherwise could, and perhaps would
cheerfully for the Publick safety. Thus may the great supposed charge to
be incumbent on the more devout Protestants by Oblations, probably tempt
them to use all the means the Law will permit, to render the Government
of a Popish Prince uneasie to him, and certainly disable them from paying
in that proportion toward the public Levys upon emergent occasions, they
else might do.</p>
            <p>It may therefore here be affirm'd, that the gain of Popes arising from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi>
which was so vast, that <hi>Popes</hi> would boast <hi>That they could never
want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> while they could command Pen and Ink,</hi> and which <hi>Klockius</hi> in his
Book <hi>de Contributionibus</hi> observes, did yield the Pope in Common Years
<hi>a hundred Tuns of Gold,</hi> i. e. a Million of pounds Sterling, (and which being
an unequal <hi>Tax</hi> on Papists, and not pressing the <hi>debauchees</hi> of that Religion
but only falling heavy on the more Pious and devout sort, made them the
less able to supply the holy See with mony on extraordinary occasions,
or to pay their Taxes due to the Popish Princes they lived under, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
those due to the <hi>Pope</hi> as a Temporal <hi>Prince</hi>) has since in a manner
dyed a natural death, the light of <hi>Learning</hi> having no sooner come into

<hi>Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple,</hi> with as much ease almost as our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
did the <hi>Iewish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any one who shall consider the burden of <hi>Oblations,</hi> that the devoute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Roman Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> lye under, as to their <hi>Priests</hi> (which we may
suppose to be very heavy, according to Mr. <hi>Iohn Gees</hi> account in his <hi>Book</hi>
called <hi>The foot out of the Snare,</hi> p. 76, where he saith, <hi>That the Popish Pastors
ordinarily had a fifth of the Estates of the Laity allowed them, and that he
knew that in a great shire in</hi> England, <hi>there was not a Papist of</hi> 40 l. <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
but did at his own charge keep a Priest in his house; some poor neighbours
perhaps contributing some small matter toward it</hi>) may well think our Laity
will bid as high for <hi>English</hi> Prayers, and for Wares they understand, and
see, and weigh, as the Popish Laity doth for <hi>Latine</hi> ones, and Merchandize
they are not allowed to examine; and he who considers that the Priests of
that Religion, though thus pamper'd with Oblations, yet knowing them
burthensom to the Laity, do feed themselves and them with hopes of the
Restitution of Tithes to holy Church, and even of that sort of Tithes
alien'd from it in the times of Popery, may reasonably conclude that our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
whenever forced to fly to the <hi>asylum</hi> of <hi>Oblations,</hi> will be restless in
being both Heaven's and Earth's <hi>Remembrancers,</hi> of their claim of Tithes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the Protestant Religion by the Laws in being, and that a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Religion, and illegal Gospel will be but a Temporary barr against the
collecting of Tithes, from a Land only during an Earth-quake.</p>
            <p>I shall here acquaint your Lordship with a passage in the late times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the <hi>Clerical</hi> Revenue in <hi>England,</hi> worthy not only your knowledge,
but posterities, and that is this: A Person of great understanding, and of
great regard of the truth of the matters of fact he affirmed, and one who
made a great figure in the Law then, and in the Long Parliament from the
beginning to the end of it, related to me occasionally in discourse, <hi>That
himself and some few others, after the War was begun between the King and
Parliament, were employed by the Governing party of that Parliament to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
with some few of the most eminent Presbyterian Divines (and such whose
Counsels ruled the rest of that Clergy) and to assure them that the Parliament
had resolved, if they should succeed in that War, to settle all the Lands, Issues
and Profits belonging to the Bishops and other dignitaries upon the Ministry
in</hi> England, <hi>as a perpetual and unalienable maintenance, and to tell them that
the Parliament on that encouragement expected that they should incline the
Clergy of their perswasion by their Preaching, and all ways within the Sphere of
their Calling to promote the Parliaments Cause; and that thereupon those Divines
accordingly undertook to do so: And that after the end of the War, he being minded
by some of those Divines, of the effect of the Parliaments promise by him notified,
did shortly after signifie to them the answer of that party, who had employed
him in that Negotiation to this effect,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Parliament formerly did
fully intend to do what he had signified to them as aforesaid, and that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
debts occasion'd by the War disabled them from setling the Bishops Lands
on the Church: But that however he was authorized at that time to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them,
that if it would satisfie them to have the Deans and Chapters Lands so settled,
that would be done: And that then those Divines, in anger reply'd, They would
have setled on the Ministry all or none: representing it as Sacrilege to divert
the Revenues of the Bishops to Secular uses, and that thereupon they missed both,
the Deans and Chapters Lands being sold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those <hi>Divines</hi> it seems had a presension that the prosperous Condition
of their Church, would diminish the Charity of Oblations, and therefore
did not impoliticly try to provide for the duration of their <hi>Model,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103047:96"/>
both the Bishops <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nds</hi> among their Clergy: And no
doubt but in the way of a <hi>fac simile</hi> after this Presbyterian Copy, the Popish
Priests will in <hi>concert</hi> with the Pope, even under a Popish Successor as well as
now, combine to lessen the <hi>King's</hi> power, and advance the <hi>Pope</hi>'s, on promises
from the <hi>Holy See,</hi> that they shall have the Church Lands restored to them.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not but a <hi>Popish</hi> Successor will support a Popish <hi>Clergy</hi> with
what maintenance he can, having a reference to the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and
likewise to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> that binds him first to support himself; and
perhaps by keeping <hi>vacant</hi> Bishopricks long so (a thing that by <hi>Law</hi> he
may do) he may have their <hi>Temporal ties</hi> to bestow on whom he shall
please, and perhaps by issuing out new <hi>Commissions</hi> about the <hi>valuation</hi> of the
<hi>Clerical Revenue,</hi> a larger share of <hi>First-fruits and Tenths</hi> legally accruing to
him, may enable him to gratifie such <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> as he shall favour. But
as I likewise doubt not that ever any accident of time will leave the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of such a great proportion of the <hi>Church Revenue</hi> at his <hi>Arbitrage</hi> as the
Usurpers had at theirs, so neither do I of his affairs ever permitting him to
allow so large a share of that Revenue to his Clergy as the Usurpers did to
theirs, whom as those <hi>Powers</hi> durst not wholly disoblige (and therefore
unask'd settled on them toward the <hi>augmentation</hi> of their Livings the <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
Tithes</hi> belonging to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and to the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
though yet nothing of their <hi>Terra firma</hi>) so neither durst those <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
Divines <hi>who followed them for the Loaves,</hi> and who once in a sullen
humour resolved not to have half a Loaf rather then no Bread, reject the
<hi>Impropriate Tithes</hi> given them, because they saw a new Race of <hi>Divines</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Independent</hi> ready to take from those <hi>Powers</hi> what they would give, and
who were prepared by their Religion to support the <hi>State-government,</hi> and
some of whom had already acquired Church-Livings, and others of whom
in the great <hi>Controversie</hi> among all those Parties (which was not general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
so much <hi>de fide propagandâ</hi> as <hi>de pane lucrando</hi>) would with the favour
of the times easily have then worsted the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Clergy in the <hi>scram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
for that thing aforesaid, that though <hi>Moreau</hi> in his learned <hi>Notes</hi> on <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
Salerni,</hi> saith, <hi>no Book was ever writ of,</hi> yet I think few have been writ
but <hi>for,</hi> namely <hi>Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But herein on the whole matter the <hi>Vsurpers</hi> Policy was so successful as
that ordering the great Revenues of the Church as they did, and <hi>Appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> Lands to the use of the <hi>State,</hi> they
by the augmentations arising from the <hi>Fond</hi> of the Impropriate Tithes to
their <hi>Clergy</hi> (and especially to those of them they planted in great Towns
and Cities) ty'd them to their <hi>Authority</hi> (as I may say) by the Teeth, and
kept them from barking against it, or biting them, which else they would
have been likely to have done, being disappointed as to their <hi>gratiae expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivae</hi>
of the <hi>Lands</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> had they been let loose to have depended
on maintenance by <hi>Oblations</hi> in such Towns and Cities, and where they
would have probably tryed with a diversified <hi>Curse ye</hi> Meros, to fly in the
faces of Masters who would not feed them.</p>
            <p>I have before said how the Parliament sweetned them into obedience by
the luscious power of oppressing their fellow Subjects: But neither by any
Revenue adequate to those Impropriate <hi>Tithes,</hi> nor by any such power of
oppressing (that prerogative of Devils, to torment) can it be imagined that
a Popish Successor will ever be able to ensure the obedience of his Clergy
to himself. His Bishops and Dignitaries will be like the Popes <hi>Trent Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
without a <hi>Title,</hi> I mean one to a <hi>Dignity</hi> or <hi>Benefice,</hi> and the burden of
the Clerical Papists maintenance, lying still on the laity, will make Popery
soon visibly grow weary o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103047:97"/>
I shall here take occasion to observe that Tithes were first called <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate</hi>
by the <hi>sarcasm</hi> of the dislodged <hi>Monks,</hi> who thought that the Tithes
<hi>Appropriated</hi> (for that was the Antient Law-term for them) were improperly
placed on <hi>Lay-men;</hi> but both the present possessors, and all that know that 'tis
necessary for <hi>England</hi>'s being a <hi>Kingdom</hi> and no <hi>Province,</hi> that its Riches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing
by the number of its Inhabitants, and by improvement of its Soil,
should keep its weight in the <hi>Balance</hi> of Christendom, especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the growth of <hi>France,</hi> will for ever think it very <hi>improper,</hi> that so much
of its Land and Wealth and Populousness should be sacrificed to Religious
<hi>Idlers,</hi> and that according to Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s account, almost half of the
Land should be turn'd into <hi>Franks</hi> for <hi>Boares,</hi> or as I may say, Sties for
such as are <hi>Epicuri de grege Porci,</hi> or such as were call'd <hi>Barnevelts</hi> Hoggs,
he having called the Monkish <hi>Herd</hi> by that name, of whom if <hi>any angers one
they all rise against him, and if he pleaseth them all, there is nothing to be got
but Bristles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Herd</hi> was not a little molested, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tells us, by a private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
one Mr. <hi>Simon Fish</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1527. who writ a little Book called
<hi>The supplication of Beggars</hi> addrest to the <hi>King,</hi> and it had the honour to
reach his Eyes, and to be lodged in his Bosom three or four days, and to
bring its Author to be embraced by the King, and to have long discourse
with him, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> affirms, who <hi>Prints</hi> that Book, wherein the <hi>Author</hi>
with much laboured curiosity attaques the Revenue of the Monks with
<hi>Arithmetick,</hi> a Science necessary for the strengthening of Political no less
Military Discipline.</p>
            <p>He saith there in the beginning <hi>That the multitude of Lepers and other sick
People and Poor, was so encreased that all the Alms of the Realm sufficed not
to keep them from dying for hunger: And that this happened from counterfeit
holy Beggers and Vagabonds being so much encreased. These</hi> saith he) <hi>are not
the Herds but Wolfes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who have got into their hands more then the third
part of your Realm. The goodliest Lordships and Mannors are theirs.</hi> Beside
this he sets forth that <hi>They have Tithes, Oblations, Mortuaries,</hi> &amp;c. And he
therein saith, That <hi>there being in</hi> England 52000 <hi>Parishes, and Ten Housholds
in every Parish, and five hundred and twenty Thousand Housholds in all, and
every of the five Orders of Fryers receiving a peny a quarter, that is Twenty
Pence in all yearly from every one of these Housholds, the Total Sum was</hi>
430333 l.—6 s.—8 d. <hi>Sterling.</hi> He further sets forth, <hi>That the Fryars
being not the four hundredth Person of the Realm, had yet half its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were in that little Book many things so pungent, and so confirm'd
by <hi>Calculation,</hi> that the <hi>Clergy</hi> put no meaner a Person then Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>
on the answering it in Print; and it occasion'd the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
an <hi>Edict</hi> to call in that little Book, and the <hi>English</hi> New Testament,
and many Books writ against the excesses of the Priests. Well therefore
might Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> be favour'd with a <hi>License</hi> to <hi>read Heretical Books,</hi>
when he was to be at the fatigue of answering them. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> in his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
to it makes a just exception to Mr. <hi>Fish</hi>'s estimate of the number of
<hi>Parishes</hi> in the Realm: But admitting there were then Ten Thousand <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> and about Forty <hi>Houses</hi> in one <hi>Parish</hi> with another in the
<hi>Country</hi> (beside what were in great Towns and Cities) he might modestly
<hi>Calculate</hi> 520000 Housholds in all.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be much wondered at, That a private Gentleman should err
in the excess of the <hi>number</hi> of the <hi>Parishes,</hi> when we are told in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
That in the 45 of <hi>E.</hi> 3. The <hi>Lords and Commons in Parliament gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King a Subsidy of</hi> 50000 l. <hi>at the rate of</hi> 22 s. 4 d. <hi>for each Parish,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103047:97"/>
they estimated the Parishes then near that number; but were afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by the Lord Chancellour, that by returns made into the Chancery on
Commissions of Enquiry, it was found there were not so many Parishes in the
Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had been very acceptable to those who in this Age take their Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
measures of the power and growth of Kingdoms from <hi>Numbers,</hi> if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mr. <hi>Fish</hi> or Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> who answered his Golden little Book (as
I may call it, for his endeavours therein to fix matters relating to the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy
of the Kingdom by <hi>Calculation,</hi> and for his being a <hi>Columbus</hi> to
discover rich Mines without going to <hi>America,</hi> nor yet further then home)
or if any of our <hi>Monkish</hi> Historians, or even our Polish'd and Ingenious ones,
and particularly <hi>My Lord</hi> Bacon, <hi>and my Lord</hi> Herbert had given the World
Rational estimates of the <hi>Numbers</hi> of the people of <hi>England</hi> in the times they
writ of, or particularly of the <hi>Numbers</hi> of the Males then between the <hi>Years</hi>
of 16 and 60, for if they had done that (as on the publick <hi>Musters</hi> made
by occasion of Warlike preparations they might perhaps well have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
we might now easily by the help we have had from the <hi>Observator</hi>
on the <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi> conclude, what the entire Number of the People
then was, and might likewise have better agreed on a stated Rule of the
<hi>Period</hi> of Nations <hi>doubling;</hi> a Curiosity in knowledge not unworthy the
Genius of an Inquisitive or Philosophical States-man, and which presents
to his View as in a Glass the <hi>Anatocisme</hi> of the <hi>faetus populi,</hi> resembling the
<hi>Interest upon Interest</hi> of <hi>Money;</hi> as for Example, when we see that one pound
in Seventy years (the Age of a Man) is, at 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> encreased to a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
            <p>But it is our misfortune, that through the aforesaid omission of our <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi>
we are not so much illuminated about the encrease of the <hi>English</hi>
Nation, as we are about the gradual multiplication of the People of <hi>Rome</hi>
so many hundred years ago: And indeed by the help of the <hi>Writers</hi> of other
<hi>European</hi> Countries we are taught to know the Numbers of all people but
our own. But in this State of improvement that the World is arrived at,
I do account that all who shall hereafter employ their Pens about that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
exercise of humane Wit and Judgment, call'd <hi>History,</hi> and shall not found
the weight of their Remarques upon the <hi>Numbers</hi> of the People they write
of, will no more be termed <hi>grave Authors,</hi> or indeed ought but <hi>grave nothings,</hi>
and such who deal irreverently with a World that is weary of trifles, and
from which they are to expect no other Doom then that of the <hi>Annales

            </p>
            <p>And though as to the <hi>faetus populi</hi> as well as to the <hi>faetus pecuniae,</hi> called

as if he would infer that the losses they received from <hi>Hanibal</hi> had

the which may be made out by <hi>continued mean proportionals.</hi> But this by
the way.</p>
            <p>If my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> who mentions <hi>pag.</hi> 121 of his <hi>History,</hi> That in the
<hi>Year 1522 Warrants were issued out, Commanding the Certificates of the Names
of all above sixteen Years old,</hi> had set down the total number of the persons
certified, he had much more obliged the World then by many things in his
<hi>History.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103047:98"/>
I do not remember that any of our Historians of those times do relate
the Numbers of the Religious Persons that all the suppressed Monasteries
contain'd.</p>
            <p>We are told by <hi>Godwin</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> That <hi>the number of the Abbies that
were in</hi> England <hi>is not easily cast up,</hi> and the Names of the chiefest, and whose
Abbots had voices among the Peers in Parliament, he thereupon enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Weaver</hi> in his <hi>Funeral Monuments</hi> p. 104, mentioning <hi>That all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Houses under the Yearly value of</hi> 200 l. <hi>being given to the King, and
that they were all worth</hi> per annum 20941 <hi>l.</hi> saith, <hi>That the Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
put out of the same were above Ten Thousand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> p. 441, speaking of that sort of Monasteries, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in the 27<hi>th</hi> year of the King's Reign, makes <hi>Thirty, or Thirty two
Thousand pound yearly thereby fall into the King's hand:</hi> And <hi>p. 507, makes
the total yearly value of all the Religious Houses suppressed to be 161100 l.</hi> It
may therefore be thence infer'd, that if <hi>Thirty Thousand pound</hi> yearly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
10000 <hi>Religious</hi> Persons, that there were maintain'd by the 161100 <hi>l.</hi>
above 50000 <hi>Religious</hi> Persons or <hi>Regulars:</hi> And according to the aforesaid
rate of the yearly value of the Land, <hi>viz. 161100 l.</hi> the allowance to each
came to somewhat above 3 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> the which shews that those Lands
were not sold to half the value, because less then double that Sum cannot be
imagined to have maintain'd such a person then.</p>
            <p>I do account that supposing the <hi>Parishes</hi> to have been then in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales,</hi> as <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> says, 9284, that the <hi>Secular</hi> Clergy added
to the Number of the <hi>Regular</hi> only the last said <hi>Number:</hi> For then the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
Law (which requires, that <hi>Orders</hi> shall not be given to Men without
<hi>Titles</hi>) being strictly executed, there were perhaps not more Parish Priests in
<hi>England:</hi> And the adding to those Numbers the <hi>Dignitaries,</hi> viz. <hi>Two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,</hi>
and 24 <hi>Bishops,</hi> and 26 <hi>Deans,</hi> and 60 <hi>Arch-Deacons,</hi> and 544 <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendarys,</hi>
and several <hi>Rural Deans,</hi> doth enlarge the Sum to another Thousand
of Persons who lived by the Altar. Moreover there being then estimated
to live in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> about Sixty Thousand Students, who in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of Church-preferment, as either <hi>Regulars</hi> or <hi>Seculars,</hi> abstain'd from
Marriage, I account that the Number of Persons then ty'd by <hi>Caelibate</hi> from
encreasing and multiplying the people to be above 120000, as at present above
double that Number are in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What accrued to the Secular Clergy then, or since by <hi>Tithes</hi> ought not
to have been looked on by any one with an <hi>evil Eye,</hi> as I suppose by Mr.
<hi>Fish</hi> it was not. For as to the nature of the payment of <hi>Tithes,</hi> according
to the judgment of Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> in his Book of <hi>Taxes and Contributions,</hi> p. 58,
<hi>It may be said to be no Tax or Levy in</hi> England, <hi>whatever it might have been
in the first age of its Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this notion of his may be extended even to that which is called a
<hi>Tenth,</hi> but is <hi>revera</hi> a <hi>Fifth</hi> (I mean the <hi>Tith</hi> of <hi>arables</hi> in regard of the
charge of Culture and Seed, which is ordinarily at least as much as the <hi>Rent</hi>
of the <hi>Land</hi>) because it is a charge <hi>equally</hi> incumbent on all proprietors of
such Land, and for that the true notion of Wealth and Riches depends on
comparison, and 'tis only the inequality in the proportion of the Tax that
is the sting thereof.</p>
            <p>But that which Mr. <hi>Fish</hi> chiefly level'd his <hi>Calculations</hi> at, was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
share in the Wealth of the Kingdom the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryars</hi> had, who
did so little for its preservation, and the encrease of its Numbers. <hi>What an
infinite number of people,</hi> saith he, <hi>might have been encreased to have peopled
the Realm, if this sort of Folk had been married like other Men!</hi> Instead of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103047:98"/>
using his Rhetorical Expression of <hi>infinite,</hi> I shall affirm that these 120000
adult, able persons living in <hi>Celibate</hi> might according to the notion of the
<hi>Observator of the Bills of Mortality,</hi> That every marriage, one with another,
produceth four Children, <hi>viz.</hi> Two apiece for each Sex, have more then dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
their number in the same age: by which any one may well conclude,
that as the number of the people of <hi>England</hi> is now vastly encreased by the
dissolution of Abbies, so it would likewise be so diminished by their re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment.
To effect therefore to lessen thus the number of the people
of <hi>England,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> King with great wisdom has by the Revival of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Immunity of the <hi>Ius trium librorum,</hi> and the application of others,
laid so a great Foundation for the growing populousness of <hi>France,</hi> would too
much expose us to his power and derision.</p>
            <p>The Divine Wisdom's allotting to the <hi>Levitical Tribe</hi> the affluent <hi>quota</hi> it
enjoy'd, is very justly took notice of by those who discourse of the Clerical
Revenue.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Present State of</hi> England, saith, <hi>That our Ancestors accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the pattern of God's ancient people the Iews, judged it expedient to allot
large Revenues to the</hi> English <hi>Clergy, and that the</hi> English <hi>Clergy were the best
provided for of any Clergy in the whole World, except only the Nation of the
Iews, among whom the Tribe of</hi> Levi, <hi>being not the</hi> Fourth <hi>part of the twelve
Tribes (as appears in the Book of</hi> Numbers) <hi>yet had, as Mr.</hi> Selden <hi>confesseth,
and that by God's own appointment, three times the Annual Revenue of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of the twelve Tribes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Covel</hi> in his <hi>Modest and Reasonable examination of some things in use
in the Church of</hi> England, Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1604, saith in <hi>Chapter</hi> the Eleventh,
<hi>That<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>the</hi> Levites <hi>were not the Thirteenth part of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and yet had the
Tenth:</hi> Wherein that <hi>Doctor</hi> agreed with the sense of the <hi>Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of</hi> Trent, who (as 'tis mention'd in the latter end of the <hi>History of that
Council</hi>) said, <hi>That in the</hi> Mosaical <hi>Law God gave the Tenth to the</hi> Levites,
<hi>who were the Thirteenth part of the people, prohibiting that any more should be
given them: But the Clergy now which is not the Fiftieth part, hath gotten al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
not a Tenth only, but a Fourth part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by exacter Calculations, 'tis apparent that the <hi>Levites</hi> though a small
Tribe (if a Tribe, there being twelve beside) scarce the sixtieth part of the
House of <hi>Iacob,</hi> had perhaps a <hi>Sixth</hi> of the whole profits of the Land: They
had the <hi>Tenth</hi> or <hi>Tith</hi> of the Land, together with its Culture; they had in
<hi>Iudaea,</hi> a small Country, 48 Cities, with their Suburbs, 2000 Cubits from
the Wall on every side, and their first-fruits, and a great part of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Sacrifices, and free-will-offerings of the Male Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> which
were to <hi>appear thrice yearly before the Lord</hi> with some Offering, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
House, Field, Person, Beast, &amp;c. was by a singular Vow given to God,
which was to be valued by the Priest himself, and all these duties were
brought in to the Priest, without charge or trouble: and those Cities and
Lands descended from them to their posterity, from generation to generation,
as also did their <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Offerings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall here observe, that that which hath probably induced so many to
err in making the number of the <hi>Levites</hi> so great as aforesaid, was their not
considering what yet is really true in Nature, namely, That the number of
people of any Nation from a month old and upwards (for so the <hi>Levites</hi>
were counted <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 39.) is more then double their number from Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years old and upward, and so the rest of the Tribes were numbred <hi>Exod.
33. 26. Numb.</hi> 26. 62. And therefore I infer that the <hi>Levites</hi> were but about
a sixtieth of the number of the other Tribes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103047:99"/>
But during the Theocracy that the <hi>Iews</hi> sometimes lived under, or while
God was their King, it being worthy of the Divine Empire to design and
promote the wealth of its Subjects, and consequently that they should encrease
and multiply (for that alone is real wealth) there was no Celibate among the
<hi>Levites,</hi> or any degree of Ecclesiasticks to hinder the same.</p>
            <p>Having thus in the way of Calculation glanced on the Ecclesiastical Polity
of God's peculiar People or Subjects, I suppose the rectitude of that Rule
will shew the obliquity or warping of the practice of the Papal Clergy: For
if we do admit (as I believe we well may) that there are seven Millions of
people in <hi>England,</hi> of which 120000 is a sixtieth part, this old Church
Polity of the Popes Clergy doth <hi>Toto Caelo</hi> differ from that of the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
in that they spend double the proportion of the wealth of the Kingdom, and
yet live in Celibate or without multiplying: And as Mr, <hi>Fish</hi> in effect said
in that his Book, do hinder procreation by promiscuous coupling with other
Mens Wives.</p>
            <p>But 'tis a known great truth, that the great business of the Monks, and
the <hi>Ratio studiorum</hi> of the Papal Clergy was not to make the Kingdom po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
but to depopulate. We have for this the testimony of <hi>Walter Mappe</hi>
Arch-deacon of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who was bred up with <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, that the
Abbots and Monks in that time were very Criminous in the point of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation,
whence that Proverb arose <hi>Monachi desertum aut inveniunt aut fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt,</hi>
wherever they seated themselves, they either found the place a Desart,
or made it one.</p>
            <p>'Tis said of them, <hi>That they laid more places waste then ever</hi> William the
Conqueror <hi>or his Son</hi> Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us <hi>did, when they demolished and destroyed many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
to enlarge the bounds of the new Forrest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that Fleet of <hi>depopulators</hi> there was one first-rate one, namely <hi>The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of</hi> Osney, who was for his Talent of depopulating so remarkable, that
'twas observed that he made all <hi>paupers</hi> that dwelt within the <hi>purlieus</hi> of his
Possessions: And of this <hi>Henry</hi> the Second took such notice, that one day
when he had not poor people enough for his Alms on some great Festival
he said in a fit of anger, <hi>That rather then his bounty should be unemployed he
would make as many beggars as the Abbot of</hi> Osney <hi>had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think that the <hi>Monks</hi> should have been well willers to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the populousness of the Kingdom, for that thereby the values of
their Lands would have been encreased, a thing no doubt that appeared visible
to the Reasons of the more Sagacious among them: But there was another
thing they found palpable, that is, they found themselves well at ease, even
to envy in their vast share of the wealth of the Nation, whereby they <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it over both God's inheritance,</hi> and the Laity, and therefore they did not
fancy the sight of the Sea of the people increase, by the coming in of the
Tide of new generations, that would have produced much more persons to
maligne, and perhaps contest with them: they naturally therefore wished the
sweet absence of such company from the World, just as in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other
thin peopled Countries, the Natives living at their ease have sharp regrets
against the accession of strangers, though they know it would raise the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of their Lands, and as in <hi>America</hi> the Natives wish no improvement to
their Country from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Monks had got the Monopoly of Religion, and near half the Land
by it, and not having any certain Issue to endear posterity to them, and
consequently to oblige them to promote the wealth of the Kingdom in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and to consult thereby the good of surviving parts of themselves (for
that figure Children make as to Parents) they and the Abbots and Popish
Bishops cared for no more then being warm in the Pyes Nest while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103047:99"/>
and 'twas as natural to them to repel the thoughts of Colonies of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
advancing the wealth of the Kingdom by new generations, as 'tis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to present Trading persons to prevent the publick good of an <hi>Act of
Naturalization.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this advancement of <hi>depopulation</hi> was therefore the interest of the
<hi>present</hi> Monks and Priests, so was it of the <hi>present</hi> Popes, who knew they
were sure of receiving Aids and Contributions from them, as long as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of other fresh comers did not drive them off the Stage.</p>
            <p>One would rather wonder that our Popish Monarchs saw it not sooner
their Interest, to crush the Politics of these holy <hi>Depopulators</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi>
that turned the Kingdom into Sheep-walks, and who minding chiefly the
encrease of Cattle by pasture, hindred that encrease of Men that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Tillage would have produced, and the furnishing the Crown
with more Subsidy Men, and Soldiers. But this supineness of our Kings
was not only caused by Superstition, and a vitiated fancy in Religion, an
Idol to which <hi>Philip</hi> the Second sacrificed his <hi>Son</hi> (and therefore might be well
supposed prevalent with others to wish the generation of their Children or
Subjects restrained) but our Kings were not then stimulated by necessity
to promote the populousness of their Realm, for that their riches and strength
depending on comparison, the same Religious <hi>Orders</hi> did by <hi>Celibate</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>population</hi>
equally obstruct the Wealth and Power of the neighbouring
Kingdoms as well as this, and by that means they were not our <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the course of encreasing Generations having operated so far as to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the World, and Men for not having so much Elbow-room as they had,
jostling one another by the violence of War, the politics of <hi>Statutes</hi> against
<hi>Depopulation</hi> were forced and reinforced on this Realm: And like as Men,
so too will such <hi>Statutes beget one another</hi> (as I may say) <hi>to the end of the
Chapter.</hi> Nor is the power of the Kingdom ever likely again to be really
emasculated by such as pretended <hi>To make themselves</hi> Eunuchs <hi>for the Kingdom
of Heaven's sake,</hi> and honoured not the <hi>Founder</hi> of Christianity, of whom
since he for the good of Mankind made his first Disciples <hi>fishers of Men,</hi> it
may seem unworthy that he should intend the hurt of States and Kingdoms,
by making the following <hi>Doctors</hi> of his Church <hi>Pastors</hi> of <hi>Sheep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> in the <hi>first Book</hi> of his <hi>Vtopia</hi> doth with a sharpness wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
his excellent wit tell us, <hi>That certain Abbots (holy Men God wot) not
profiting, but much damnifying the Common Wealth, leave no ground for Tillage,
they enclose all in pastures; they throw down Houses, they pull down Towns, and
leave nothing standing, but only the Church, to make of it a Sheep-house.</hi> And
afterward saith, <hi>That one Shepherd is enough to eat up that ground with Cattle,
to the occupying whereof about husbandry many hands were requisite.</hi> And he
in that Book calls the <hi>Fryers errones maximos,</hi> and desires they might be
treated like <hi>Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars.</hi> And in the <hi>Second Book</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives
a <hi>Model</hi> of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> so as not to make it such a Nusance to the
Civil Government, as the Papal one was, accordingly as has been before
discoursed. For one of his fundamentals there is, <hi>That the Priests should be
very few, and that they should be chosen by the people like other Magistrates,
and with secret voices; and enjoyns to his Priests marriage, and makes them
to be promoted to no power but only to honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> it seems was far then from <hi>Writing at the Pope's Feet,</hi>
(the Character that was afterward given to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s style) and there
was as little occasion for a peace-maker's interposal between him and <hi>Fish,</hi> as
is between two wrangling Lawyers at a Bar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:103047:100"/>
But the matter is well mended with our <hi>English</hi> World since the time of
the <hi>Supplication</hi> of <hi>Beggars,</hi> as appears by the multitudes of the healthy and
robust <hi>Plebs</hi> of our Nation, that Till the Earth and Plough the Sea; and
who by the proportion of the Mony Current coming to their hands, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fortify'd their Vital Spirits with good diet, there is <hi>finis litium,</hi> and an
end of such <hi>Lamentations,</hi> as the beginning of that <hi>Supplication</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>
in part before referred mentions, <hi>viz. Most lamentably complaineth of their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
misery to your Highness, your poor daily Beads-men the wretched hideous
Monsters, on whom scarcely for horrour any eye dare look, the foul unhappy sort
of Lepers and other sore people, needy, impotent, blind, lame, and sick,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>How that their Number is daily so sore encreased, that all the Alms of all the
well disposed people of this your Realm is not half enough to sustain them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but their indigence was extream, when they were to
glean not only after the Reaping of the <hi>Monks,</hi> but after the Ecclesiastick
<hi>Beggars,</hi> the <hi>Fratres Mendicantes,</hi> (or as they were then called <hi>Manducantes</hi>)
had been satiated <hi>in diebus illis,</hi> and when <hi>Holy Church</hi> almost engrossed
not only the wealth but the begging in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And he who now looks on our <hi>English infantry</hi> when they turn their
<hi>Plough-shares</hi> into <hi>Swords,</hi> will see nothing of the horrour of starvelings in
their faces: and the Writ <hi>de leproso amovendo</hi> is in effect obsolete in nature,
as that too <hi>de haeretico comburendo</hi> is abrogated: And within the <hi>Term</hi> of
about twenty years that the Observator of the Bills of Mortality refers his
Calculations to, he mentions but six of 229150 dying of the <hi>Leprosie.</hi> What
the Bills of Mortality in <hi>France</hi> may contain about deaths by the <hi>Leprosie,</hi>
happening there in late years, I know not, but do suppose that the general
Scur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e appearing in the skins of the Pesantry there, condemned to <hi>Sell their
Birth-right</hi> of nature <hi>for no Pottage,</hi> and to eat little of the Corn they Sow,
and to drink as little of the Vines they Plant, and to taste little of Flesh,
save what they have in Alms from the Baskets of the Abbies, and who are
Dieted only for Vassalage, may be an indication of the <hi>Leprosie,</hi> having still
its former effects among them: But our <hi>English</hi> Husband-men are both bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fed and taught, and the poorest people here have so much of brown Bread,
and the Gospel, that by the Calculations on our <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that for so many years past but One of Four Thousand is starved.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore I think by instinct of <hi>Nature,</hi> That our <hi>Yeomanry</hi> in the
Country, though not addicted to mind niceness of Controversie in Religion,
nor to be dealers in the Protestant Faith by Retaile, are great Whole-sale
Traders in it, and will as soon suffer their Ploughs to be took out of their
Hands, as their Bibles from under their Arms: And they have been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
observed since the Plot, and some years before, to manifest in common
discourse their robust abhorrences of <hi>Popery,</hi> as supposing that under that

the Preachers of the contrary Religion are not so frequent with them as in

            <p>But were he now alive he would find the Scene of things changed in our
Country Churches since Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, in whose Reign a <hi>Book</hi>
was printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1585, called <hi>A lamentable complaint of the Commonalty by

He would find that even in the poorest of our Country Parishes (where yet

our Country-Folks with so much understanding, as will render them

Kingdom ready like moyst Wax to have receiv'd the impressions of Popery,
but would have observ'd in them, That with the stubborn and <hi>proverbial
Pride</hi> of a <hi>Russet Coat,</hi> they disdain to draw in the Yoke either of Papacy or
Presbytery, and that they talk of <hi>Popery</hi> as a Religion that would sink down
both their Souls and Bodies to the state of Brutes, and not only make agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture
vail to pasture, but bring them to eat Grass and Hay <hi>more pecudum,</hi>
as a great <hi>Cardinal</hi> bragg'd <hi>that they had almost prepared the Laiety to do,</hi> till
<hi>Luther</hi> shew'd them better things: and if any one who has not heard the stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Anathema's</hi> that our <hi>Rustics</hi> in their Common discourses bestow on Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and who has not observ'd that in Elections for <hi>Knights of the Shire</hi> their
Suffrages are given to the most fiery Zealots against it, shall not have the
same sense with me of the general intense hatred of the Countrey People
egainst Popery, let him Cast his Eye on the <hi>Returns</hi> made in the <hi>Bishops Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>
of the Number of <hi>Papists</hi> above the age of 16, for those two <hi>Diocesses</hi> in
which the glory of our English <hi>Yeomanry</hi> so much abounds, namely of our
<hi>Yeomen of Kent,</hi> and he shall find that the Number of Papists both male and
female was in <hi>Canterbury</hi> Diocess but 142, and in that of <hi>Rochester</hi> 64; and
one would think that the Neighbourhood of <hi>France</hi> might have transplanted
more of the <hi>Popish</hi> Persuasion into those Diocesses.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Traditions</hi> our <hi>Country</hi> People have had from their <hi>Ancestors</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>state</hi> in the days of Popery, have sufficiently <hi>antidoted</hi> them against
the poyson of <hi>Traditions</hi> from Popish Priests and such who would have them
<hi>Traditors</hi> of their English Bibles. They have a joyful <hi>Gusto</hi> of the <hi>Petition
of Right</hi> (as it were) fresh in their Mouths, and fear the being thrown back
to the <hi>supplication of Beggars.</hi> They cannot think of the Times of <hi>Monkery</hi>
here, without thinking of how many of the Plough-men in <hi>England</hi> were then
<hi>Villains,</hi> and that too <hi>Villains</hi> to <hi>Abbies,</hi> for that part of their Land that
was <hi>arable:</hi> they were <hi>Villains regardant</hi> to their <hi>Mannors,</hi> and such as the
<hi>Romans</hi> call'd <hi>adscriptitii glebae.</hi> And 'tis observed by Sir <hi>T. Smith</hi> in his
3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> 
               <hi>Book de Repub. Anglorum,</hi> c. 10. <hi>That the Monks and Fryars when they were
Conversant with the Layety as Confessors in</hi> extremis, <hi>enjoyn'd them in the Court
of Conscience for the honour of Christianity to manumit all their Villains: but</hi>
(saith he) <hi>the said holy Fathers with the Abbots and Priors did not so by
theirs.</hi> And he saith, <hi>Quorum exemplis episcopi insistentes ab ista crudelitate
nisi pretio conducti, aut Calumniis impetiti sero deterreri potuerunt. Dein aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
solo Monasteriis &amp; in manus laicorum recidentibus, libertatem omnes adepti
sunt. i. e.</hi> But at last the Monasteries being levell'd with the ground, they all
gain'd their freedom.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Abbots and Monks formerly affect the Monopoly of ordering
<hi>Villainage:</hi> and the <hi>multiplying</hi> of the people born of their <hi>Villains</hi> by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Generations, did but <hi>multiply</hi> Slaves to the Abbies; and at the same
time they <hi>sow'd</hi> Corn for the Abbys, they <hi>sow'd</hi> their Children too to Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage:
The which is apparent by an <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Convent's formula</hi> of <hi>manumis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time, mention'd in <hi>Blount,</hi> viz. <hi>Omnibus—Frater

But the Children that now come to see the light in <hi>England,</hi> are not <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati
antequam Nati,</hi> Condemned to Servitude before they are born, and our
Yeomen that are above wearing the <hi>Badges</hi> of our <hi>Nobles,</hi> will scorn the Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salage
to <hi>Friers:</hi> and when the <hi>Genius</hi> of the English Nation is so full of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
(and what few Nations can pretend to) that they never make <hi>Slaves</hi> of
their Prisoners of War in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> none I believe will ever see their

            <p>That 40 s. a <hi>Year</hi> that made them in the state of <hi>legales homines heretofore,</hi>
is now become in value 6 l. <hi>per annum:</hi> and as by the encrease of their Wealth
they are the more enabled to go to <hi>Law,</hi> so the <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>William the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
to have mens <hi>Lands</hi> lie <hi>scatter'd</hi> as they are in <hi>Common Fields,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that the multiplicity of Law Sutes occasion'd thereby might divert their
uniting against him, (the which hath been <hi>Commonly</hi> call'd the <hi>Conquerour's
Curse</hi>) hath however enured them to a pugnacious spirit of litigation in the
Law, and the effect of which tough <hi>mettle</hi> of theirs, <hi>Popery</hi> is likely to find if
ever it shall be a <hi>Trespasser</hi> on them: and in fine, Popery need never <hi>balder</hi>
us with any other <hi>miracles,</hi> if it can effect this one, namely, to reconcile
our Husbandmen to love it, and to applaud the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of the <hi>Monks</hi>
that coming in <hi>Sheeps clothing,</hi> would by a <hi>Pasce Oves</hi> make <hi>Pasture</hi> confound
<hi>Tillage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, they are as unlikely ever to effect this, as are any who love
the Noble Sport of <hi>Hunting,</hi> to reduce <hi>England</hi> to its Primitive state, and
more remote then <hi>Pasture,</hi> namely, <hi>Forrest,</hi> (for that and <hi>Marsh</hi> is the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
state of all uncultivated and desolate Lands) tho they should too try to
hunt as with a full cry out of the Scripture into that state, and with the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>Isaia,</hi> cry, <hi>Resonate Montes laudationem, sylva &amp; omne lignum ejus;</hi>
and further tell us of the antiquity of the Divine Right to Forrests appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of those words of the Royal Prophet, <hi>For all the Beasts of the Forrest
are mine, &amp;c.</hi> and should insinuate that 'twas fit to unpeople the Earth of men
to make groves for Gods to inhabit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are told in the</hi> Preface <hi>to</hi> Manwood, <hi>That in the Reigns of</hi> Richard
<hi>the</hi> First, <hi>King</hi> Iohn, <hi>and</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> Second, the Crown had afforrested so
much of the Lands of the Subjects, as that the greatest part of this Realm was
then become Forrest; <hi>but no man is so sensless as to pretend to fear the Return
of any such state in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>And according to the Principles of Sense and reason it may be affirm'd, That
all Monkish hopes of our Ploughmen happening again to be over-run by
Shepherds, are very extravagant, and Popery will grosly err, if it shall think
that Poverty will ever compel this sort of men to the turpitude of taking up
illegal Arms for it, or that it can eradicate their innate hatred against it.</p>
            <p>The Subsistence that the Plough afforded our Husbandmen in their
Trade, made few of them in Comparison of those of other Trades, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Souldiers in our late Civil Warrs: Nor were they then observ'd
to favour those hyhocritical <hi>Religion-Traders</hi> the Land was then pester'd
with. Nor indeed can they who really Till and Improve the Earth, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
affect those who pretend to Cultivate Heaven; and by necessity
of Nature it must still come to pass, that they who acquire their own bread
by rearing it for others with hard labour, will have an aversion against
those who can subsist luxuriously, by cheating others of it with easie Tricks,
and against any attempts for a Resetled <hi>Monkery,</hi> which would, after the <hi>mode</hi>
of the <hi>Pyed Piper,</hi> demand an unconscionable rate for trying to rid us of a
few <hi>haeretical Mice,</hi> and which too tho our Land should pay, would yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate
it of its Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:103047:101"/>
And here I cannot forbear to Observe, That there happen'd one thing so
momentous, that it can never be forgot while the <hi>English</hi> Nation has a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and which did among our people in the Country Convey a fresh sense
of the Pestilential nature of Popery, and of the encreasing Danger of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and that is, that the Body of our Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
did generally from the Press and Pulpit for some Years together send so
many strong Antidotes against Popery round the Kingdom. Every Pulpit
almost from one end of the Land to the other did resound, as I may say, with
a <hi>Seasonable discourse against Popery.</hi> It may be with Justice apply'd to those
<hi>Discourses</hi> of our <hi>Divines,</hi> That they alarmed more than our <hi>English</hi> World,
or perhaps the <hi>Roman,</hi> and that the World elsewhere did ring with their
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; I here allude to those words in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
Their sound went into all the Earth, and their words to the ends of the World.</hi>
There is no doubt but their <hi>Sound</hi> was heard to <hi>Rome</hi> by the help of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
intelligence, and that our <hi>Divines</hi> knew when they so Preach'd and Writ,
they had pass'd the <hi>Rubicon,</hi> and that 'twas in vain like <hi>Cranmer</hi> to try to be
reconciled to irreconcileable <hi>Rome,</hi> and that 'twould be as much in vain in
any Course of future time to use politic whispers in Commendation of Popery
after their former loudness against it, as for one who told a Husband that he
saw such an one strugling to ravish his Wife, to say afterward that he was a
very Civil Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Fanaticks</hi> therefore do by nothing more deserve that Name, then by
nick-naming the Body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as fautors of
Popery, since 'twas <hi>but of yesterday</hi> that almost all our First and Second Rate
Divines did like <hi>Capital</hi> Ships (as I may say) one after another attaque the
Fleet of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and discharge their Thunder upon them: but as my
Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath observ'd, That in great Sounds the Continuance is more
than momentany, and that the noyse of Great Ordnance, of which the Sound
is carry'd many miles on the Land, and much further on the Sea, will there
come to the Ear not in the instant of the shooting off, but an hour or more
later, the which must needs be the Continuance of the first Sound; Thus too,
I hope, that the aforesaid late <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of our Capital <hi>Divines</hi> against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
which has been heard far and near among our Countery Inhabitants,
(and will I believe Continue audible among them during the hour of life) will
in part of that <hi>hour,</hi> sooner or later, be heard with <hi>regard</hi> by our weaker <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what a <hi>Daemon</hi> then in understanding, or <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Eloquence</hi> had he need to
think himself, and to be thought too such by others, who Imagines to talk <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
both out of its <hi>Manna</hi> of Religion, and what is better then its <hi>Flesh-Pots</hi>
too, and to persuade us by bringing in <hi>Monkery</hi> again, to have our Land ore-run
with Flocks of Sheep, and to want hands to Work their Fleeces, or (as I may say)
to fancy to have Manufacture without hands; and for want thereof, to make our
Sheep almost useless but only to eat, and in that way too to be chiefly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the Stomachs of <hi>Lubbers;</hi> and, who would allow our Land Flocks
of Sheep, but not Dogs to guard them; I mean a sufficient growing <hi>Populacy</hi>
in the Land to defend both it, and the very Flocks in it, and I may add too,
who would almost make the Wooll of our Sheep useless but only to send into
Forrain Parts; and who would abdicate from the Land that benefit of the
continual passing of our <hi>Wooll</hi> here through so many hands busy'd in Trade,
and thence fill'd with Wealth in the way of <hi>Interest upon Interest</hi> intended by
Nature for the maintenance and subsistance of our People, so <hi>multiplying</hi> as
aforesaid, and preparing Tables for all new Guests here, let them come into the
World never so fast; and would have us Consent to the diminution of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103047:102"/>
Number of our People, when for want of our being fully stock'd with them,
so great a part of our Land lyes fallow every Year, as doth not in Countreys
sufficiently Populous, and where the Lands value will quit the cost of the
Manuring.</p>
            <p>Alas; when through the Divine Blessing <hi>England</hi> shall arrive at the state
of being fully Peopled, and being got beyond <hi>Pasture,</hi> that <hi>first</hi> improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a thin Peopled Country, shall likewise have Compleated <hi>that second</hi>
of <hi>Tillage,</hi> that our being better Peopled will occasion, there will lie a <hi>third</hi> in
our View to employ the Labours of our Consummate <hi>Populacy,</hi> namely that
of <hi>Gardening,</hi> and to oblige us that the Earth shall produce nothing but what
is exactly useful: and instead of going back from <hi>Tillage</hi> to <hi>Pasture,</hi> we must
naturally go forward from <hi>Tillage</hi> to <hi>Gardening,</hi> whereby one <hi>Acre</hi> may be
made to maintain Twenty persons, whereas now 'tis observ'd that 20 <hi>Acres</hi>
generally throughout <hi>England</hi> maintain but a fourth of that number, <hi>viz.</hi>
5. persons.</p>
            <p>And when we are thus furnished with as many People as by Tillage or
Gardening can well live on the <hi>Land,</hi> 'tis then, and not before, that our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
Populousness will push on greater numbers of our Inhabitants to live
on the <hi>Sea,</hi> which none will choose to do, that can live on the Shoare: and
'tis only such a state of populacy that can naturally make us Masters of the
<hi>Fishing-Trade;</hi> to compass which, all our Projects before, whether by <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Companies</hi> and <hi>Stock,</hi> will be but <hi>Chymerical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, 'tis only such a state of <hi>Populacy</hi> that will exonerate us of those
burdens of the Earth, and scandals to Heaven, I mean all <hi>Religion-Traders,</hi>
whether <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Fanatical,</hi> those vilest of <hi>Nominales</hi> who cheat <hi>in nomine
Domini,</hi> and such likewise who disquiet States by assuming the Trade of
<hi>World-menders,</hi> and everlasting <hi>Propounders,</hi> that are like busie <hi>Insects</hi> flying
in the Eys of Mankind, (and whom Sir <hi>E. Coke</hi> in the 85. <hi>Ch.</hi> of his <hi>Institutes,</hi>
which is entituled against <hi>Monopolists, Propounders and Projectors,</hi> deservedly
brands) and <hi>Atheists</hi> that would reform a Church, Bankrupts in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Trades that would advance Trade in general, Defiers of Justice who
would amend the Law, and wasting that time as <hi>Censors</hi> of the Manners of
Kings for not paying their Debts, which they should employ in acquiring
<hi>Assets</hi> to pay their own: In fine, Undertakers to Cure Church and State as
Confident as the <hi>Quack</hi> who said in his Bills, <hi>He Cureth all Diseases both cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and incureable.</hi> All these sorts of men whose <hi>Trade</hi> is talking, and whose
talk is cheat, will only come to be <hi>Bankrupt</hi> by being heaved out of all places
by the Generations of Useful Traders multiplying there. Nature that has
been long laying its Siege to such <hi>Idlers</hi> in places of resort, will then at last
carry on its works so far as to leave them no Earth to play their Engines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and such unprofitable people will be as naturally extruded out of our
Towns, as are Women and Children out of Places besieged: nor can all the
<hi>humming</hi> of their <hi>Propositions</hi> procure them more continuance in such places
of business, then the noyse of Drones entitle them to a residence in the Hive;
and it will as little quit Cost to have them planted in our Cities, as for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner
that pays a high Rent to have beds for weeds.</p>
            <p>Of the Improvement of great quantities of Land by Gardening, the <hi>Ilands</hi>
of <hi>Iersey</hi> and <hi>Guernsey,</hi> are examples: and we have a Pleasant and Profitable
Prospect of such Improvement near our <hi>Metropolis</hi> and other Great Cities;
and I doubt not but <hi>England</hi> may flourish so as to become the <hi>Garden</hi> of the

Aided by the acuteness of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (I referr to his similitude of the Corn)

by a bold instrument of Eternity drawn by a small Scriveners Boy, be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
Conveyed to any Lay-man and his Heirs for ever.</p>
            <p>I know that the present State of that part of the Land of <hi>England</hi> that
was aliend from the Church, is such that it bears not the price of years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
it did before the <hi>Plott,</hi> and that it is according to the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>become a drug</hi> as to Moneys being taken up on it in comparison of
other Lands: and it is obvious to consider how much herein the Plott
hath prejudiced the Wealth and Trade of the Kingdom, in making so great
a part of the Land in some regard comparatively useless to the Possessors:
but I likewise know that hereby Popery will be no gainer, for that 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
that the owners of it will be indefatigable in the use of all means
lawful to bring Popery to such a State, as shall make any men ashamed
to say they fear it.</p>
            <p>Tho <hi>Holy Church</hi> that everlasting <hi>Minor,</hi> that <hi>Minor</hi> like Sir <hi>Thomas
Mores</hi> Child that he said would be always one, will be still labouring the
Resumption of what was alien'd from it (and hence I believe it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
that our Kings thô in the eye of the Law always at full Age, have
thought fit to learn from <hi>Holy Church</hi> the Priviledge too of being reputed
<hi>Minors</hi> or <hi>Infants</hi> in Law, for so the Books call them, that upon occasion
they may <hi>resume</hi> what was <hi>alien'd</hi> from the Crown) and thô the hopes of
such resumption would be a bait to help Popery to Multitudes of Proselytes,
yet the people <hi>imagine a vain thing</hi> who think such resuming practicable in
<hi>England,</hi> and especially at this time if the <hi>Calculation</hi> of the <hi>Ebb</hi> of the
Coinage of <hi>England</hi> be as is contain'd in <hi>Britannia languens, viz.</hi> from the
foremention'd period of <hi>May</hi> 1657, to <hi>November</hi> 1675, (near <hi>another
nineteen years</hi>) 3, 238, 997 <hi>l. 16s.</hi> ¾, a Calculation that I think cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
but by the <hi>Records</hi> in the <hi>Pipe Office,</hi> where annual account of the
Money Coined in the Mint are preserved, or by <hi>Ballances</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> made up
from that time, whereby the exportations eminently preponderating what is
imported, would evince what considerable quantities of Bullion have been
Coyned, or by our knowing that since that time <hi>Sterling Silver</hi> has not still
obtain'd the <hi>Price</hi> of 5<hi>s 2d an Ounce, a price</hi> that it has not indeed fall'n
short of in <hi>England</hi> about these twenty years past, and therefore before the
late <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Coynage,</hi> could never be entertain'd by the <hi>Mint</hi> to be <hi>Coyn'd,</hi>
which was by its Law and Course necessarily restrain'd from giving for <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
Silver above 5 <hi>s. the Ounce,</hi> and which Rate and no more it did afford
when the <hi>Ballance</hi> of Trade favouring us caus'd that vast Coynage mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the former <hi>Ternary</hi> of <hi>nineteen years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:103047:104"/>
But in fine, his Majesties Royal Goodness to his People in not only quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what did accrue to him for <hi>Coynage,</hi> but being at the expence of the
Coyning the most exquisite sort of Money in the Known world, and such
as in Curiosity does equal Meddals, is an indication of the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi>
not having employed the Mint sufficiently in making for his Subjects the
<hi>Medium</hi> of Commerce; and for the depression of the Trade not only of
the <hi>English</hi> but of more then the <hi>European</hi> World, the Usurper <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
is to be justly blamed, who not long after the wounds <hi>England</hi> had felt
by the <hi>Munster</hi> Peace, did harrass us by his fantastick War with <hi>Spain,</hi>
which not only impoverish'd <hi>England</hi> but the Trading World, and forcibly
obstructing the Returns of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Plate Fleets, did particularly put
both <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> under a necessity of making that Peace that gave
the <hi>French</hi> Crown its leasure to trouble the World.</p>
            <p>But let any one judge then how ridiculous it is to suppose, that the
Trade of the Nation must not, as I may say, shut up Shop, if half its wealth
should be again juggled into the hands of a few Ecclesiasticks, and the old
Trade between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> be renew'd of giving the Pope <hi>Gold</hi> for
<hi>Lead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must indeed be acknowledged by all who have conversed with History
that the absolute and unbounded Power with which the <hi>Eastern</hi> Monararchs
Governed their Kingdoms, did not more require an excessive share of the
publick Revenue to feed standing Armies then Priests, who with their Idols
and Superstitions, and Crafts, did awe and delude People into obedience:
but as in orderly Commonwealths there is no need of such an immense
Charge for Artifice to make men obey themselves, so in our Constitution
of the <hi>English</hi> Government, it being justly to be supposed, that we have
all the desireable, solid and substantial freedom that any Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
can import, besides the insignificance of the name of it (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant
we may well call it who remember that our late real Oligarchists
<hi>took</hi> not only <hi>the name of God,</hi> but the name of a Commonwealth <hi>in vain</hi>)
and are to the envy of Forraigners, and shame of our former Domestick
Propounders, blessed with the Soveraign Power of a <hi>Great and Glorious
King over a free and happy People</hi> (as the words of the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi>
are in one of his <hi>Declarations</hi>) it may be well said to any one who shall
talk of giving half the profits of the Realm to use Art, and Imposture
to make Members obey their Head so constituted, <hi>quorsum perditio
haec?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in a word, to come closer to the Case of Popery, any one that
would have half the Revenue of the Kingdom given to Impostors for the
making a Monarch only half a King, or King but of half his People, and
for the tricking both him and them into a blind obedience to a Forraign
Head, and for the making a Forraign Power Arbitrary and absolute, is a
very bad Land-Merchant, and knoweth not the use or value of the soyle of
<hi>England,</hi> and will never find the half of 25 Millions of Acres sold for
Chains and Fetters, and will be put to the trouble of taking out the Writ,
<hi>de idiota inquirendo</hi> against at least three Millions who have already out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted
him, and will never think a Forraign <hi>Minor</hi> and whose concessions are
resumable, fit to be their Guardian, and account it a very preposterous thing
that since our <hi>Saviour</hi> refused to <hi>divide</hi> an Inheritance, his pretended <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>
should do nothing else.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Holy Churches resuming</hi> all its Lands out of <hi>Lay</hi> hands,
would appear the more strange in <hi>England</hi> when we see (as my Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<hi>Bramhal</hi> saith in his <hi>vindication of the Church of</hi> England, p. 212) that
the very <hi>Kings of</hi> Spain <hi>impose Pensions usually on Ecclesiastical preferments
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103047:105"/>
to the</hi> 4th <hi>part of the value, and particularly one Pension on the Arch-Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
of</hi> Sivile <hi>in favour of an Infant of</hi> Castile <hi>of greater value then all the
Pensions there imposed by the Pope;</hi> and when we know that the <hi>French</hi>
King doth for the behoof of so great a number of <hi>Lay-men,</hi> impose so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great Pensions on the Abbeys without saying to the Abbots more
then <hi>Car tel est nostre plaisir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edwyn Sands</hi> in his <hi>Europae Speculum</hi> writ in the Year 1599, and in
the time of <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> speaking of that Kingdom, saith,
<hi>That there the Church Prelacies and other Governments of Souls, are made the
Fees and Charges of meer Courtiers and Soldiers:</hi> and our excellent Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adverter
on <hi>Monsieur Sorbier</hi> reflecting on that Country, Intimates in effect
how <hi>there the chiefest spiritual dignities are entailed upon Families, and
possest by Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who unjustly cry out of the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
for interrupting the <hi>Trade</hi> of the Kingdom, would be loud enough in their
Complaints of <hi>Omnia comesta à Belo</hi> under Popery.</p>
            <p>He who knows not that the <hi>Revenue</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> now depends in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
solely upon Trade, and that Trade depends on populousness, and that
the encouragement of people to live under any Government, is that great
thing, call'd <hi>Property</hi> in their Estates, Religion, and Laws, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any thing that calls it self <hi>Religion,</hi> that goes to exterminate <hi>above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty persons for every one it leaves</hi> (for so the <hi>Proportion</hi> between
<hi>Non-Papists</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> by the Bishops survey <hi>made</hi> about the <hi>Year</hi> 1676,
was return'd to be) and to call them <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and which makes their
<hi>Goods</hi> and life <hi>ipso facto</hi> a forfeit of the Law, will not <hi>ipso facto</hi> exterminate
Trade, is fitter for the <hi>Galleys</hi> or a Trading Voyage to the <hi>Anticyrae,</hi> then
for any discourse of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship hath in your <hi>Travels</hi> sufficiently seen it long since exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified,
that the <hi>Protestant</hi> Countries for the quantity of Ground exceed
the <hi>Popish</hi> in Trade, and numbers of People, and that thus the Protestant
<hi>Hanse</hi> Towns have eclipsed their <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Neighbours; and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,
Antwerp,</hi> and the <hi>Vnited Provinces, Flanders,</hi> and that in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
where the Ecclesiasticks are Proprietors of seven parts of ten of the
whole Country, Levies of Men and Money for the defence thereof have
been made, with so much slowness and difficulty, and been so inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as not to have secured themselves against Invaders.</p>
            <p>Nor did the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> there think it worth their while, to strain
themselves in Contributions to resist an Invader who is of their own Religion
(the which made the <hi>French</hi> Kings Victories there flie like Lightning) more
then our over-rich <hi>English</hi> Regulars did to oppose <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror,
when he came here under the Popes Banner. And thus were they here, and in
<hi>Flanders</hi> are like <hi>Wenns</hi> in the Body which draw to themselves much nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and are of great trouble and no use, and thus ridiculous is it that so over
great a part of the property of the Land, should be linked to persons, who
are no way linked to the interest of the Country, more then professed Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Empyrics and Soldiers of Fortune, and are no more damnified by
Popish Invaders, then Fishes of the Sea are by Earth-Quakes.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand in the United-Provinces, how easily and soon are
vast Taxes raised when their All is at Stake, &amp; to what a prodigious encrease
of the numbers of their People have they attain'd since the Reformation?
insomuch that the Author of a Political discourse of <hi>the Interest of</hi> Holland
<hi>Printed</hi> in <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1669, and <hi>Licensed</hi> by <hi>Iohn de Witt</hi> and by
<hi>Van Beaumont,</hi> makes the <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> to be 2 <hi>Millions</hi>
and 400 <hi>thousand,</hi> and so likewise doth <hi>Pellerus</hi> in his Learned <hi>Notes</hi> on
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103047:105"/>
               <hi>Klockius de Aerario</hi> p. 300. and there cites that Book of <hi>the interest of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
when as <hi>Gerard Malynes</hi> in his <hi>Lex mercatoria</hi> makes the People in
<hi>Flanders</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1622 to have consisted of <hi>a hundred and forty thousand
Families,</hi> and he reckoning each of them one with an other at 5 persons,
makes the <hi>Total</hi> of the people in <hi>Flanders</hi> to have then amounted but to
<hi>seven hundred thousand Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet as that Author of the <hi>interest of Holland</hi> saith, the Province of
<hi>Holland</hi> can hardly make 400 thousand profitable Acres or <hi>Morgens</hi> of
Land, <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Heath</hi> not put in, and that the 8<hi>th</hi> part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Holland</hi> cannot be nourished with what is growing there: but
tells us what prodigious Granaries they there have, and that <hi>Amsterdam</hi>
that in the <hi>Year</hi> 1571 was about 200 <hi>Morgens</hi> or <hi>Acres</hi> of Land, was in the
year 1650 enlarged to 600 <hi>Morgens</hi> or Acres of Land in Circumference,
and to have in it <hi>three hundred thousand</hi> Souls.</p>
            <p>And the defence of the <hi>Zelanders</hi> Choice <hi>Printed</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1673,
mentions <hi>Aitsmas Liere</hi> to have reckon'd the publick Incomes of <hi>Holland</hi>
alone in the Year 1643, to have amounted to 1100 thousand pound <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi>
and the Author of the <hi>Interest of Holland</hi> saith, that in one Year in
a time of Peace, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Year 1664 the Inhabitants of <hi>Holland</hi> did over
and above the Customes and other Domains of the Earls or States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
pay towards the publick Charge as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the States of <hi>Holland</hi> 11 Millions of <hi>Gilders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Admiralty of the <hi>Maze, 472 898 Gilders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Admiralty of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> 2 Millions of <hi>Gilders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Admiralty of the <hi>Northern</hi> Quarter, 200 thousand <hi>Guilders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which comes to in all about 14 hundred, 87 thousand Pounds <hi>Sterling.</hi>
How meanly do the Atchievements of <hi>Venice,</hi> and their Efforts to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize
their Republick, compared with <hi>Hollands</hi> shew in story, for the
quantity of years many times doubled since the <hi>Dutch</hi> threw off the Yoke
of the Papacy! History hath recorded the longevity of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>The very Religion of Popery makes the <hi>Venetians</hi> more narrow in their
principles, and even in their Rules of Traffick then are the Inhabitants of
Protestant Countries. The Popish Religion doth hamper its devout Professors
as to Trading with Hereticks, and holding Communication with such as are
<hi>ipso jure &amp; ipso facto</hi> excommunicated, and giving any Quarentine to men
said to be infected with Heresie, insomuch that we are told in <hi>D' Ossat</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>Part. 2d.</hi> That the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> would not suffer the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador

               <hi>Sir</hi> William Temple <hi>in the</hi> 5th <hi>Chapter of his Observations</hi> on the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to be the oppression of Mens Consciences, or Persecution in their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Estates, and Lives on the pretence of Religion;</hi> and it may be truly said
that by their <hi>buying the truth</hi> at the Rate of such high Taxes as they now
pay, and not <hi>selling</hi> it either to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> they have been no losers; for
many good Artists and wealthy Fugitives have brought their Persons and
Families and Estates to them for shelter, from the Storm of Papal Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103047:106"/>
and daily continue so to do; insomuch that the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>the Zelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Choice in</hi> Sect. 3. Observes <hi>that of late years some of the Wise Men of
the Reformed Religion in</hi> France, <hi>being fearful of its being there utterly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted,
have required their Children by their last Wills and Testaments to
leave</hi> France <hi>and settle themselves in the Vnited Provinces:</hi> and in so doing,
they bestowed rich Legacies on <hi>Holland,</hi> each head of any new comer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>The late great late accession of Protestant strangers to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> hath
caused many new houses to be there built, and hath raised the Rents of the

of all Sects</hi> do hear Men speak in their own Language, <hi>and what
they think most Musical to them,</hi> the wonderful works of God.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Enemies to Monarchy to ascribe the flourshing State of
<hi>Holland,</hi> to its former throwing the Power of the State-holder, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
General out of the Ballance of their Government. Their breaking
down the Banks of his Authority, introduced the sudden inundation of the
<hi>French</hi> Power among them, that they had else been more secured against
then the Assaults of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and not have so perfectly forgot the Art and
Nature of Defensive War in their Frontiers: and thô it may seem plausible
that an Animal, supposed to have most heads, will have most brains, and
that Republicks are more apprehensive of their true interest then other
Governments, yet to the Reproach of such Politicks it appear'd, that when
the Regnant Faction in <hi>Holland</hi> were no more headed by a Captain General
or State-holder, and had thrown the poise of his Power out of the Scales,
they grew so vain, as thô they had no Capital Ships, yet to become aggres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
in a Naval War against <hi>England,</hi> that had Ships enow of that kind to
affright the World, and of which War the Result was the abolishing their

               </gap> 
               <hi>England,</hi> from whence their forced frequenting of our
Harbours, still occasions their exporting more of our Commodities then we
import of theirs. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>However so vast yet is their Navigation, and the number of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
that thô we <hi>need them not</hi> for our <hi>Carriers,</hi> both <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi>
do: and to which Kingdoms they have and probably will for some Ages to
come, have the honour and profit to be Carriers, how much soever <hi>France</hi>
is or seems to be fear'd by us: and thus that <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Interest of Holland</hi>
tells us, viz. <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>have very few Ships and Marriners of their own,
so that almost all their Traffick for</hi> Holland (<hi>some few</hi> English <hi>Ships of Trade
excepted) is driven by</hi> Dutch <hi>Ships, and that when any Goods are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from one</hi> French <hi>Haven to another, they are laden on Board</hi> Dutch
<hi>Vessels, and that as to</hi> Spain, <hi>that it hath so few Marriners and Ships that
since the Peace between them and</hi> Holland, <hi>they have used to hire</hi> Dutch
<hi>Ships to sail to the</hi> Indies.</p>
            <p>And therefore when I consider what that ingenious Author hath thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed,
and that Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> in a <hi>Manuscript</hi> discourse in the Year 1671/2, hath
Calculated the number of the Total of the Seamen, who are Subjects of
<hi>France</hi> to be 15000, and that a great and fatal diminution of the
number of them since happen'd in the Year 1678, by so many of their
then perishing under <hi>D' Estre</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and that as the Author of
<hi>Britannia languens</hi> saith, <hi>The</hi> Dutch <hi>have at least 10 times as many Seamen
as the</hi> English, I shall venture to conclude that more then all the Millions
of Mankind now living will be dissolved to Ashes before (humanly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103047:106"/>
it will be possible for <hi>France</hi> to over-ballance either the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>

at Sea, and whoever they are that pretend to fear the Contrary, I think
they do but pretend to fear it.</p>
            <p>But at once to return to the consideration of the gain <hi>Holland</hi> hath from
fresh <hi>Advenae,</hi> and to take my leave of it, all old Trades being there fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
such new comers are forced to dig up a new Soile of Trade and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
as I may call it, for their subsistance; and thus at the Charge of their
Experiments the Country is enriched: and many new Artists there bring
with them their old experimented Arts, and thus 'tis known that an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-man</hi>
from <hi>Yarmouth</hi> coming to be an Inhabitant among them, taught
them the rich <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the Fishing Trade: and since they disused to
pray to dead <hi>Saints</hi> in the way of Popery, they have found living Saints
praying to them to be admitted to live with them, and have not only had
the honour to entertain <hi>Saints,</hi> but <hi>by being not forgetful to entertain Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
they have unawares entertain'd Angels</hi> (as the Scripture expression is)
and such who have proved <hi>tutelar</hi> ones to their Country and Religion.</p>
            <p>No marvel therefore if the Learned <hi>Divine,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Defence
of the</hi> Zelanders <hi>Choice,</hi> doth there so pathetically pronounce his opinion,
<hi>that if ever the Protestant Religion shall leave</hi> Holland, <hi>that Country may be
called</hi> Ichabod, i. e. <hi>the Glory is departed from it.</hi>

            <p>And here I should be injurious to the Political <hi>Energy</hi> of the Reformation
in <hi>England,</hi> if I should not observe how vastly it has contributed to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the value of our Land, and the number of the people and the extent
of our Commerce, and indeed of Commerce it self.</p>
            <p>It was not long before the Reformation that the Kings and People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
maintained themselves chiefly by <hi>Sheperdry,</hi> and the Kings and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Tillage,</hi> and their great improvement in Manufacture,
bears Date but from <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>ths</hi> time. The great <hi>Scene</hi> of <hi>Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi>
was not open'd in <hi>Europe</hi> till about 6, or 7 hundred years ago, and till
then none were there worthy the names of Merchants except some few in
the Republicks of <hi>Italy,</hi> who lived in the Mediterranean parts trading with
the <hi>Indian</hi> Caravans in the <hi>Levant,</hi> or driving some inland Trade, and then
and some hundreds of years afterward, the Nations in the worst Soil of <hi>Europe</hi>
being the greatest breeders, and having superfluity of nothing but people,
had no invention for living but by being Murderers, and by the boysterous
Trade of Fighting their way into better Quarters: and during that dark
and Iron Age that produced Herds of Men void of knowledge, there was
nothing in humane Conversation or discourse valuable; and in our <hi>European</hi>
World it was scarce worth Men a few steps to gain one anothers acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
but on the gradual encrease of knowledge there, Men found a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
way at once with delight and profit to exchange Notions and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of Traffick, and the Protestant Religion at last drawing up the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that kept all things obscure on that Stage of the World, Men being
better taught the knowledge of the God of Nature and of Nature it
self, were grown worth one anothers knowledge, and were for the
surprizing brightness of their intellectual Talents gazed on by the wondring
World, like in <hi>Machines,</hi> Gods coming down out of Clouds, and it was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the bounty of Heaven, then to spread on the Earth the Commerce
of Men and the <hi>Medium</hi> of <hi>Commerce</hi> too, and to allow them to converse
together with more splendor by the <hi>Donative</hi> of the <hi>American Mines</hi> when
the dawn of the knowledge a little before that of the Reformation had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
them conversable Creatures, and fit for the interviews of one another:
and shortly afterwards by a mighty encrease of Navigation, <hi>many did pass to
and fro, and knowledge was more and more encreased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:103047:107"/>
Thus as I have some where read of a saying of one of the <hi>Fathers,
Deus ambit nos donis &amp; formâ suâ,</hi> the Divine Goodness provided that the
World should <hi>Espouse</hi> the beauty of the Reformation with a great <hi>Dowry,</hi>
and that it should appear particularly in <hi>England</hi> with the great Figure that
<hi>Wisdom</hi> makes in the <hi>Proverbs, Length of days is in her right hand, and in
her left hand riches and honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth is conspicuous in our <hi>English</hi> History that former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of some Efforts of Trade, and of some, of withstanding the Papal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
were alway contemporary, and liv'd and dy'd together, and they
were no sooner risen out of the Grave where the barbarity of former times
depressed them, but they were again found in one anothers Embraces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Stock and Wealth of the Kingdom, is vastly encreased since</hi>
Harry <hi>the</hi> 8ths <hi>time, is visible to any one who considers what</hi> Stow <hi>saith
in his</hi> Annals <hi>on the</hi> Year 1523, <hi>the</hi> 15th <hi>Year of his Reign,</hi> That when
in a Parliament held at <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> and where Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> was
Speaker, 800000 <hi>l.</hi> was required to be raised of the fifth part of every mans
Goods and Lands, that is 4<hi>s,</hi> of every Pound to be paid in 4 years: but it
was denyed, and it was proved manifestly that if the fifth part of the substance
of the Realm were but 800000 <hi>l,</hi> and if Men should pay to the King the fifth
part of their Goods in Money or Plate, that there was not so much Money out
of the Kings, hands in all the Realm: for the fifth part of every Mans Goods is
not in Money or Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then consequently if all the Money were brought
to the Kings hands, then Men must barter Cloath for Victuals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there
it was further Argued that the King had by way of Loan 2 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound
(which is 400000 <hi>l.</hi>) and if he had 4 <hi>s.</hi> more in the Pound, 'twould amount to
1200000 <hi>l,</hi> which is almost the 3<hi>d</hi> part of every Mans Goods, which in Coyn
cannot be had within the Realm.</p>
            <p>That the Merchandizing Trade of <hi>England</hi> was before the Reformation,
and sometime after managed chiefly by Forraigners, we Learn out of <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s
<hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> p. 108, where he saith that <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th, Supprest the
Corporation of Merchant Strangers, the Merchants of the Stilyard, concerning
which we are to know that the</hi> English <hi>in the times foregoing being neither
strong in Shipping, nor much accustomed to the Sea, received all such Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
as were not of the growth of their own Country from the hands of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
resorting hither from all parts to upbraid our laziness, namely Merchants
known by the name of</hi> Easterlings, <hi>who brought hither Wheat and Rye and Grain,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>for their encouragement wherein they were amply priviledged and exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from many impositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall here deduce a proof of the growth of the Revenue of the Nation,
from the growth of that of the Church, and to prove that the Revenue of the
Church &amp; Nation of <hi>England</hi> were in the year 1660 about <hi>Quintuple,</hi> to what
they were at the time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> I shall say first that <hi>Godwin</hi> in his
Catalogue of <hi>Bishops,</hi> makes the Revenue of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops
to be valued at the time of the Reformation near 22000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi>
and if we admit the Revenue of the Deans and Chapters, to be double the
Sum, <hi>viz. 44000 l.</hi> then will the whole Revenue of the Hierarchy appear to
have been then 66000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Cornelius Burgess,</hi> a Man vers'd in the speculative and practick
part of Sacriledge, doth in his <hi>Book</hi> concerning Sacriledge call'd <hi>Two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,</hi>
and Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, affirm that the Bishops, Deans, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Lands, were at the end of the late Civil War sold for <hi>two Million three
hundred thousand pounds,</hi> and he saith, there was offer'd since his Majesties
Restoration <hi>seven hundred thousand pounds</hi> more to confirm that Sale:
whereby the value of the said Land is made to be in the year 1660, 3 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:103047:107"/>
And Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in his Printed <hi>Speech</hi> in the House of Commons on
<hi>Monday the 4th of</hi> December 1648. <hi>touching the satisfactoriness of the Kings
Answers to the Propositions of both Houses,</hi> doth in Page 68 there affirm,
<hi>That near one half of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops Possessions and Revenues
consists in Impropriations, Tithes, Pensions, and the like;</hi> and if we may
suppose the like as to the Revenues of the <hi>Deans and Chapters,</hi> then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Estimate will the value of the whole Revenue of the Hierarchy
of our Church be about 6 Millions, the twentieth part whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> at
twenty years Purchase is 300,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and the 12<hi>th</hi> part of the
same, <hi>viz.</hi> at 12 years purchase is 500,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> so that what at the time
of the Reformation was worth but 66000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> was in the Year
1660 worth between 300, and 500000 <hi>l.</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>In the next place I shall prove the Remainder of my Position that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the whole Nation is about <hi>Quintupled</hi> also; for that the Revenue
of the demolished Monasteries was, as <hi>my Lord Herbert</hi> in his <hi>Harry</hi> the
8<hi>th,</hi> makes it 1 <hi>hundred 61 thousand pound per Annum,</hi> and the Revenue of the
whole Church about <hi>Triple</hi> to that Sum, <hi>viz.</hi> About 450000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi>
and the Revenue of the whole Nation between <hi>triple</hi> and <hi>quadruple</hi> to the
Revenue of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>Million 6 Hundred Thousand Pound per
Annum:</hi> but careful <hi>Calculators</hi> in these times have computed the same to
be about 8 Millions <hi>per Annum,</hi> which is quintuple to the said 1 Million 6
Hundred Thousand Pound above mentioned.</p>
            <p>And as to the proportion of the Trade and Traffick of <hi>England</hi> encrease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
since the Reformation, little more need be added to what
I have before discoursed then that the Customes, which when Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
came to the Crown, made but 36000 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> were since 1660,
farm'd at 4 <hi>hundred thousand Pound per Annum,</hi> and have since that time
made about double that Sum. And because She foresaw that that Branch
of the Revenue would both support the Crown and the Walls of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
I mean its Ships and Sea-men, she wisely provided for the encrease of the
Customs and Navigation in her own and future times by the <hi>Planting</hi> of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi>
and was the Foundress of our Trade in the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, that is
at this day so beneficial to the King and Kingdom, and where no Forraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
can Trade without his Majesties leave (and therefore the Freight both
outwards and homewards is restrain'd to our own Shipping) and where
the Scene of entercourse is agreeable to the Genius of so many of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Traders of <hi>England,</hi> and not troubling them with the sight of the
Religion, or with the Study of the Language of <hi>Popish</hi> Countries. And
as in any great important undertakings, the first projectors or undertakers
do usually but lay the Foundation of Gain for the next comers, thus too
did providence order it to be in the Case of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Acquests of <hi>America,</hi>
which were so fatal to the diminution of the strength of <hi>Spain,</hi> and fortunate
to the encrease of that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was by the means of the advancement of the Protestant Religion
that she was so prosperous in her mighty Attempts of advancing Trade
and Navigation. 'Tis notorious how by making her Realm and <hi>Asylum</hi> to
Forraign oppressed Protestants, She enriched it with the Manufactures they
introduced, in her great Towns and Cities, and where the value of
House-Rent being by that means raised, the Manufacturers were
enforced to work harder, and the encreasing of their corporal hard labour
did tend to the encrease of their Generations and Populacy as it did among
the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and it had a greater tending to that effect, in regard
that our People in their Towns were their own <hi>Task-masters,</hi> and could
console themselves with the thoughts not of going but being gone out
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103047:108"/>
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they were rendred the more industrious by the knowing
that they were secure from having the fruit of their labours swept away from
themselves and their Children by Arbitrary Confessors and Priests, a thing
that was practised by those who formerly made <hi>England</hi> in effect but a
<hi>Province</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and when more Money was exported hence by Appeals
and Applications to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> then is here imported from <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and when as in <hi>Turky</hi> men are dicouraged from enriching themselves tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
industry and improvement by the Grand <hi>Signiors</hi> being the general
Heir, our Fore-fathers too were by the Popes being so much here in the
same capacity. In fine, the value of the Benefices of the Divines in those
great Towns, being partly encreas'd by the growing Numbers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and their riches, and partly by their liberal contributions did invite thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such men of Learning to the Pastorage of Souls, as did by their fame
invite more inhabitants, and did keep up those Towns by the Cement of
Religion in such a state, that they were Seminaries of Knowledge to the
Adjacent Countries, and even Magazines of War for the Princes occasions,
as well as Store-houses of Manufacture to be exported: and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Arch-Bishop <hi>Grindal</hi> in his Letter to Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno Domini
1580, Printed</hi> in <hi>Fullers Church History</hi> speaking of able Ministers, being
placed in all Parishes, and of the benefit thereof redounding to Princes by
their Subjects obedience to them, saith, <hi>No Prince ever had m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hereof, then your Majesty hath had in your time, and may have daily:
and if your Majesty comes to the City of</hi> London <hi>never so often, what gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what joy, what concourse of people is there to be seen: yea, what Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
and Prayers to God for your long Life and other manifest significations
are there to be heard of inward and unfeigned love with most humble and hearty
obedience? whereof cometh this, Madam, but of the continual Preaching of
Gods word in that City, whereby the people hath been plentifully instructed in
their Duty toward God and your Majesty? On the contrary, what bred the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in the North? was it not Papistry and Ignorance of Gods word through
want of often Preaching in the time of the Rebellion? Were not all Men of all
States that make profession of the Gospel most ready to offer their lives for your
defence, insomuch that one Parish of</hi> Yorkshire <hi>which by continual Preaching
hath been better instructed then the rest,</hi> Halifax <hi>I mean, was ready to bring
3 or 4000 able Men into the Field to serve you against the said Rebels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As I before observed, That the Reformation brought us at the first step,
out of a blind Chaos into a Paradice of knowledge, so I may add that at
the next it conducted us to that blessing of Paradice, <hi>Be fruitful and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and replenish the Earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the Fish
of the Sea.</hi> No sooner had the Reformation under that Great Queen clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the heads of her Subjects, but it enlarged their hearts, and substituted
in Men a new brave and generous spirit, in lieu of that dull and formal
and lethargic one that possessed them under the Captivity of their blind
Guides, and they accounted their <hi>All</hi> and even the Worlds, too little for
their Prince, and they made her Exchequer as spacious as her Kingdom,
and the <hi>English</hi> Commerce as wide as the World. Navigation and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators
were her Favourites, and her great States man <hi>Walsingham</hi> by her
Command animated <hi>Frobisher</hi> to attempt the discovery of a nearer passage
to <hi>Cathay and China,</hi> without going so far about as by the <hi>Cape of good
hope,</hi> and he gave not over that design till after three Voyages, and the
death of <hi>Walsingham:</hi> and the success of her Politics and of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have in despight of all the power of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> terminated in such
a <hi>multiplying</hi> of the Subjects of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as probably ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them more numerous then the people of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:103047:108"/>
which <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Geography</hi> makes to have only Eight <hi>Millions</hi> of Souls.</p>
            <p>But there scarce needs any other <hi>Medium</hi> whereby to evince that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of the <hi>Reformation</hi> hath vastly encreased the value of our Land and
proportion of our Commerce, then that it hath so vastly encreased the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our People, a <hi>Fact</hi> that I have already proved, and have shewn what
<hi>Depopulaors</hi> or dispeoplers of the Kingdom the Monks were, and have made
some Calculations of the numbers of the Religious Persons living in <hi>Celibate,</hi>
and the effects thereof in restraining formerly the growth of the Numbers
of the People: but do find that I was extremely short in assigning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those whom Popery made to live in <hi>Celibate</hi> to be but 120000. I
was glad to gain a rise for somewhat like an Estimate of the numbers of all
the Religious persons in Monasteries by finding it in <hi>Weavers</hi> Monuments
that the Religious Persons put out of the Religious Houses, under the yearly
value of 200<hi>l.</hi> were above 10000: and that therein <hi>Weaver</hi> agrees with
<hi>Sanders de Schismate,</hi> &amp;c. but I made no Estimate of the numbers of <hi>Friers</hi>
Mendicant the which were very great, and I was too short on the account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there were perhaps no more Secular Priests then Benefices in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
for thô the Rule of the <hi>Canon</hi> Law allows not Orders to be given to
Men without a Title, yet it admits an exception in the Case of Men who can
live on their own patrimony, and it still took the Title to be a Curate as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Coyn for one to a living: and moreover the livelihoods that many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beneficed
Secular Priests acquired by saying particular Masses, did pass for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi>
and thus in <hi>France</hi> it being conceived that the Secular Priests unbeneficed
are about 6 times as many as the beneficiaries, we may thence guess what
the proportions of their numbers were in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet further to discourse of the growth of the numbers of the people
of <hi>England</hi> before and since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> I shall acquaint your Lordship
that you may easily find among the Records of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> what the
number of the people of <hi>England</hi> was in the Year 1522, when <hi>Harry</hi> the
8<hi>th</hi> (as I cited it out of my Lord <hi>Herberts</hi> History <hi>p.</hi> 121,) <hi>Caused War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
to be Issued out, Commanding the Certificates of the number of all above
16 years old to be returned,</hi> and by an Index or Repertory of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of State in the Exchequer that I have, I can readily direct the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it out there: and moreover by the accounts of the <hi>Pole</hi> Acts in
former times, a considerable indication of the numbers of the people in those
days may be had.</p>
            <p>And if we may guess at the encrease of the people of <hi>England</hi> from
that of <hi>London,</hi> I can easily satisfie any person about the prodigious growth
of that City in numbers of people, and consequently in wealth since the
abandoning of the Papacy.</p>
            <p>I have by me an account of the proportions of the Shires of <hi>England</hi> &amp; City
of <hi>London,</hi> in a Tax of 50000 <hi>l.</hi> long since in <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>ds</hi> time, and in which
<hi>Surry</hi> bore the same proportion with <hi>London,</hi> and in which <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Surry</hi>
and <hi>Middlesex</hi> paid but about 1500<hi>l.</hi> which was but about a 16<hi>th</hi> part.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> times, it hapned that Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> excited divers
Princes of Christendom to invade <hi>England,</hi> &amp; a fit man he was who had been
then a Traytor to come here and absolve Hereticks: but <hi>Holling shead</hi> in
his <hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>th, p.</hi> 947 tells us, <hi>That the King having heard
of the Treasonable practices of the Cardinal, did</hi> Anno 1539, <hi>make a Survey
of his Naval Strength, and did ride to the Sea-Coasts: and that Sir</hi> William
Foreman <hi>Knight, then Major of</hi> London, <hi>was commanded to certifie the names
of all the Men within the City and liberties thereof, between the age of 16 and
60, whereupon the said Mayor and his Brethren each one in his Ward, by the Oath
of the Common-Council and Constable, took the number of Men, Arms, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103047:109"/>
Weapons: and after well considering of the matter by view of their Books, they
thought it not expedient to admit the whole number certified for apt and able
men; and therefore assembling themselves again, they chose forth the most able
persons and put by the residue, especially such as had no Armour. But when they
were credibly advertised by</hi> Thomas Cromwel <hi>Lord Privy-Seal (to whom the
City was greatly beholden) that the King himself would see the People of the
City Muster in a convenient number, and not to set forth all their power, but to
leave some at home to keep the City,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then he saith, the number beside
the Whifflers and other Waiters was</hi> 15000.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Observator</hi> on the <hi>Bills of Mortality,</hi> hath in his last Observations
on that Subject told us, <hi>That there are in</hi> London <hi>about 6 hundred</hi> and
70000 <hi>Souls:</hi> and thô I know that some Parishes are included within the Bills
of Mortality for the said City that formerly were not, yet the said <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
having told us that there are in <hi>London</hi> more Males then Females, and it
being true that there are as many above the Age of sixteen as are under it,
and that the <hi>Sexagenarii</hi> are but a 6<hi>th</hi> part of Mankind, and the Quota of
the numbers resulting from the Parishes added, being likewise shewn us
by that <hi>Observator,</hi> let any one judge how vast the number of <hi>able</hi> Men
certifiable between 16 and 60, is grown to be since that year of <hi>Harry</hi> the
8<hi>th</hi> before mentioned.</p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged that the thanks of the Age are due to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator
on the Bills of Mortality, for those solid and rational Calculations
he hath brought to light, relating to the numbers of our people: but such
is the modesty of that excellent Author, that I have often heard him wish
that a thing of so great publick importance to be certainly known, might
be so by an actual numbring of them, and the truth is, it is much to be
pittied that by the care of Magistrates, an exact number of the people as
well of <hi>London,</hi> as of all other places in the Realm, hath not with
diligence been made and preserved, the knowledge whereof is the <hi>Substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
of all political measures that can be taken as to a Nations strength or
riches, and the part thereof that is <hi>spareable</hi> for Colonies, and the value of
the branches of the publick Revenue, and the equality in proportioning
any Taxes or Levies by Act of Parliament, and the satisfying the World
about the value of our Alliances, a thing one would think somewhat neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
when 'tis published in Print that a Forraign Minister, who hath spent
much time here and is deservedly famous for being a Critical Judge in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
and in many sorts of Learning, <hi>makes the people of</hi> England <hi>to be but
two Millions,</hi> and when a late famous <hi>French</hi> Author of <hi>la Politique Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coise,</hi>
who sets up with his Goose-quill to be a Governor of the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
us after his manner with the fewness of our people, and saith, <hi>How
insolent soever the</hi> English <hi>are, they must confess that all the</hi> Brittish <hi>Islands
laid together, do not equal the half of our Continent, either in extent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or
number of Men, in Wealth, in Valour, Industry and Vnderstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iames Howel</hi> in his <hi>Londinopolis</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1657 saith, <hi>That in
the Year 1636, King</hi> Charles <hi>sending to the Lord Major of</hi> London <hi>to make a
Scrutiny of what</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks there were in</hi> London, <hi>he took occasion
thereby to make a Cense of all the people, and that there were of Men, Women,
and Children, above 7 hundred thousand that lived within the Barrs of his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
alone: and this being 21 years ago, 'tis thought by all probable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
that</hi> London <hi>hath more now by a third part then it had then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his <hi>Parallel</hi> of <hi>London</hi> there with other great Cities in the World, he
observes that the weekly Bills of Mortality in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> come but to
about 60 a week, whence saith he, <hi>It may be inferr'd that</hi> London <hi>is about 5
times as populous, more dying in a week commonly in</hi> London <hi>then</hi> 300.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:103047:109"/>
And as to the quantity of the people in <hi>London,</hi> there is no doubt to be
made but that if in the year 1636, there lived 700,000 <hi>within the Barrs of the
Lord Majors Iurisdiction,</hi> there lived then so many more in the other Parishes
within the Bills of Mortality, and that there live in this year within the
Bills of Mortality, more then double the number that did in the year
1636; and at that Rate their number would now amount to near two
<hi>Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am to suspect that there was no such return of any <hi>Cense</hi> of the
people <hi>within the Barrs of the Lords Majors Iurisdiction in the year</hi> 1636
as is before mentioned, and do suppose that Mr. <hi>Howel</hi> did in that point
mistake, partly for that I think him mistaken in his Allegation before as to
the people of <hi>Paris</hi> being returned as above a <hi>Million</hi> of Souls at the last <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nse</hi>
made there, and do as to their number give more credit to the <hi>Bishop of
Rhodes,</hi> who in his History of <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> written since the year 1660,
saith in <hi>part</hi> 2d, <hi>That there were in</hi> Paris <hi>when 'twas block'd up only 200000
persons, and that there were then retired thence 100000 of the Inhabitants,
so that in those times there were no more then 300,000 Souls in</hi> Paris, <hi>whereas
'tis now believed there are twice as many,</hi> and partly because I find it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the curious Observator on the <hi>Bills of Mortality,</hi> p. 113, and
114. That <hi>Anno 1631, Ann. 7. Caroli 1. The number of Men, Women and
Children in the several Wards of</hi> London, <hi>and Liberties, taken in</hi> August,
1631. <hi>by special Command of the Lords of his Majesties Privy-Council, came
in all but to</hi> 130178, and finally because the said curious <hi>Observator</hi> (for
that name I give that Author after my <hi>Lord Chief Iustice Hales</hi> hath given
or adjudged it to him in his <hi>Origination of Mankind</hi>) having by rational
Calculations proved, that their dyes within the Bills of Mortality a <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
part</hi> or one in thirty yearly, and that there dyes ordinarily there
22000 <hi>per Annum,</hi> that if there were there according to <hi>Howel</hi> a Million and
an half of people, it would follow that there must dye but 1 out of 70 <hi>per
Annum,</hi> and that they must live one with another 70 years.</p>
            <p>There is an ingenious Author and that is the Author of <hi>the present State
of England,</hi> who tells us in his 2<hi>d part, That in 1588; there went forth from
the Queen Commissions to Muster in all parts of</hi> England, <hi>all Men that were of
perfect Sence and Limbs from the Age of 16 to 60, except Noblemen, Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Vniversity, Students, Lawyers, Officers, and such as had any publick charges,
leaving only in every Parish so many Husbandmen as were sufficient to Till the
Ground. In all those Musters there were then numbred three Millions: but of
those fit for War about</hi> 600,000.</p>
            <p>I would scarce desire better Evidence for an Opinion that the people of
<hi>England</hi> were in all 12 <hi>Millions,</hi> then that 3 <hi>Millions</hi> of Males between 16
and 60 were then returned; for the said <hi>Observator</hi> having by Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
assured us, that there are about as many Females as Males, and about
as many people under the Age of 16 as are above it, the said opinion would
stand firm and unshaken.</p>
            <p>There is too another <hi>Author</hi> who much enlargeth the number of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England,</hi> and that is <hi>Gerard Matynes</hi> in his <hi>Lex Mercatoria</hi> first Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the year 1622, and there in <hi>Cap.</hi> 46. he makes them to be 16 <hi>Millions</hi>
and 800,000: but any one will hardly take his word for it, who considers
that he there makes the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be 9 <hi>Millions,</hi> who are but
about one <hi>Million</hi> and reckons 5500 Parishes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where there were
never more then 2 <hi>thousand 2 hundred Parishes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis the fate of Nations to have their numbers sometimes inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
Assigned by considerable Authors, and thus it happened particularly
to <hi>France</hi> from an error of <hi>Campanella</hi> who in his discourse of <hi>the Spanish Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103047:110"/>
C.</hi> 24. saith that <hi>France hath in it 27000 Parishes,</hi> and 100 and 50
<hi>Millions of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this rate there would be in the Parishes in <hi>France</hi> one with another
5555 Souls, whereas Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> in a Manuscript <hi>discourse</hi> of his, saith, <hi>That
a substantial Author in his Treatise</hi> concerning <hi>France,</hi> sets it down as an
extraordinary Case if a Parish in <hi>France hath in it 600 Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have too an Author of great Vogue for the Politicks, Sir <hi>Robert Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
who in his <hi>Abstract of the Records of the Tower, touching the Kings Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi>
hath these words, <hi>viz. That</hi> London (<hi>which is not the 24th part in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Kingdom) had in it found above 800,000, by a late enquiry by the
Order of the late Queen,</hi> meaning Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But so far have we been from enabling our Political Writers to satisfie
themselves in the Numbers of our People, that we have not done it yet as
to the very Numbers of Parishes, wherein <hi>Blunt</hi> tells us in his <hi>Law Lexicon
that our Authors differ;</hi> and we generally reckon them as they were before
many new ones have been built.</p>
            <p>One late writer has accounted the Parishes in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> to be
10260: and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> sayes in his <hi>Villare Anglicum</hi> p. 408. <hi>That he is of
opinion that there are about 1500 Parishes in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales <hi>not valued in
the Kings Books, and of which he can get no account so as to make the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and 'twill be difficult for him to do it, unless the several persons concern'd in
the particulars give an account of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1607, when he reckons the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi>
Churches in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> and in <hi>Northumberland</hi> to be
118, adds <hi>praeter sacella plurima:</hi> and saith in <hi>Yorkshire, Parishes besides
Chappels, and Parishes to which many Chappels are subject that are equal to great
Parishes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Grants from the Crown of <hi>Extraparochial</hi> Titles in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Counties, may serve for an indication of great numbers of people that
are not Inhabitant in Parishes, and so likewise may the Multitudes of those
people who live in <hi>Forrests,</hi> and which places are generally accounted by
the Law to be <hi>Extraparochial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Number</hi> of Parsonages and Vicarages in <hi>Edward</hi> the 1<hi>sts valuation,</hi>
whereof there is a <hi>Manuscript</hi> Copy in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library was about 8900,
and into that number the <hi>Chappels</hi> are not accounted; but of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
many since have grown up into Parsonages: and this would likewise
induce one to think the number of our Parishes at this time to be greater
then the common Estimate, especially when according to the Kings Books
which respect the valuation in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths,</hi> time, the number of them is
considerably above 9000.</p>
            <p>But what may seem more strange is that some men of Thought and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
have attempted even by <hi>Calculation,</hi> to prove that the people of <hi>England</hi>
have for a very long space of time decreased in their numbers, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the <hi>Author</hi> of a Book in <hi>Quarto</hi> called, <hi>An account of the</hi> French <hi>Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
on the Trade of</hi> England, <hi>and the great damage the</hi> English <hi>yearly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
by their Commerce,</hi> Printed in the <hi>Year</hi> 1679, and Writ with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of <hi>Calculation</hi> in some parts thereof: and yet that Author doth <hi>p.</hi> 16
say, <hi>And I can easily believe that 1000 years since, this Nation had a much
greater stock of people then now it hath, for the</hi> Rome-Scot, <hi>or</hi> Peter-pence
<hi>which was but one Penny a Chimney (granted by</hi> Offa <hi>and</hi> Ina Saxon <hi>Kings to
the Pope) did amount to 50000 yearly: and the Hearth-money, which is
two Shillings the Hearth (and one Stack of Chimneys may have many Hearths)
doth not amount to</hi> 300,000l. <hi>yearly; whereas if the number of Chimneys
charged with the</hi> Romescot <hi>had been two Shillings a Chimney, it would have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103047:110"/>
amounted to</hi> 1,200,000 l. <hi>yearly. So that we may conclude there were then more
Buildings and Chimneys, and so by consequence more people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But had that Author considered that the <hi>Romescot</hi> or <hi>denarius sancti Petri</hi>
was only an <hi>annual Penny</hi> from every Family or Houshold, and that it
amounted to 300 <hi>Marks and a Noble yearly,</hi> as <hi>Blunt</hi> says, by that <hi>reckoning</hi> it
would have appeared that there were not then in all <hi>England</hi> 50000 Families
liable to that <hi>Duty,</hi> whereas there are now above a <hi>Million</hi> of such Families: so
that now the people and Families of <hi>England</hi> are twenty times as many as
they were then, which agrees pretty well with my <hi>Lord Chief Iustice Hales</hi>'s
reckoning.</p>
            <p>That great person in his <hi>Primitive Origination of Mankind,</hi> yields that
the people of <hi>England</hi> are at least 6 <hi>Millions,</hi> and doth too in <hi>Page</hi> 205,
say, <hi>That he doth not know any thing rendred clearer to the view, then the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
encrease of Mankind by the curious and strict Observations on the Bills of
Mortality:</hi> and doth very elaborately make a comparison between the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the people in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> and particularly some great Towns and
Burroughs there, as <hi>Thornbury</hi> and <hi>Tedbury</hi> as they were at the time of the
making up of <hi>Domesday Book</hi> and as they now are, and shews, <hi>That there
are very many more Vills and Hamlets now then there were then, and few
Villages or Towns or Parishes then which continue not to this day, and that the
number of Inhabitants now is above 20 times more through the general extent of
the Country then at that time:</hi> and afterward saith, <hi>if we should institute a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Comparison,</hi> viz. <hi>between the present time and the beginning of Queen</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
<hi>which is not above 112 years since, and compare the number of Trained
Soldiers then and now, the number of Subsidy men then and now, they will easily give
us an account of a very great encrease and multiplication of people within this
Kingdom even to admiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be no difficult thing to fortifie the observation of the great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
encrease of the people, and particularly of those in the Parishes of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi>
by the shewing the encrease of their worth and riches in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
publick <hi>Valuations,</hi> and their present real value, from whence their
growth in the numbers of their Inhabitants may be well inferr'd; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in <hi>Edward</hi> the 1<hi>sts Valuation, Tedbury</hi> is valued, <hi>Ecclesia de Tedbury
36. m. i. e. Marks,</hi> and in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8ths <hi>Valuation,</hi> is valued at 36l. 13<hi>s 2d,</hi>
and is now worth about 100 <hi>l. per Annum. Thornbury</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the 1<hi>sts</hi>
valuation is valued at 47 <hi>Marks</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> to 32<hi>l.
14s. 8d.</hi> and is now worth about 120 <hi>l. per Annum. Berkley</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the
1<hi>sts Valuation</hi> comes to 36 <hi>Marks</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> to 32<hi>l.
14s. 8d.</hi> and is now worth about 100 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have instanced in these places, as referred to by <hi>Hales,</hi> and shall here
as to <hi>Gloster</hi> only further observe, that there are more places in the <hi>Decanatus
Glocestriae</hi> in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> valuation, then were in <hi>Edward</hi> the 1<hi>sts:</hi> as
for instance, <hi>Edward</hi> the 1<hi>sts Valuation</hi> doth in the <hi>rural Deanry</hi> of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>
comprize 6 Churches and a Chappel, but <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> doth in the
<hi>Deanery</hi> contain above 20 Churches and a Chappel.</p>
            <p>I shall here corroborate his Lordships <hi>remark</hi> of the encrease of Families
in another Town in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> which he calls <hi>Dursilege,</hi> and which is in
<hi>Edward</hi> the 1<hi>sts Valuation</hi> called <hi>Dursly,</hi> and valued as a <hi>rectory</hi> there at 10
<hi>Marks per Annum,</hi> and in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> as a <hi>Rectory</hi> at 10 <hi>l. 14s. 3d.</hi> and
is now let for 72 <hi>l.</hi> yearly.</p>
            <p>I have observ'd a suitable difference between the former valuations of
other Livings in that County and their present real values.</p>
            <p>His Lordship having before justly acknowledged <hi>that it was a
laborious piece of work to make a Calculation of the number of Inhabitants
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103047:111"/>
at this day throughout</hi> England; did however in a way very worthy of his
great judgment adapt his Estimate to the extent of one entire County; for
had he gone less, and restrained it to this or that Parish, the gradual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the People there, might have fallen short by particular accidents;
and to this purpose we have it in Mr. <hi>Bentham</hi>'s <hi>Christian Conflict,</hi> p. 322.
<hi>that 11 Mannors in</hi> Northamptonshire <hi>have been enclosed with depopulation,
and have vomited out their former desolate owners and their posterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many ingenious persons have applyed their thoughts to several ways of
<hi>Calculation</hi> whereby to discover the total of the number of the People in
<hi>England,</hi> and in the Investigation thereof some concern'd in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Hearth-money</hi> have reckon'd that in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> the
number of Hearths of rich and poor is 2 <hi>Millions</hi> and 6 <hi>hundred thousand,</hi> and
that at a Medium there are between 4 and 5 persons to a <hi>Hearth,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
but 4 persons to a Hearth, they suppose that at that rate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> will appear to be 10 <hi>Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The slowness of believing great things which is incident to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and my inclination to desire that any thing may be proved to me by
ocular Demonstration, where the Subject Matter will bear it, do make me
as to any of the greater forementioned <hi>Quotas</hi> of the People of <hi>England</hi>
contended for by Calculators, to reserve my Judgment till some such accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Survey hath been made thereof, as I have heard Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> that Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s-man wish for.</p>
            <p>But this I will venture to affirm, that by what may be observed out of the
<hi>Returns</hi> on the late <hi>Pole-Bills,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> Survey, 'tis very highly
probable that the <hi>Total</hi> of the number of the people here will upon
any actual view hereafter to be made by publick Authority, appear
very considerably greater then any cautious <hi>Calculators</hi> have made it.</p>
            <p>Another account of the same great <hi>Quaesitum</hi> was sent me into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
from a Gentleman of <hi>London,</hi> who acquainted me that he received the
same from a very knowing and ingenious person whom the late Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
as great a Master of the Science of <hi>Numbers</hi> as perhaps ever any that
Acted in that high Sphere of State, employed to effect an Impartial Return
of the number of the people in <hi>London</hi> and in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and every other
County both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Total resulting from them
was as I cast up the same 8,272,062. But I judge that this account was not
taken upon ocular View of the several Counties, but by way of Estimate
not absolutely perfect, and by <hi>Calculation</hi> or comparing several former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
together.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but the most satisfactory way that we can at present
take for our Estimates, and whereby we may Trace the Numbers of the
people from somewhat that looks like matter of <hi>Record</hi> is, as I hinted,
from the <hi>Returns</hi> on the <hi>Pole</hi> Bill and the <hi>Bishops</hi> Survey.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Poll-money</hi> of <hi>Anno 1666, 2 hundred thirty seven thousand
Pound</hi> was the gross <hi>Charge:</hi> and if on the consideration of Counties
whereof the <hi>Charge</hi> was not returned, as <hi>Buckinghamshire, Durham, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,
Kent, Oxon, North Wales, Brenoc, Radnor, Glamorgan, Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi>
(of which the proportions in numbers with the Counties return'd
are not hard to be Calculated) and of the omissions perhaps through partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
whereby great numbers of persons chargeable were not returned, and
withal on a supposal that there had been in the Act no qualifications and
exceptions of many persons from being Charged, and particularly of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
under the Age of Sixteen, and of Paupers, &amp;c. we may further venture
to make the <hi>Total</hi> chargeable to be 600,000 <hi>l.</hi> and every one paying for his
<hi>Head,</hi> there would then apppear 20 times as many people, <hi>i. e. 12 Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:103047:111"/>
I know that out of such a Sum as 600,000 <hi>l.</hi> supposed chargeable, it
will be obvious to consideration that what was paid by the <hi>Nobility</hi> and by
<hi>Titlers</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> must be substracted: but when it shall be likewise consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that in that <hi>Poll-money</hi> that of the <hi>Peers</hi> paid into the Receipt, came
to but 5693 <hi>l. 6s. 8d.</hi> and that perhaps as much went beside the Nett of the
<hi>Receipt</hi> under the notion of imaginary <hi>Paupers,</hi> and by persons not return'd; as
came into it from the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Titlers,</hi> and that the persons excepted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Age</hi> of 16 were about a Moiety of the people, the supposition of
600,000 <hi>l.</hi> chargeable by way of <hi>Capitation</hi> will not seem so strange as at
the first view.</p>
            <p>The great difficulty of having the Total of the people chargeable by any
<hi>Poll-Bill</hi> exactly and impartially return'd, appears in the Case of a <hi>Poll</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Tax
in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>

but Prisoners and Vagrants, and those that were on the other side the
Line, and all strangers, and that then there were found in South <hi>Holland</hi> no more
then 481934 Souls, though yet the Commissioners instructions were strict for the

            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> there delivers his opinion, <hi>That many evaded the being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
on that Poll, and that the number return'd was very short and defective,</hi>
but adheres to the account of them being now as is before mentioned, <hi>viz.
2 Millions 4 hundred thousand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this as it doth in some measure fortifie my foregoing notion of the
prodigious growth of the people of <hi>Holland</hi> under the <hi>Reformation,</hi> so it
doth likewise afford an instance of the partiality used in the returns of the
numbers chargeable in <hi>Poll-Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which doth chiefly induce me to believe the Total of our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
may very much exceed the sentiments of Cautious <hi>Calculators</hi> in this
point, is the Result of the <hi>Bishops</hi> Survey, which was made for the Province
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and wherein none under the age of Communicants or 16
were return'd, and but very few Servants, or Sons, and Daughters, or Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or Inmates of the people of several perswasions of Religion: and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103047:112"/>
thing endeavour'd was that the heads of Families or House-Keepers, <hi>i. e.</hi>
Man and Wife might be truly return'd; and at that rate, the <hi>Total</hi> at the
foot of the account for the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is 2,228,386, the
which according to the forementioned currant Rule of <hi>Calculation</hi> to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
about doubled on the account of the people under 16, makes the
<hi>Total</hi> of the <hi>Souls</hi> in that <hi>Province</hi> to be 4 <hi>Millions, 4 Hundred 56 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
7 hundred seventy two;</hi> and the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>York</hi> bearing a sixth part of
the <hi>Taxes,</hi> and having therefore the 6th. part of the people that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath, which is 742,795, that being added to those
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> makes 5 <hi>Millions, a hundred ninety nine thousand, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
sixty seven:</hi> and since 'tis apparent that not more persons were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Survey then did really exist in Nature, and live within the
Province as return'd, it will hereafter seem a very unnecessary thing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
absurd to question whether the people of <hi>England</hi> were not then at
least 5,199,567.</p>
            <p>But since it appears by the inspection of that Survey, that there was so
vast a quantity of places that made no <hi>returns</hi> at all, some of which present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occur'd to my view in the Cursory reading and taking some few Notes
thereof, and without my designing to make any Collection of all the places
that made no returns, as for example, in the Arch-Deaconry of <hi>Colchester,
11 Parishes</hi> made no returns, and in the <hi>Decanatus Tendring</hi> twelve
Parishes, in the <hi>Decanatus Colcestre</hi> seven Parishes, in the <hi>Decanatus
Lexden</hi> ten Parishes, in <hi>Decanatus Witham</hi> eleven Parishes, in the
Arch-Deaconry of <hi>Middlesex</hi> and <hi>Decanatus Braugling</hi> and <hi>Harlow</hi> four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<hi>Parishes,</hi> in the <hi>Decanatus Dunmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 7 Parishes, in the <hi>Decanatus Henning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
9 Parishes, in the <hi>Decanatus</hi> of <hi>Middlesex</hi> 16 Parishes (some of which
were St. <hi>Clements Danes,</hi> St. <hi>Mary le Bow, Vxbridge) and in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Deacony
of</hi> London <hi>St.</hi> Bartholomew Exchange, are therein express'd to have
made no returns; it may hence seem rational for any Man to suppose in
general that the number of the People of <hi>England reverâ is</hi> very great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the said total of 5,199,567. and that it would have risen to a much
greater number if exact returns had been made of all the <hi>heads</hi> of <hi>Families</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> and much more if all Persons in all Families above
the <hi>Age</hi> of 16 had been return'd.</p>
            <p>But yet according to the Returns that were <hi>de facto</hi> made in that <hi>Survey,</hi>
I observ'd that in some, where the <hi>totals</hi> for Counties were cast up, that they
doubled the <hi>totals</hi> of the People return'd for the same Counties, upon the
<hi>Poll</hi> Act of 66. as for example, the <hi>Poll</hi> for <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornwel</hi> was <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thousand three hundred Pound;</hi> and the number return'd for those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by the <hi>Bishops Survey</hi> was <hi>two hundred</hi> and <hi>thirteen thousand,</hi> doubling
which number for those under the Age of <hi>Communicants</hi> there, makes
426000 Souls there; so then the 14000 <hi>l.</hi> at 12 <hi>d.</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> makes there
280000 Shillings, or Persons at 12 <hi>d.</hi> a <hi>Head,</hi> to which as I shew'd the
number in the <hi>Bishops Survey</hi> is double.</p>
            <p>And further to shew the Omissions of great Numbers of People, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in that <hi>Survey,</hi> I shall acquaint your Lordship that in the year 1676.
in the which the <hi>Bishops Survey</hi> was made, there dy'd within the <hi>Bills of
Mortality</hi> 18730. and according to the <hi>rule</hi> of 1 in 30. there yearly dying,
there will be suppos'd to have then liv'd there 533,170. and the <hi>total</hi> of the
People return'd of all Persuasions of Religion <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Age</hi> of 16 in the
whole <hi>Diocess</hi> of <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 76. was 286,347. and the doubling of
that number for those under the <hi>Age</hi> of 16 in that <hi>Diocess,</hi> makes the <hi>total</hi> of
the People there then to be 572,694. But here it is to be Considered that
tho the <hi>Peculiars</hi> of the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>London</hi> were <hi>de
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103047:112"/>
facto</hi> return'd then within the Survey of the <hi>Diocess</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> yet the great
and populous Parishes in <hi>Southwark</hi> and others in <hi>Surry</hi> within the District of
the <hi>Bills of Mortality,</hi> were not return'd with any respect to the <hi>Diocess</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> but were in that Survey by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Winton</hi> return'd as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Lordships <hi>Diocess;</hi> and that in a late year of ordinary health,
<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. there dyed in the Parishes in <hi>Surry,</hi> that are within the
<hi>Bills of Mortallity</hi> 2803. and therefore according to the Rule of the 30<hi>th.</hi>
part then dying there, it is to be judged that there then lived there, 81287.
and therefore we being to Substract that last mention'd Number out of the
533,170, then the number of all the Souls in the other Places in the <hi>Bills of
Mortallity</hi> will be 451,983. and so at that rate the number of all the Souls
within the whole <hi>Diocess</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> will be but 120,711 more then those
that were in the other Places within the <hi>Bills of Mortallity,</hi> the which <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi>
takes in all the other Places in <hi>Middlesex</hi> that are without the <hi>Bills of
Mortallity,</hi> and all <hi>Essex,</hi> and part of <hi>Hartfordshire.</hi> And to conclude this
point, the omissions of Great Parts of the Numbers of the People, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulary
of Sons, Daughters, Servants, being supposed to be in other places
proportionable; I am hence induced to believe that on the occasion of any
actual and exact Survey of the People of <hi>England</hi> to be made, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
will rise to a greater height then what it hath been advanced to by the
most judicious Calculators.</p>
            <p>And now if after all this, one should tell me that any vast encrease of
the numbers of the People of <hi>England</hi> beyond the <hi>quota</hi> supposed by Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Calculators, is <hi>incredible,</hi> and to be added to the number of things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible;</hi>
I will answer him out of <hi>Salust, Incredibile est memoratu, quantum
adepta libertate, in brevi Romana Civitas creverit;</hi> and will tell him, that
'tis almost incredible to relate how much we have gain'd by our abandoning
<hi>Popery</hi> and its <hi>Incredibility,</hi> and the almost incredibile as well as intolerable
Servitude, that the <hi>Papacy</hi> so often oppressed both our Kings and People
with.</p>
            <p>We are told by the <hi>Observator</hi> on the <hi>Bills of Mortallity, that anxiety of
mind hinders Breeding,</hi> and from sharp anxieties of divers kinds hath the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion rescued <hi>English</hi> minds, and from their former daily <hi>yariness</hi>
for their <hi>daily Bread,</hi> and their fears of being Arbitrarily dispossest of it.
What Princes (as I may say) are the <hi>English Infantry,</hi> and even the <hi>Boors</hi>
of <hi>Holland</hi> to the Pesants of <hi>France,</hi> who with Chains on do propagate
their <hi>Species,</hi> and Servitude it self? And what pity was it that <hi>Commerce</hi>
which with its infant Smiles cheer'd our Isle in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the
6<hi>th.</hi> was almost frighted away from it by the Frowns and Arbitrary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and that after that <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> consulting the
Advancement of our Trade had legally Suppressed the Corporation of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Strangers,
and null'd their Monopoly; Queen <hi>Mary</hi> endeavour'd the
Suppression of our Native Merchants, and that too by Illegal Impositions.
It is not denyable that in the fourth year of her Reign she did lay an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post
upon our Cloth: and one who had been a <hi>Iudge</hi> of the Realm, and
who had no spight to her Story mentioning it in his Book call'd, <hi>The
Rights of the People Concerning Impositions,</hi> saith there, <hi>This Religious Prince
Inviron'd with infinite Troubles in the Church and Commonwealth, and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish'd
by her Devotion in Renouncing the Profits of the Church Lands that
were in the Crown, was the first that made Digression from the steps of her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Progenitors, in putting on that imposition without assent of Parliament:</hi>
And the same Author in pag. 91. mentions another unjust Imposition of
hers on <hi>Gascoyn</hi> Wines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:103047:113"/>
And her expulsion of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church and their Pastors from <hi>London,</hi>
and her Canselling of the Legal Priviledges that <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> (for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
his Heirs and Successors gave them, and other Strangers by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents, was an Arbitrary blow given to the Trade of the Kingdom
in general, and of that City in particulars; The Copy of her <hi>Proclamation</hi>
for the Expelling them is Printed in <hi>Fox,</hi> in which they are stiled, a <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of evil disposed Persons being Born out of her Highnesses Dominions in
other sundry Nations, flying from the Obeysance of the Princes and Rulers,
under whom they be Born, some for Heresie, some for Murther, Treason, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and are there further represented as such, <hi>whose secret practices have not
fail'd to stir her Highnesses Subjects to a Rebellion against God and her Grace,</hi>
&amp;c. But secret Traitors they were found by the Realm, and secret they
were left by it. Two of them were <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Lasco,</hi> Uncle to the King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> that were thus sent out of the Realm with <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benitos</hi>
on: and so far were our <hi>Popish</hi> Ancestors from Hospitality to
Strangers, and thereby <hi>unawares entertaining Angels,</hi> that they made
<hi>Devils</hi> of them, and as such used them: and to make amends to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Forraign Artists for the Gold they brought here, they had the Dirt
of Shams thrown at them by a <hi>Proclamation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as if not only the Biting, but the very Barking of Mad Doggs had
power to make others Mad, she grew so enraged by the Books of Heresie
and Sedition, Printed in Forraign Parts and here Imported, that she Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
a <hi>Proclamation</hi> Printed likewise in <hi>Fox,</hi> wherein she Declared to all
her Subjects that, <hi>Whoever shall after the Proclaiming hereof be found to have
any of the said Wicked and Seditious Books, or finding them do not forthwith
Burn the same without shewing or reading the same, shall in that Case be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
and taken for a Rebel, and shall without delay be Executed for the Offence
according to the order of Martial Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nothing can palliate the Arbitrariness of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>Proclamation,</hi>
for the Exercising of <hi>Martial Law,</hi> but that she thought her Reign a time
of War, and perhaps not altogether Improperly; for that Hereticks have
the Title of <hi>Hostes</hi> given them by <hi>Popish</hi> Masters of Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>There was another reason that induced Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to use the Arbitrary
Power, that her <hi>Popish Predecessors</hi> did not, and that is this: <hi>The People of</hi>
England <hi>in the days of</hi> Popery <hi>were like to the three Fools in</hi> Lipsius, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ty'd together by a twine Thread, went Whining about the House, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
that they who would unty the Knots of it, should have what Money from
them they pleas'd:</hi> And thus were our Foolish Ancestors <hi>innodated</hi> with <hi>Papal
Censures,</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> did but Arbitrarily ask and have their rewards to
Absolve them. But that Queen finding that the Reformation begun had
proved Physick to Cure those <hi>Idiots</hi> of their dull Stupidity, she therefore
supposed that the Fools who before were held by the <hi>twine</hi> Thread, must
then be bound to the good Behaviour with Chains.</p>
            <p>In fine, by these three Important Acts of Arbitrary Power (the which
presently occurred to my remembrance out of her Story, and without my
troubling my self to rake for more) she gave the alarm to her Subjects
newly after their Eyes had been opened, and their Hands unty'd by the
Reign of K. <hi>Edward,</hi> that they were to expect no free Trading where there
was no free Living, and to hear nothing but the dying Groans of Liberty
and Religion. So very exact indeed is the Frame of our <hi>English</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of the Soveraignes Power and Peoples Liberty therein, that as
in an <hi>Arched</hi> Building, if one Stone be removed from it, the whole is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
endanger'd, and nothing could probably have saved it from ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but the Restoration of our Law as well as Gospel, by such a Reign as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103047:113"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> who was so far from the exercise of Arbitrary Power on
her good Subjects and Friends, that she did it not on the worst, nor on her
Enemies.</p>
            <p>One would have thought that after the many attempts against her Life,
and after the forementioned threatning Letter of <hi>Campians,</hi> which notifies
that the <hi>Iesuits had entred into a Covenant or Association to Kill Heretical
Princes,</hi> &amp;c. that she might have been provoked to have declared that <hi>Order</hi>
by a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be <hi>Hostes,</hi> a thing that she or any Protestant Crown'd
Heads might do without Violating the Laws of Nations in reference to
those Forraign Princes that were their Allies, and to whom any of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
were Subjects: a thing not only Consonant to the <hi>jus gentium,</hi> but to our
<hi>Lex terrae</hi> as it was resolv'd in <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> by the Lord Chief
Justice <hi>Catelin,</hi> who being ask'd, <hi>Whither the Subjects of another Prince,
Confederate with the Queen, might be held for the Queens Enemies?</hi> Answer'd,
<hi>That they might, and that the Queen of</hi> England <hi>might make War with any
Duke of</hi> France, <hi>and yet in the mean time hold Peace with the</hi> French <hi>King;</hi>
and a thing that if done, would have tended more to their Extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of this or any Country perhaps, then all other Laws against them,
in regard that it would have more effectually bereav'd them of the benefit
of Correspondence, Aids and Assistance from thence; all Subjects being
every where by the Law rendred Traytors, who Correspond with, or give
Aid and Assistance to declared Enemies.</p>
            <p>Nor would the term of <hi>Hostes</hi> bestow'd on such be more then a Retaliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and to this purpose <hi>Mariana</hi> makes the people authoriz'd to Proclaime
a King upon occasion, to be a <hi>Publick Enemy:</hi> and so likewise <hi>Lessius</hi> even
in his Book <hi>de Iustitiâ &amp; jure,</hi> saith, <hi>That a Tyrant is to be declared an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by the Common-welth:</hi> and thus <hi>Parsons</hi> alias <hi>Doleman</hi> in his Book of the
<hi>Succession, Part 2. Cap.</hi> 4. terms an Evil King <hi>an Armed Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The term I mention'd before of <hi>inimicus homo</hi> is certainly proper enough
for those that sow such Tares in the World as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> do, and make not
only <hi>Lollards</hi> of ordinary <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but as the Commenter on the Epitome of
Confessions, otherwise the 7<hi>th.</hi> Book of <hi>Decretals</hi> tells us in Commendation
of all the <hi>Iesuits</hi> in these words, <hi>Tyrannos aggrediuntur, lolium ab agro Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico
evellunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall here observe how in the year 1596. the</hi> Hollanders <hi>and others of
the</hi> States <hi>of the</hi> Vnited Provinces <hi>did Publish an Edict,</hi> That none of the
Bloudy Sect of the Jesuits, or any that gives himself to Study at this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Professors of that Sect, whether he be B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rn in any of the Provinces
that are Confederate, or be a Forraigner crept secretly into the same Province,
should longer remain there then the time prescribed, under the pain of being
accounted and kill'd for an Enemy.</p>
            <p>But that Magnanimous Queen did as much think it Inglorious for her to
employ her Anger in such a <hi>Proclamation</hi> on such firy pedants, as I believe
our potent Neighbouring Monarch, whose Name will look as great in all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uture Story, for mighty dilligence, and for exact prudence in the Conduct
of his Affairs of State, as for the Success of his Arms, would to Honour
with the Title of <hi>Enemies</hi> such little great talkers, who here in the <hi>Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houses</hi>
Arraign his Political Measures.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, as it is not worthy the Grandeur of Princes, who are
Heavens Vice-gerents to squander away its thunder, in experiments on
Shrubs and Mushrooms, or on slight grounds, to call any of slight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and who are of no <hi>Name,</hi> by that dreadful one of <hi>Enemies,</hi> a name
that the Impotent passion of Subjects makes them so familiarly vex one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
with, and thereby shews them not such fit <hi>depositaries</hi> of Heavens
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103047:114"/>
Artillary as Soveraigns are; so is it extremely unbecoming the Glorious
height to which the Doctrine of the Cross hath exalted humane Nature,
for men (as I may say) to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cend from Heaven to Earth for Dirt, and to
Hell for Fire-brands to throw at one another, and petulantly to call those
<hi>that were sometime Aliens and Enemies in their mind,</hi> &amp;c. always such after
the Divine reconciliation, or even to manage the most lawful and just War,
<hi>Sine quadam bene volentiâ,</hi> as St. <hi>Austines</hi> words are, or to think that they can
justly assume the great Name first used at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and yet retain a Constant
and Stated enmity against any Person whatsoever; For according to the
Excellent saying of <hi>Tertullian, Christianus nullius est hostis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Bosome</hi> of that <hi>wise</hi> Princess was no resting place for <hi>Anger,</hi> and
all the <hi>Popes</hi> Thunder could not discompose her; and as in all Games
they who in their play retain a Constant Equabillity of mind, are generally
most Successful; so was she in the great Political Game she play'd, by being
<hi>Semper eadem;</hi> and the <hi>Papal Excommunications</hi> seem'd to her as despicable,
as the <hi>Curses</hi> of loosing Gamesters: and I doubt not but by her Prudent and
just Administration of the Government of Church and State, she hath laid
the Foundation of the <hi>English</hi> Nations being <hi>Semper eadem</hi> in the Royal
Line, and of the Protestant Religions being so too, and that no <hi>delen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
fore</hi> can Issue out against either; (humanly Speaking) and that any <hi>Popish</hi>
Successor that can come here will find it his interest to use the Politicks of
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as a Sea Mark to avoid, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s as a Land Mark
to go by; and it being clear accordingly as Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> in his Manuscript dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
called, <hi>Verbum Sapienti,</hi> demonstrates it, <hi>Cap. 2. of the Value of the
People,</hi> that each Head of Man-kind is as certainly valuable as Land, that
the many Strangers who have Transplanted themselves hither need never
fear that they will be so undervalued as in the <hi>Marian</hi> days.</p>
            <p>The Families of <hi>French</hi> Protestants that have lately come here have filled
800. of the Empty New Built Houses of <hi>London,</hi> and have given us too an
occasion of <hi>entertaining Angels</hi> in those untenanted Houses whose Ruinous
appearance before made them seem to the vulgar such as they call <hi>haunted;</hi>
but from which no Prince can ever think of exorcising the inhabitants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Conjuring away his own Revenue, of which about one moity depends
on that City, and where the Rents, tho fallen as I say, would yet have been
much lower but for the Tenancy of these Forreigners, and the expectation of
others.</p>
            <p>There is a very great President in our <hi>English</hi> Story, and that is of a
Prince of the <hi>Popish</hi> perswasion, and yet one who was a sharp persecuter
of the Extravagances of the Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergy, and one who
by the Introducing of Forreignors here to Manufacture our Wooll saved the
Life or Being of the Nations Trade, which his Predecessors had left in a
Gasping Condition, and one who by his Patronizing of <hi>Wiclif</hi> sufficiently
shew'd that if those Forreigners had been <hi>Wiclifists,</hi> he would yet have
been a <hi>Fautor</hi> of those Hereticks, and one who more disoblig'd the Pope
by seizing on the Lands of the <hi>Alien</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thodox Clerical Idlers, then he
could have done by the entertainment of many Heterodox lay Alien Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers.
'Tis needless to say that I here mean our great <hi>Edward</hi> the
<hi>third,</hi> of whom and of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the prudence was as memorable,
as of any Princes that ever Sate on the <hi>English</hi> Throne; And I will never
despaire of any Heroick Prince here, of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> perswasion,
with his Scepter upholding the trade of the Kingdom, as those two great
<hi>Names</hi> did, and that too by the same methods, if ever he shall come to find
it in the tottering Conditon that they did; and it may be well supposed
that the experience the Kingdom hath since gained under King <hi>Iames</hi> and

the <hi>Royal</hi> Martyr, and His Present <hi>Majesty,</hi> of the publick benefit that hath
arisen from the reception of Forraign Artists, who have been <hi>Heterodox</hi> in
some ritual points about our Religion, will make their expulsion seem a
Solecisme: And every Sagacious Person will (I believe) accord with me
that the <hi>Spider</hi> hath done much more good to humane kind by furnishing it
with the Invention of <hi>Weaving,</hi> then harm by any thing of Poyson.</p>
            <p>I shall be glad to know from your Lordship, whether on your search

            </p>
            <p>Bodin <hi>in his</hi> de Republicâ, <hi>speaking of the</hi> Numbering of the People, <hi>saith,</hi>
That the benefit that redounds to the Publick thereby is infinite: and that
thereby Princes and States know what Souldiers they may have, and what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
they may send abroad to Collonys.</p>
            <p>I have been informed by a Person belonging to the Custom-house, that
near 10000. Persons have had their Names entred as gone out of the Ports
of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bristol,</hi> for our Plantations in a years time: And no doubt
but the Number was great that then went away thither from other Ports,
and likewise of such that went from <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>out-Ports,</hi> whose Names
were not entred. But I was not a little surprised of late, when I read it in
a Book newly Printed, called, <hi>The Negros and Indians Advocate,</hi> and Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the <hi>Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterbury,</hi> where the Author pag. 171.
Speaking of the <hi>Kidnappirs</hi> trade or mistery, saith, <hi>A Trade, that tis
thought Carrys off and Consumes not so little as 10000. out of this Kingdome
yearly, which might have been a Defence to their Mother Country,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>'Tis certainly a sign that we are very rich in the number of our People,
when we can endure such a quantity of them to be yearly stolen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the pursuit of a Hue and Cry.</p>
            <p>Yet in this point <hi>Scotland</hi> is reported to be somewhat more unhappy
then <hi>England,</hi> for those who go hence for our Plantations do Contribute
some way to the Trade of the Kingdom, and many of them return hither
again; But Mr. <hi>Roger Coke</hi> in his Book called, <hi>Englands Improvements,</hi> pag.
21. saith, <hi>Its believed above 12000. of the Kings</hi> Scotish <hi>Subjects yearly go
out of</hi> Scotland <hi>into</hi> Poland, Sweden, Germany, France, Holland, <hi>and other
places, and never after return into</hi> Scotland: And that Author having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the same page mentioned, <hi>That 5 l. given with an Apprentice to be
instructed in the Woollen or any Manufacture, by which means be afterward
earns</hi> 30 l. per annum, <hi>this in 20. years becomes</hi> 600 l. &amp;c. <hi>which is more
valuable to the Nation then if</hi> 600 l. <hi>had been given it, and the People not
employed:</hi> Thereupon he afterward Computes, <hi>That the benefit which
might accrue to the Nation by employing so many thousands of the</hi> Scottish <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
there might in 20. years time be above 6 Millions.</hi> And according to
the opinion of that Worthy Gentleman, we may further be inclined to
think the Number of the <hi>Scots</hi> removing into Forraign parts to be very
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103047:115"/>
great, when we find among Sir <hi>Iohn Denhams Poems,</hi> one with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
or Title, <hi>On my Lord</hi> Crofts, <hi>and my Iourney into</hi> Poland, <hi>from
whence we brought</hi> 10000 l. <hi>for his Majesty, by the Decimation of his</hi> Scotish
<hi>Subjects there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>moreover</hi> the satisfying the Inquisite <hi>genius</hi> of our People, concerning
the greatness of their Numbers, may be of some importance to them and
the publick quiet, in satisfying them of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the former Moddel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of a <hi>Republick</hi> here, a form of Government tho easily supposed Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
in large Cities, yet not so in great and populous Nations; and <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of all fears of a <hi>Vniversal</hi> Monarchy, bridling the world
again, a thing which though it was of old feasable, when Mankind made
not so mighty a Mass, is now far from being so.</p>
            <p>'Twas easie to imagine it possible, and indeed to effect it in the days
when <hi>Aristotle</hi> taught men, that no City ought to have above 10000. Citiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens;
and when, however the Number of Citizens was grown at <hi>Athens</hi> to
20000. and when in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire the number of the Citizens was
not so vast as is by many imagined; and so accordingly the Excellent
Discourser <hi>de Magnitudine Romanâ Lipsius,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 7. then Speaking of
the <hi>Multitudo Romanorum</hi> under <hi>Augustus,</hi> saith, <hi>Ipse de se in Lapide Ancyrano
clare hoc dicit. In consulatu suo Sexto lustrum condidisse: quo lustro Censita
sunt Civium Romanorum Capita quadragiens Centum millia &amp; Sexaginta tria,</hi>
i. e. <hi>four Millions and a hundred thousand:</hi> And <hi>Lipsius</hi> afterward mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Number of the <hi>Romans</hi> encreased under <hi>Claudius</hi> cites <hi>Tacitus</hi>
for making it then <hi>Sexagies movies centena Sexaginta quatuor Millia,</hi> i. e.
about seven <hi>Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but the People of the Provinces did vastly exceed that
Number; but since according to the estimate of <hi>Bodin</hi> in his <hi>de Rep.</hi> 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> when at its greatest extent in <hi>Trajans</hi> time, scarce
contain'd the thirtieth part of the World, and that the prolifit <hi>North</hi> stiled ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
by Authors <hi>officina &amp; vagina gentium</hi> by the encrease of its populacy,
so humbled the <hi>Roman</hi> Sword, that within about 154. years afterward some
of the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> became their Allies, and <hi>Gallus</hi> submitted
to pay Tribute to the <hi>Goths,</hi> tis no wonder that the <hi>thirtieth</hi> part of the
World was since reduced to cease from domineering over all the other parts
of it: And notwithstanding <hi>Maximines</hi> boast to the <hi>Senate</hi> in the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his account to them of his <hi>German Successes,</hi> cited by <hi>Iul. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitolinus</hi>
in his Life, <hi>tantum Captivorum abduxi ut vix Sola Romana sufficiant,</hi>
his <hi>Resvery</hi> of the Immortality of the <hi>Roman Power</hi> on the Stage of the
World was liable to Confutation from the same way of arguing, as his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
of his own Immortality was; which having been observed to have
tainted his fancy on the occasion of his great and robust Body, the same
<hi>Capitolinus</hi> in his Life saies was corrected by a Players reciting these Lines on
the Stage in his presence:
<q>
                  <l>Qui ab uno non potest a multis occiditur,</l>
                  <l>Elephans grandis est &amp; occiditur,</l>
                  <l>Leo fortis est &amp; occiditur,</l>
                  <l>Tigris fortis est &amp; occiditur,</l>
                  <l>Cave multos si Singulos non times.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what I find by</hi> Lipsius <hi>in the second</hi> Book, <hi>third Chapter there cited
out of</hi> Tertullian <hi>is much more applicable to the present State of the World,
then to that wherein twas Writ: He saith there,</hi> At Tertulliani locum non

            <p>And that strong and populous Nations Conspired to break their Chains
hath nothing of wonder in it; and the truth is, the freedom the World
has gain'd since the decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and even by means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
hath hung out such a Picture before all mens Eyes, of Populous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
drawn to the bigness of the Life, as has made the Notion of erecting
another <hi>Vniversal</hi> Monarchy, seem but a Portraiture of Imagination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
nothing but bold Strokes of Colour, without regular Proportion
and Design; and the <hi>Copying</hi> only a <hi>Landskip</hi> of the <hi>Devil's Mountain,</hi> and his
<hi>shewing thence all the Kingdoms of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is the World ashamed now of its having been in the last foregoing
Age, amused with the thoughts of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s being its <hi>Catholick</hi>
Monarch, and of having tormented it self with Jealousies about such a great
Nothing: And which I believe was never modell'd in the fancy of that
Prince, and was only projected by <hi>Court-Sycophants,</hi> and <hi>Mercenary</hi> Writers;
and that he himself never enter'd any express claim to it, one would think
who reads the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi>'s answer to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
<hi>&amp;c. Anno</hi> 1624. where the Duke having aggravated some
State-Practices, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Minister adds, <hi>And is not this a Proclamation
to all the World, that they aspired to such an absolute Monarchy as so many
Books, Stories, Discourses, and the general Complaints of all Princes and
States have long charged them with?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for such Writers as I last mention'd to flatter a Prince with Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Greatness and Extent of his Power, is not more unusual then for
Mendicant Poets to over-act their part in Panegyricks, or for the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of any particular bright beauty in Verse, to represent her as the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi>
of all Hearts: and thus the Famous <hi>Campanella</hi> after he had made his
Present of the <hi>Universal</hi> Monarchy to <hi>Spain,</hi> sent it too a Begging into
<hi>France,</hi> as appears out of <hi>Arch-Bishop Laud</hi>'s Book against <hi>Fisher,</hi> pag. 210.
where he saith that lately <hi>Friar Companella hath set out an Eclogue on the
Birth of the Dauphin, and that</hi> permissu Superiorum, <hi>in which he saith, that
all the Princes are now more affraid of</hi> France <hi>then ever, for that there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for it,</hi> Regnum Universale, <hi>the Vniversal Kingdom or Monarchy.</hi> The
words there are in the Margin, <hi>Quum Gallia alat 20000000 hominum, ex
Singulis Centenis sumendo unum collegit 200000 strenuorum militum stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorum

            <p>Yet with a <hi>Non obstante</hi> to the Politicks of <hi>Campanella,</hi> and his pittyful
great Flatteries, I shall venture to pronounce the Great <hi>French</hi> Monarch,
who is certainly as great a Prince in the Intellectual World, as in the other,
and is truly by the bright Sun of Reason <hi>non pluribus impar,</hi> no Designer of
taking the Dimensions of the whole Globe of the Earth with Chains; and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103047:116"/>
do think the most <hi>Christian</hi> King, out of his Royal Prudence, less inclined
to favour the servile Flatterers, who would set him up to be King of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi>
then was formerly the <hi>Catholick</hi> Monarch to encourage those who
render'd him aspiring to be the <hi>Vniversal</hi> one: a Title which according to
the excellent saying of Mr. <hi>Cowly</hi> in his <hi>Brutus, None can deserve, but he who
would refuse the offer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I doubt but that if ever the greatest Prince in Christendom should
be abandoned to the Vanity of attempting the particular Conquest of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Power in the Ballance of the VVorld would as
soon and as sensibly grow insignificant thereby, as did the King of <hi>Spains',</hi>
by the Design of 88. And as the Fate of the great temporary Disturbers of
Mankind hath been their constant Augmentation of their own Expences,
(which was a just pecuniary mulct from Heaven on their Ambition for
their encrease of the charge of divers Nations in the posture of Defence,)
so is it likely to be more and more to the end of Time: And it was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
exemplified in the Result of the <hi>Pope's</hi> and King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Politicks in
88, which reduced them to attempt the Remedying of the Prosu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion of
their Treasure by sending (as I may say) Canonical <hi>Waste-Paper</hi> to the
<hi>West-Indies,</hi> and the loss too of their <hi>Cargo</hi> of that, as appears by <hi>Malynes</hi>
in his <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> where he saith, pag. 126. <hi>That in the year 1561,
Pope</hi> Sixtus Quintus <hi>caused two Ships to be Laden out of</hi> Spain <hi>for the</hi> West-Indies
<hi>with</hi> a 100. <hi>Buts of Sack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 1400 little Chests containing each of them
three ordinary small Barrels of Quick-Silver, weighing</hi> 50 l. <hi>apiece, to refine the
Silver withal in the</hi> VVest-Indies; <hi>and a great number of Packs of Printed</hi>
Bulls, <hi>and</hi> Pardons <hi>granted at that time to make Provision against</hi> Hereticks,
<hi>because the year 1588, had so much exhausted the Treasure of</hi> Spain. <hi>These
two Ships were met with at Sea by Captain</hi> VVhite (<hi>who was Laden and
Bound for</hi> Barbary) <hi>and brought into</hi> England <hi>by him, where the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were Sold: But the</hi> Popes <hi>Merchandise being out of request, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a long time in Ware-Houses at the disposal of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>at the last
at the request of her Physician</hi> Doctor Lopez, <hi>she gave all that great quantity
of</hi> Bulls <hi>to him, amounting to many thousands in number: And he and another
sent those</hi> Bulls <hi>into the</hi> VVest-Indies, <hi>where they were no sooner Arrived but
the</hi> Popes <hi>Contractors for that Commodity did Seise on all the said</hi> Bulls, <hi>and
caus'd an Information to be given against them, that they were Infected, as
having been taken by</hi> Hereticks. <hi>Twas alledged that they were Miraculously
saved; but they were lost and Confiscated. Malynes</hi> further mentions, <hi>That
he was employed to appraise the Lading of those Prizes, and to certifie what it
cost, and what it might have been worth in the</hi> VVest-Indies <hi>according to the
rate of every</hi> Bull <hi>tax'd at two</hi> Rials <hi>of Plate, and some four, and some eight</hi>
Rials, <hi>according to their Limitation, every one being but one sheet of Paper,
and by Computation the Lading did not cost</hi> 50000 l. <hi>and would have yielded
above</hi> 600000 l. He had before said, <hi>That every Reasonable Soul of the</hi> Popish
Religion <hi>in</hi> America <hi>must have one of these</hi> Bulls <hi>yearly; and that these</hi> Bulls
<hi>contained a</hi> Mandate, <hi>that their Beds should be sold who would not take off one
of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems (by the way) that all that Treasure of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> bestowed by
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on <hi>Doctor Lopez,</hi> could not oblige him from designing
afterward to take away her Life by Poyson. But this was the result of
the Trage-Comedy, or rather, <hi>Farce</hi> of 88. and <hi>Broyl on the Coast</hi> when
<hi>Spains Invincible Fleet</hi> that had in it but 8350. Seamen, proved the sport
of Fortune and of the VVinds, and the fatal VVrack of its Treasure, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that it could never since (if then) aw the world by the Number of
Mariners; Men who love not to be paid with <hi>Tickets</hi> even in <hi>this</hi> VVorld,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103047:116"/>
and much less to receive them as payable in <hi>another,</hi> the which is the true
Notion of <hi>Paper-Indulgences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreed on by all Writers, that the <hi>Spanish Armada,</hi> consisting of 130
Ships then had in it but the Number of Seamen before-mention'd (and of
those too a great part borrowed from diverse Countries) and 19290 <hi>Land</hi>
Soldiers, which Naturally clogg'd its Sea Service; for the Antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those and Seamen in Ships is such, that unless the Seamen are the
<hi>Major</hi> part there, they are apt to look on those as intruders, and as such
who stand in their way, and in their light: But in a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to the
<hi>Earl of Nottingham,</hi> Lord High Admiral, from the <hi>Trinity House, Anno</hi>
1602. Extant in <hi>Sir Iulius Caesar</hi>'s Collections, 'tis mention'd, that in 88.
<hi>The Queen had at Sea 150. Sail of Ships, whereof 40 only were her own, and
110 were of her Subjects, and that in the same year there were</hi> English Ships
<hi>employed in Trading Voyages into all Parts and Countries, to the Number like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of 150 Sail, of about 150 Tunn one with another, and that all those 300
Ships were Manned with 30000 Seamen, that is, the Queens Forty with
12000, and the 110, with 12000, and that in the other</hi> 150, were 6000
<hi>Seamen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not unworthy to be remark'd, that notwithstanding the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of Providence with the Gallantry and Numbers of her <hi>Seamen,</hi> and
the great event of the Confusion of the <hi>Armada,</hi> that made the VVorld so
willingly Tributary to her praise; She was so far from giving it any um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
of her claiming any <hi>Vniversal</hi> Empire of the Sea, that she as <hi>semper
eadem,</hi> who some years before 88. (as we have it in <hi>Cambden</hi>) had on the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador's Complaining that the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean was Sail'd by the
<hi>English,</hi> Reply'd, <hi>That no Title to the Ocean belongs to any People or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Man, for as much as neither Nature, nor regard of Publick Vse permits the
Possession thereof:</hi> Did likewise after 88 Notifie the same thing by her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador's
Expostulation with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark, and that the Sea is free
for all Men, and that Princes have no such Dominion of the Sea, that they can
deny Sailers the use thereof, no more then of the Ayre, according to that saying
of the Emperor</hi> Antonine, <hi>I am Lord of the Earth, but the Law is Lord of the
Sea;</hi> and she urged, <hi>That Princes have no Iurisdiction of the Sea, but of that
which is near adjacent to their Territories, and that only for the securing the
Navigation from Pirates and Enemies: and that the Kings of</hi> England <hi>never
prohibited the Navigation and Fishing on the</hi> Irish <hi>Sea, that is between</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>and</hi> England, <hi>tho they are Lords of the Coast on both sides; No less then
the Dane is of</hi> Norway <hi>and</hi> Izeland, <hi>who challengeth this Right to him on no
other account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I intend not to awaken any Controversie about this matter that is asleep
in the VVorld, and if it were not, do suppose that <hi>Loccenius</hi>'s distinction in his
<hi>De Iure Maritimo,</hi> namely the <hi>Imperium Maris Vniversale, &amp; Particulare,</hi>
and ancient usages, and the <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi> of Princes and States might send it
to rest. I have only spoke of the <hi>Fact</hi> of the Point in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Story,
who probably foresaw that her great example of advancing Navigation,
would oblige the VVorld to follow it, and that the claiming an <hi>Vniversal</hi>
Empire of the Shoar, would not have sounded harsher then the pretending
to such an one of the Sea, an Empire as easily drawn in a <hi>Poets</hi> Imagination,
as a <hi>Ship</hi> usually in a <hi>Geographer's</hi> Map, and with the like proportion; since
if the Ship were Measured by his Scale of <hi>Miles,</hi> it would appear perhaps
two or three hundred miles long.</p>
            <p>Thus the samed <hi>Venetian</hi> Poet <hi>Sannazarius</hi> long since in an <hi>Epigram</hi> of
six Verses, that begins with <hi>Viderat Adriacis,</hi> &amp;c. put the Complement of
the whole Empire of the Sea on the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> and was rewarded by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103047:117"/>
the Senate with about a 100 of our <hi>Nobles</hi> for every Verse; but they knew
better things then to <hi>espouse</hi> more of the Sea, then their own <hi>Adriatick,</hi> and
of that too a <hi>Pope</hi> once demanding the Original of their Right: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
him an answer very like <hi>Poetry, That their Charter for it, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
on the back of</hi> Constantine's Donation, <hi>of which the Record was in his
Custody:</hi> They knew that the enclosing the Common of the whole Sea
would have been too chargeable an Adventure, and that the Dominion of
their <hi>Adriatick</hi> was no <hi>sine cure,</hi> but brought its Load of Obligation with
it, and particularly to protect their Subjects and Allies there, and to purge
it from Pirates, and punish Delinquents therein.</p>
            <p>Nor could it be a remote Consideration to our <hi>Queen</hi> and her whole
<hi>Council,</hi> that the securing her particular Interest, even in the <hi>Brittish</hi> Seas,
was liable to difficulty and uncertainty, in regard of the uncertain humor
of the Seamen her Subjects, and of the aptness of all Marriners to change
their Quarters, and Embarque in Forraign Service, sometimes on a <hi>Capricio</hi>
of their reputing themselves disobliged at home, and at other times on their
expectance of better Pay abroad: And accordingly the said <hi>Remonstrance</hi>
from <hi>Trinity-House</hi> sets forth, <hi>That in a little above 12. years after 88. the
Shiping and Number of our Seamen were decay'd about a</hi> 3d. <hi>part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho the World has no Universal Empire, yet Seamen by the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Scenes of their Lise, and their being every where useful and welcome,
have the Previledge of being Universal Subjects, and are easily tempted to
seek good Entertainment in other Countreys, if they find it not in their own.</p>
            <p>What I have before observed concerning the Influence of <hi>Numbers</hi> on
the Government of the VVorld, will make it appear to any man of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thought and sense, that the Science of the encrease of the People is not
a nice Speculation, or an expedient in knowledge to salve <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
but is indeed of much more use to the Body Politick, then the discovery
of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Bloud is to the Body Natural: And I may add,
That men's now gravely proceeding just in those tracks of Policy, that they
have read and took notes of out of the <hi>Classick</hi> Authors, who writ when
there were not so many Millions of Readers and Observers in the World as
are now, would be as absurd as is <hi>Astrologers,</hi> taking the measures of their
Predictions now from the Tables of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> since whose time the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctials
and the whole Systeme of Heaven are moved from the Position they
then had among the fix'd Stars, a whole <hi>Sign</hi> or more, and as is some <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers</hi>
pertinacy in following the error of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who asserted the
unalterableness of the Heavens, because in so many Ages nothing had been
observed to be altered, when the many Experiences of new Stars have since
confuted the Reason that moved <hi>Aristotle</hi> to thing as he did.</p>
            <p>Princes and States will now in the Administration of Publick Affairs find
themselves obliged to mend their pace, and no longer travel so unconcern'd
through the World as formerly, while now they see the new tides of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
coming in so fast: And no doubt but the great example of the <hi>French</hi>
Monarch, and his admirable exact proportioning of his <hi>Receits</hi> with his
<hi>Expences</hi> (the which was so remarkable in that active and expenceful year
of 1673. that then his <hi>Receipts</hi> came to 8,232,709 <hi>l. Sterling,</hi> and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
exceeded that <hi>total</hi> but by 25548 <hi>l. Sterling</hi>) and the strong Current
of his successes will enforce <hi>Political</hi> Arithmetick on the World, as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of <hi>Nile</hi> did <hi>Geometry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it will be but Natural for us to Conclude, that the great encrease
of the Number of the People here and abroad in the World, must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be Fatal to the <hi>Papacy</hi> which has been so long as importunate Candidate
for a <hi>fifth Monarchy</hi> of the World: But 'tis now too late for any one Man to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103047:117"/>
be a precarious King of Kings, and particularly to think, that after the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and populousness of the <hi>Northern</hi> Principalities has made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
their former Donations of Land to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Hierarchy,
that those Countries that before broke the old Roman Yoke by force, will
now when better peopled, and stock'd with better brains, be again brought
under a New <hi>Roman</hi> one by fraud, and that the <hi>omne Malum ab Aquilone</hi> will
not be able in that Quarter to put an end to that which begins <hi>in Nomine
Domini,</hi> and that they will not be the rather willing so to do, in regard
that the <hi>North</hi> made the World feel the Malignity of both those <hi>Proverbs</hi>
by its old well-meant charity to the Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since in the days of Popery here in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th's time it did pass
<hi>in Rem Iudicatam, that the Pope had no more power over us by the Scripture
then any other forrain Bishop;</hi> it cannot now but seem ridiculous to scruple
whether he can thence claim more authority here than any other forrain
<hi>Prince;</hi> and he who was exploded here formerly when the Critical Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were not so many, for having ill acted the part of a King on our stage
of the World, would be thought mad for personating one after the Play is
over.</p>
            <p>Thus too in a less people World <hi>Bartolus</hi> the famous Lawyer pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it to be <hi>Haeresie</hi> to deny the <hi>German Emperor</hi> to be King of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi>
the which any one would now account Madness to affirm.</p>
            <p>And if in <hi>France</hi> hundreds of Years ago its <hi>Monarch</hi> greeted the Pope with
the terms of <hi>fatuus &amp; amens,</hi> for claiming a Supremacy in Temporals there,
'tis impossible he can be otherwise thought there now, prosecuting a claim
to Supremacy in things Ecclesiastic; for even his pretensions to that the
<hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have damned in their <hi>Declaration,</hi> by setting a General
Council above him: and which <hi>Declaration</hi> the great <hi>Monarch</hi> hath there
ratify'd by a perpetual and irrevocable Edict. And 'tis but with a Consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the nature of things, that the Papal Infallibility should be concluded
against in that Declaration: and since as the Author of <hi>the Policy of the
Clergy of</hi> France relates, the Roman Catholick Church there doth so much
swarm with <hi>New Phil sophers</hi> there call'd <hi>Cartesians</hi> and <hi>Gassendists,</hi> whose
<hi>new Philosophy</hi> has been there by Zealous Catholics observ'd <hi>to have ruin'd
the mystery of the Real Presence,</hi> (for so the words are in that <hi>Book</hi>) 'tis no
wonder if the growth of the <hi>Messieurs les scavants</hi> encreasing with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy
of that Realm, makes any man's belief of his infallibility pass for a
degree of madness, accordingly as Mr. <hi>Hobbes, Chap. 8. Of Man,</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
that <hi>excessive opinion of a man's own self, for Divine Inspiration and
Wisdome, becomes distraction and giddiness:</hi> and this probably may be the
final <hi>result</hi> there of the late fermentation about the <hi>Regalia,</hi> &amp;c. and the
Pope be tacitly thought so as aforesaid, and his Power there insensibly eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate,
and without any visible distrubance given to it by the <hi>ratio ultima
Regum:</hi> for no prudent person would declaim reproachfully against any of
a quiet <hi>Phrensy,</hi> or molest and vex such a one tho living near him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
would much less project the disgrace or mischief of such an one living at a
great distance, tho he should assume to himself bigger Titles than ever the
Kings of <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Persia</hi> did, and call himself <hi>Son of the Sun,</hi> or <hi>Lord of
the Sea and Land;</hi> or like some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, challenge Divinity,
or be styled <hi>Dominus Deus noster Papa.</hi> And thus may the <hi>Pope</hi> quietly
go on longer to call himself <hi>Monarch</hi> of the World, without being <hi>call'd
Names</hi> for it in <hi>France,</hi> just as the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> style themselves Kings
of <hi>Cyprus</hi> without any gainsaying from the <hi>Turk;</hi> who likewise did not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
the Pope for causing the Brother of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> to be in
<hi>Rome</hi> proclaim'd <hi>King of Ierusalem:</hi> nor when that Gentleman in Requital
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103047:118"/>
of that favour from his <hi>Holiness,</hi> caused the <hi>Pope</hi> to be in <hi>Naples</hi> proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Caliph of Bandas,</hi> was the Mogul aggrieved thereby.</p>
            <p>And thus probably too will the Enthusiast's who assert a <hi>Millennium</hi> or
Universal Reign of Christ on earth, with that quietness and gentleness that
the ancient Fathers before the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council did, pass off the Stage
of the World; but it will seem ridiculous not to bind such <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi>
Men in <hi>Chains</hi> as Mad-men, who have in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> endeavoured
to <hi>bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make Convulsions in the State, by the Diseases of their minds, as once
<hi>Mahomet's</hi> Epileptic Fits shook the World, and who by promising us <hi>a new
Heaven and a new Earth</hi> would confound the old, and only give us a new
Hell broke loose. But the World will not now be blunder'd into Confusion
by such wild Reformers.</p>
            <p>In the Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> (of which <hi>Bodin</hi> tells us in his <hi>Methodus
ad facilem Historiarum Cognitionem,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion being ask'd, he
answer'd, <hi>Se penitùs ignorare quid velit tam obscurus scriptor</hi>) it must be
confessed that the Majesty of the <hi>Style</hi> is agreeable to that of the rest of the
holy Text, and that the predictions of the future State of the Church, and
of its splendor in the World are not <hi>grosso modo</hi> utter'd, or attended with
any irregularity, but on the contrary that God appears there as <hi>the God of
Order,</hi> and applying all the exactness of proportion and number, and its
very fractions to the great things foretold. After one Verse hath account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>the number of the Beast</hi> to be 666, the next mentions St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Vision of
a <hi>Lamb standing on Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and with him an hundred forty and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</hi>
The Bodies of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are mentioned to be unburied <hi>three days
and an half. The 4 Angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour, and a
day, and a Month and a Year for to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay the third part of Men. The Woman
was to be in the Wilderness 1260 days, and to be nourished there for a time,
and times, and half a time. Blood came out of the Wine-Press by the space of
1600 Furlongs. There were Seal'd of all the Tribes of Israel</hi> 144000.
And in the State of <hi>Babylon</hi> mentioned in <hi>Cap. 18th,</hi> where the voice
from Heaven is heard, <hi>Come out of her my People,</hi> though all the various
Sects of Religion that thrust one another into <hi>Babylon,</hi> will admit of <hi>no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
in their revenge, yet it is there say'd, <hi>Reward her even as she rewarded
you, and double unto her double, according to her works, in the Cup which she
hath filled, fill to her double.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But near the end of that Book, where the great <hi>Scene</hi> of <hi>The New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and the New Earth</hi> opens, and the Vision of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
a <hi>Golden Rod was given the Angel to measure the City,</hi> and the
Measures thereof are particularized.</p>
            <p>And tho I pretend not to understand the meaning of any of these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
passages of Scripture, yet one thing seems to me there as Conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as the Meridian Light, namely, That as the Divine Providence did
found the Old World in <hi>Number, Weight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> so it likewise will
the foretold New One.</p>
            <p>The exactness of the Numbers described by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in that Prophetick
Book written in the Island of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> hath assured us that his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was much above the Vapors that fumed into Mens heads in several
<hi>Islands</hi> anciently, and made them Prophetically <hi>Fanatick,</hi> as <hi>Gryphiander
de Insulis</hi> mentions, and in his <hi>Chapter</hi> there, <hi>De Mirabilibus Insularum,</hi>
saith, <hi>Alibi fatidici specus sunt, quorum exhalatione temulenti futura praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt,
ut Delphis nobilissimo oraculo. Homines eo Spiritu Correpti dementes
ac fanatici dicti, quod circum fana bacchentur.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:103047:118"/>
But it is confessedly too true, That some of the <hi>Expositors</hi> of this <hi>Book,</hi>
and particularly in this our <hi>Island</hi> did too long here <hi>Bacchari circum Fana,</hi>
and have therefore justly had the name of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and may as justly
expect that their <hi>Oracles</hi> should be silenced as the <hi>Delphic</hi> was, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
persons of a <hi>sober Party</hi> drunk with <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> will not be again allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make all things reel into Confusion.</p>
            <p>Those likewise who did here more <hi>cum ratione insanire</hi> then the Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-men,
I mean the Assertors of Presbytery, and who by the pretence
of putting the <hi>Scepter into Christ's hand,</hi> projected to put it into their own,
will find the numbers of knowing men now so encreased that our World
will be more averse then formerly against their offers to mend it by their
assuming of Regal Power.</p>
            <p>What well willers they were to the Mathematicks of stretching out on
our Church and State, <hi>the Line of Confusion,</hi> as the Scripture-expression is,
and how they thought <hi>Confusion</hi> as commendable a thing, as I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<hi>Antony</hi>'s thinking <hi>Sedition,</hi> sufficiently appears out of Mr. <hi>Nyes
Book</hi> I quoted before, where the great Architectonical Rule for settling a
Government in the Church is rendred to be the destroying its Government
by Law Establish'd: and he there names it, <hi>viz. Tollatur lex &amp; fiat certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi>
and thereupon he saith, p. 187. <hi>It was moved by some Parliament men
Friends to Episcopacy when it was to be removed, that it might remain till a
better Government were concluded; but on the other hand it was prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
how while that form stood and had the advantage of the Law, there
would be no freedom in arguing about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I account that the great Fundamental Principle for the quiet of the
<hi>World,</hi> as well as of a mans own <hi>Conscience,</hi> is contrary to that of <hi>tollatur
lex,</hi> viz. that no man is <hi>warranted by any intention of advancing Religion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the right of the Sovereign Power, that is inherent in Princes, by the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Laws of their Countries.</hi> When ever any man quits this Principle,
he hath made his first step from a Precipice: he is fallen from the <hi>Pinacle
of the Temple,</hi> and has very presumptuously tempted Omnipotence to save
him, after he hath thus begun to destroy himself, and Religion too, and
has to Heavens <hi>secret</hi> Will sacrificed its Reveal'd.</p>
            <p>The shaking of this Principle is, as I may say, the shaking of the
<hi>Earth;</hi> and as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> tells us in his <hi>Noctes Atticae</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi>
did not know to which of all their <hi>Gods</hi> to offer Sacrifice in the time of an
<hi>Earthquake,</hi> but did then only worship an <hi>unknown</hi> Deity, this too will be
the fate of Nations where the <hi>lex terrae</hi> is shook by Enthusiasts, namely
that too many people will not know what God to adore, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Illuminations will only serve to conduct them to such an <hi>Altar,</hi> as
at <hi>Athens</hi> ground under the Subscription <hi>to the unknown God,</hi> and if perhaps
some Enthusiastick <hi>weak</hi> Brethren arrive not at the denomination of the
<hi>Forts-sprits</hi> applyed in <hi>France</hi> to Atheists, they will be abandon'd to a
disposition to close with the next <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of Religion they shall meet,
whether that of <hi>Deists, Papists,</hi> or <hi>Muggletonians,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> as
<hi>Bodin</hi> speaking of the Cause of several Nations, being fixt in their particular
soiles saith, <hi>alii longo errore jactati, non judicio elegerunt locum, sed lassitudine

            </p>
            <p>To this purpose our incomparable Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his Lecture <hi>de ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Little did many of our deluded <hi>Reformers</hi> when they <hi>broke</hi> the <hi>hedge</hi> of
the Law, think what <hi>Serpent</hi> bit them, and as little did many of their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning

so <hi>fair,</hi> that at that time the very <hi>poyson of the aspes</hi> of Popery and
Superstition, was under their <hi>tongues,</hi> for that No Principle hath in it more
of the <hi>Popishness</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> if I may so say, in the resemblance of the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Sin</hi> by it self, viz. <hi>the sinfulness of Sin,</hi> then the legitimation of
unjust things by holy ends; and this too our last mention'd <hi>Bishop</hi> brands
in his <hi>Praelectio secunda De bonâ intentione,</hi> where having mention'd that a
<hi>Cardinal</hi> telling the <hi>Pope</hi> in a Conclave, that somewhat he propounded to
be done was not just, and that the Pope reply'd, <hi>Licet non posset fieri per
viam justitiae, oportere tamen fieri per viam expedientiae,</hi> he goes on thus,
<hi>Nimirum is thoc est sapere! haec est ex Iesuitarum ni fallor officinis deprompta

            </p>
            <p>And too little do many who justly Complain of <hi>Popery's</hi> having sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
it self by <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power on <hi>Earth,</hi> reflect on their having sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that Power against Earth, and even against <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, and that
the fumes of their Enthusiasme do vainly try to erect a <hi>Pillar</hi> of smoke

<hi>Ignominy</hi> against it, and that it is an unlucky part of the Arbitrariness of
Popery to transplant some of its odious Principles among other Sects, as the
Devil can at pleasure transform himself into an Angel of light.</p>
            <p>The general received notion of <hi>Superstition</hi> is, that <hi>'tis a needless fear

of Gods being unconcern'd in its Protection; the which to imagine, is more

the <hi>gladiatory</hi> Combats did in some one Month cost <hi>Europe</hi> 30000 mens
lifes to divert the old <hi>Romans,</hi> so fanatical have some that call themselves
Protestants been as to afford sport and diversion to the new <hi>Romanists,</hi> and
even the very <hi>Iesuits</hi> by <hi>Superstition,</hi> having made so many of us <hi>Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
against one another, and as if we were Brute <hi>Animals,</hi> we give them
the recreation of seeing us like <hi>Cocks</hi> attacking each other with the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
anger when they please, and give the Arbitrary Power to the <hi>Iesuits</hi>
to make our Land their <hi>Cock-Pit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>the set time</hi> (humanly speaking) for the extermination of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of Popery here being come, and the worst thing in <hi>Popery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its <hi>Fanaticism, and Holy Church</hi> being the great <hi>Asylum</hi> of that, as our
Learned Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> hath taught the World in his Book of the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism
of the Church of Rome,</hi> 'tis in vain for Popery or Jesutisme to save-themselves
from the blow of Fate by standing behind <hi>Presbytery.</hi> The
<hi>Conclusum est contra Manichaeos</hi> before mention'd that is now the <hi>Vox populi,</hi>
doth with its full cry pursue <hi>Presbytery</hi> as well as Popery, for the making
<hi>duo summa Principia</hi> in States and Kingdoms, and claiming an Ecclesiastick
Power immediately derived from Christ and not dependant on the Civil:
and 'tis in vain for any Principle, that an awaken'd World pursues as a
Cheat to try to save it self by changing its name. There is no observation
more common, then that <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi> that seem as distant as the
two Poles, yet move on the same Axle-tree of a Church Supremacy immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
derived from Christ; and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his <hi>Leviathan</hi> might have passed
through the World with a general Applause, if no Notion had been worse in
it then in Chap. 44. The making his <hi>Kingdom of darkness</hi> to consist of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Presbytery.</p>
            <p>The measures that the Genius of our Nation inclines it to take of things
from <hi>experiment,</hi> will Naturally Perpetuate its aversion from <hi>Presbytery</hi> as
well as <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Protestant Churches abroad that are fautors
of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Form of Church Government, own not the doctrine
of Rebelling for Religion, and tho thus on the occasion of a <hi>Iesuite's</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Printing somewhat in defence of his Order, and alledging that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Protestant</hi> Writers had allow'd the Rebelling of Subjects against their
Princes, and instanceth in <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> yet <hi>Rivet</hi> the <hi>Professor</hi> of
<hi>Divinity</hi> at <hi>Leiden,</hi> in his <hi>Answer</hi> to that Jesuite, saith, that <hi>all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Writers Condemn that doctrine;</hi> and he ascribes the Rashness of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>
and <hi>Knox, praefervido Scotorum ingenio, &amp; ad audendum prompto:</hi>
and tho the persons who in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> live under that Form of
Church Government, have pretended to no authority from <hi>Christ</hi> to resist
Soveraign Powers, and that the Loyalty of the <hi>French</hi> Protestants hath been
so signal under all their Pressures that <hi>D'Ossat</hi> in his <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Villeroy</hi> from
<hi>Rome, Ianuary</hi> the 25<hi>th,</hi> 1595, having discoursed of the horrid attempt
against the Life of <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> acknowledgeth, Concerning the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,
il's n'ont rien attenté de tel, ny contre lui, ny contre aucun de cinq Roys
ses predecesseurs, quelque boucherie que leurs Majestez ayent faite des dits
Huguenots:</hi> i. e. <hi>They have attempted nothing of this Kind either against
him or against any of the five Kings his Predecessors, notwithstanding the</hi>
butchery or slaughter <hi>that their Majesties made of those Huguenots,</hi> yet is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103047:120"/>
it too notorious to be denyed that that sort of Church-Government having
in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the time of our former Princes been accustomed continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hold their Noses to Grind-stones, which was a preparatory way to
have brought their Heads to Blocks, and that Nation invading us with a
<hi>Covenant,</hi> the very entring into which and the imposing it without leave
from the King so to do, and much more against his Command, was a
thing that perhaps to the <hi>Associators</hi> themselves seemed <hi>illegal</hi> and contrary
to the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which provides against the administring of any Oath
not <hi>warrantable</hi> by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, there was by that
means a Coalition between the Presbyterian <hi>Divines</hi> of our Nation and
theirs in principles of Enthusiasme and Rebellion Principles that our <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist</hi>
Divines in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time here abhorr'd; for in the
<hi>Protestation</hi> of the Kings <hi>Supremacy</hi> made by those <hi>Ministers</hi> and
Published <hi>Anno</hi> 1605, the conclusion of their 4th <hi>Tenet</hi> is, <hi>That the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of Kings is not tyed to their Faith and Christianity, but to their
very Crown from which no Subject or Subjects have power to separate or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
it:</hi> and their 9th <hi>Tenet</hi> is, <hi>We hold that though the King should command
any thing contrary to the Word unto the Churches, that yet they ought not to
resist him therein, but only peaceably to forbear Obedience and sue to him for
Grace and Mercy, and where that cannot be had meekly to submit themselves
to the Punishment:</hi> and their last <hi>Tenet</hi> is, <hi>We hold it utterly unlawful for
any Christian Churches whatsoever by any Armed Force or Power against the
will of the Civil Magistrate and State under which they live, to erect and
set up in publick the true worship of God, or to beat down or suppress any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and Idolatry that shall be countenanced and maintained by the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I believe none will imagine that those Nonconforming Divines
would take any <hi>Oath</hi> but <hi>in the imposers sence,</hi> or Casuistically advise others
so to do.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore no marvel if our later Presbytery being so unconformable
to the Law of the Land, and to the Tenets of the former Nonconformists,
soon grew <hi>weary</hi> of it self, and did with its horrid Visage only <hi>face</hi> us and
march off. Your Lordship found that in another thing it resembled Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
namely in that it would be all or nothing, and you helped it to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the Alternative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Nye <hi>who made a great Figure in the</hi> Assembly of Divines, <hi>hath in
that</hi> Book <hi>of his forementioned,</hi> p. 98, <hi>helped this Age to know how Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
they would have been in delivering men to Satan; for saith he
there</hi> the exercise of Discipline in our Congregations was ordered by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but limited likewise to an enumeration of the Sins for which we might
excommunicate, exempting other Sinners that were as much under our charge.
This was looked on by the Assembly as a great Abridgment of their Ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Liberty, and so great as they professed it could not with a good Conscience
be submitted to, as not being able to perform their trust which they receiv'd
from Iesus Christ, and must give an account of to him, resolving to stand fast
in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free.</p>
            <p>So ridiculous were those Divines that tho no Pope ever arrogated a power
to Excommunicate one, but for the Crimes nominated in his <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> and
tho our Church of <hi>England</hi> never claim'd a power of excommunicating,
but for a Crime express'd in the <hi>Kings</hi> Ecclesiastical Laws, yet those frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Disciplinarians would have been allow'd to shoot their Thunderbolts of
Excommunication upon a <hi>Capricio.</hi> But not only the Parliament but the
whole Nation in a manner pronounced them <hi>Contumacious:</hi> the people saw
how Arbitrarily they would have <hi>interdicted</hi> the whole Land from the use
of the <hi>Cup</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> too in the Sacrament, and have <hi>rail'd</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103047:120"/>
with fantastick Qualifications, and they soon judged those
Clergy-men guilty of <hi>Irregularity,</hi> and the rather for that they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
so far <hi>in Causâ sanguinis,</hi> and the same <hi>Sun</hi> of Reason and Knowledge
that with the strength of its Beams had here put out the Popes Kitching Fire
of Purgatory, did soon without noise and insensibly confound their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in the <hi>Kingdom of Darkness,</hi> and those <hi>Divines</hi> themselves found that
their destroying Episcopacy here, had in effect by the <hi>Parliaments</hi> being
their <hi>Superintendants,</hi> enthroned <hi>Erastianisme,</hi> that which indeed their
Principles led them to hate more then Episcopacy it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>in the Preface to his</hi> second part of the Nonconformists Plea
<hi>speaking of</hi> Presbytery <hi>saith,</hi> I do not hear of many out of <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Lancashire</hi> that did ever set up this Government, and I know not of one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
now in <hi>London</hi> of <hi>Englishmen</hi> that exerciseth the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nor ever did since the King came home, &amp;c. <hi>And saith,</hi> they have
no National Assembly, no Classes, no Coalition of many Churches to make a
Presbytery, and I hear of none (unless perhaps some Independants that I know
not) that have so much as ruling Lay-Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alluding</hi> to some <hi>expressions</hi> before applyed to <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> I may
say that the <hi>Cato's</hi> of Presbytery came here <hi>on the Stage, tantum ut exirent,</hi>
and that Government soon had its period here <hi>per simplicem desinentiam:</hi>
'Twas obvious that <hi>Presbytery</hi> as well as <hi>Popery</hi> directed men where to
stand in a place divided from the Civil Government, and so to shake the
Earth: and it appear'd very <hi>inauspicious</hi> to the Model of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that
in its first Paragraph, it should stumble upon <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> by swearing to
a Government and Reformation that <hi>shall</hi> be, and to the <hi>preservation of the
Reformed Religion in the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>in Doctrine, Worship, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Government,</hi> the particulars whereof, the <hi>Lay</hi>-Covenanters of
<hi>England,</hi> if not the <hi>Clerical</hi> also were far from understanding.</p>
            <p>And tho in that <hi>Paragraph</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> binds its takers to endeavour to
advance the <hi>Reformation</hi> of Religion <hi>according to the word of God</hi> (a <hi>Clause</hi>
that Sir <hi>Harry Vane</hi> declared to a very <hi>worthy Gentleman</hi> now living, that he
caus'd to be inserted into the <hi>Covenant</hi> after much debate about the same,
and opposition from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners with whom he was interested
in the making of it, and thereupon said, <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e was three days in getting
the word of God into the Covenant</hi>) yet that Covenant having almost extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
<hi>Root and Branch,</hi> those spiritual <hi>Guides</hi> from whom the people might
expect a more Rational and Learned Interpretation of the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>word</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> then from the Presbyterian Divines, they were soon sensible of
their danger both as to the perverting of the <hi>Scripture</hi> and subverting of the
Church from the new Correctors of <hi>Magnificat,</hi> and found that such an
<hi>Inundation</hi> of Vile Religionary Tenets was got into the Church, that the
<hi>Houses of Parliament ordered</hi> the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March, 1646. To be set apart as
a solemn day of humiliation to seek Gods Assistance for the suppressing
and preventing of the growth and spreading of Errors, Heresies and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
and that Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> on that day Preaching before the <hi>Commons,</hi> p. the
4<hi>th</hi> of his <hi>Sermon</hi> printed, acknowledged, <hi>That that day was the first
that ever was in</hi> England <hi>on that sad occasion,</hi> and p. 67 of that <hi>Sermon</hi>
mentioned a most detestable thing then broach'd by the <hi>Press,</hi> though yet
in the way of <hi>Query,</hi> namely, <hi>what is meant by the word Scripture when
it is asserted that the denying of the Scriptures to be the word of God should be
holden worthy of death:</hi> for saith the Author, <hi>either the</hi> English <hi>Scriptures
or Scriptures in</hi> English <hi>are meant by the word Scriptures, or the</hi> Hebrew <hi>and</hi>
Greek <hi>Copies or Originals, the former cannot be meant with reason, because
God did not speak to his Prophets and Apostles in the</hi> English <hi>Tongue: nor
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103047:121"/>
the latter, for the greatest part of men in the Kingdom do not understand or know
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> declared his just Abhorrence of that <hi>insinuation,</hi> and saith, <hi>If
this dilemma be good, what is become of the certain foundation of our hope, or
faith, or comfort? how can we search the Scriptures without going first to
School to learn</hi> Hebrew, <hi>and</hi> Greek? And 'twas obvious to every one to
consider that if the <hi>English</hi> Scriptures are not the word of God, there
was an end, not only of the Reformation according to it mentioned in the
<hi>Covenant,</hi> but the substantial one promoted by the Protestant Religion, that
help'd us to the Treasure of our <hi>English</hi> Bibles, and that we should soon
be stranded on the Shore of <hi>Implicit Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor could it long be hid from common observation, that those <hi>Divines</hi>
who exclaim'd so much against the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
as an oppressive <hi>Yoke,</hi> would have imposed on us such a rigid observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the great <hi>Scene</hi> of Ceremonies among the <hi>Iews,</hi> as
would have made it forgot that it was ever <hi>made for man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>thinking</hi> sort of men found that tho the Principles of those <hi>Divines</hi>
did not like the Jesuits make <hi>Calumny</hi> no <hi>mortal</hi> Sin, that yet as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
to Presbytery did calumniate the Constitution of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> for bordring on Popery, and the <hi>Royal</hi> Martyr for being a <hi>Fautor</hi>
to it, so they did by their Censorious tempers transfuse such an acid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
among the people, that very much loosned the Nerves of the <hi>English</hi>
good nature, and distorted the <hi>English</hi> hospitality, and therefore 'tis but by
a natural instinct that that old <hi>Pharisaical Leven</hi> is now so nauseous, that
probably any one suspected of an inclination to replant the old Presbytery
here and its <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power to excommunicate, would too be <hi>staked</hi> down
to a narrower tedder in Conversation, and be it as it were <hi>excommunicated</hi>
from Gentlemens Company, as much as <hi>Make-bates,</hi> or common Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
upon <hi>Penal</hi> Statutes.</p>
            <p>The people heretofore found out that as Popery endangers men by the
<hi>Priests not intending to make the Sacrament of the Eucharist when he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
it:</hi> So that these, as I said, <hi>intended</hi> it should not be at all administred
but to their own Sect, and that the gesture of sitting at the Communion
that they invited men to, and thereby to their being rescued from the
Popish Posture of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> was but a sort of <hi>Sham</hi> in its way, for that
kneeling, was the gesture used in the ancient times of the Church, and
the first that was ever observ'd to sit then was the <hi>Pope</hi> to express his
State.</p>
            <p>The observing sort of Men then judged that as <hi>Sibthorpe</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi>
had been exploded for going beyond their Credentials from Heaven, as
God's Ambassadors, in straining the Prerogative of Princes, these deserv'd
to be so too, for scruing the Power of Parliaments above Law, and for
thrusting down the <hi>King</hi> into the Class of <hi>The Three Estates;</hi> and that as
<hi>Sibthorpe</hi> was exposed to severe Animadversions, from the Age for his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of Apostolic Obedience, shewing the Duty of Subjects to pay Tribute and
Taxes to their Princes,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>p.</hi> 21. of that Sermon, applying the
words of <hi>Curse ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>yea curse them bitterly, &amp;c.</hi> to the promoting
his illegal purpose; they deserved to be censur'd for going on too with the
Alarm of <hi>Curse ye</hi> Meroz thousands of times over, when the Subjects were
slack in paying Tribute to one another, to dethrone their Prince.</p>
            <p>They saw that those <hi>Divines</hi> in trying to <hi>salve the Phaenomena</hi> of the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and the Covenant that they had taken,
were in the Course of their Theology continually put to it, to <hi>deliberate</hi> of
Rebellion, and that their very <hi>deliberation</hi> of it was <hi>ipso facto</hi> one, and a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103047:121"/>
thing that included the horror of a mans <hi>deliberating</hi> to kill his Father:
and 'twas but natural for the people representative and diffusive to fancy it
lawful for them silently to <hi>resume</hi> the power given to those Church-men
and abused by them, who were always in the Pulpit and Press lowdly trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peting
forth the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> Notion of the lawfulness of the peoples <hi>resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Power given to Kings;</hi> and as I shall never fear that the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spain</hi> will ever be able to take the World in a <hi>Ginne</hi> by <hi>Campanellas advise</hi>
to him in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy</hi> to employ Divines, to set up the
<hi>Roar</hi> of <hi>unus Pastor and unum Ovile</hi> every where for the Pope, so neither
shall I, that mens vociferating the Clause in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Lord
may be One and his Name One and in the three Kingdoms,</hi> will ever again be
able to embroyl them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In short any one who shall consider that in</hi> Scotland <hi>Presbytery's former</hi>
Kingdom of Darkness, <hi>the people have been so of late illuminated as to find the
way to be Latitudinarians, need never have any fears and jealousies of that
Governments,</hi> jus Divinum, <hi>again Marching hither. In the first</hi> Session <hi>of the</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Parliament of this King at</hi> Edenburgh, November <hi>the</hi> 16th, 1669.
<hi>There passed an</hi> Act <hi>wherein 'twas declared,</hi> That his Majesty hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority over all Persons and in all Causes Ecclesiastical within this
his Kingdom, and that by vertue thereof the ordering and disposal of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Government and Policy of the Church doth properly belong to his Majesty
and his Successors as an Inherent Right to the Crown, and that his Majesty and
his Successors, may settle, Enact and Emit such Constitutions, Acts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
concerning the Administration of the External Government of the Church
and the Persons employed in the same, and concerning all Ecclesiastical meeting,
and matters to be proposed and determined therein as they in their Royal Wisdom
shall think fit, &amp;c. And his Majesty with Advise and Consent aforesaid doth
rescind and annual all Laws, Acts and Clauses thereof and all Customs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
Civil or Ecclesiastick, which are contrary to or inconsistent with his
Majesties Supremacy as it is here asserted, and declares the same void and null
in all times coming.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament is the more observable for that it declared the
extent of the Regal Power in Ecclesiasticks, after that in the <hi>Year</hi> 1663,
An <hi>Act</hi> passed there for a <hi>National Synod under the Government of Bishops,</hi>
and for that <hi>Presbytery</hi> which was before like <hi>Hame,</hi> the only <hi>body</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that doth not content it self to take in any other body, but would
either overcome and turn another body into it self, as by victory, or it
self to dye and go out, was then grown so <hi>amenable</hi> to the Course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in all other bodies (of which one is a glue to another) that not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with its own former consistence, it did as suddenly, and easily, and
quietly receive in the body of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> (as I may say) as Air takes in
light, and as readily as <hi>Metals</hi> themselves receive in strong waters; and then
it was that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> which in the Forms of Church Government seems by
its <hi>weight</hi> as <hi>Gold</hi> among Metals (and indeed all bodies) to be the
most <hi>close</hi> and <hi>solid,</hi> did there greedily drink in the <hi>Quicksilver</hi> of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho Presbytery then was and now is considerable in the <hi>Internal</hi> part
of the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is likely so to be till
<hi>Christ's</hi> second coming (humanly speaking) with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to any thing
that time can cause, and will be preserved in perpetuity by the means of
what my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> calls the <hi>drowning</hi> of Metals, namely when the <hi>baser</hi>
Metal is incorporated with the more rich as <hi>Silver</hi> with <hi>Gold,</hi> yet so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
were they in <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>give to</hi> Caesar <hi>the</hi> real Supremacy that was
<hi>Caesars,</hi> that knowing the Protestant Religion can be no more there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103047:122"/>
under any external form of Church Polity then as I said, Gold can
be destroyed in Nature, they thought it more prudent to trust the <hi>Crown</hi>
with a Power of <hi>melting</hi> down that on emergent occasions, and altering
the <hi>Superscription</hi> of its Coin <hi>in infinitum,</hi> I mean its outward polity and
denominations, rather then that the Crown it self should be once more
so fatally melted down by any of those denominations as formerly.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Covenanting</hi> Divines of <hi>Scotland</hi> by at last consenting that
some things in their Presbytery (which whether <hi>tolerabiles ineptiae</hi> or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
good, I now enquire not) should be preserved by Episcopacy's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Paramount National Church Government, have done that which
would make it appear ridiculous for them ever again to attempt to replant
Presbytery and extirpate Prelacy as formerly, so likewise have the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
sort of our Presbyterian <hi>Divines,</hi> who were associated with them, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
since the <hi>King's</hi> Restoration to submit to Dr. <hi>Vsher</hi> the Archbishop of
<hi>Armagh</hi>'s Form of Episcopacy, done the self same thing (over and above their
being then reordained by Bishops who had before received Orders only
from the hands of the Presbytery) and especially when it shall be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that that <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as described by that Learned and Pious
<hi>Archbishop</hi> Courted them and was refused by them, before our Civil War
began wherein they were the Trumpeters and before <hi>three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men were slain in</hi> England, as Mr. <hi>Carew Reynel</hi> in his Book called the
<hi>true English Interest</hi> Accounts the number to have been.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore with the justice of Fate that our old <hi>Presbytery</hi> too is
gone among <hi>Pancirolls Res Deperditae:</hi> and if it could be supposed that
there was any <hi>Order</hi> of Forraigners, whose avowed or known design it
was by <hi>force</hi> or restless artifices and retaining Pensioners to revive that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
here in spight of our Laws, I shall think the term of <hi>hostes</hi> with
justice applicable to them too.</p>
            <p>But there is another thing beside the <hi>Coincidence</hi> of some of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our Presbyterians, with Popery, that we have now too loud a <hi>Call</hi>
to think of: and that is that the great real part of the danger that we now
are in of the inundation of <hi>Popery,</hi> and its idolatrous worship, is to be
imputed to their having broke the Banks of the Regal Power, and enforced
the Royal Issue for the Safety of their Persons to be exiles abroad in Popish
Countries for many years, and where they might be in danger of the
Poyson of Popery conveyed into them in the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of the Civilities they
received from Popish Princes after they had been so barbarously treated by
their Protestant Subjects, who after they had by secret whispers calumniated
them for being Papists <hi>here,</hi> did in effect by the loud outrage of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
bid them <hi>go and be Idolaters there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I think of the cruelty in the late Usurpation they shewed to his
Majesty in his being thus not led but driven into temptation by his Subjects,
I am minded of applying to it, part of those words in 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> c. 26. v.
10. of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul, If the Lord hath stirred thee up against me, let him
accept an Offering, but if they be the Children of Men, cursed be they before
the Lord, for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Lord, saying, go serve other Gods:</hi> as to the meaning of which
words, I shall consult no Commentators among the <hi>Critics</hi> but shall rather
take it from the <hi>Assemblies Notes,</hi> and I may say that in their Comment on
it they write their own <hi>Commentaries,</hi> and they thus <hi>à propos</hi> say, <hi>I am
now driven so as I cannot be present in the Tabernacle to worship God and enjoy
those holy Priviledges, but am forced to wander from place to place, &amp;c.</hi> saying,
go serve other Gods, <hi>that is, tho not verbally yet really they have done it,
and as much as in them lies, they have compelled me to Idolatry, by forcing
me an Exile to fly into idolatrous Countries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:103047:122"/>
It cannot have escaped the observation of a person so curious as your
Lordship, that among the many allow'd ways of Punishment among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> banishment was not one, and the reason thereof is supposed among
the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> writers to be this: the Laws of the <hi>Iews</hi> and their <hi>Religion</hi>
being the <hi>same</hi> thing, to have <hi>banished</hi> men from their Country and the
benefits of its <hi>municipal</hi> or Civil Law there, had been to have
<hi>banish'd</hi> them from their Religion and the means of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and from doing with the <hi>Iews</hi> were so averse that even
the <hi>Excommunicate</hi> among them were not removed from all parts of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> and were admitted there to a peculiar place. But this cruelty to
Souls unknown even among the stiff-neck'd, hard hearted <hi>Iews,</hi> was by
such Christians as pretended to the greatest tenderness of Conscience pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
toward their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and that to such a degree that as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
that <hi>the Lords Annointed the Breath of our Nostrils</hi> should be only
in the infectious <hi>Air</hi> of Popery, after they had exiled him from his own
Protestant Realms, they effected by the power of the prevalent Faction in
<hi>Holland,</hi> that he and his <hi>R. H</hi>'s and their Adherents should be banish'd
thence also: nay, out of <hi>France</hi> where the Air was less infected with <hi>Popery,</hi>
into one more pestilential, I mean into the Dominions of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore there is any number of men in these Realms that owns the
old <hi>Scotch</hi> Plat-form or Presbytery, and the former Methods to advance it
here who shall be excessive in aggravating our danger of Popery, I shall
think that herein they practise a great deal of Self-denial, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
their own rest while they disturb that of the World, and are of all men
the most obliged to speak softly of that Subject.</p>
            <p>But more then enuf hath been said to argue the paucity of the number
of such in <hi>England.</hi> The Bishops <hi>Survey</hi> of the number of the perverse
<hi>Opiners</hi> in Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mentions that two or three are called <hi>Self-willers</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly:
and by that <hi>number</hi> of that Sect (for ought I know) may be
meant so many of the lovers of the old <hi>Plat-form,</hi> and no name can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fit any who would maintain the Garrison of an opinion after their
Commanders have slighted it, then <hi>Self-willers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But so much gratitude doth <hi>Popery</hi> now shew to <hi>Presbytery</hi> and to those
who are call'd <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that because they magnifie and enlarge the
Numbers of the Papists on all occasions, the Papists do the like for them.
And because 'tis now the <hi>mode</hi> of many <hi>timid</hi> Protestants to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon their Timidity's, and on <hi>the fear of the Papists and their numbers
being falln upon them,</hi> as if Christ who commanded his <hi>little Flock</hi> not to fear,
could be pleased with his great Flock of Protestants here being in continual
fear of <hi>Antichrists</hi> little one, I shall now entertain your Lordship with an
Account of the present number of the Papists here, and some little histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Glanses about the gradual decrease thereof in this Realm in several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures
of time since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and in every one of which the
highest tide of their numbers hath been but introductive to their lowest
Ebb.</p>
            <p>Of all Nations the <hi>English</hi> are observ'd to be the least addicted either to
fear or jealousie. The Pencil of Nature hath in <hi>English</hi> minds on the dull
and vile colour of fear (the which is said to be <hi>aversion</hi> with the opinion
of hurt from any object) laid on that more noble and bright one, which
is said to be the hope of avoiding that hurt by resistance, and is called
<hi>Courage:</hi> and this Age which is so inquisitive into the Causes of things,
will be naturally apt to abominate that <hi>fear</hi> that is causeless, or without
the apprehension of <hi>why</hi> or <hi>what,</hi> and which from the Fables of <hi>Pan</hi> (as
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith) is called <hi>Panic</hi>-fear: and methinks the very <hi>English genius</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:103047:123"/>
doth now begin to rouze it self up and call on us to weigh our fear, and
if we find it just to prevent our being surprized by danger, and if causeless,
to abandon it, according to the words of the <hi>Orator</hi> against <hi>Catiline, Si
verus ne opprimar, sin fallus ut tandem aliquando timere desinam,</hi> and not to
contribute to the encreasing the numbers of the <hi>Papists</hi> which has in all
times most fatally happen'd (and that too according to the course of Nature)
by the fearing them, according to the Instance of the encrease of the
number of the <hi>Iews</hi> mentioned in the Book of <hi>Esther,</hi> where 'tis said,
<hi>And many of the people of the Land became</hi> Jews, <hi>for the fear of the</hi> Jews
<hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the account of our having most justly deserved the <hi>Visitation</hi> of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
we may very reasonably apprehend the danger of it: but the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
fear of the Plague is so far from being an Antidote against it that we
use to say, it comes with a fear. And as we have justly deserved to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by the rage of Popery, so have we likewise to be tormented with
those Epidemic fears to which we are abandon'd, a Judgment mention'd by
the Royal <hi>Prophet,</hi> where he says, <hi>Put them in fear O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
one Concomitant of our <hi>fear,</hi> namely, the <hi>shame</hi> we are exposed to for
it from the Papists themselves. An instance of it occurr'd to me in the
Reading a Pamphlet call'd <hi>the seasonall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Address of the Church of</hi> England
<hi>to both Houses of Parliament,</hi> Printed in the <hi>Tear</hi> 1677, but writ by a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi>
and in the way of <hi>Sarcasme,</hi> where in <hi>p.</hi> 30. the <hi>Author</hi> saith, <hi>And here
I cannot omit to tell you that this partiality of our Rigor hath already given
Protestants the consusion and Papists the comfort to imagine that our fears and
jealousies of Popery which at present disturb and distract the Nation, are but
the self same sprights that haunted</hi> Caiphas <hi>his house, lay under the</hi> Jews
<hi>Council-Table, and scared them with the</hi> Romans <hi>coming and overrunning their
Countrey. There have been men of so weak a judgment that they have dyed only
with the fear of death, and it is not without all ground that our Adversaries
now hope that we shall at length turn Papists with the fear of Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I am not heterodox in my Notion of Poperies not being now
so formidable, by the strength of its numbers as the timid Protestants make
it, is sufficiently manifest from the Conditional <hi>Vote</hi> of two Houses of
<hi>Commons</hi> relating to the being revenged on the Papists.</p>
            <p>Part of the entertainment I just now promised your Lordship, I shall
borrow from <hi>Dr. Glanvile,</hi> and for it do refer you to his <hi>Zealous and
Impartial Protestant,</hi> p. 46, 47. where he saith, <hi>in the year 1676, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
came from the Archbishop to the several Bishops, and from them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Ministers and Church-wardens in the Province of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
carefully and to return an Account of the distinct Numbers of Conformists,
Nonconformists and Papists in their several Parishes,</hi> viz. <hi>Of all such men and
women that were of Age to Communicate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The number of Papists there returned was but eleven thousand, eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and seventy. Now tho in this Account Conformists and Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
were not so distinctly, could not so justly be reckon'd, yet for the Papists they
being so few in each Parish and so notoriously distinguished as generally they are,
the Ministers and Church-wardens could easily give account of them, and there is
no reason to suspect their partiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In St. <hi>Martins</hi> alone I have heard of twenty or thirty thousand: but the
Account was taken there and as exact a one as could be, and I am assured by some
that should know and had no reason to misinform me that the number return'd
upon the most careful Scrutiny was about 600. I have found the like fallings
short of the reputed Number in divers other noted places. In one City talked
of for Papists as if half the Inhabitants were such, I am assured there are not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103047:123"/>
twenty Men and Women: In another large and popular one, a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
living in it told me, there were at least 600, but when the enquiry was
made by the Ministers and Church-wardens in each Parish, the Number was not
found to be 60; and 'tis very probable such a disproportion would be met be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the reputed and real Numbers in all other places if Scrutiny were made.
In all the West and most Populous part of <hi>England</hi> they are very inconsiderable.
I hear frequently from Inhabitants of those places, that in <hi>Bristol</hi> the second or
third City of <hi>England</hi> there is but one, and in the City of <hi>Glocester</hi> one, or
two at most: in the other great Towns and Cities Westward scarce any, and
those that are in the Counties at large are extremely few, thinly scatter'd, here
one, and at the distance of many Miles, it may be another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We hear of the vast Numbers in the North, and there are more no doubt in
those parts then in the Western: but I believe they are much fewer then we hear,
and no way able by their Numbers to make any kind of ballance for the exceeding
disproportion in the West.</p>
            <p>The truth is People are mightily given and generally so to multiply the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Papists, and they do it in common talk at least ten-fold, <hi>&amp;c. And after
saith thereupon,</hi> God forbid, I should diminish the real force of our Enemies,
or endeavour to render us secure in dangers. The Malignity and Principles of
Papists, their unwearied zeal and diligence to overthrow our Religion, I very
well know and thank God that the whole Kingdom is awakened to apprehend:
but I think we shall encourage them and dishearten our selves, if we over magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There came out in Print in <hi>London</hi> in the year 1680. a Sheet of Paper
called <hi>a Catalogue of the Names of such Persons as are or are reputed to be of
the Romish Religion, not as yet Convicted, being Inhabitants within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of</hi> Middlesex, <hi>Cities of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Westminster <hi>and Weekly Bills of
Mortality, exactly as they are ordered to be inserted in the several Commissions
appointed for the more speedy Convicting of such as shall be found of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
a Paper, that was not Published I think by a friend to the Papists:
for the <hi>Author</hi> there Names them and the respective Parishes they lived in,
and the total number of Men and Women there was 317, of which only
one Man was there called <hi>Monsieur,</hi> tho yet six others seem'd to me there to
be of <hi>French</hi> Names; and one there has a <hi>Dutch</hi> Name, and only one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in there call'd an <hi>Italian;</hi> so that notwithstanding the great Cry of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Papists in, and about <hi>London,</hi> they did but little more then make a
<hi>Number:</hi> and the persons there <hi>reckoned</hi> for St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields are
but 22, and for <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> but 4, where yet the <hi>Bishops Survey</hi> makes
64, and for St. <hi>Margarets Westminster</hi> that Printed Paper makes but 4, of
which the Number it seem'd in 41, proved so dreadful to Justice <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Andrews Holborn</hi> has in that Paper but 6, which in the <hi>Bishops
Survey</hi> has 13. St. <hi>Giles in the Fields</hi> has in that Paper but 23, which
has in the <hi>Bishops Survey</hi> 126. The <hi>Savoy</hi> in that <hi>Paper</hi> has but 6, which
in the <hi>Bishops Survey</hi> has just the same Number, and St. <hi>Giles Cripplegate</hi>
has there but 2, which in the Bishops Survey has 20.</p>
            <p>Of the care that was probably taken in those Parishes in <hi>London</hi> that
made Returns in that Survey, <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>-Parish, and some others are
Instances in one thing, namely that there are near so many houses as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
are made for, or not many more. Thus in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
return'd are 790: the Papists 64, the Nonconformists 6: and so
Servants and Children and Lodgers being not return'd (as <hi>Dr. Glanvile</hi> saith,)
the persons of Men and their Wives return'd in all there, are 860, which
agrees pretty well with the number of houses there which are about 460.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103047:124"/>
I suppose that Printed Paper by the Number of Inhabitants included only
House-keepers as the Bishops Survey did, and tho it is not to be doubted
but that when that Survey was made, there were in the respective Diocesses,
Deaneries and Parishes therein return'd, at least the full Number of the
Papists therein mention'd, yet the Popish Plot about two years after occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning
the other Paper, it may be supposed that what by many Popish Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
removing out of the Realm, and what by many of them coming
to our Churches, the Number of the Popish Recusants did there considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
decrease, as it has from the beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi> gradually
done, unless in some particular Intervals, or <hi>Conjunctures,</hi> and is likely so
to do, till the uncouthness and strangeness of their Principles and Scarcity
of the persons that own them shall make them <hi>tolerable</hi> as <hi>Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did before in this Letter thus far accord with Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> that <hi>Popery</hi> since
the Reformation may have sometimes acquired a new vigour, and that it
hath not always since its first assaults against Popery gain'd ground of it
proportionably, but whatever the Fate of the Ejected <hi>Puritan</hi> Divines in
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days was, and whether deserv'd or not, and properly or not
timed, I enquire not (tho yet in our days the plenty of Conformist Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
is such visibly that the supply of all our good Livings needs not crave
Aid from <hi>Dissenters</hi>) but do on all thoughts made persist in my opinion,
that Protestancy hath since its being first espous'd here as a Religion propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
it self by the great encrease of its followers, except in some infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Intervals of time, as I may call them.</p>
            <p>Thus tho the <hi>Obsarvator</hi> on the <hi>Bills</hi> of Mortality hath taught us
as aforesaid that every Marriage with another produceth four Children,
yet in times of <hi>Pestilence</hi> (we are told by him) that the <hi>Christnings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and that a Disposition in the. Air toward the Plague doth also dispose
Women to Abortion,</hi> and considering this, we may well infer, when the
<hi>Burials</hi> do much exceed the <hi>Births</hi> in any City <hi>reverà</hi> (and not seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the not Registring all the Births) that tho the <hi>Bills</hi> of Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
tell us that there dyed then none of the Plague, and that there were
then <hi>Parishes</hi> infected with the Plague <hi>none,</hi> yet there is then a <hi>Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
there Reigning. And thus is it a <hi>Pestilential</hi> time with a Church,
when more Apostatise from it then are born or as I may say regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into it, or converted; and therefore by such <hi>times</hi> we are not to esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the encrease of the propagation of the Numbers of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a time in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign that the Reformation was
honour'd by all <hi>Englands,</hi> populace, being of a piece almost, and worshiping
God in the way prescribed <hi>with one heart and one mind:</hi> and then as we are
told by Sir <hi>Re. Cotton,</hi> p. 42, and 43. <hi>Of his considerations for repressing
the encrease of Papists, till the</hi> 11th <hi>of her Reign, a Recusants name was
scarce known,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the name of a Papist smelt rank even in their own Nostrils,
and for pure shame to be accounted such, they resorted duly to our Churches: but
when they saw their great</hi> Coriphaeus Sanders <hi>had sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly pinn'd the Name of</hi>
Puritans <hi>on the Sleeves of Protestants that encountred them with most courage
and perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ived that the word was pleasing to some of our own side,</hi> &amp;c. That
(saith he) <hi>brought plenty of water to the Popes Mill, and there will most
Men grind where they see appearance to be well serv'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the accidental encrease of their Numbers in any <hi>Conjuncture</hi> was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
regarded by the State, and to this purpose we are told it in <hi>Heywood
Townsends</hi> Collections, that <hi>Dr. Bennet acquainted the House of Commons
that there were 1500 R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cusants in</hi> Yorkshire, <hi>which he vouched upon his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103047:124"/>
Credit were presented in the Ecclesiastical Court, and before the Council at</hi>
York.</p>
            <p>Popery it seems then gain'd ground in the poor <hi>North,</hi> having lest it in
the warm <hi>South,</hi> and to this day in the Northern parts of <hi>England</hi> where the
<hi>Livings</hi> generally are poor, the light of the Gospel hath not quite dissipated
the Mists of Popery, in somuch that if any one shall tell me that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
of <hi>York</hi> which bears but a 6<hi>th</hi> part of the Taxes, and hath not in it much
above a 6<hi>th</hi> part of the people that the <hi>Province of Canterbury</hi> hath, yet
contains at least the half of the number of Papists that the Province of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> doth, I shall not contradict his Estimate.</p>
            <p>It is the Observation of <hi>Dr. Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Church History</hi> of the part of
<hi>England, Trent North, that 'tis scarce a third of</hi> England <hi>in ground, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the half thereof for the growth of Recusants therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus as the <hi>Observator</hi> on the Bills of Mortality hath observed
that <hi>Northern as well as Southern Countries are infected with great Plagues,
altho in the Southern Countries they are more vehement and do begin and end
more suddenly,</hi> it may be said that the infection of Popery doth yet continue
in our Northern parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that the Papists valued themselves on their numbers throughout</hi>
England, <hi>toward the latter end of Queen</hi> Elizabeth's <hi>Reign, appears out of
that Pestilential Book of</hi> Father Parsons <hi>about the</hi> Succession, part. 2<hi>d,
where he weighs the several parties of</hi> England <hi>in the Ballance of State,
and saith,</hi> It is well known that in the Realm of <hi>England</hi> at this day there are
three different and opposite Bodies of Religion, that are of most bulk and do
carry most sway and power which three Bodies are commonly known by the Names
of Protestant, Puritants and Papists: <hi>and afterward speaking of the</hi> Great
Power of the Protestant Party for wealth and force. <hi>He saith p.</hi> 140. A
chief Member of the Protestant Body is the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> especially the
Bishops and the other Men in Ecclesiastical Dignities which are like to be a
great back to this Party at that day, <hi>&amp;c. meaning the time after the death
of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>when her Successor should enter on the Stage: and
then having weighed the</hi> Puritan <hi>Party and its interest, he saith,</hi> The third
Body of Religion which are those of the <hi>Roman</hi> who call themselves Catholicks,
which is the least in shew at this present by reason of the Laws and Tides
of the time that run against them, yet are they of no small consideration in
this Affair to him that weighs things indifferently, and this in respect as well of
their Party at home as their friends abroad: for at home they being of two sorts
as the World knows, the one more up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n that discover themselves, which are the
Recusants, and the other more close and privy that accommodate themselves to
all external preceedings of the time and State, so as they cannot be known or at
leastwise not much touch'd, we may imagine that their Number is not small
throughout the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Vigour of the hopes that</hi> Popery <hi>had in that</hi> Conjuncture <hi>appears out
of that great Historical Letter of</hi> D'Ossat <hi>to his</hi> King, <hi>Anno 1601, where
he makes such a judicious abstract of this</hi> goodly Book of Parsons <hi>(for so he
calls it</hi> Ce beau livre) <hi>and Animadversions on it, and saith,</hi> 'Tis about four
years ago that the Pope did Create in <hi>England</hi> a certain Arciprestre to the end
that all Ecclesiasticks and Catholicks of the Realm should have one to whom
to go and have recourse about the things relating to the Catholick Religion, and
by means thereof to be united among themselves, and to understand what shall
be good to be done for their preservation and the re-establishment of the Catholick
Religion, and some have given his Holiness to understand that by that means he
would make a great Party of the Catholicks in England for what he would
effect, <hi>and then acquaints the King,</hi> That the Pope had sent three Briefs to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103047:125"/>
his Nuntio in the Low-Countreys for him to keep till the death of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and after that to send them to <hi>England,</hi> one to the Ecclesiasticks, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Nobility, and another to the third Estate; by which the said three
Estates are admonished and exhorted by his Holiness to remain united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to receive a Catholick King that his Holiness shall name, and such a one
who shall appear acceptable to them and honourable, and all this for the Honour
and Glory of God, and for the restoring the Catholick Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Here was it seems one <hi>Brief</hi> more sent to <hi>England</hi> then Mr. <hi>Marvel</hi>
mentions in his <hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> where he saith, <hi>That the Pope sent two
Briefs in order to exclude King</hi> James <hi>from the Succession to the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>Popery</hi> was in a Storm during the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
and in it the Papists were sometimes <hi>carried up to the Skyes, and then down
again,</hi> and in their Enterprizes with variety of success in some conjunctures,
their fortune was <hi>to reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man;</hi> and as in a
Storm many <hi>hands</hi> are necessary, so on the whole matter they found need
of the numbers of more <hi>hands</hi> then they could command, and their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
decreased in the ballance of the people here, as much by the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> Ambition, as did the <hi>numbers</hi> of the Papists in the United Provinces
thereby.</p>
            <p>And as they look'd big on the account of their numbers in the latter end
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, so they did in the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s:
and as <hi>D'Ossat</hi> said in that Letter to <hi>Villeroy</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 2d, 1603. <hi>You will
find that the</hi> Spaniards <hi>who are most troubled about this Event</hi> (meaning of
the Succession) <hi>will be the first to Congratulate the King of</hi> Scotland, so it
happen'd here with the <hi>Papists,</hi> as appears by a <hi>Book</hi> in 4<hi>to,</hi> Printed for
<hi>Ioseph Barnes</hi> at <hi>Oxford, Anno</hi> 1604 called, <hi>A Consideration of the Papists
Reasons of State and Religion for toleration of Popery in</hi> England, <hi>intimated
in their supplication to the Kings Majesty and the States of the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
where in their <hi>Supplication</hi> at large Printed they in the beginning
thereof in a profession too as <hi>inauspicious</hi> as was possibly, say that <hi>His
Majesties direct Title to the Imperial Crown of the Realm both by Lineal Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and Priority of Blood, and your Highness most quiet access to the same do
exceedingly possess and englad our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tide</hi> of the <hi>Succession</hi> against which they had striven was made by
Fate to run smooth and clear, and they were resolved to appear on the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
of it with a <hi>nos poma natamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gabriel Powel <hi>of St.</hi> Maryhall <hi>in</hi> Oxford, <hi>the Publisher of that Book
saith in his</hi> Animadversion <hi>on the said beginning of that</hi> supplication,
How can Papists without blushing acknowledge his Majesties Title to the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> to be direct, seeing they have heretofore most indirectly and
most unjustly oppugned the same; which Traite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous <hi>Parsons</hi> confesseth albeit for
excuse, he assureth himself that whatsoever hath been said, writ or done by any
Catholick against his Majesty which with some others might breed disgust, hath
been directed to this end, to make his Majesty first a Catholick and then our
King, as if Treason and Treachery against his Highness could make him a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
and impugning of his direct and just Title, tended to make him King.
<hi>Rob. Parsons</hi> in his Treatise of three Conversions in the dedicat. Addition to
the Catholicks.</p>
            <p>But tho they gave themselves (as it were) an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Oblivion</hi> as to the
many Treasons of <hi>Parsons</hi> his Book of the <hi>Succession,</hi> yet in this <hi>supplication</hi>
they forgot not again in effect to use <hi>Parsons</hi> his <hi>division</hi> of the people of
<hi>England</hi> into three <hi>parts,</hi> and so to shape the Estimates of their <hi>Numbers:</hi>
and they say in their <hi>first reason of State, the World knows that there are three
Kinds of Subjects in the Realm, the Protestant, the Puritan and the Catholicks
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103047:125"/>
affected, and by general report the subject Catholickly affected is not inferiour to
the Protestant, or Puritan either in number or alliance,</hi> &amp;c. And saith <hi>Powel</hi>
in his <hi>Notes</hi> on that <hi>Clause, If by Catholickly affected you mean plainly Papists,
the World knows that in comparison of the Protestants they are but as it were a
handful of Thieves among honest Subjects, however you are bold to brag that at
this present there are within the Realm more Catholicks and Catholick Priests
then there were forty years since. Math. Kellison</hi> in his <hi>Survey</hi> in the <hi>Epist.
dedic. almost at the latter end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They afterward in their <hi>Supplication</hi> use the word <hi>Catholickly affected</hi> to
make it comprehensive of both parts of <hi>Parsons</hi> his distinction of Papists,
more open, and close, and therein have the honour of the <hi>Invention</hi> of
the <hi>Phrase</hi> of <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> that hath so much gall'd them since, and at
this day continues to do: and I shall accord with them that the Number
of <hi>Papists</hi> or of <hi>Popishly affected</hi> was apparently grown great in the <hi>juncture</hi>
of time, after King <hi>Iames</hi> came here to the Crown: but 'tis not deniable
that after the <hi>Epoche</hi> of the <hi>Gun-powder-Treason,</hi> it did more sensibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
for they cannot say that by the intended blow from the <hi>Gun pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
they <hi>designed to make him Catholick in order to make him continue a
King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Bangor</hi> in his excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> in <hi>Print,</hi> and Preached at
St. <hi>Martins</hi> on the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. Speaking, p. 29, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators
in the <hi>Gun-powder-Treason</hi> saith judiciously, <hi>For the Number I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the design it self was known to few, but that there was a design was known
to many more. King</hi> James <hi>himself tells us so in</hi> his works, p. 291. <hi>A great
number of my Popish Subjects of all Ranks and Sorts both Men and Women as
well within as without the Country, had a confused Notion and obscure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that some great thing was to be done in that Parliament for the Weal of
the Church, tho for Secresies sake they were not to be acquainted with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no doubt but that great Number took occasion to slip their Necks
out of the Collar of Misprision of <hi>Religion</hi> as well as of <hi>Treason</hi> thereupon, and
a vast encrease of the Numbers of the Protestants was thereby occasioned.
But there afterward appeared another <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of time in which the
<hi>Catholickly affected</hi> did in his Reign multiply in the which however <hi>implicit
faith</hi> could never come so much in fashion but that (as <hi>Gondomar</hi> observed
in the Kings Chappel) <hi>when ever the Preacher quoted Texts of Scripture,
the Auditors would immediately turn to their Bibles to find them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> saith in his <hi>Introduction to the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury'<hi>s Tryal,</hi>
p. 13. <hi>That the number of Priests and Popish Recusants enlarged out of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress
by King</hi> James, <hi>if we may believe</hi> Gondomars <hi>Letter from hence to the
King of</hi> Spain, <hi>or the Letter of</hi> Serica <hi>that Kings Secretary, Dated from</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,
July 7<hi>th,</hi> 1622, to Mr. <hi>Cottington was no less then</hi> 4000. He had
before in <hi>p.</hi> 10. and 12. set down <hi>the Petition and Remonstrance intended to
be sent to King</hi> James <hi>by the House of Commons in</hi> December 1621, where
among other things 'tis said, <hi>That the Popish Recusants were then dangerously
encreas'd in their Numbers,</hi> and complaint is made of the <hi>swarm of Priests
and Iesuites dispersed in all parts of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis probable that not many Papists except Priests were then imprison'd,
and it may be conceived that the Number of Priests who escaped the Net
of Imprisonment was more then double to that which was took therein,
and that the Number of Lay-Papists was very growing in that Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iohn Gee</hi>'s Book of the <hi>Foot out of the Snare</hi> of 4th <hi>Edition</hi>
Printed in <hi>London,</hi> 1624. mentions the Names of many Romish Priests
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103047:126"/>
and Jesuites resident about <hi>London</hi> in that year, and begins with the
Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and shortly after him mentions <hi>Collington</hi> the Titular
<hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Wright Treasurer</hi> for the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and <hi>Smith
Vicar-General</hi> for the <hi>South</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Broughton Vicar-General</hi>
for the <hi>North</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Bennet Vicar-General</hi> for the <hi>West</hi>
parts of <hi>England,</hi> and the whole Number of them there named together
with the places of their Lodging, is two hundred sixty one: and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> out of that <hi>Total</hi> is 72. Moreover out of that <hi>Total</hi> he
mentions only 3 as having been formerly in Prison in <hi>England,</hi> and but
one who was at that time in Prison. At the end of the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the
<hi>Priests</hi> there he saith, <hi>These be all the Birds of this feather which have come
to my Eye or Knowledge by Name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet above four times so many there are
that overspread our Thickets through</hi> England <hi>as appears by the empty Nests

            </p>
            <p>In the following Pages he there Prints a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of Popish <hi>Physitians</hi> in,
and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and makes the Number of them 27; and
no doubt but that in that <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of time the number of Papists en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
there were enow Patients of that persuasion to afford Livelyhoods
to so many Physitians.</p>
            <p>In that <hi>Book</hi> immediately after <hi>p.</hi> 116. he Prints a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of such
<hi>English</hi> Books that he knew of to have been Printed, reprinted or dispers'd
by the Priests and their Agents in <hi>England</hi> within two years last past or
thereabout, <hi>viz.</hi> 156.</p>
            <p>So fortunate was that <hi>Conjuncture</hi> to the Papists then that the odious
Name of <hi>Puritan</hi> was bestowed on any of the Magistrates that went to
put any Laws in execution against Popery, as we find it from Sir <hi>R. Cotton</hi>
in his <hi>serious Considerations for repressing of the encrease of Iesuites, Priests,
and Papists without shedding of blood,</hi> p. 33. his words there are, <hi>There is
no small Number that stand doubtful whether it be a gratful work to cross Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or that it may be done safely without a foul aspersion of Puritanisme, or a
shrew'd turn for their labour at some times or other,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Petition and Remonstrance of the House of Commons</hi> in <hi>December</hi>
1621 before mentioned, among the <hi>Causes of the growing mischiefs here</hi> the
fifth Paragraph assignes one what would make Popery very prolific with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
here, viz. <hi>The strange Confederacy of the Princes of the Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
aiming mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly at the advancement of theirs and subverting ours,</hi> &amp;c.
and another is assigned in the 6<hi>th Paragraph,</hi> viz. <hi>The great and many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
raised and maintained at the Charge of the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>the chief of
that League,</hi> and another in §. 8th, <hi>The interposing of Forraign Princes and
their Agents in the behalf of Popish Recusants for Connivance and Favours to
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in fine, in King <hi>Iames</hi> his Reign, the <hi>gross</hi> of the Number of the
Protestants was generally reckoned to be ten <hi>times</hi> greater then the <hi>Papists,</hi>
the which is hinted in the <hi>Posthuma</hi> of <hi>Cotton</hi> who then said, <hi>To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
shews it to muster the Names of the Protestants, and to vaunt them to be
ten for one of the Roman Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of the Royal Martyr their Numbers decreased faster in
many <hi>active</hi> Conjunctures of time then they encreased in any lazy one.
The Author of the <hi>Regal Apology,</hi> and supposed to be Doctor <hi>Bate</hi> the
<hi>Physitian</hi> saith in <hi>p. 39. It is well known there are not 24000 Papists Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103047:126"/>
in all</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales: And if we should suppose the Number of the
Papists then not Convicted to be double to that of the Convicted, yet
would such their number appear considerably dwindled from what it was
swoln to in any <hi>Conjuncture</hi> before in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Reign. And I believe
if our Civil Wars had not happen'd, one <hi>Canon</hi> even of the <hi>Convacation</hi> of
1640, as ill as that Convocation heard among many, I mean the third <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
would have effected the extermination of Popery from <hi>England</hi> in the
Reign of the Royal Martyr.</p>
            <p>The Title of the <hi>Canon</hi> is for <hi>Suppressing of the growth of Popery.</hi> No
doubt but a little before that time Popery did again <hi>lift up his head</hi> as if its
<hi>Redemption were to draw</hi> nigh in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and therefore the
<hi>Convocation</hi> then with great conduct and skill did lead up our Ecclesiastical
<hi>Hierarchy</hi> to confront its <hi>growth:</hi> and I do not remember to have found that
Phrase of the <hi>growth of Popery</hi> (which has in later days so filled our Mouths)
used in any <hi>Author</hi> before the writing of that <hi>Canon:</hi> and do think that
all the <hi>Committees</hi> that have been appointed to prevent the <hi>growth of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
or Books of that Subject have not produced to the World any means or
expedient so likely to make Popery have done growing here, as is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Scheme</hi> for that purpose drawn in that <hi>Canon,</hi> and which when ever
it shall be with vigour executed will make our fears grow out of fashion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the number of the Arguments of the Papists, or of the Argument
of their Numbers.</p>
            <p>That since that Restoration of our King and Laws, and of the discipline of
our Church, a Conjuncture hap'ned that made the barren Womb of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
here fruitful of Numbers none will deny, who consider how all our
great <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> did so lately <hi>lift up their voices
like a Trumpet</hi> against it, as I before observed.</p>
            <p>In the account of the Numbers of the perswasions in Religion in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that Dr. <hi>Glanvile</hi> said he had seen, and which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in a Sheet of Paper, among the nine Preliminary <hi>Observations,</hi>
the first is, <hi>That many left the Church upon the late indulgence who before did
frequent it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe by the many there are meant those that <hi>veer'd</hi> toward
<hi>Popery,</hi> and I suppose that few had for several precedent years repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from fear of the Penal Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have a</hi> Remark <hi>given us by that</hi> Learned <hi>States-man and Noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>the</hi> Earl of Clarendon <hi>in his judicious</hi>
Animadversions <hi>printed</hi> Anno 1673, <hi>on</hi> Cressy'<hi>s Book against Dr.</hi> Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,
That the rude and boisterous behaviour of some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks
here disturbed the happy Calm they all enjoyed, and the vanity and folly of
others made that ill use of the Kings bounty and generosity toward them, that
they endeavoured to make it believ'd that it proceeded not from Charity and
Compassion toward their persons, but from affection to their Religion, and took
upon them to reproach the Church of <hi>England</hi> and all who adhered to it, as if
they had been in a condition as well as a disposition to oppress it, and to affront
and discountenance all who would adhere to it, and so alienated the affections of
those who desired they should not be disquieted and kindled a jealousie in others,
who had believed that they were willing to attempt it, and had more power to
compass it then was discerned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this mischief the wisest and soberest Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of <hi>England</hi> have long foreseen, would be the effect of that petulant and unruly
Spirit that sway'd too much among them, and did all they could to restrain it,
<hi>&amp;c. And afterward saith,</hi> As if they could subdue the whole Kingdom and so
care not whom they provoke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:103047:127"/>
A friend of mine in the Kings Loyal long Parliament wrote to me
for News after one of their Sessions, that the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the House of
Commons, Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> opening according to the customary manner
in a publick Speech to his Majesty in the House of Lords, the nature of the
<hi>Bills</hi> then ready for the Royal Assent, spake thus concerning that sharp
one that will forever here cut Popery to the quick, <hi>viz. And for the severity
of this Bill to the Papists, they may thank their own petulant inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>petulant</hi> being very significant, and importing <hi>sawcy, malepert,
impudent, reproachful, ready to do wrong,</hi> one would suppose that those two
great observing persons would not apply it to any body of men without
just occasion.</p>
            <p>It seems the House of Commons at their next Session in an <hi>Address</hi> to
the King, <hi>October</hi> 31. 1673. had this Clause, <hi>That for another age at the
least this Kingdom will be under continual apprehensions of the growth of Popery,
and the danger of the Protestant Religion,</hi> and in an Address to his Majesty,
<hi>November</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> 1673. Speaking of the Popish Recusants, they have
these words, <hi>whose numbers and insolencies are greatly of late encreased,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>It was then high time for that Great Minister of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Earl of
Danby</hi> when he saw that of all Dissenters chiefly the Popish ones had
sascinated so many with a belief of their Numbers, to cause that great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into them to be made, and it was his fortune by the very enquiry to
strip the Papists of many of their valued number, for the very next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
to that I before mentioned is this, <hi>The sending forth these Enquiries
has caused many to frequent the Church.</hi>

               <hi>numerat populum,</hi> and the thing perhaps done with an
ill intent was punish'd with a Plague from God: but the Fact of our Noble
and Profound States-man did abate the Plague of the late <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of
pragmatical insolence, and too the Plague of the fear of Papists that was
then so epidemical among Protestants, and did in effect console us as with
the words of <hi>Elisha,</hi> viz. <hi>Fear not for they that be with us are more then they
that be with them:</hi> and indeed the numbering of people in the Bills of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
who dye of the Plague is not more necessary to the State, then is the
numbring of the Souls infected in any <hi>Conjuncture</hi> with destructive opinions,
and the omission thereof in a publick <hi>Minister</hi> when ever it should be as
necessary as at that time it was, would appear in him a <hi>Lethargy</hi> that would
be as Penal as a Plague to a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That useful undertaking of his Lordship as it was worthy of his very
great abilities, and vigilance for the publick, so was it of the great power
he had in the Government, and could not have been conducted so far as it
was by any private persons: the Book called <hi>Popery absolutely destructive
to Monarchy,</hi> printed in <hi>London</hi> in the year 1673. shews the danger of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Magistrates intermedling with the numbers of Papists in particular
Parishes, by instancing <hi>p.</hi> 115. how <hi>when the long Parliament was first call'd,
Iustice</hi> Howard <hi>was ordered to deliver up a Catalogue of all Recusants within
the Liberties of</hi> Westminster, <hi>to prevent which Mr.</hi> John James <hi>a Zealous
Popist stabb'd the Iustice in</hi> Westminster-hall: and Sir <hi>George Wharton</hi> in his
<hi>Gesta Britannorum</hi> saith <hi>Anno 1640. November 21. Iustice</hi> Howard <hi>assaulted
and stabb'd in</hi> Westminster-hall. It seems that <hi>Iustice</hi> of Peace as well as
<hi>Iustice</hi> Godfry <hi>found what it was to anger St.</hi> Peter, and so has that Noble
<hi>Earl</hi> done (I believe) by some Papists murdering his reputation and
<hi>shamming</hi> the Blood of <hi>Godfry</hi> on him in vallanous Pamphlets, of which I
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103047:127"/>
hear that 32000 were dispersed in one Week, and that it appeared at an
<hi>Honourable Committee</hi> that no inconsiderable quantity of them was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
by <hi>Celier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis probable that the time that was taken for discovering the number both
of Papists and other Dissenters was most proper, in regard that the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

out of their Recesses to appear abroad visibly, and as the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

And as if any man would give himself the trouble to essay the numbring of the
Worms that are in the Earth, the properest time for that his affected Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would be after the Rain making the earth soft, and the Sun then warming
it had invited those Animals to come out of the Earth, the which lye within
a few Foot of the Surface of it; so for the above reason was the investigation
of the numbers of the Papists most properly timed.</p>
            <p>I am therefore of opinion with the aforesaid Dr. <hi>That the number of the
Papists was near the matter retain'd with truth,</hi> and that their number is still
waining and will be so more and more, but in some accidental Conjunctures
of time.</p>
            <p>A late Author hath publish't it, <hi>That in</hi> England <hi>in these twenty years
last past 250 Families of the Gentry and 12 of the Nobility have quitted the
profession of Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any one shall affirm, as some considerate Papists have done,
that the number here of secret Papists and who go not to Mass is as great
as the number of the professed ones, I shall say that the number of the
people of <hi>England</hi> having been in this Discourse represented so much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then it was in former Estimates, the number of secret Papists cast into
that of the known ones will perhaps signifie little more then the dust in
the Ballance of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Their Numbers that did somewhat encrease in the beginning of the
Conjuncture of their <hi>petulant Insolence</hi> that went before the time of the
Popish Plot, as the Purples, Small-pox and other Malignant Diseases fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
the Plague, did sensibly and suddenly decay by the change of the <hi>Air,</hi>
that the Loyal long Parliament and its <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Test</hi> made, just as the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator</hi>
of the Bills of Mortality hath let us see that by the reason of the
changes and dispositions in the Air, the Plague doth by sudden Jumps start
back in a very few days time from vast numbers to very small ones: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that presently after the breaking out of the Plot they took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the detection of the paucity of their Numbers, that the <hi>Earl of Danby</hi>'s
aforesaid Prudence had made, as thence to raise an Argument <hi>ab impossibili</hi>
that they should design a Plot to turn the Tide of Nature in the Nation.</p>
            <p>And thus as Men once pass'd the valuing themselves on the Charmes and
Vigour of Youth, do it for the Reverence of their Old Age, and hope to
be the better treated as Guests in the World for the shortness of the time
they are to stay in it, they did resemblingly too look big upon the smallness
of their <hi>Num<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> therefore of the <hi>Compendium</hi> printed
<hi>Anno</hi> 1679 tells us, <hi>à propos</hi> p. 85, <hi>That there are not 50000 of the Roman
Catholick Religion in</hi> England, <hi>Men, Women and Children,</hi> and that agrees
well enough with the <hi>Surveys</hi> of the Numbers of those of that Religion in
the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of the Age of Communicants; and admitting
the Total of such to be doubled on the account of <hi>Papists</hi> below the Age
of <hi>Sixteen,</hi> an account that ought to be admitted, the <hi>Observator</hi> on the
Bills of Mortality having taught us (as aforesaid) that there are in nature
about as many under the Age of 16, as above it, and with the making
the Total of all the Papists in the Province of <hi>York,</hi> according to <hi>Fuller,</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:103047:128"/>
equal to that in the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the number of the Papists
throughout <hi>England</hi> will appear to be probably near what the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Compendium</hi> hath estimated.</p>
            <p>That their Numbers did considerably decrease after the <hi>fermentation</hi> in
peoples minds relating to Religion followed the <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Indulgence,</hi>
and after the severity of the Parliament to Papists thereby occasion'd, a
convincing Argument may be had from the <hi>Letters</hi> of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> the
which did confute several imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tations of it in Mr. <hi>Marvel</hi>'s <hi>Growth of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
to the King's Ministers, better than any <hi>Apologies</hi> could have done,
and has enabled Fame to Trumpet them forth to Posterity as <hi>Confessors,</hi>
whom Envy here whisper'd to be <hi>Traditors;</hi> and let the present Age see
that their alledged <hi>Closing</hi> with Popery, was but in the way of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Wrestlers,</hi> and not of friendly <hi>Embracers:</hi> And no doubt then but
the many Dependants and Followers those Ministers had, and the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
for their favour and expectants of Offices thereby, were then Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to all implicit Faith, but only for what they thought the Religion of
their <hi>Chiefs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his</hi> Letter <hi>to</hi> le Cheese <hi>of</hi> September 29, 1675, <hi>He saith,</hi> That the
Lord Treasurer, Lord Keeper, and Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> were become as fierce
Apostles and as Zealous for Protestant Religion and against Popery, as ever
my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was before them, and in pursuance thereof perswaded
the King to issue out those severe Orders and Proclamations against Catholicks,
which came out in <hi>February</hi> last, by which they did as much as in them lay
to extirpate all Catholicks and Catholick Religion out of the Kingdom. <hi>And
he in his</hi> Letter <hi>to the</hi> Internuntio <hi>of the 5th of</hi> February 1674/5 tells him,
That the King had sign'd a Proclamation last <hi>Wednesday</hi> to banish all the
Priests, Natives of this Kingdom, to forbid all Subjects to hear Mass in the
Queens Chappel, and at the Houses of Ambassadors, to bring home all the
Youth that is now out of the Kingdom in any Popish Colledges, to prosecute all
Persons, as to their Estates, according to the Laws, which are so insupportable,
that 'tis impossible for any that is reach'd by them to have wherewithal to eat
Bread, if they be executed according to the said Proclamation.</p>
            <p>It was but about <hi>October</hi> 1673, that the House of <hi>Commons</hi> in an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress</hi>
to the King, took occasion to say, <hi>It is now more then one Age that
the Subjects have lived in continual apprehensions of the encrease of Popery,
and the decay of the Protestant Religion;</hi> but what Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were of the <hi>Growth</hi> of Popery on the 5th of <hi>February</hi> 1674, I have
shewn before, and am of opinion, That though possibly in the following
course of time to the birth of the Popish Plot, the coming of many <hi>Romish</hi>
Missionaries here might make some accession to the Number of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
that however the Laity of them, here Inhabitants, hath in its Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
sensibly decreased, and will do so more and more, till the most <hi>timid</hi>
Protestants shall be no more aggrieved at their Number, then of that of
the <hi>Muggletonians,</hi> or of the <hi>Sweet Singers</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the discovery of the Popish <hi>Plot</hi> hath had a natural Tendency to
the abating the Number of their perswasion, must be granted by all who
believe there was one, and who know that the blustring attempts of the
Conspirators to subvert the Protestant Religion, and which have therein
failed, must end in the better settlement of it, as all Storms that do not
overthrow a Tree confirm its growth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Care <hi>in his</hi> History of the Popish Plot, <hi>mentions,</hi> That the Iesuites
and Seminary Priests in <hi>England</hi> at the time of the Plot were about 1800, <hi>a
Number far inferior to that in the Conjuncture in King</hi> Iames'<hi>s time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mention'd: And short of the Number mention'd by</hi> Prynne <hi>in a Book
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103047:128"/>
of his, Printed</hi> Anno 1659, <hi>called</hi> A True and Perfect Narrative of what
was done, spoken by and between Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> the old and new forcibly Seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Members, and those now sitting, <hi>&amp;c. where he saith,</hi> p. 44, That an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Lord return'd from <hi>Rome</hi> about four years since averr'd, that the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
of the <hi>English</hi> Iesuites, when he went to see the Colledge in <hi>Rome,</hi> assured
him, That they had then above 1500 of their Society of Iesuites in <hi>England</hi>
able to work in several Professions and Trades which they had there taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, the better to Support and Secure themselves from being discovered,
and infuse their Principles into the vulgar People.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> complains of a <hi>Conjuncture</hi> as to Popery that he writ in,
that <hi>tho the Harvest was great, the Labourers were very few;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
supposeth the <hi>Labouring</hi> Jesuites who wrought in the Trade of Religion,
and in other Trades too, were here after the year 50 above 1500; and it
may therefore be well conceived that there were many Jesuites here beside
who could only manage their Tools in the former Trade, and perhaps as
many Seminary Priests as Jesuites: And no doubt without some hint of
notification from some one of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Provincials, their Number in any
Protestant State can hardly be conjectured, in regard of their <hi>Proteus</hi>-like
varying their Shapes, accordingly as a Description of them is given in the
Book called, <hi>The Emperor and the Empire betray'd,</hi> where 'tis said, <hi>There
are in the Society of Iesus Men of several sorts, some of which are dispens'd
with not only to lay aside the Habit, but to marry and bear all sorts of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
and he further presumes to say, <hi>That the Emperor was thus in this
Order in his younger days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Prynne <hi>in</hi> p. 42. <hi>of that Book averrs, That</hi> Oliver Cromwel <hi>declared
to his Parliament</hi> Anno 1654, That the Emissaries of the Iesuites then came
over in great swarms, and that they had then fixed in <hi>England</hi> an Episcopal
Power, with Arch-Deacons and other Persons to pervert the People: <hi>a thing
they never since the Reformation, I think, attempted in any</hi> Conjuncture
<hi>till</hi> Quarto Caroli, <hi>and then (as appears out of</hi> Rushworth'<hi>s Collections)
in a Conference between the Lords and Commons, and managed by Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
Cook, <hi>he said,</hi> There was at that time a Popish Hierarchy established in
<hi>England,</hi> that they had a Bishop Consecrated by the Pope, and that Bishop
had his subalternate Officers of all kinds, as Vicars General, Arch-Deacons,
Rural Deans, Apparitors, and that they were not Nominal or Titular Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
only, but they all Executed their Iurisdictions, and made their ordinary
Visitations throughout the Kingdom, kept Courts, and determin'd Ecclesiastical
Causes.</p>
            <p>But it appears not that they had any such <hi>Hierarchy</hi> here at the time of
the <hi>Plot,</hi> or that they have any thing like it at this time in this Realm.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> tells us in <hi>p.</hi> 49. of that Book, That in that <hi>Conjuncture in
Cromwel</hi>'s time <hi>above 30000 Popish Pamphlets were permitted to be Printed
and Vended in</hi> England, <hi>and that of this the</hi> London <hi>Stationers complain'd
in Print.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis very little that they have Printed here since the King's Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the same private Presses which gave Birth to the few Pamphlets
they printed, would have done it to as many Volumes as ever <hi>Tostatus,</hi> as
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> writ, if they had pleased.</p>
            <p>The great Number of the Protestants must still be naturally attractive
of the lesser to it, for the preservation of their Persons, tho at the price of
the diminution of their Numbers, as a drop is best preserved in the Sea,
tho it be there swallowed up. This Notion is well confirm'd by <hi>Edmund
Spencer</hi> in his Observations of the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> in former times, where
he shews in what course of time a handful of <hi>English,</hi> planted among the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103047:129"/>
Numerous <hi>Irish</hi> must of necessity become <hi>Irish,</hi> as indeed his own Family
there did, as I am told, and that <hi>Cromwel</hi> speaking to the Grand-child of
<hi>Spencer</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> that on the account of the Fame of his Ancestor he should
enjoy his Estate, was not by him understood.</p>
            <p>And there is no doubt but time will illuminate the Papists as to the Pope's
<hi>Politicks</hi> being inconvenient to them, and only convenient to himself:
For the same Principle in Politicks that makes every lesser State have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
against being United to a greater, namely, for fear of its being absor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
thereby (a Notion lately in <hi>vogue</hi> when the Union of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> was agitated) engageth the <hi>Pope</hi> to keep the Papists from a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition</hi>
with the Protestants here, that would drown the visibility of their
Numbers, and consequently the appearance of the Numbers of his Subjects
in this Realm, for so in effect they are.</p>
            <p>The true Cause therefore in Nature that made the Pope by his <hi>Bull</hi> in
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time prohibit the <hi>Papists</hi> from continuing to come to
our Churches, and to our <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> a thing they would else still have
done, was the Pope's being enabled by such <hi>Prohibitions</hi> to put <hi>Marks</hi> on
his Sheep whereby to know them, and their <hi>Numbers:</hi> And which had
he forborn, there had probably been no Number of them returnable in the
Bishops <hi>Survey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis therefore not to be wondred that our Church got nothing but the
destruction of its Hierarchy in the last Age, by the Policy used then by
some of our well-meaning Church-men, who thought that the use of some
Ceremonies more than our Law required would have brought the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> over to us. '<hi>Tis aut Caesar aut Nullus</hi> that the Pope would be; and
he will here keep as many Subjects as he can, since not able to acquire as
many as he would. And the truth is, as the attempt of an excellent Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
to save one totally inexpert therein usually proves fatal, so likely will
the generous and charitable design of a Church of a rational Discipline in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing
to save one of an irrational, and that can do nothing by vigour
of reason to bear up it self, and is therefore meer <hi>dead weight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the <hi>Epoche</hi> of the Popish Plot that the Press has been to all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Mankind so much unrestrain'd, the World hath seen little of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
Learned Writings, or scarce any thing writ with Art and Wit, except
the <hi>Compendium,</hi> and instead of proving in Volumes that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is no true Church, or that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ever at <hi>Rome,</hi> they have
extended all the <hi>Nerves</hi> of their Wit in Pamphlets, only to prove that
Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> is no true Doctor, and that he was never a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alamanca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I believe that as the asserting of Popery here, <hi>per viam Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
(or in the way of the <hi>Schools</hi>) is in the Course of Nature Eternally
over, so will the adorning it by the way of Curiosity of Wit or Fancy grow
obsolete.</p>
            <p>But here it is proper to be observed, that in all the <hi>Conjunctures</hi> before
mention'd, and in those wherein our former Protestant Princes for deep
reason of State have been most favourable to their Popish Subjects by the
Relaxation of the Penal Laws, and when some Papists made great Figures
in the Court, and got the Ballance of Court-preferment a while by stealth
into their hands, and that <hi>Holy Church</hi> being anew <hi>Whiten'd</hi> over with
some temporary Prosperity, many Proselytes did <hi>Flock to it as Doves to
their Windows,</hi> yet the <hi>Ground</hi> that Popery got then was but <hi>Made</hi> Ground
and not natural, and was too chargeable to be kept. And as the vulgar
have falsly imagined that a great Plague has happen'd in the beginning of
every Princes Reign, so has it been obvious to the more refined observers,
that in the Reign of every new Protestant <hi>Prince,</hi> Popery has made a fresh
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103047:129"/>
essay to augment it self in the <hi>Epocha</hi> of a new <hi>Conjuncture.</hi> And that as
in the most Pestilential times of Mortality, even in our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> almost
only the poorer sort of People are swept away by it, Thus was it too in
in those Conjunctures here, when Popery boasted of its many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Nemo decipit lumbos,</hi> and Popery when pamper'd, did but Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
a sound strength, and as <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s words are, <hi>Verum robur inani sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginâ
mentiri,</hi> and was but in bad <hi>travelling Case</hi> by that <hi>washy</hi> adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
flesh, and soon tired in its furious Race; while Protestancy had that
permanent Motion which Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> on the <hi>Creed supposeth</hi> the <hi>Heavens</hi>
would have if God should move them in an instant, and which if he did,
were (he saith) more properly to be called <hi>A vigorous permanency,</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
perhaps to things seeming to stand still when they move fastest. Dr.
<hi>Twisse</hi> in answer to him doth to the Expression of a <hi>Permanent</hi> Motion,
with a mirth and raillery unusual in him, apply that Verse of a <hi>Poet</hi> whose
Horse being tired, and not moveable by the Spur, said to his fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
who <hi>Rein'd</hi> in his Horse to go easily; <hi>Your Horse stands still faster
then mine will go.</hi> And thus (raillery apart) I do believe that Protestancy
will <hi>stand still</hi> faster than Popery can go, let it be never so high mounted:
And we may properly resemble the course of Protestancy in any Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
to the <hi>Sun,</hi> which enjoys its Natural Motion at the same time it
suffers its Forced, and according to Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s Expression doth at the
same time <hi>run the day and walk the year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we may as properly resemble the height and greatness of Popery
in any former Conjuncture, and the greatness of Peoples fears of its Growth
and Continuance to the dreadful Entrance and dull Exit of a <hi>Comet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many <hi>Comets</hi> have hung over our heads, and lasted some considerable
time, that were bigger than the <hi>Globe</hi> of the Earth, which as they appear'd
on a sudden, so hath that great Mass of Matter, of which they consisted,
and which threat'ned destruction to the Earth, by little and little dwindled
to nothing, or disappear'd. And this hath been the Event of the <hi>Growth</hi>
of <hi>Popery,</hi> and over-growth of its Fears here, and I believe will be in any
<hi>Conjuncture</hi> that can come.</p>
            <p>I believe that if such an extremely improbable thing should ever happen,
as that the Legislative Power should allow the Papists a publick place for
their Devotion in every great City in <hi>England,</hi> the very sight of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
would encrease and sharpen the Popular aversion against their
Church.</p>

of the <hi>Surplice,</hi> and quotes <hi>Durand in Ration. lib. 3. c. 1. n.</hi> 10. 11. for it, <hi>viz.

many Authorities about its being used by the Clergy; and while the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Monks</hi> lived upon the labour of their hands, and wore such Leathern
Clothes as labouring Rusticks in the Towns with whom they wrought,
it was but a necessary piece of decency when they retired to their <hi>Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
to Worship God together, to have that covering of Linnen that might
hide the sordidness of their Clothes, and so probably that Linnen Surplice
appearing in it self decent, and carrying with it more respect from the
just Reverence those Innocent Ancient Monks attracted, it came by that
means first in fashion in the Church to be worn by the better habited
Priests, and being here enjoyn'd by the Laws of our Sovereign, and therein
declared to be a thing not in its own nature necessary, it seems to me to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103047:130"/>
be an uncivil humour in our <hi>Dissenters</hi> so much to quarrel the use of it;
and do suppose that the Civility of the <hi>French</hi> Nation appearing in the
Protestants of that Realm, who are here, and to whom it is natural not
only to comply with Princes but even their fellow Subjects in the use of
all Ceremonies they expect to be treated with, may instill such a humour
of <hi>Complaisance</hi> into some of those here who were aggrieved at our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or, as I may say, our Kings Ceremonies, as all the Learned Books of
our Divines have not yet done.</p>
            <p>But if after the disuse of our Ceremonies in the late Usurpation the sight
of a Surplice doth fright them so much from our Church, how would they
be disgusted to see one with a shaven Crown, with his <hi>Amice Girdle, Aube,
Maniple, Stole, Chesible,</hi> and other pretended holy Vestments, and see him
use <hi>Crossing, Turning, Ducking, Lifting, Whispering, Gaping, mingling of Wine
and Water, Lickings,</hi> and other variety of Gestures, and to hear Prayers in
<hi>Latine,</hi> and to the Saints, and for the Dead, and to have our Bells Baptised,
to have Vailes, Holy-Water, Holy-Ashes, Palms, &amp;c.</p>

is but a <hi>Gibeonitish</hi> or meer <hi>pretended</hi> one, and that even its <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated</hi>
Bread is not <hi>brought from so far a Country</hi> as is pretended, and that
it was no longer ago then <hi>Anno</hi> 1212, that <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third in the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Council brought in Transubstantiation as an Article of Faith, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
those to be <hi>Exterminated</hi> who did not believe it, <hi>And that Kings
were to be compelled to Exterminate them, and that the Pope had power to
depose Kings,</hi> an effectual way to put not only the <hi>nature</hi> of Things but
Men on the Wrack, and then make them say they believe any thing.</p>
            <p>But we having been used to the New <hi>Sumpsimus</hi> these hundred years,
shall be so <hi>Curious in it</hi> as to make what is barbarous the object of our
Mirth, as much as <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth and <hi>Erasmus</hi> did, and the <hi>Novelty</hi> of
Popery coming again here in the Masquerade of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> would appear
as nauseous as would the <hi>moudly Bread</hi> of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to the Men of
<hi>Israel,</hi> if they had come to treat them with it a Second time.</p>
            <p>From what hath been in this Historical way glanced at, concerning the
gradual decreasing Popery here in the several past Conjunctures, we may
without the <hi>Amentia Prophetiae</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it) say, That in any
Conjuncture that can hereafter come it will more and more decrease, and
that under any new Prince Protestancy will be the Rising Sun, whose
light will be then encreasing, and Popery acquire no more lustre then the
short one of a <hi>parelius.</hi>

that the Multitude of Free-Schools in the Kingdom, diverting the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the poorer sort of our Youth from useful laborious Trades, to the

tho according to the Observator of the <hi>Bills</hi> of Mortality there usually

encreased proportionably, that is, as a 1000 dy'd each year more than
other, so 29000 lived there each year more than in the other, and that
there lived in the year 79 in <hi>London</hi> 120000 more than did in the year
75, and that many of these People having broke in the Country, through
the Poverty that the Plot occasion'd, came to <hi>London</hi> to hide themselves
and their shame: I say, when I consider all these things, I may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that all these <hi>Indigents</hi> will be ready to hope for a Golden Age, and
call any thing a <hi>Religion</hi> that will bring it them: And by a new shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
of Religion will be indeed hoping for better Cards in this World.</p>
            <p>Some of those who have been <hi>Trumpeters</hi> to the <hi>Puppet-Shows</hi> of little
Enthusiastick Religions, and movers of the Wyres there, would if ever the
great one of Popery should come on the Stage, be glad to be sharers or
quarter sharers in it, and to be either Actors or Ministerial to them, and
especially to be applauding Spectators when by the ill <hi>Poets</hi> of the Play,
they shall be well paid to line the Pit Boxes, and Galleries to cry it up: and
thus the Wit and Philosophy of a great <hi>Lady</hi> have been Celebrated in the

               <hi>Vniversities</hi> by Heads of Colledges, and lodged there in <hi>Libraries</hi> on the
expectance of her being a Benefactress.</p>
            <p>And if any <hi>Tecelius</hi> would come not as a sturdy <hi>Pardon-Pedlar</hi> as before
to require Mony (the which thing then proved so destructive to Popery)
but to distribute it, there would be enow to receive it; and among the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digents</hi>
for a while, according to the <hi>Stylus curiae Romanae</hi> in Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>But <hi>Conclamatum est</hi> as to the state of Religion it self as well as of the
Power of any <hi>Prince,</hi> when men come to be bought by him either into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or Loyalty. The <hi>profusion</hi> of Money in the way of Legacies by any
one, is a sign of his being near his end, and <hi>Tacitus</hi> therefore saith it not
improperly of <hi>Otho, Pecunias distribuit parce nec tanquam periturus.</hi> And
thus is any Princes Power and likewise Religion near expiring, when once
he comes to buy of <hi>Hydras</hi> heads, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s expression is in his
<hi>History of the Civil Wars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that it hath been the common practice of <hi>Kings</hi> to buy of <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi>
and some of their <hi>Ministers</hi> have perhaps been apt to think that those
who formerly were by their Artifices able to make the Disease of Sedition
in the minds of the people, had likewise the greatest skill to cure it; in like
manner as any <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Phsick</hi> who could make a Quartan Ague, or any
other Disease, would be held in the greatest repute for ability to cure it, it
being perhaps more easie to make a Disease then to cure it, as <hi>composition</hi> is
more easie then <hi>Analysis</hi> and <hi>Multiplication</hi> then <hi>Division:</hi> but the too <hi>dear
bought</hi> experience of Princes, hath seal'd the <hi>Probatum est,</hi> in this case of
all popular <hi>Wizards,</hi> losing their power of charming, when they have been
<hi>Captivated</hi> with Royal gifts, <hi>Witches</hi> according to the vulgar received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
being unable to hurt when they are in Jayles.</p>
            <p>There is another <hi>Notion</hi> I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>scanted largely on before, and that overstocks
the Market of expectants to be <hi>bought off,</hi> Namely, that all men naturally
think themselves equally wise, and therefore as any Ship that sails faster then
another, is in the Sea-phrase said to wrong it, so are men apt to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>wrongd</hi> by those who with Gales of Court preferment get beyond
them.</p>
            <p>Moreover tho the power of Gold be still what it always was namely the
most <hi>ductile</hi> thing in nature next to degenerate Man made <hi>ductile</hi> by it;
yet will any Prince be impoverish'd who buys <hi>Gold</hi> or Men of golden
Abilities and great Parts too dear by Preferments and Donatives: for
such <hi>Donees</hi> will be <hi>Continuando-beggers,</hi> and everlasting expectants of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gifts, and their conversion either to a Princes Interest of State or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
must be still nourished by the same thing it was made of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was worthy the wisdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> to observe, <hi>That he that oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Poor, and giveth Gifts to the Rich, shall surely come to want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And most certainly here, as in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Play</hi> of a Prince who shall use
that <hi>Game</hi> to win Souls, will not be worth the sorry Candle of Conversion he
shall light up; and the <hi>Conversion</hi> of <hi>Sharpers</hi> will be of such who will
soon run away with the stake of their Souls they have laid down.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fisherman</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s pretended Successor, can neither in
<hi>France,</hi> nor here with a drag-net of <hi>Conversion,</hi> catch thousands of Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at
a draught, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> elsewhere did: but must Angle for every Convert,
and that with a golden Hook, of which the value is more considerable to
be lost, then is that of the Fish to be taken, and from which Hook too it
can invisibly get off at pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:103047:131"/>
A Prince of that Religion will have more occasion for the multiplying
Miracle of the <hi>Loaves,</hi> then that of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> and the Multitude
that follow his <hi>Converters</hi> for the former Miracle, will be apt as soon to leave
him as they did our <hi>Saviour</hi> who followed him on that account.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Observator</hi> on the <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> shews us, that in <hi>December 1672.
The Protestants in</hi> Paris <hi>were but as one to</hi> 65: and 'tis confessedly true on
all hands, that the great Scene of the late <hi>French</hi> Conversions lies in <hi>Paris,</hi>
and even there the present Ecclesiastical Policy is to Attaque t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Fleet of
the Hereticks, rather by Merchant-men then by <hi>Fire ships.</hi> I have never
heard of any <hi>Bishops Survey</hi> of the persuasions there relating to Religion,
but in the Index of <hi>Mersennus</hi> his <hi>Comment</hi> on the first 6 <hi>Chapters</hi> of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> I find it said, <hi>Atheorum numerus Luteciae,</hi> p. 671. and <hi>Athei in Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>â,
Germaniâ, Scotiâ, Poloniâ, p.</hi> 673. I could find neither of those places in the
body of the Book; but observe that in the Learned Fryars Dedicatory
Epistle to <hi>De Gondy</hi> the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> he says, <hi>Quibus addo te hujus
urbis &amp; orbis Parisiensis ut vigilantissimum Praelatum sapientissimè constitutum
esse, in quâ sicut eximiam plurimorum virtutem atque pietatem admiramur, à
multorum etiam infesto &amp; immani scelere longissimè abhorremus: ad cujus fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium
non video quid adjungi possit, cum numen omne pernegent, &amp; ex eorum
mente quibuscum familiariter degunt, sensum Divinitatis, &amp; consensum pro viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
evellunt. Quamobrem impii suorum numerum in hac Parisiorum luce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentem
esse aiunt atque gloriantur.</hi> But I have heard some more conversant
in that Book then I have been, relate, how that great Master of <hi>Numbers</hi>
doth make the Atheists in <hi>Paris</hi> to be 20,000: and it being justly to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that those 20000 Miscreants being wretchedly poor (for that as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> has long since well observ'd, rich men are naturally <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or
lovers of God, who hath provided so well for them) they would presently
seem Protestants to qualifie them for turning Papists, and receiving their
Conversion Money, and would say as of old, <hi>accipe pecuniam &amp; dimitte asinum,</hi>
and instantly swell up the number of Converts in <hi>Paris.</hi> But Popery gains
nothing in reality by those fugitive Converts: <hi>for the Fool that saith in his
heart there is no God,</hi> will be easily brought to say in his Soul, there is no
Soul: and therefore say I, <hi>caveat emptor</hi> to <hi>Messieurs</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Converters:
the volatile Converts for a good quantity of solid Gold, sell them but a
little Quicksilver, or rather Smoak: and I think they may as well employ
their Money in converting the <hi>Poysoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another thing that makes it very impolitick thus to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
good Money on bad Converts, and that is what hath been observed to
be the effect of this expenceful project in <hi>France;</hi> namely, that it makes
the remaining part of the Adherents to their former Religion to be really
the more strong, powerful and united. The Wine that was at first in colder
weather preserved by the Lees in it, yet in the hotter season improves best
by being rack'd off the Lee, and thus it is with the Adherents to a Religion,
when in the heat of Persecution they are defecated from the viler part of
its Numbers.</p>
            <p>But yet on the other hand the Mercenary Religionists and Religion-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
do grow impoverished with their very Gifts, and the vigour of their
minds, and natural disposition to industry is thereby emasculated. I shall
here once for all say, that by the word <hi>Religion-Trade,</hi> I intend no prophane
reflection on Religion as 'tis in the Scripture sense, the <hi>calling</hi> of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
but 'tis they that prophane it, who by prostituting that <hi>high Calling</hi>
(as St. <hi>Paul</hi> styles it) to low and vile ends, do indeed miscall it, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
others to do so too. And indeed we are out of the Sacred Writ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
of the Religion-Trade and Religion-Traders. St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103047:132"/>
the Alarm of <hi>False Teachers, that shall through Covetousness with
feigned words make Merchandise of them:</hi> And one Chapter in the
<hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as generally interpreted by Protestants, makes his pretended
Successor to deal in the <hi>Merchandise of Gold and Silver and Precious Stones,
and Pearls, &amp;c. and Slaves and Souls of Men.</hi> And as in <hi>Rome</hi> at present,
and long since, the only considerable <hi>Trade</hi> that is driven, is that of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
there being scarce any Secular <hi>Merchants</hi> there but <hi>Iews,</hi> and those
too chiefly dealing in <hi>Frippery,</hi> so is the great Trade thence forced upon
the World from the Apostles See, relating to the Souls of Men. 'Tis
there the great <hi>Bank</hi> of Souls is kept, and the security of <hi>Rome</hi> is expos'd
for that <hi>Bank,</hi> as that of the whole City of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> for its <hi>Bank,</hi> the
which doth not more enrich the Merchants that deal with it by saving to
them the expence of their time, and preventing their receiving of bad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
then the other <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> doth impoverish its <hi>Merchants</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
some of their good Money, and others of their pretious Souls by
it, and by the lavish wasting of the time of others, and making them who
embanked their Talents of good Natural Parts and Wit there, but in effect
to <hi>wrap</hi> them up in a <hi>Napkin,</hi> and both by believing some of the Papal
Tenets, and by being paid so much and no more for the same, and not
providing for their Families as they might have better done by substantial
and even Mechanical Trades, to be <hi>worse then Infidels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis but Natural to Suppose that a Man of two Trades will neither to
any high Degree improve them, or his Estate by them, suitably to him
who minds wholly one Trade: And the adventitious gain of a Man in
any Profession, who is a <hi>Religion-Trader</hi> doth but entice him to the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whose effects render him unfortunate in both; and therefore I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> unless it could pretend to infinity of Treasure,
as well as Infallibility of Judgment, and whereby it might plentifully by
Pensions tye all its <hi>Devoti</hi> only to the Religion Trade, loseth its Oyl and
Labour in the largesses it affords Men of other Trades.</p>
            <p>The prying People of <hi>England,</hi> next to their <hi>Algebraing</hi> out (as I may
say) the <hi>Authors</hi> of <hi>Murder,</hi> have that Curiosity too to discover the ways
by which any of their Neighbourhood do subsist, and when they knew
them to have no Paternal Estates, nor to have acquired any by Marriages,
or by Skill and Industry, and Success in their particular Professions, yet
see them live with Equipage and Splendor, they often with Justice resolve
the Cause of their Living so, into the Contributions they receive from the
<hi>Religion-Trade:</hi> But yet 'tis a Familiar thing to observe that other Artists
in the same Secular Calling with them are therein more diligent, and more
dextrous, and more thriving, and too more frugal (as having that only to
depend on for their Maintenance) then such Journey-men of <hi>Rome</hi> as are
aided in their Expences by Contributions from Holy Church, by which
the births of their Fortunes are thus in a manner over-laid.</p>
            <p>Of trading Persons and Companies being undone by Donatives, and
being diverted from necessity, compelling them to an excellence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by their being provided with Golden Bridges to retreat from want
and hard labour by, we have a remarkable instance in <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w</hi>'s <hi>Survey of
London,</hi> where he inserts the famous <hi>Will</hi> of Mr. <hi>Iohn Kendrick</hi> Citizen and
Draper of <hi>London,</hi> who dy'd in the <hi>year</hi> 1624, wherein he, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Woollen Manufacture in certain Country Corporations
that were then and before Eminent for and by that Manufacture, bequeath'd
great Sums of Mony to them, as for Example, to <hi>Redding 7500 l.</hi> and
4000 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Newbery,</hi> and moreover ordered 500 <hi>l.</hi> to be lent <hi>gratis</hi> to the
Clothiers of <hi>Newbery</hi> and <hi>Redding;</hi> but under the weight of that Charity
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103047:132"/>
of his their Trade was in the event really depressed, and many Merchants of
<hi>London</hi> occasionally broke by that means.</p>
            <p>And sutably to the Operation of the Religionary Trade and the other
Secular one, impoverishing several of our Iesuited and other Lay-Papists,
the late times gave us the Experience of several Tradesmen who being
of a slothful disposition, thought it for their ease to get some little Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from the <hi>State,</hi> or voluntary Contributions from some of the Sectarian
Populace to <hi>eek</hi> out their Maintenance, and that particularly under that
great Idol <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who so fatally ruin'd the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
the Pope in being a <hi>Cape Merchant of Souls,</hi> was not undeservedly
in the time of his Reign greeted in print by the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by a
Reverend Divine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the which was applyed to
<hi>Oliver</hi> in the Title of the Book, and he it was that begger'd the Nation,
and then taught it to Cant; and then did that <hi>Pharoah</hi> otherwise then in
a <hi>Dream</hi> make the <hi>lean Cattle</hi> of Canting Words and Phrases devour the <hi>Fat</hi>
of the Land, and much of solid improvement, even in Mechanical Arts and
Sciences, and then it was that various <hi>Clanns</hi> or Corporations of <hi>Canters</hi>
only by being such, Monopolis'd the Preferments of Church and State,
and few were admitted to <hi>prattique</hi> there but such who had the Plague,
and were as idlers, pests to the Kingdom, and who had <hi>Embanked</hi> their
Souls in that great Religionary <hi>Bank</hi> of his setting up: And yet then
those adherents of his that sold the <hi>Wind</hi> of inspiration were in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the substantial other Traders, who soly depended on excelling in
their particular Trade, as poor almost as the <hi>Lap-landers</hi> who sell other
Winds.</p>
            <p>But that which is much more <hi>Momentous</hi> than the impoverishing of all
these Particular <hi>Religion-Traders,</hi> and even the diminution of Trade in
general, ensuing the profusion of profit by donations on the account of
Religion, is that Religion it self is hereby impoverished, and its most
vital part Sincerity hereby in danger to be exterminated. For as 'tis a
thing well known to <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> and <hi>Mint-Masters,</hi> that if
the <hi>Par</hi> (as they call it) or exact <hi>Proportion</hi> between Gold and Silver be
not observ'd in any Country, either the Gold will carry all the Silver out
of it, or the Silver all the Gold; so it may be affirm'd too, That if there
be not a <hi>Par</hi> or <hi>Proportion</hi> observ'd as to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Wealth,</hi>
either the Religion of a Country will carry out all the profit or <hi>Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
of it, or the profit will carry out or exterminate Religion. I will
not therefore here <hi>Prophecy</hi> that the World <hi>will</hi> never, but say that it <hi>can</hi>
never be fixed in a quiet and orderly State, and free from the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Sedition of Hypocrites till its Present State be such that Men
can neither get nor lose by Religion: And till the World recovers this
Golden Age, namely, that Gold cannot carry out our Religion, (and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
us with Hypocrites) or our Religion Gold, the World will be but a
great disorderly House and scarce worth any Mans being Monarch over
it.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Irish</hi> call their last <hi>Rebellion</hi> by the name of the <hi>Commotion,</hi> so
some have happen'd to call the Present State of Peoples Minds in <hi>England</hi>
which is so disorderly by the name of a <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and this <hi>Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
can never be over in our <hi>English</hi> World, till there shall here be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profit or loss by Religion, and that no Man shall be more or less Rich
by more or less Combining with any Party, to cry up or decry any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary
Tenets or Propositions.</p>
            <p>One would wonder that since <hi>Religion,</hi> and particularly the Christian,
with its <hi>Credenda</hi> doth Crown the reason of Man, and likewise annex by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103047:133"/>
the exuberance of the Divine benignity a Crown of Glory hereafter to the
Believers, that any Men should for their belief of Propositions not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to reason, and wherein the credit of the propounder was supported
by Miracles, expect to be rewarded in this World, a <hi>humour</hi> that hath
been regnant even among Christians, from the time of our Saviour's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Earth to the present Age, and a humour that so poyson'd the <hi>Iews</hi>
of old, that they thought it not <hi>Tanti</hi> to have their minds freed from the
slavery to Error, unless the Messias would have deliver'd them from the
servitude of the <hi>Romans</hi> (and because he did not, and did decline the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made an Earthly King when the <hi>Iews</hi> with their <hi>Hosannas</hi> were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to it, they Accused him Capitally for saying <hi>That he was a King,</hi>
whenas it was not he, but they that said it, and they put him to Death
<hi>reverà</hi> because his Kingdom was not of this World) <hi>and a humour</hi> that
would not quit the Stage when the first Christians did, but boldly still
faced the World, as appears by the notion of the <hi>Millennium</hi> having been
so much applauded by all the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church and the Christians
before the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>But methinks from the Example of the Christians of old who did <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bire
Martyrium</hi> to such a degree that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Let God number our
Martyrs, for to us they are more in number then the Sands</hi> (as if the work
had been too hard for another <hi>Archimedes</hi> with his <hi>Arenarius</hi> to Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the number of the Martyr'd Christians, and one Author accounts that,
excepting on the first of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> there is no day for which <hi>Records</hi> do
not allow 500 <hi>Martyrs</hi> at least, and that for most days they allow 900,
and who did ennoble the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, by shewing to the World an
Example of Contempt of Death, and even of Life beyond that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Romans</hi>) I say from the Example of those Christians who did in shoals
dye daily for their Religion, <hi>Ours</hi> may, if they please, be taught the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
not to expect daily livelihoods from it, and to account they have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fair play if they do not lose their livelihoods by it.</p>
            <p>'Tis moreover observable that under the <hi>Iewish Theocracy</hi> Providence
had then so ordered things, that no Man should <hi>get</hi> or <hi>lose</hi> by Religon.
The <hi>Tribes</hi> had then their shares of the good Land by <hi>lott,</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi>
only had that affluent proportion of the <hi>Proventus</hi> of the other Tribes
that I have before Calculated, and which would have tempted many of
the other Tribes to have march'd over to the <hi>Officium</hi> and <hi>Beneficium</hi> of
the Priesthood, had not God their <hi>Monarch</hi> provided against that, by the
confinement of the Administration of the Priesthood to one <hi>Tribe,</hi> and its
descendents by natural generation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as to the notion of</hi> getting <hi>or</hi> losing <hi>by Religion, I shall recommend
to your</hi> Lordships <hi>reading a small</hi> Pamphlet <hi>printed in two sheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in</hi> Folio, <hi>and call'd</hi> The great Question to be consider'd by the King and
this Parliament, <hi>&amp;c. to wit,</hi> How far Religion is concern'd in Policy or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Government, and Policy in Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the disquisition of which a
sufficient Basis is proposed for the firm settlement of these Nations to the most
probable satisfaction of the several Parties and Interests therein, and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by the name of <hi>Philo-Britanicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who the Author of it was I cannot learn, but do easily find by the
Book that he is a Man of great</hi> Acumen <hi>of thought, and that Matters of
Religion and State, especially relating to this Kingdom, have been very
much thought of by him, and that the Author was certainly neither</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
<hi>nor</hi> Presbyterian, <hi>and so far from being a favourer of the Church of</hi>
England <hi>that he doth</hi> interminis <hi>make the publick Maintenance of the
Clergy to have been the</hi> Bone of Contention in these Nations, p. 8. <hi>and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103047:133"/>
there saith,</hi> It will be found to stand on the same foot with Abbies and N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and their Lands, <hi>and there further as a</hi> propounder <hi>would give all the
Church-Lands to the Crown, and the Tithes to the People; and then tells
us,</hi> That all Fears and Iealousies and Animosities on the account of Religion,
will be pluck'd up by the Roots. <hi>That Author in</hi> p. <hi>the</hi> 5th <hi>doth very acutely
observe,</hi> That Popery hath two Parts, the one is that which is meerly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that is which relates properly to Religion or Conscience, and which is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to them, such as the believing of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Adoration of
Saints and Images, yea, and the superiority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over other
Churchmen, all which and those of this kind may be believed and professed
without prejudice to Civil Society, and as being matters relating to Conscience
come not properly under the Magistrates Cognizance: the other part is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Pope's Power over Princes and States, his obsolving the people from
their Obedience, his giving them dispensations to kill Princes and destroy them,
and allowing them not to keep faith to Hereticks and such like, which as they
are destructive to Government, are truly no part of Religion, but a politick
contrivance, long hatch'd by the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his dependants for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
to himself a firm Monarchy in the World, and therefore ought to be
guarded against and punished by the Magistrate, not as errors in Religion, but as
destructive to the Government.</p>
            <p>The Author of <hi>Omnia comesta à Belo</hi> as great a <hi>Calculator</hi> as he would go
for, was yet but a Blunderer in respect of the <hi>Author</hi> of this discourse, in
which there is so much smoothness of words and plausibleness of notion,
that if it were possible he would <hi>deceive some of the very Elect,</hi> and that too,
of their Established Maintenance.</p>
            <p>But whatever the Sentiments of that Author were, I must affirm that
as ample as the Revenue of the Church of <hi>England</hi> shews, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with that of other Protestant Countries, it is yet so far from excess in
its proportion as to ward off all inconveniences from the State of mens
getting by Religion.</p>
            <p>The over ballance of Land here was so much on the Churches side in
the times of Popery, that it was then in our <hi>Provincial Constitutions</hi> sulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
as a <hi>Menace</hi> to the Layety that in case of some particular <hi>Contumacy,</hi>
none of their Children should be admitted into the <hi>Clerical</hi> Calling for three
Generations.</p>
            <p>But how Nugatory would such a threatning now be! There are few or
none of the inferiour <hi>Clergy,</hi> but might have in inferiour Callings arrived at
greater Incomes and with less charge of Education, and the most envied of
our <hi>dignified</hi> Clergy might in the other two of the great professions, <hi>viz.</hi>
in <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Physick</hi> raised their Estates and Families on better and easier
terms then they now can.</p>
            <p>And that the Men of the most eminent natural parts would be losers by
Religion, I mean by the <hi>Clerical</hi> Profession but for the encouragement of
these Dignities, we have an indication from the quality of the <hi>Divines</hi> in
the late times, who were generally so unlearned, that Learning it self then
seemed to have retreated from our <hi>Vniversities</hi> to the Colledge of <hi>Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
in <hi>London.</hi> Notwithstanding the great Sums of Money by the Usurp'd
Powers employ'd in the Augmentations of Livings, one may well suppose
that all of the 10000 Livings in <hi>England</hi> except 600 needed, for that was
the number of the Livings in <hi>England</hi> as beforesaid averr'd to have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Competent maintenance for a Minister, the dearth of Learning and
Learned Men still continued, insomuch that the teeming press then brought
forth few Learned Discourses, relating to the faculty of <hi>Theology</hi> but what
was published by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> and some other
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103047:134"/>
               <hi>Divines</hi> born and bred in the Sunshine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I do believe that in <hi>Holland</hi> the Livelihoods for their Parochial <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
are better then those that our Livings at a <hi>Medium</hi> yield, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ministers Widdows have 40 <hi>l.</hi> a year paid them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Viduity: but for want of such encouragement as our <hi>Dignities</hi>
afford for the Educating their Natives in Learning, they are constrained
as Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> observes in his Book called <hi>Beams of former light,</hi> p. 152.
<hi>To send to Forraign Parts to men to be their Professors, in their Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I account that nothing less then the hopes of being <hi>Dignitaries,</hi>
could in the flourishing condition of the Church of <hi>England</hi> make so many
of our Learned <hi>Divines</hi> take up with the poor generality of our Livings,
which are such that the <hi>Answer to the Abstract</hi> published by Authority in
the <hi>Year</hi> 1588, mentions in <hi>p. 27, That surely if a Survey were taken of
all Parish Churches and Parochial Chappels in</hi> England, <hi>I dare affirm that it
would fall out that there be double or treble as many more Livings allotted for
Ministers under the true value of</hi> 30 l. <hi>a year,</hi> ultra omnia onera &amp; reprisas,
<hi>as are above that Rate.</hi> And that our <hi>Divines</hi> in the late Times look'd on
such a yearly Sum as an uncomfortable pittance for a Minister, we have
an instance in the Story told in a <hi>History</hi> of the late Times in <hi>Print, where
a Patron desiring one to recommend to him a godly man for a Living of</hi> 50 l.
<hi>a year he then</hi> had void, was answered, <hi>That a godly man could not be had to
accept of a Living of so small a value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is moreover a lamentable thing to consider what an <hi>Excisum</hi> hath
been put on the value, even of our poor Livings, by the Simoniacal Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Lay-Patrons: and in their hands the greatest part of the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
hath been computed to be.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard</hi> a Famous Parliament-man of the last Age, in a
<hi>Speech</hi> of his in behalf of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> spoke in Parliament and Printed at
<hi>Oxford, Anno</hi> 1628, speaks there of the <hi>Scandalous</hi> Livings we have of 5 <hi>l.</hi>
and 5 <hi>Mark</hi> a year, and Cites Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> for complaining in a Sermon
before Queen <hi>Elizabeth, That the Simony of our Lay-Patrons, was general
throughout</hi> England, <hi>and that a Gentleman cannot keep his House unless he
have a Parsonage or two in farm for his Provision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how generally a Simoniacal disposition hath continued to infect our
Gentry, appears by the vile Bonds that have been so much by Lay-Patrons
imposed on the Ministers they presented, <hi>viz.</hi> to resign their Livings again
to them at pleasure; and it is for the lasting Glory of the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi>
that he hath in Court declared that he will on occasion Null all Bonds of
that sort, and no doubt but the accidental encrease of the poverty of the
Gentry, which hath tempted them to sell the same Land twice, and to
sell the same Living once, will tend to the encrease of Simony.</p>
            <p>Moreover when it shall be considered, that the Case of a Minister is such,
that tho Lay-men are secured by the Great Charter from being punished for
Contempt of the King's Commands, otherwise then with the saving of
their <hi>Contenement</hi> and <hi>Free-hold,</hi> yet that he holding <hi>Virtute Officii</hi> is lyable
by the Kings Ecclesiastical Laws, even for those things that in the Layety
are no offences to be deprived of the Free-hold, that the Law supposed him
as Parson or Vicar to possess, and that he by the Artifice of the said <hi>Bonds,</hi>
hath had the benefit of his Free-hold, in effect during the Patrons <hi>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>epla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum:</hi>
and further, that every New Political <hi>Conjuncture</hi> threatens him
with New Subscriptions from the Magistrate, and New Nic-names from
the <hi>Mobile,</hi> and that on any change of Religion, he is sure to be put in the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103047:134"/>
forlorn hope, and that he tho continually thinking of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is
his profession, hath not yet that freedom to speak all his Sentiments of the
controverted part of it, which a Lay-man enjoys, and that he is still expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by constant thinking to prey on the Membranes of his own Brain to find
Notions for sensless people, methinks after he has all his life before, been
constrain'd to take these bitter Pills as they are in themselves, none should
repine at their being <hi>gilded</hi> for him in his declining age: and if among
<hi>Ten thousand</hi> of these, <hi>twenty six</hi> shall in their old Age have the Revenue of
Bishops, and <hi>five hundred</hi> of <hi>Prebends</hi> after so many shall have drawn
<hi>Blanks</hi> in the <hi>Lottery</hi> of Preferment, those few that shall draw those <hi>Prizes,</hi>
need not be envyed for what they have acquired by the Theological Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
            <p>It was both with Justice and Prudence by our Laws caution'd that so great
a part of the <hi>Clerical</hi> Maintenance should arise from <hi>Tithes,</hi> for by that
means our <hi>Clergy</hi> are engaged to make the interest of their Country and
its improvement their own; and had they not had so much of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
sounded on <hi>Tithes,</hi> but on Money out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> as they
had before this time lost excessively by Religion, so Religion would have
lost their Calling: for that the price of Silver falling by the plenty of it,
and the plenty or encrease of our people making all the Products of our
Country dearer, it hath been advantageous to our Clergy to receive their
Tithes in kind, as it hath been to Colleges to receive a <hi>Quota</hi> of their <hi>Rent</hi>
in <hi>Corn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that still the maintenance of the inferior Clergy, was too mean, will
appear even by the late Enemies of our Hierarchy being Judges, for Mr.
<hi>Nye</hi> in that Book of his, called <hi>Beams of former Light,</hi> having spoke of the
Ministers Calling, being once a gainful one, saith <hi>p. 123. It is vtterly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
now, not but that there is a very liberal Maintenance appertaining to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and greater by the bounty of the Honourable Parliament, then the
Preaching Ministry have formerly enjoyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The gradual encrease of our People and Trade, hath proportionably
encreased the <hi>Clerical</hi> Revenue which on the beginning of the Reformation
was presently sunk, so that <hi>Latimer</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> before <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi>
said, <hi>We of the Clergy have had too much, but that is taken away, and now we
have too little;</hi> and what <hi>Iewel</hi> in his Sermon notified to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of
that kind, I have mention'd, and so languid was the State of the maintenance
of the Inferior Clergy in her time, that She by one of her Printed Ecclesiastical
<hi>Injunctions, Anno</hi> 1599. did under great Penalties, <hi>forbid all Priests and
Deacons to Marry any Woman without the Advice and Allowance first had by
the Bishop of the Diocess and two Iustices of Peace,</hi> which I suppose was
caution'd by the <hi>Queen,</hi> that the many Ministers who had not competent
Livings to maintain themselves, might not marrying Wives without Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
by new Births, encrease the number of <hi>Paupers</hi> in Parishes.</p>
            <p>It is observable, that in the late times the <hi>Iesuites</hi> did publish many Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
in Print against <hi>Tithes,</hi> and did animate the people to make Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
Addresses to the Usurpers to abolish that maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
wherein as their <hi>Politicks</hi> were so unjust to our <hi>Monarch,</hi> that had
they succeeded, they would have barricaded the way for his return in the
minds of too many of the People for fear that the payment of Tithes should
return too, so likewise were they so ridiculous by cutting off all hopes of
the return of Popery here in any Conjuncture of time, that less then an
Army of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> would never have perswaded the common People to
hear with patience any talk of <hi>Holy Church's</hi> re-establishment here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:103047:135"/>
Tho, as I have shewn, that <hi>Tithes</hi> by reason of the equality in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of them, and the diuturnity of time that hath habituated People
to the payment thereof, are a gentle part of the Yoke of our Ecclesiastical
Government, yet if the payment of them or any other Tax, whether of
<hi>Excise, Customs,</hi> or <hi>Chimny-money</hi> were for many years discontinued, there
would be no probability of bringing either the old Stagers or new Comers
in the World to consent or hearken to their being re-established.</p>
            <p>The Critical Observers of the <hi>Iewish</hi> State, after Ten Tribes had made a
Schism from the other two, judge that there were two <hi>Conjunctures</hi> of time,
wherein their piecing together was fesable, and that the great true Cause in
Nature that hindred the Re-union of the Tribes, was the aversion in the
Ten Tribes to make three chargeable Journeys yearly to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and to
pay a double Tenth yearly out of their Estates (besides Offrings and other
Casualties to the Priests and Levites) from which trouble and charge they
had been relaxed by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and by his Model of Idolatry: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the People having most inclination to that Religion that was cheapest,
and knowing that if they return'd to their old Religion, they must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
return to their old Payments to the Priests and Levites, did venture
to adhere to the cheaper <hi>Golden</hi> Calf: and had the <hi>Iesuites</hi> here effected
from the Usurpt Powers the Abolition of the Clergies <hi>Tithes,</hi> which
would have made the Return of the Church of <hi>England</hi> so difficult, I may
well argue that it would have made the Return of the Papal Religion, and
its <hi>chargeable</hi> Idolatry impossible, whose Yoke of Payments neither we nor
our Forefathers were able to fear.</p>
            <p>But when senseless <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anaticks</hi> came with those <hi>Petitions</hi> against <hi>Tithes,</hi>
the more sagacious of the Usurpers knew that the <hi>hand of</hi> Joab <hi>was in
them,</hi> and they knew that hardly any Observation was more <hi>trite</hi> then that
Popery gained ground, chiefly in the poorer parts of the Kingdom, where
the despicable maintenance made the Ministry so too, and where too the
Pope would no more hunt for Converts then among the poor <hi>Norwegians,</hi>
but that it was of use to him to have the number of his <hi>Subjects</hi> increas'd
in any poor places in a rich Kingdom, where he tho a spiritual <hi>King</hi> might
yet call his <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>Fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard</hi> takes notice of <hi>Popery's</hi> being an intruder among
the poor Benefices of the <hi>North,</hi> in the Speech before Cited, and there
saith, <hi>p. 1. That to plant good Ministers in good Livings, is the strongest
and surest means to establish true Religion, and will prevail more against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry
then the making of new Laws, and executing the old,</hi> and there <hi>p.</hi> 3.
relates what King <hi>Iames</hi> had done for the supporting of the Protestant
Religion in <hi>Scotland, where</hi> (saith he) <hi>within the space of one year, he caused
to be Planted Churches throughout that Kingdom, the High-Lands and the
Borders worth</hi> 30 l. <hi>a year a piece, with a House and some glebe-Land belonging
to them, which</hi> 30 l. <hi>a year considering the cheapness of that Country is worth
double as much as any where within an 100 Miles of</hi> London. And <hi>p.</hi> 7.
he mentions some Passages of Bishop <hi>Iewels</hi> Sermon before Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
where the Bishop having in general reflected on those that then cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the diminution of the maintenance of Ministers, he further saith,
<hi>howsoever they seem to rejoyce at the prosperity of</hi> Sion, <hi>and to seek the safety
and preservation of</hi> the Lords Anointed, <hi>yet needs must it be that by these
means Forraign Power, of which this Realm by the mercy of God is happily
delivered, shall again be brought in upon us. Such things shall be done to
us as we before suffer'd in the times of Popery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Twas there before mention'd how that Man of God with a flame of
Zeal, reflected in these words on the</hi> Queen <hi>her self,</hi> Our posterities shall rue
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103047:135"/>
that ever such Fathers went before them, and Chronicles shall report this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of learning among the Plagues and Murrains and other Punishments of
God; they shall leave it written in what time, and under whose reign this was
done.</p>
            <p>If the good Bishop had considered the vastness of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
before mention'd, in desending the Protestant Cause, <hi>contra gentes,</hi> he
would have <hi>given her day</hi> to have built and endowed some Churches; and
to those <hi>expences</hi> before mention'd, it comes into my memory here to add
what I then forgot, which is related in the <hi>Travels</hi> of Mr. <hi>Fines Moryson,</hi>
who was <hi>Secretary</hi> then to the <hi>Chief Governor</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> in her Reign, <hi>viz.
That she expended in 4 years time on that Kingdom, a Million and one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Ninety Eight Thousand Pound</hi> Sterling; which Sum so laid out then
on <hi>Ireland,</hi> will seem the more considerable, when by a late <hi>Report</hi> of the
<hi>Counsel of Trade</hi> in that Kingdom drawn by Sir <hi>W. P. The currant Cash of
that Kingdom is made to be but Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pound</hi>
Sterling.</p>
            <p>But this by the way, and to resume my discourse of our Clergies neither
getting nor losing by Religion; I shall say that as the acceptable free resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Church</hi> as well as the <hi>Crown</hi> to its Lands, shewed that there
was no fear of its injuring the Ballance of the Kingdom, or hurting Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by its weight, so hath the following <hi>acquiescence</hi> of all dis-interested
men in the same, evinced that weight to be no <hi>gravamen.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>In a</hi> Pamphlet <hi>called</hi> a Letter from a Person of Quality to his Friend in the

Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and which asserts the Justice of the</hi> Declaration of
Indulgence, <hi>the</hi> Author <hi>in p. 5. speaking of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the head of the Protestants at home and abroad, saith,</hi> For that place
is due to the Church of <hi>England</hi> being in favour and of nearest approach to the
most powerful Prince of that Religion, and so always had it in their hands to be
the Intercessors and Procurers of the greatest good and protection that Party
throughout all Christendom can receive. And thus the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
might become not only <hi>alterius orbis,</hi> but <hi>alterius Religionis Papa,</hi> and
all this Addition of Honour and Power attain'd without the least loss or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of the Church: it not being intended that one Dignity or Preferment
should be given to any, but those that were strictly conformable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The natural inclination in all</hi> ingenious <hi>Men not to cast</hi> an evil Eye <hi>on
the Church Revenue, appears in Mr.</hi> Marvel<hi>'s Second</hi> Part <hi>of the</hi> Reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
transpos'd, <hi>p. 146. where he saith,</hi> I am so far from thinking enviously of
the Revenue of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. That I think in my Conscience
it is all but too little, and wish with all my heart that there could be some way
found out to augment it.</p>
            <p>And our ingenious and great Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his <hi>certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
touching the pacification of the Church of</hi> England, hath with great
equity decreed our Parliaments to be in some sort indebted to the Church.</p>
            <p>Moreover that <hi>Gentlemanly</hi> way of writing used by our great <hi>Divines,</hi>
in a late <hi>Conjuncture</hi> against Popery, and so suitable to the refinement of
Wit and Reason in the Age, and wherein without the Pedantry of unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Words or Quotations, or raising a dust out of the Learned Rubbish
of the Schoolmen, they generally with a manly Style and clear reason and
skill at that weapon got the Sword out of their Enemies hand by the
<hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> and shewed us that Popery and Implicit Faith
were not Calculated for the Meridian of this Age, hath (I think) made
all ingenious Men <hi>Conformists</hi> in this opinion, that if their <hi>Genius</hi> had been
cramp'd with the <hi>res angust a domi,</hi> their thoughts had not in their Books
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103047:136"/>
appeared so great, and therefore I hope that all the well writ <hi>works of their
hands, and seasonable discourses against</hi> Popery at that time when it was ready
to <hi>curse</hi> us, and to <hi>rise up against our Religion,</hi> will make all <hi>thinking</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
to say <hi>Amen</hi> to that Prayer of <hi>Moses, Bless O Lord</hi> Levi<hi>'s substance,
accept the work of his hands: smite through the Loyns of them that hate him,
that they rise not again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will I doubt not appear to rational and thinking men, that our little
interloping Churches or Congregations that set up with their precarious
Power, and small stock of Learning or Revenue, will no more be able to
break the great Compacted Body of the Papal Church, that hath the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly</hi>
of the <hi>Religion-Trade</hi> in so many parts of the World, then a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping
Merchant-men to break the Opulent <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Company,
who have engross'd so much of the Spices of the World, that sometimes
they cause several Ships loadings of them to be at once consumed, as
knowing what quantity, and no more will be useful to the World. And
somewhat like that thing too, the Polity of the <hi>Anglican</hi> Church in
<hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi>'s time perform'd while it drove a <hi>Religion-Trade</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi>
and yet consumed a great quantity of its superfluous Merchandize, and the
same thing hath been done by our National Church, as to remaining parts
of the Romish <hi>Superstition</hi> in succeeding times, and indeed <hi>Superstition</hi>
which is a kind of <hi>Nimiety</hi> of Religion, is so incident to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and is so destructive to the Polity of Churches, and the substantial
Commerce of Nations, that it is worthy the Power and Care of Nations
to consume it.</p>
            <p>And considering that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath still valued it self for
being <hi>terribilis sicut castrorum acies ordinata,</hi> it is a vain thing to contend
with such a Regular Church Militant, without our having of <hi>general</hi> Officers,
and as exact a Conduct, or to think to have such Officers without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Maintenance from the Publick: <hi>For none doth go a Warfare at
any time at his own charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I think how in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, while a Cloud of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was always over the head of the Christians, that yet they strain'd
themselves so much in Contributions for the Pastorage of their Souls,
that all the Pastors then were so far from losing by Religion, that some
were tempted to that Office for <hi>filthy Lucre</hi> (as we may see out of <hi>Peter
Ep. 1. Ch 5. Vers.</hi> 2.) tho yet too so little comparatively was to be gain'd
by all thereby, that others probably undertook that Office <hi>by constraint,</hi>
as the same <hi>place</hi> intimates, and that therein the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Prudence was
conspicuous in ordering it upon the whole matter, that the generality of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
then should not get or lose by Religion, I may reasonably conclude that
we who live in the flourishing and prosperous State of Christianity, ought
to provide that the meanest Pastor of Souls in <hi>England,</hi> may live compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
and decently by that Office: and for my part I shall never give my
voice for any ones serving in Parliament, that will not be willing to move
for the discharge of the Debt to the <hi>Clergy</hi> before mention'd, as soon as
the State of the Kingdom will bear it.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard</hi> in his aforesaid <hi>Speech</hi> p. 3. mentioning the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
we are in of being upbraided by the Papists, for being willing to serve
God with somewhat that would cost us nothing, hath a <hi>saying</hi> that I have
often heard Cited in discourse as anothers; namely, <hi>He that thinks to save
any thing by Religion, but his Soul, will be a loser in the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Notion of his of not saving by Religion, doth fortifie my affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the publick inconvenience accruing by the getting by it, as to
which I have so opened the present State of the <hi>Clergies</hi> maintenance in
<hi>England,</hi> as to represent them rather losers then gainers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:103047:136"/>
When 'tis considered how many there are in <hi>England</hi> of the <hi>Layety,</hi>
who gape for gain by Religion, and are ready to devour one another for
it, as well as Religion by it, I am sure none can with reason think the
<hi>Quota</hi> of the <hi>Clergy's</hi> Maintenance, should be such as in the time of the
prosperity of the State to render them losers.</p>
            <p>How scandalous and how ridiculous, nay, how ridiculous by Poverty
it self, many of our Lay-Popish and Protestant <hi>Religion-Traders</hi> have been,
I have already evinced; and do suppose that nothing can <hi>blacken</hi> that Trade
in the fancies of the People, more then the discovery of the <hi>Traders,</hi> who
must needs appear more odious then they who are the Mercenary Brokers,
for the debasing of Humane Nature by Lust, since the Hypocritical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion-Traders
do for Rewards prostitute the Honour of their Creator, and
as much as they can make the Divine Nature subservient to the diabolical
Art of their Hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>Before the late Market for Converts in <hi>France,</hi> I have not heard or read
of any Nation in the World, wherein great Parcels of the Layety have
gain'd Mony by Religion, but only in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe that in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> (whereas <hi>Des Cartes</hi> saith in one of his
Epistles, <hi>Nemo non mercaturam exercet</hi>) there is not one Religion-Trader,
tho yet all Religions are there tolerated. Nor yet is any Lay-man of that
Trade in <hi>Paris</hi> who is of any other.</p>
            <p>And in the Policy of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, 'tis provided for as a <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi>
that nothing shall be there acquired by Religion; insomuch that
all that Emperor's Subjects as well as himself being by their Law enjoyn'd
to be able to practice some <hi>Manual</hi> Trade, when any are call'd out to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Office of Priests, or Celebraters of the Publick Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
there, such exact Care is taken, that they shall get by the exercise of
that Office, just so much and no more, as they did by their <hi>Manual</hi> Trade:
for which purpose, an Excellent Person who was the King's <hi>Ambassador</hi> at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> related to me, That he complaining to the <hi>Visier</hi> of some
injury done by a <hi>Turkish</hi> Priest to one of his Servants, the <hi>Visier</hi> deprived
him of that Holy Employment, and that the Priest being afterward sent
to Petition to be restored to his place, he answered, that he would not,
being as well content to work on in the Mechanick Trade, to the exercise
whereof he was returned since his said deprivation.</p>
            <p>But this Trade and sort of Traders that hath so long pester'd our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
is now about to expire and dye a natural death, and which it could not
before be brought to do by a violent. And as the <hi>Trade</hi> of sturdy Beggars,
the which is as much a Trade and as much conducted by Laws among
themselves, as is any incorporate one that hath the stamp of the Great
Seal, could by no Legislation be extinguished, but would soon be so by
peoples voluntary forbearing to be their Contributers, thus too will this
<hi>sturdy</hi> Religion-Trade have its Period. Our Fifth Monarchy-men who
thought to inherit the earth without giving sixteen years Purchase for it,
and who pretended to <hi>follow the Lamb wheresoever he went</hi> but really out
of dreams of a golden Fleece, are by all exploded. The condition of <hi>Britannia
languens,</hi> and that too very much occasion'd by the former insolence of the
Papists, being understood at <hi>Rome,</hi> will make the old <hi>Gentleman</hi> there think
'tis vain for him to hope to be possess'd of the Abby Lands without giving
for them many Millions of Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> and the Papists here will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
so soon penetrate into the present State of our Poverty, that they will
find no way effectual for the delivering them from the vexatious Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Protestant Informers, but the Removal of that decay of Trade,
and general dearth of many that has necessitated so many to be <hi>Informers,</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:103047:137"/>
and who cause them to spend upon <hi>under Sheriffs</hi> more Money then they
save by not being <hi>high Sheriffs,</hi> and which decay of Trade hath sunk a 4th
<hi>part</hi> of the value of their Lands, and which can never be cured but by the
dissolution of the Religionary one; and finding the Credit of the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
Society crack'd, as I have before express'd, will find that their <hi>Iourneymen
Calumniators</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> calls them in a Paper of his I have seen)
must necessarily <hi>break too,</hi> and it being found that not only our <hi>Enthusiasts</hi>
are forced by necessity of Nature to desist from expecting any gain by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but all Protestants whatsoever, the Popish Traders therein will be
the more content to give over one of their Trades, and the fare of them will
be like that of the Associated Jesuites, to march out of their Spiritual
Corporations insensibly, like the captious <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
of whom 'tis there said, <hi>Being convicted in their own Consciences, they went
out one by one beginning at the eldest even to the last,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Tho as I said no man in <hi>Holland</hi> doth get or lose by Religion, yet since
the Reformation there was a Controvery of Religion, I mean the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi>
one which made an extraordinary fermentation in their State, and
which Controversy tho Knaves there frighted Fools with, as if it were stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> with an intent to bring in Popery; yet the
knowing few easily understood that neither side of the <hi>Question</hi> could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that effect, and they likewise understood that the profession of the
belief of the several opposite Points of that Controversie among the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Parties there, serv'd only as <hi>Ribbands</hi> of several colours, to distinguish
Parties that are against each other in Arms.</p>
            <p>And yet that very great Controversie in <hi>Religion,</hi> which divided <hi>Holland</hi>
and distracted our Kingdom in the time of the Royal Martyr, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of which perplexed the <hi>Trihaeresia</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> the <hi>Saduces, Essenes</hi>
and <hi>Pharises,</hi> and likewise three sorts of Christians, the <hi>Pelogians, Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and that of old divided the Sects of the Philosophers,
and hath many years raged among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and likewise among the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> after its having for so many thousand years troubled
so many Millions of Mankind, seems lately to be retired to its Eternal
Rest, and the sullen World seems resolved to hear and read no more of it,
and none I believe will get or lose any secular profit by his Sentiments in
that Controversie; and 'tis probable that the Controvertible part of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
may thus go silently out of the Company of People in this Kingdom,
and without so much as troubling us by taking a formal leave, give rest to
it self and us, and that none will in this our World get or lose by that part
of Popery that can properly claim to be call'd a <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have usually in this <hi>Discourse</hi> called it an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or <hi>Supposition,</hi>
which I chose rather to do then to call the entire Body of it a <hi>Religion,</hi> which
I know that it is not and cannot be, and that <hi>Popery</hi> and the former <hi>Scotch</hi>
Presbytery, and <hi>Socinianism</hi> are not in the gross called <hi>Religions</hi> otherwise
then <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>I will not quarrel with Papists for calling some Points before mentioned,
wherein Disputants will be still playing with the Dye of Controversie, by
the Name of Religion, and I will give tho not grant them my Consent for
applying that Name, to the believing that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Principium Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi>
and there are not many Propositions in the <hi>Chronologia haeresium,
sectarum &amp; schismatum,</hi> and in the <hi>Haeresiographis</hi> that many have Publish'd,
that I would think a man to have <hi>laesa principia</hi> that did call Tenets of
<hi>Religion;</hi> and there are in <hi>Popery</hi> many things enjoyn'd, that tho I look
on as needless impositions and new inventions, for the diverting the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
I shall not gainsay any one that shall call <hi>Religion</hi> and represent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103047:137"/>
them as of <hi>Apostolical</hi> Practice, tho the birth of many of them was <hi>reverâ</hi>
but of yesterday.</p>
            <p>And thus let the mixing of Water with Wine in the Eucha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fasting on <hi>Friday,</hi> Pilgrimages to the Sepulchres of Martyrs, the Priests
using a low voice in Consecration, and let the Canonization of Saints,
the institution of <hi>Saturday</hi> Mass in honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the Red Hatts and Scarlet Cloaks worn by Cardinals, the
Institution of the year of Jubily, the Popes every year Consecrating a <hi>Rose</hi>
of Gold, the sound of the Bell at the hour of Mid day, the <hi>Rosary</hi> of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and likewise the Baptization of Bells, be all baptised
with the name of Religion, and many Notions and Practices likewise more
peculiar to Popery.</p>
            <p>And tho the denomination of things is from the better part, as Mines
are said to be of Lead, or Silver, &amp;c. from the quantity of the Metal there
most valuable, and so I can be content to call a Complication of Tenets
of which some are erroneous by the name of a Religion, yet in any <hi>Systeme</hi>
of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Confession,</hi> that may happen to appear in the World more pure
and exact then the <hi>Augustane,</hi> or the <hi>Helvetian,</hi> or the <hi>Saxonic,</hi> the <hi>Gallic,</hi>
or <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Belgic,</hi> or <hi>Bohemian,</hi> and more accommodate to the true
sense of the <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the best <hi>Expositors</hi> then the former,
and containing more satisfactory explanations about the propagation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of <hi>Original</hi> Sin, the Nature, Order and Offices of <hi>Angels,</hi> and of
the Consistency both of Gods immutable Decrces, with the Contingency
of second Causes, and of the Efficacy of God's Grace, with the freedom
of Mans Will, and of the Time, Place and Antecedents of the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
one single Notion relating but to a Commandment of the second
Table, incorporated with such a <hi>Confession</hi> of Faith, would make the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Name of <hi>Religion</hi> to the whole to be very ridiculous and nauseous,
and make it more fit in the gross to be called a <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Faction,</hi> or of
<hi>Conspiracy</hi> against Mankind; and any one will think so if that one Article
should be thus inserted, <hi>And we further think it commendable at some Seasons
of the year, to kill the next man we shall meet.</hi> And yet as harshly as this
sounds, there is that in <hi>Popery</hi> and likewise in the Doctrine of the <hi>Resistance</hi>
of <hi>Princes</hi> contrary to the <hi>Municipal</hi> Laws, that doth hear worse, and that
is tho not ajustification of the killing the next man to be met with, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of which would yet make men excite their natural Courage and fortifie
it with skill, and be provided with good Arms, whereby to be always ready
to defend their Country (just as the <hi>Spartan</hi> Law of punishing no man
for <hi>Theft</hi> that was not taken in the Fact, made men more vigilant in the
Custody of their Goods) namely, the killing Multitudes of the best men
that can be culled and singled out of the <hi>faex</hi> of Mankind, and such of

so called, as even <hi>transubstantiation</hi> it self and many others, are not to be
term'd <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but other points before mentioned can properly be term'd
nothing else, and when all those Tenets are so complicated by them, that they
do all conjoyntly integrate their Religion, then is there pretended Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

years since brought to light the Invention of the <hi>double bottom'd</hi> Vessel,

easily guessed that such a Ship bearing much more Sail then other Ships,
must needs go a great deal faster before the Wind; but I was not inform'd

            <p>This hath been the condition of Popery with its <hi>double bottom</hi> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,

a quiet World sail'd apace before the Wind and in fair weather, but the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous

            <p>I doubt not but the Papists as well as others of Mankind, have a Right

58th <hi>V.</hi> of the 8<hi>th</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> And should I chance to over hear any one
Member of Mankind at his Private Devotions, <hi>and importuning Heaven to
illuminate his mind with the knowledge of some point in Religion, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
necessary to his Salvation, and acknowledging it to the praise of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness, that excited him to the use of all means whereby to discover it,
that he had so far through the Efficacy of assisting Grace practised the Truths,
his understanding was possest with as to satisfie his mind that he was a serious
Supplicant for its being the depositary of more,</hi> I should be so far from wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this man delivered over to <hi>Satan,</hi> from differing for me in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted

Point of Religion, that I should think that if the truth he was in
quest of; imported his Salvation, <hi>God</hi> would send an <hi>Angel</hi> to explain it to
him.</p>
            <p>But as to <hi>one</hi> part of the <hi>double bottom</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> tho we should grant
it laden with fundamental truths, yet 'tis notorious that the <hi>other</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden
with Fundamental Errors, and such as are apt to undermine the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of States and Kingdoms, and there is no need of an extraordinary
Messenger from Heaven to tell one embarked therein, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not
to absolve Subjects from the obedience of their Princes, nor to cause an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
fermentation and inqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tude in the World, through his Kingdom, (that
should not be of it at all) yet being unbutted and unbounded by him in all
the parts of it.</p>
            <p>I will likewise tell any <hi>Soeinian</hi> that his great Master <hi>Socinus</hi> made such
a <hi>double bottom</hi> of his <hi>Systeme</hi> of Notions, that it hath forfeited its right to the
Name of Religion by one Tenet complicated therewith, and that he ought
to throw that off and <hi>simplificare se ipsum.</hi> Let any one if he pleaseth call
the <hi>Socinians</hi> denying of the Trinity in Unity, and Original Sin, and the
Baptism of Infants, or the Divine Prescience, and many other of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by the Name of <hi>Religion;</hi> but there is own of their <hi>Tenets</hi> that their
Master needed no long wrestling with Heaven as a Supplicant to find out
the truth of, and which Notion when really believed is as pernicious to
Crown'd Heads and their Subjects, as the lawfulness of any ones sometime
killing the next man he meets, and that is, that my Prince and I may not
defend our lives against the next Invader who comes to take them away;
for as to that great Question, <hi>An bellum offensivum vel defensivum fit licitum,</hi>
the <hi>Socinians</hi> answer is <hi>negatur,</hi> which any one may see who pleaseth to
consult the <hi>Themata F. Socini de officio Christi</hi> p. 7. <hi>Inter breves tractatus F.
Socini:</hi> and likewise his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Christopher Morstias,</hi> p. 498. among his
<hi>Epistles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus let the well-willers to <hi>Presbytery,</hi> call that erroneous opinion
of their Church Government being founded on that <hi>Divine</hi> Right, and the
immediate Command of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles a <hi>Tenet</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> but
to confront the Laws of Kingdoms in the settling it, and to eradicate any
part of those, and especially to root the inheritable Monarchs Power in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Election or Approbation, and to make him but the Peoples <hi>Attorny,</hi>
and his Authority as revocable by them as a Letter of <hi>Attorney,</hi> is <hi>abusively</hi>
call'd <hi>Religion,</hi> and is only properly to be term'd <hi>Sedition,</hi> or <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been so copious in insisting on the necessary separation of all <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>
that are denominable as <hi>Religious,</hi> from those that are really <hi>Irreligious</hi>
and <hi>Seditious</hi> under the gross name of the <hi>Religion</hi> in any Party, as a thing
perfectly just in it self, and necessary for the quiet of the World, and do
hope that the Age that is so much addicted here to the improvement and
polishing of our <hi>Language,</hi> will incline it to do it self that right as not to
give <hi>false</hi> Names to Things, and Names of a contrary significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>We know that the <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Mint</hi> refers both to
<hi>weight</hi> and <hi>fineness;</hi> and tho a piece of Money may have the Royal Stamp
on it, engraven with all possible curiosity, yet if it be not standard, 'tis so
far from being allow'd the Name of any <hi>Species</hi> of the Kings <hi>Coyn,</hi> that 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to be broken in pieces; and as this is but just so is it but necessary for
the quiet of the People, who else detecting it would suspect the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the Mint, as well as of that Species of Money, and would either not
take it or else with a Clamour raise the price of their Commodities for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:103047:139"/>
And thus it is too a thing unreasonable and troublesome to the World, for
Men to <hi>Coyn</hi> false words or false denominations for any Tenet in Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally
defective, what curious stamp of the artifice of any Party soever
it may bear: its <hi>reprobate Silver</hi> is not to be call'd <hi>Religion,</hi> and it makes
Religion it self lyable to suspicion among the inquisitive, it will trouble
every hand it passeth to and from, and in giving a value to it, the People
will raise the price of their tolerating it, and the World will never be quiet
till its allay from the true Silver be separated by melting it down, and it
takes the name of Religion only when it deserves it.</p>
            <p>What is more ordinary then for Clamour to raise this question, <hi>Will you
punish any man for his Religion? and will you have any man lose by his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi>
and I see no end in the disputes of the question but by this Answer,
and by this it must find a <hi>Period,</hi> viz. <hi>I punish no man for his Religion,</hi> for that
<hi>Tenet</hi> that I quarrel with him about, is not and indeed cannot be <hi>Religion.</hi>
It is pure and rank Sedition and Rebellion; and if any <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
shall write or speak to make the Kings Power a bubble blown up by the
breath of the People and so dissolvable, I shall esteem him fit to be proceeded
against by the new Statute of the 13<hi>th</hi> of this Kings Reign against Sedition,
and as a Subverter of the Fundamental Laws, and do suppose 'twill be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for any one to plead his <hi>Religion</hi> in bar of that Indictment, and he doth
moreover deserve to be punish'd as a <hi>Cheater</hi> for abusing the World and
himself and Religion too, by calling such a particular Tenet <hi>Religion,</hi> or a
Complication of many <hi>Tenets</hi> by that Name, where the vertue of them all is
not strong enough to correct the Poyson of one.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> doth punish those with a denunciation of a <hi>Wo</hi> who <hi>call
evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness;</hi>
and in this particular <hi>Point</hi> of the calling any of the Idolatries or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of the Heathens or others, by the name of <hi>Religion,</hi> I remember
not any <hi>instance</hi> in <hi>holy</hi> Writ, tho yet in other Cases 'tis not infrequent for
the inspired Pen man to speak <hi>cum vulgo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I observe that in the <hi>New Testament</hi> the name of <hi>Religion</hi> is several times
applyed to the <hi>Iewish</hi> after the World was freed from the Obligation of it:
but one of the <hi>holy</hi> Pen-men speaking in one Chapter of false <hi>Apostles,</hi>
useth the Style of <hi>hating the Deeds of the</hi> Nicolaitans, <hi>and of holding the
Doctrine of the</hi> Nicolaitans, <hi>and of holding the Doctrines of</hi> Balam: And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>Amanuenses</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> speaks of <hi>Doctrines of Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man shall offer to my consideration a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Doctrines</hi> that
relate to Theology, and I find it is too subtle for my understanding to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate,
I shall yet be so evil as to allow the <hi>Propounder</hi> to call it a <hi>Religion:</hi>
and thus if <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants</hi> would agree to call Dr. <hi>Gibbon</hi>'s <hi>Scheme,</hi>
a <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>demonstration</hi> of it, I would not oppose theit calling it any such
thing; and the rather since it enjoyns not to me any thing that would
break my own or the Worlds quiet; but when <hi>Popery</hi> doth enjoyn so many
<hi>Tenets</hi> to be believed that are incredible to a rational Man, and some things
that are clearly impossible to a Moral Man, I will call Popery in the <hi>gross</hi>
any thing rather then Religion, just as <hi>Tully</hi> saith of those Law-givers who
did <hi>perniciosa &amp; injusta a populis praescribere,</hi> that they did <hi>quidvis potius ferre
quam leges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find not that since the year 1605. <hi>Popery</hi> hath so discriminated it self by
any alteration for the beter, as to overthrow the weight of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
saying then to both his <hi>Houses of Parliament, viz. That as it is not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

good and faithful Subjects, so on the other hand, none that know and believe the
grounds and School conclusions of their Doctrine, can ever prove good Christians

There is one <hi>Tenet</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Popery that your Lordship shewed
me once discust in <hi>Print</hi> by a <hi>Canonist,</hi> and by whom I was directed to
trace it, both to the <hi>Gloss</hi> and <hi>Text</hi> in the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, that I having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of, to a Pious and Learned Neighbour of mine, who is a <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
he obliged me to write to your Lordship, that you would please to
let any of your <hi>Amanuenses</hi> transcribe, and to send hither to me the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of that Lawyer, and determination of the Pope in his Law about it,
and hath declared to me, that he will joyn issue with me in the Plea about
Religion, in that being a Tenet or Principle approved by the Church of

you, <hi>lumen de lumine,</hi> will (I doubt not) make it easie to you to gratifie
my request in his behalf.</p>
            <p>He grants to me that if that <hi>Tenet</hi> can be shewn to be one approved by
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he believes there will be no occasion for disputants
any more to attaque the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, and that as an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>

            <p>The Gentleman being of a nice tenderness of Conscience, and having a
quick sense of any thing that looks like gross impiety, was at the very
nameing of the first and second Question, surprized with a kind of trembling,
and was somewhat more discomposed, when I told him that upon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole matter, it appear'd even from the most moderate of the
<hi>Canonists</hi> that a whole City might lawfully be destroyed with Fire, if the
Majority of it were Hereticks, and that there were the Judgment of
the Church in the Case; and like a Man of a large and candid Soul, he
said, that he was sorry that Humane Nature could in any men so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
as to <hi>deliberate</hi> about such their destroying a whole City by Fire,
but would reserve his judgment on the Point till he saw it before him in
the Quotations out of the <hi>Canon</hi>-Law, as well as <hi>Canonists.</hi> What the
Event of his Judgment will be I know not; and I confess I have been very
sparing of my time in discoursing with <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, about any
Point of the Doctrine of their Church, since I read it in <hi>Cardinal</hi> Tolets <hi>Inst.

But this is not the temper of this <hi>Worthy Gentleman,</hi> whom I have reason
to esteem a lover of truth <hi>quatenus</hi> truth, and for its own sake, and one
who doth not account falshood charming, or <hi>rebelling against the Light</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious:
and indeed I have observ'd it in some others, as well as him, that
after they have deserted the Church of <hi>England,</hi> their inquisitiveness in
Religion has not been at its Journeys end, but has still continued in its
way, and that so far, that Holy Church and they have oft been apt secretly
to be weary of one another.</p>
            <p>The Rational Religion they were first educated in, has had the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Natale solum,</hi> that they could never wholy overpower.</p>
            <p>I have known three <hi>Earls,</hi> one whereof was of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and the other two of <hi>England,</hi> and all of them were men of great Wit
and Parts, and such who being brought up in the Religion of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> went off from it to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but receded not from
the candour of their tempers, nor from the Society of their old Friends,
nor from the frank readiness to discourse with them, about the controverted
Points of both Churches, and neither of them perverted their Wives or
Children to Popery, and the eldest Sons of them all, are eminent Sons
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and do make considerable figures in the
State.</p>
            <p>One of those three Earls is yet living, and in him lives the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of an <hi>English</hi> Nobleman, adorning Nobility by his intellectual and
Moral Endowments, and by a Majesty mixt with incomparable sweetness
in his familiar Converse, and by a consummate Loyalty to his Prince that
Envy it self never spotted, and by such an exact Observation of his Faith,
given to any of Mankind, that he would no more violate it with an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
then with a Patriarch or Apostle, and by having been never suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from using any <hi>Iesuite-Confessors</hi> to learn how to evade from solid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by subtle distinctions, or once to allow the least <hi>Chicanery</hi> in God's
Great <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we cast our thoughts on <hi>France,</hi> we shall there find that the great
and the brave <hi>Turen</hi> after he had so unfortunately thrown himself at the Popes
Feet, had there his Arms as ready to embrace his Protestant Friends as
ever.</p>
            <p>I have heard of two Crown'd Heads of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were
very unkind to their Protestant Subjects after stipulations to the contrary:
the one was <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who when Cardinal <hi>Cleselius</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Vienna</hi> told him, that if he made War on the <hi>Bohemians</hi> the destruction
of that flourishing Kingdom would certainly follow, answered, <hi>We would
rather have the Kingdom destroyed then damned;</hi> the other was Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who as the (<hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> tells us) being intent
on the <hi>Restoring the Abby-Lands, and discoursing with Four of her Privy-Counsellors
about the same,</hi> said, <hi>perhaps you may object to me again, that the
State of my Kingdom, the Dignity thereof and my Crown Imperial, cannot be
honourably maintain'd without the Possessions aforesaid; yet notwithstanding I
set more by the Salvation of my Soul, then by Ten Kingdoms:</hi> and the Reign of
each of these was besmear'd with Blood: but had they been born and bred
Lambs, I believe that no <hi>Transmutation</hi> of the Blood of <hi>Tygres</hi> into them
would have made them such.</p>
            <p>The Famous <hi>Iulian</hi> of whom 'twas said, <hi>Nunc Apostolicus, Nunc Vilis
Apostata factus,</hi> had learned too much Christianity, when he was a <hi>Reader,</hi>
to be a raging Blood-sucker; and if when Emperor he had had e're a <hi>Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi>
that collected the <hi>Madrigals</hi> or Hymns against him, he would perhaps
have done him no harm.</p>

The low birth and the Poverty and Mercenary disposition of <hi>Iudas,</hi>
tempted him to betray his Master with a kiss, but he was so far wrought
on by the good Company he had kept, that he afterwards kill'd none else
but himself: and they are such perverted Protestants generally that are of
the same rate with <hi>Iudas</hi> for Birth and Poverty, and paultry Avarice,
that I should desire to stand out of the way from and to avoid the Vermine
of such <hi>Renegadoes;</hi> and they are only such Popish Princes as <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
and <hi>Mary,</hi> that in their Education were never imbued with better Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
then the bloody ones of Popery, that I should fear as Monsters, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
any Kingdom but a Den, if I lived therein with them: and when ever
I happen to dispute about that Notion in <hi>vogue</hi> that Vertue it self in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Successor will be a Nusance, and make him a bloody Bigot, I answer
with a <hi>distinction</hi> and grant it is likely to be so in one who passed from the
Breast, in Infancy to suck in Sanguinary Principles, but where in any <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,</hi>
the Tenets of Popery when he is on the Borders of old Age, are
Successors to Principles of a Noble and Rational Religion, that he has
grown up into youth and manhood with, I shall account my fears very
wild and irrational if my hopes do not grow up with them as to my promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my self, that he will at least answer <hi>Bocalines</hi> Character of the <hi>best

and who without the help of Miracle and Prophecy were taught by
Nature <hi>to lye down together,</hi> and shall account the same persons injurious
to the World, who fishing in troubled waters of the State, say, <hi>the worse
the better,</hi> and of such a Prince educated in Protestancy and then perhaps
turning Papist, <hi>the better the worse,</hi> and especially when the Laws have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous'd
us to his Line, <hi>for better for worse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our acute and profound Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> in Mature years went over
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in his course there made a <hi>short turn,</hi> and the
<hi>Natale solum</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> charm'd him soon back again, and
he by the culture of his reason made the Soil a hundred fold amends for
his temporary deserting it. But Princes and Potentates are under higher
temptations then his low Station placed him in not to be seen to retreat,
especially after their having once done it before, and may suppose that
other Princes will look on them as more slippery and unsafe to be dealt
with, if the same Principles once congeal'd or hardened in them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
dissolv'd should be congeal'd again, just as the Earth is more slippery
and unsafe to be walked on in a Frost after a Thaw.</p>

has heard some of the Nonconformist Divines acknowledge, that they did not
scruple what the Conformists do: but thought it unhandsome for them to do it,
&amp;c. And the meaning was, in plain English, that they were ashamed to confess
their error.</p>
            <p>But if some of those <hi>Divines</hi> whose low Education conducted them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
from being Servitors in the University to domineer in their <hi>Cures,</hi> and
who through the Track of their Lives might be traced by the slime of their

and grant him nothing of the Guard of Honour in the Case, but Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the temptations from honour to their sinful obscure selves.</p>
            <p>But as no man can take the measures of anothers Sins without taking
those of his temptations, so none but a Prince can know the temptations of
a Prince. <hi>Dic mihi si fueris tu Leo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The like Pedantry therefore in the great St. <hi>Ierom</hi> was inexcusable as to
that sharp saying of his, <hi>Miror si aliquis Rex salvabitur:</hi> and that Satyrical
fancy of his hath since met with its Match by some that have sent St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>

            <p>Moreover I think it great injustice to any Prince who has changed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of Protestancy for Popery, that Protestants should at the same time
be jealous of his retaining no tincture of his former Principles, that the
Bigotted and Jesuited Papists are jealous of his scarce retaining a tincture
of his new ones, and by <hi>jealousie</hi> too, <hi>as cruel as the Grave,</hi> as appeared by

               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:103047:141"/>
I mention'd it before out of <hi>D' Ossat</hi> that it was known at <hi>Rome,</hi> that
Queen <hi>Anne</hi> the Wife to King <hi>Iames, had some inclination to the</hi> Roman <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion,</hi> and no doubt but she was perverted to it in some measure
by some of the <hi>Romish</hi> Priests who were then as since insolently over offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to tempt Princes to change their Faith: and tho none of our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
mentions any thing of her being a Papist or inclining to be so, yet
<hi>D' Ossat</hi> (as I said) relates <hi>how</hi> Villeroy <hi>supposed her to have turn'd Papist:</hi>
but our Historians unanimously mention one thing, that she was designed
as well as the King and Prince and others to be blown up by the Gun-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treason,
a thing that may give one who turns Son of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> cause to say, <hi>Mallem esse Herodis porcum quam filium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt but the mind of any Popish Prince coming out of the cool and
sweet Air of a benign and rational Religion, to that of such a torrid Zone
and Shambles of mans flesh as the Doctrine of Popery presents, will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener
in his thoughts travelling back to that Religion then the prying
World can know.</p>
            <p>But the Gentleman my friend is not any way tempted in point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to delay his Return to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and he lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
to me his wishes of the speedy Arrival of your <hi>Lordships</hi> Papers,
told me, that possibly he and I should be both gainers thereby, and that I
should gain the Victory and he the Truth, and that he would never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
those Priests of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Missionaries of <hi>Christ,</hi> who if their
Doctrine be refused, shall instead of <hi>shaking off the dust of their feet</hi> in any
house, reduce it to Ashes; and further affirmed that it were less absurd and
extravagant to wish there were no Religion at all in the World, whether
reveal'd or natural, then that any such <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or Doctrine that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised
a Practice of that nature, should be universally receiv'd in it as its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>For tho natural Religion acquaints me with the Divine Power, and gives
me hopes of my Creators not rendring me miserable by that Power, and
the rather when I have seen that many of the Contemners of Heavens
Thunder lived prosperously on Earth, yet if a Model of Religion pretended
to be the only reveal'd one shall controuling all the Dictates of natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
enjoyn the firing of whole Cities, and mankinds confused outraging
one another, I must abandon my further hopes of Bliss from such a Being
as was it self miserable, for so that would be whose nature was still in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of Anger and Passion, and rear'd up Men as the Workmanship of its
hands, only to dash those curious but brittle Vessels against one another, and
that even for such a Being 'twere more eligible to be, then to be always
so miserable, as well as 'twould prove so for my self too, then to be always in
Torment by Anger.</p>
            <p>But we know that as God is <hi>the God of Order and not of Confusion,</hi> so he is
likewise an overflowing Fountain of Goodness, and so infinitely benign,
that if his Nature were rightly represented to an ingenious <hi>Atheist,</hi> if he did
not at last believe he would ardently wish there were a God: and I think
if there be any number of that degenerate sort of Mankind called <hi>Atheists,</hi>
(as was said) that such degeneracy must needs be chiefly caused by the
mis-representations of the Divine Being.</p>
            <p>I have before mentioned how <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>de Natura Deorum</hi> shews great
Wit in his Anger against the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> for their representing the <hi>Deity</hi> as
unconcern'd for Mankind; and against the rendring God careless of the
welfare of his Creature man he there exclaims, <hi>Deinde si maxime talis est
Deus ut nullâ gratiâ, nullâ hominum charitate teneatur, valeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:103047:142"/>
How passionately then would he have upbraided any Mushroom Sect of
Philosophers, if such had sprung up in the World (as in his time and before
there never did) that had represented the Nature of the Deity as solicitous
and careful only of procuring the misery of Mankind and disorder of the
World, and enjoyning men to spit fire at one another, exposing them to
the sury of Wild Beasts if they lived in Desarts, and of wilder Creatures,
that is, themselves, if they lived in Cities.</p>
            <p>There was an Ingenious and Learned and Pious <hi>Divine,</hi> I mean <hi>Cressy</hi>
who in our days forsook the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
turned <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and went beyond Sea, and returned to <hi>England</hi>
in the Conjuncture of the <hi>petulant Insolence,</hi> and was so far infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and likewise with the <hi>Chagrin</hi> incident to sickness, that he writ very
peevishly against our Church, and one of our great Church Men; and his
Writings were justly censured by the Earl of <hi>Clarendon:</hi> but according to
my former Observation, so much of the Character of the rationality of
the Protestant Religion that he was long bred up in remain'd in him inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libile,
that I believe had he been made an <hi>Inquisitor of Heretical Pravity,</hi>
he would neither have took away a drop of Blood from any Protestant,
nor a hair from his head; and in his Reply to that Noble <hi>Lord,</hi> he is so
candid as speaking of the <hi>Position</hi> charged on <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, that no
Salvation is to be had out of that Church, to affirm <hi>that all Catholicks
grant that this is not necessarily to be understood of an actual external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and that many Christians of vertuous</hi> devout lifes, and <hi>having had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
preparation of mind to prefer truth whensoever effectually discovered to
them before all temporal advantages, they dying in this disposition tho not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
joyned to the Church, will be esteem'd by our merciful Lord as true
Members of his Mystical Body the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Papist but one bred a Protestant, could have had thoughts so large
concerning the extent of the invisible Church, or fancy that what is before
mentioned, is <hi>granted by all Catholicks,</hi> and should I hear any Priest in a
<hi>Fryars</hi> Cowle grant what is abovesaid, I should fancy that he remain'd an
invisible Protestant, and that he continued so exuberantly good in his
natural disposition as not to be able to frame an <hi>Idea</hi> in his mind of the
damning of Mens Souls, and making Coals of their Bodies and Bonefires
of their Cities, for mistaken Sentiments in Religion: and had Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
lived till this time, 'tis possible your Lordship by your Notification of that
fiery <hi>Tenet</hi> of the Papal Church aforesaid, might have been an instrument
of his visible Return to our Church; for his labour'd heating himself
with Passion upon the mention of the Practice of that thing in his <hi>Church
History,</hi> shews sufficiently how he would have abhorr'd any Church that
abhorr'd not that Tenet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Place</hi> I refer to in his <hi>Church History</hi> is in the 14th <hi>Book,</hi> 4th <hi>Chapter,</hi>
where he doth strenuously endeavour to prove that <hi>Monk Austin was unjustly
Accused of having killed</hi> 1200 Brittish <hi>Monks:</hi> and having said there §. 9th,
<hi>yet of late this poysonous humour of Calumniating God's Saints is become the
Principal Character of the New Reformed Gospel,</hi> he goes on thus, <hi>I will add
one example more of a Calumniator, to wit, Mr.</hi> William Prynn, <hi>a late stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matised
Presbyterian,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But alas what repentance can be expected in such a
person</hi> (speaking of <hi>Prynn) who is</hi> inveteratus malorum dierum, <hi>when we
see in his decrepit Age his rancorous Tongue against innocent Catholicks, yet
more violently set on Fire of Hell so far as to sollicit a general Messacre of them,
by publishing himself and tempting others to damn their Souls also by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
through the whole Kingdom, that in the last Fatal Calamity by Fire
happening to</hi> London <hi>they were the only Incendiaries. This he did tho him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103047:142"/>
at the same time confessed that not the least proof could be produced against
them, but said he it concerns us that this Report</hi> should be believed. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of this most execrable Attentat were made, and several Oaths to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this were offer'd, but in vain. But however surely there is a Reward for
the innocent oppress'd, and whatsoever Mr.</hi> Prynn <hi>may think, doubtless there
is a God that judgeth the World. Let him therefore remember what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God saith,</hi> quid detur tibi, aut quid apponatur tibi ad linguam dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam
sagittae potentis acutae, cum carbonibus desolatoriis, <hi>is what must be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <p>And it follows §. 10. <hi>With as good reason therefore St.</hi> Austin <hi>may be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of the slaughter of those</hi> Brittish <hi>Monks as St.</hi> Columban, a holy <hi>Irish</hi>
Monk, <hi>&amp;c. might be charged with the most horrible death of Queen</hi> Brune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheld,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This good man certainly apprehended no reason of an additional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
<hi>Thou shalt not fire thy Neighbours house,</hi> and had he been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that the Pope in his decrepit Age had made a Commandment for
the firing of it, and whole Cities, and had so pronounced <hi>è Cathedrâ,</hi>
would probably have imputed the <hi>lingua dolosa,</hi> and the <hi>ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to his Doctrine, and the smoak from that fiery Doctrine would have had
the effect of opening his Eyes.</p>
            <p>But as for Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s <hi>Idea</hi> of the Massacring any Incendiaries tho they
had been too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>in flagranti,</hi> if he had staid in his old Church, I mean that
of <hi>England,</hi> he would have found any such thing sufficiently stigmatised by
its Doctrine, which makes the King to <hi>bear the Sword, and that not in vain,</hi>
and allows not the Rabble to be a <hi>Terror to Evil Doers,</hi> nor Hell to break
loose for the support of Heaven, and which inculcates Obedience to the
Law of the Land <hi>for Conscience sake,</hi> and even that Law permits none to
Assemble in Arms against a declared Enemy, but by the Kings particular
Commission; and he must therefore go to <hi>China</hi> or to <hi>Rome,</hi> that will
have a Street or a Town, or the <hi>Vniversitas</hi> or <hi>Community</hi> therein punish'd,
for the pretended or real faults of particular persons.</p>
            <p>Moreover the <hi>English Genius</hi> hath not in <hi>Story</hi> that I know of, been
tainted with Infamy for penetrating any thing of that horrid Nature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the old days of Popery in relation to the <hi>Iews:</hi> and the Lay-Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was then put upon it by the Rabble of <hi>Fryars</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> who owing
Money to the <hi>Iews</hi> were that way willing to confute their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>And since the time that that Great and High Judg of Reason as well as
Equity, and to whom the Custody of the King's Conscience was Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and who hath held the Scale of Equity with as steady an hand and
tender heart, and as discerning and watchful an Eye as any of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
did place the dreadful Guilt of the Firing of <hi>London,</hi> where he did at
the Condemnation of the Lord <hi>Stofford,</hi> and probably had satisfied his
Judgment for the doing of it by Observations or Examinations of Passages
that occured elsewhere, rather then at that <hi>Tryal</hi> (for there the Evidence
did not rise clear and high enough, for the occasioning that part of his
Sentence) and since the time that the People of <hi>England</hi> by their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives
threw the Guilt of that Fire on the Papists, and the Magistrates
of our Metropolis inscribed it on the <hi>Monument,</hi> the populace have been
as calm and temperate in their judging of it, and as perfectly free from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
of Revenge against all the Papists in general, or any one Papist
in particular, as if none but that poor angry Antiquary Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> had
censured them for it, and whose Thunder the World being so long used to,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103047:143"/>
did so much despise that his popularity could scarce have obtain'd an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
for the killing of a single Mad Dog.</p>
            <p>I must confess tho by the reiterated Confession, and by the Execution
of <hi>Hubert</hi> a Papist, it appear'd that he did set Fire to the House in <hi>London</hi>
from whence its rage began, and tho his Confessing of <hi>Peidelow</hi> to be one
of his Accomplices in the Fact, exempts it from being doubted that Papists
burn'd <hi>London,</hi> and tho after I had heard of that judgment of the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
and of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and of the Magistrates aforesaid, and was
shewn that Papal <hi>Tenet</hi> by your Lordship, I doubted not of the Justice of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting

               </gap>ghts one part of the Guilt of the Fire to some Jesuited Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and that it might be said with the same propriety of Speech that <hi>London</hi>
was Fired by the Papists, as 'twas by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> that <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>France, was kill'd by the Papists;</hi> yet I never thought any considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Gentry among our Lay-Papists would have practised any thing of
that kind, tho the Pope himself should have Commanded it.</p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Book</hi> containing Observations on our late Affairs of Church
and State, <hi>Printed</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1680, called the <hi>Arts and Pernicious Designs
of</hi> Rome, <hi>wherein is shewed what are the Aims of the Iesuites and Fryars,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>by a person of their own Communion, who turn'd</hi> Romanist <hi>about thirty
years since:</hi> and throughout that Book as he in general fortifies my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a Protestant when turn'd Papist, not being able to abandon all
Candour his mind was first nourished in, so he doth it particularly, <hi>p.</hi> 25. where
having in <hi>Proposition 4th,</hi> spoke of the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> we hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> received from
some Popish Orders and particularly that of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> he saith as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in <hi>Proposition</hi> 41, viz. <hi>Amongst which the late sad disaster happening to
the City of</hi> London, (<hi>not to mention divers others of like nature happening in
divers other places since) if it were a Practice of any Humane Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and not a meer judgment of God from Heaven upon us, cannot reasonably
be thought to have been the Project or Practice of any other Men then these, and
to have come originally from</hi> Rome, <hi>and the Consistory there: who beside the
bad Principles already mentioned, which legitimate such doings at all times,
that they judge it convenient for their ends, were (without doubt) willing to
signalize that year (1666) with some remarkable mischief done to Protestants
in check to the fancies of some in that Party, who have had the confidence to
affirm, and as it were to predict, that in this year</hi> Rome <hi>and (their pretended
Antichrist) the Pope should be utterly destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it appear'd a Practice of Humane Contrivance by the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Incendiary is plain, and that it was by the People in the
City then suspected so, I have said, but so far were our plain <hi>English</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from charging it on any Lay-<hi>English</hi> Papist, that Mr. <hi>Marvel</hi> in his
<hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1677, having said, <hi>That we may reckon the
Reigns of our late</hi> English <hi>Princes, by a Succession of the Popish Treasons against
them,</hi> adds, <hi>And if under his Majesty we have yet seen no more visible effects
of the same Spirit, then the Firing of</hi> London, (<hi>acted by</hi> Hubert, <hi>hired by</hi>
Peidelow <hi>two</hi> French <hi>Men) which remains a Controversie, it is not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the good Nature or better Principles of that Sect, but to the wisdom of
his Holyness, who observes that we are not of late so dangerous Protestants as to
deserve any special Mark of his Indignation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I presume not to charge or discharge any sort of men about this Fact
further then the Law hath done, whether <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> or <hi>Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-men,</hi>
(for of a Conspiracy to Fire the City on the day it was fired
on, several of that latter Sect had been before Convicted, and deservedly
Executed for it, as we must either Grant or Arraign the Justice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> had reason to blame Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103047:143"/>
for concluding <hi>that the Papists were the only Incendiaries of the City,</hi>
when Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> could not have forgot what had happen'd to those Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
and that the very Principles of many of that wild Sect, are for the
legitimating the most desperate Out-rages and Rebellions imaginable,) but
out of Justice to Humane Nature, will never render any man ill upon ill
Proofs, and such as are contrary to the Nature of things, as for example,
one Argument which is so prevalent with many for their concluding that
<hi>London</hi> was designedly burnt by many Popish Persons, namely, because it
was apparently true and not denyable, that the Flames did break out in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places of the City at the tops of several houses, which were at a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
distance from the Fire, doth not in the least move me so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude;
for 'tis obvious in Nature, that as the heat of an ordinary Fire will put
combustible light matter that is at a small distance from it into a flame, a
heat proportionably greater, must do the same thing at a greater distance:
and this appear'd in Fact conspicuous to Thousands, while the Fire then
broke out from the Timber-work in the Tower of the Old Exchange, when
the great Conflagration was a quarter of a Mile distant from it.</p>
            <p>Nor yet would I venture in discourse with any Papist about the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Tenet,</hi> to call it either <hi>Tenet</hi> or <hi>Principle</hi> chargeable on the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> as approved by it, if it were only deducible in the way of Inferences
from other <hi>Tenets;</hi> as for example, If one should say the Papists hold that
'tis lawful to burn the persons of Hereticks, and much more therefore to
burn their Houses, and to burn the Nest as well as to kill the Bird, and
that the Goods of Hereticks are <hi>ipso iure</hi> confiscate, and therefore their
Houses; and accordingly I told my <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> friend that I would
never raise this <hi>Principle</hi> of Fire against his Church by Collision of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but by the help of your Lordships Quotations referring to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law</hi> as well as <hi>Canonists,</hi> shew him the Pope claiming the Power, <hi>in
terminis terminantibus,</hi> to fire whole Cities as aforesaid, and that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Power received so much accession of Territory (as I may call it)
of Prerogative by those great Students of <hi>Crown-Divinity,</hi> and Assertors
of his <hi>Fifth Monarchy,</hi> the Jesuites.</p>
            <p>I do intend to entertain only this my particular friend at this Season,
with the Passages I shall receive from you concerning this <hi>Tenet,</hi> because
'tis in me an habitual temper, not <hi>salem nitro superaddere,</hi> or to afflict any
afflicted Lay-Papists who may retain some unsound Notions of Religion, and
yet be sound Members of the State, and I shall not desire either by words or
writing to imitate the ungenerous Practice of the Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> toward the
<hi>Sichemites,</hi> in attacking them <hi>when they were sore.</hi> And moreover reason is
thrown away on men in Passion, and during the Paroxysme of Passion in
either any Papists or Dissenters, there is no frighting them from an absurdity
by Arguments, for there can be nothing more absurd then their very Passion,
and while that lasts they are as insensible of the wounds that are made in
their Principles by objections, as some in a Battel are of wounds they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there.</p>
            <p>But I am not without hopes of a more <hi>pacific Conjuncture</hi> that may come
wherein our <hi>Vn-Iesuited</hi> Lay-Papists may discriminate their Principles and
Notions, from the troublesome ones of others of them, that vex the knowing
part of Mankind with their Implicit Faith, like Flies blind in one Season of
the year getting into Mens Eyes, and when all empty <hi>Religion-Traders</hi> will
no more like the <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi> pass for <hi>Princes of the Earth,</hi> after they
had with a bulk of <hi>words</hi> so long enslaved the World and its <hi>Princes,</hi> and
themselves too, and made Religion but the <hi>word</hi> (as I may say) to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate</hi>
Parties in War, and to know <hi>who and who are of a side,</hi> and that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103047:144"/>
by the Mutual Consent of reasonable men of all Parties the word <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
will not be put on what is really Irreligion, and that a handful of
men will think it in vain to strive to keep up the acception or signification
of any word or words, when the currency of the age and that justly too,
hath damned the former sense thereof, and that all men must speak in the
Sense of the Rational Age or not speak intelligibly; and as <hi>he who seems to be
Religious and bridles not his tongue, his Religion is vain,</hi> it will be in vain too
for him to think to have ought call'd Religion against the sense of the World,
and as the <hi>Licence</hi> was vain and ridiculous granted to a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Physick</hi>
wherein the Licencer said, <hi>Nihil reperio in hoc libello fidei Catholicae contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
quo minus typis mandetur,</hi> so likewise will the Vogue of granting any
<hi>Liberty</hi> to any thing of Catholick Faith that has Treason and Sedition in
it, be as worthy of Laughter: and then will the Publishing of this <hi>Tenet</hi>
be prevalent probably with <hi>Papists,</hi> and prove like <hi>a word in season,</hi> and tend to
the abolishing the abuse of the word <hi>Religion,</hi> when they shall be argued
<hi>with in the cool of the day,</hi> (as our first Parents where after the fall) and
their <hi>Fiery</hi> Principles be then exposed, and then may each of them whose
Religion so call'd excited their angry Prophets to desire the destruction of
Heretical Cities, as the <hi>Choler</hi> of <hi>Ionah</hi> at last animated him tho not to destroy,
yet to wish the Destruction of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> be as he was seasonably expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, <hi>dost thou well to be angry?</hi> and dost thou well to be angry with
others, who will not call thy firing their houses Religion, when thou seest
the World begin to laugh at the impertinence of the calling it so?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> I cited before <hi>of the great Question to be considered,</hi> begins his
discourse with a Patriotly kind of Sagacity thus, viz. <hi>That this Nation and
the Nation of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>concerned with it, are at present in such a
posture, and under such Circumstances, as give just reason both of fear and care
more then ordinary both to Rulers and People, is so without doubt, that it needs
no Proof, and that we are in a dangerous Feaver, in regard both to our Civil
and Religious Interest, all in their wits must know: which Disease, albeit it
be now in the opinion of most come to a Crisis, yet few can determine, whether it
will end in a natural cool, or prove a distemper yet more dangerous and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when I consider the great number of those in the Kingdom who
are at their ease therein, either by substantial Fortunes or Professions or
Trades, and who would account it both trouble and shame to get by Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as an adventitious <hi>Trade,</hi> as much as a great first-rate Practitioner in
<hi>Law,</hi> who had a Receit for the Curing the Tooth-Ach or Gout would
to get <hi>Fees</hi> thereby, and to have a Mingle of Clients and Patients toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and which sort of Mankind that by the solid weight of their Fortunes
or Industry are come to their Center of Rest, must necessarily hate all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
of Earthquakes in Church and State, and being well on their
<hi>terra firma</hi> will never care to walk on the high Rope with the Poise of a
drawn Sword in their hands, and who will never venture their heads by
wearing any discriminating <hi>Ribbands</hi> in their Hats, nor give their heads for
the washing or the rebaptising themselves with little Names of the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Parties, and who generously valuing themselves on unmercenary
Loyalty and unbribed Orthodoxy, will neither rob <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>God</hi> of the
things that are theirs, and not expect that their <hi>Prince</hi> should impoverish
himself by paying <hi>Tribute</hi> to them and <hi>taking them off</hi> by Gifts, more then
the Patriots in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days did, and when I consider that the
more thinking and knowing part among these and whose ease is only infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by seeing so many objects that are uneasie, must needs think and know
that solid Trade and Industry can never thrive, nor the Kingdom by it,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103047:144"/>
till the false <hi>Trade</hi> of Religion shall be exterminated, I do fancy to my self
that we shall shortly by the strength of this sound part of the Nation, be
able to weather the <hi>Crisis</hi> or <hi>decretory</hi> days of our feavourish distemper,
and that our disease will end in a <hi>natural cool,</hi> and that as some <hi>fermentation</hi>
may be said to be <hi>perfective</hi> as well as destructive, (and indeed life it self is
but a Continuation of the vigorous <hi>fermentation of the Blood which is so long
maintained as the Mass of Blood is kept hot and Circulating through the Veins
and Arteries</hi>) so we shall find this fermentation that has been in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
prove perfective to it, and a continuer of the life of it. For as one
very useful property of <hi>fermentation</hi> is, that while it separates all heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
parts, it leaves the <hi>basis</hi> as it were or main Ingredient of the Mass
clear and pure, and discards from it recrements or superfluities, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
noble property thereof is, that it exalts the Body fermented to what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
it is capable of, these effects do I expect of our Political Fermentation
(that hard word that is generally used in expressing the present distracted
State of the Kingdom) and that it will naturally cause in the Body of the
People that <hi>superfluity</hi> of folly as well as <hi>naughtiness</hi> to be thrown off, which
will leave the substantial part of the Nation more clear and pure, and will
end in <hi>England</hi>'s Ballancing it self first and then the World, all our useless
Religion-Traders having been swept away as the <hi>dust</hi> of our <hi>Ballance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant that the Animosities among many Protestants of narrow Souls,
and Principles may last too long on the account of Religion, and a great
many deluders will make a great many deluded desperately obstinate against
their Ecclesiastical Rulers: but the People of <hi>England</hi> are too many to be
crowded into the Prisons of such narrow Principles, and this great and
active thing called <hi>Nature,</hi> that is always busie and which sometimes doth
its business even by mens Idleness (and the necessary effect thereof, their
Poverty) will by the general necessitous condition of <hi>Luxuriants</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion-Traders
force them to be industrious, and that industry will bring
us to the State of a <hi>Britannia florens,</hi> and too of a <hi>Britannia triumphans,</hi> and
rescue a populous Kingdom from the decay of its Trade, that hath happen'd
by our having been embarrass'd with a <hi>Holy Kirk</hi> or <hi>Holy Church</hi> Militant
against the State, and that affirmation which appeared so senseless in the
Theology of a Popish Priest, namely, that <hi>Respublica est in Ecclesia,</hi> instead
of the Church being in the Common-wealth, will equally appear so in the
Writings of Mr. <hi>Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wright</hi> (for that he there affirmed) and to be in any
man's writings as absurdly said as it is in the <hi>Lexicon Geographicum</hi> in Folio,
<hi>Cantabrigia est quoddam oppidum in quo est Academia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Dissenter should now trouble the Press with ingenious Books to
perplex the Layety about the lawfulness of the ordination by Bishops, he
would want ingenious Readers; for 'tis now as much out of fashion for
People to concern themselves about knowing the demonstrative certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the true ordination of their Pastors, almost as 'twas among the <hi>Iews</hi>
of old to question who were the true Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> by natural Generation,
a thing that none but the Mother knew.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>English</hi> World is likely to the end of time, to be too busie to mind
nice Questions of the <hi>uncertain Genealogies</hi> of Churches, and each Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
now will admit of the <hi>Credo Ecclesiam Catholicam</hi> without quarrelling
about the <hi>Latinity</hi> of the expression; and as in the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Council of
Trent</hi> (where the Thred of the Controversie about <hi>proponentibus lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
runs through the whole Council) when it was told the <hi>Pope</hi> that <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi>
granted <hi>that if the thing designed were only that the Legates shall propose,
no man would have complained, but the Ablative,</hi> proponentibus legatis <hi>did
deprive the Bishops of Power to propose, and therefore 'twas fit to change it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103047:145"/>
to another kind of Speech,</hi> the Pope replyed, <hi>That 'twas now no time to think
of</hi> cujus generis &amp; cujus casus, so in our Realm all Policy it self whether
Civil or Ecclesiastical, will now be accounted but Pedantry, that by any
previous questions puts off the debate of <hi>Capital</hi> Ships and their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Equipage; and the consideration of the necessity of great Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
for that purpose, will carry the Vote with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi>
among the People diffusive here, that they will give no more Supplyes to
Religion-Traders, and that in order to the Nations being able as a <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
florens</hi> in point of Trade to keep great Fleets at Sea, 'tis necessary that
mens expectation should be bankrupt of gain by Castles in the Air, or in
fine, that the very Corporation of the Trade of all <hi>Beggars</hi> should be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
which has so much diminished our other Trade.</p>
            <p>The great States-man of this latter Age, <hi>Mazarine</hi> projecting the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power and Glory of <hi>France,</hi> did not long before he dyed, wisely lay
the Foundation of it by the extirpating out of the Metropolis and other
Cities of that Kingdom, those publick Nusances there called Beggars, and
since all <hi>Religion-Traders</hi> are in truth and reallity of the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Beggars,</hi>
and the Multitude of them at present diminisheth the shame of that very
Trade, the destruction of it will probably by all be judged as the first
thing necessary for the advancement of other Commerce. And as the
wisest course I ever heard of, taken for breaking the Trade of <hi>Beggars</hi> in
the <hi>Streets</hi> was that by the <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>Middlesex</hi> in their Printed Papers,
sent to the Church-Wardens, Overseers of the Poor, and Constables of the
respective Parishes in the Suburbs, whereby <hi>all Persons are desired and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by their Order</hi> to forbear to relieve any Beggars at their doors, or in any
other kind about the Streets, so in like manner will nature probably by the
real Poverty of People cause them to forbear to give relief to these Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Mendicants,</hi> and will thereby break their Trade.</p>
            <p>And moreover tho there hath in all Ages been another sort of Traders,
and who too were but splendid Beggars, and by their importunity in
<hi>Courts,</hi> and with artifice representing the Sores and Maims of their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
have moved the Royal Commiseration to exhaust its Revenue on
them, yet the vast publick charge likely to be impendent over us as well
as our Neighbours will shew those First-rate Mendicants the vanity of the
Science of <hi>begging,</hi> a Science that <hi>Agrippa</hi> doth very well Animadvert upon,
in his Book <hi>de Vanitate Scientiarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there being no way for the Heirs and Children of our many <hi>Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi>
to get from under the loads of debts and Incumbrances bequeath'd them,
but by industry and frugality, I account that they will be necessitated to
mend the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Age, and so to contribute to the advancement of
Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the</hi> Author of Britannia languens <hi>doth (I fear) too truly tell us,</hi>
p. 139. That our late wealthy Yeomanry are impoverished or so much reduced
in their Stocks, that a man shall hardly find three in a County able to Rent 3
or 400 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> and that our Poor are encreased to near ten times their
late number within these last twenty years, and that their maintainance doth
cost the Nation 400000 l. per <hi>Annum</hi> constant Tax, <hi>and had before in</hi> p. 138
<hi>shew'd,</hi> That the Trades of Tillage, Grazing, Dairy, Cloathing, Fulling, that
formerly enriched the Occupiers of them, have in these latter years been the
usual Shipwracks of Mens Stocks and Estates in most parts of <hi>England, and
in</hi> p. 27. That we have in a manner lost the Eastland and Northern Trades, <hi>and
in</hi> p. 240 <hi>shews,</hi> That the cheapness of Interest doth not proceed from the plenty
of Mony but scarceness of security, <hi>and there observes,</hi> That Personal Security
for Mony being in a manner lost, and that there is not one Land security in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103047:145"/>
twenty that is good, <hi>and in</hi> p. 291. I hear of no new improving Manufactures
in <hi>England</hi> but that of Periwigs, <hi>we may well account that the Ebb of our
Trade is at the very lowest point, and that under so good a Prince in so
good and populous a Land, nature will hasten its improvement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho the understandings of the <hi>English</hi> have in all Arts and Sciences ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
as sharp as those of any Nation, and particularly in the Science of
the <hi>Politics,</hi> yet so it has happen'd that since the <hi>Reformation</hi> our States-men
have been so put to it by the efforts of <hi>Popery</hi> and other <hi>Religion-Trades</hi>
to stand continually upon their Guard, and have been so worn out by
continual duty, that they have not had time to make Platforms of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Political Discipline, or to acquaint the World with their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires</hi>
as many of the States-men of <hi>France</hi> have done, and the great
<hi>Ship</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> in its Trading Voyages (as I may say) under Sail, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a great figure in the Sea of time, and having experienced Pilots at the
Helm of State, hath yet been so clog'd in its <hi>motion</hi> by the little fantastick
<hi>Remora</hi> of a pretended Religion sticking to its side in several Conjunctures,
that our making no more way in the World hath appeared a Jest to Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Spectators, and no doubt but <hi>pending</hi> the Authority of a <hi>Religion-Trade,</hi>
as <hi>paramount</hi> over others in this or any Country, its fate will be like <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens,
never to excel.</hi> Not only our States-men but our <hi>Princes</hi> in former
times tho their abilities were very great and adequate to support the weight
of the Government had it been greater, were yet exposed to perpetual
toyl, by <hi>ballancing</hi> the Religionary Contest, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Parties of <hi>Papists</hi> and
<hi>Puritans;</hi> which minds me how it hath been wondered at, that a strong
Horse should not draw a <hi>one wheel'd</hi> Coach with a great deal of ease, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that he only bears up part of the weight, and keeps it upright to
a <hi>Ballance</hi> by <hi>thills</hi> on either side of him, and that by experience 'tis found
that this Horse becomes weary sooner then expectation: and the reason
of it is conceived to be, that tho he bears not so much burthen nor draws
so much draught as a Coach or other Carriage with two or more Wheels,
yet he is so bruised and banged on either side with the unusual motion of
the <hi>thills</hi> to keep the one Wheel'd Coach upright, that he is thereby much
sooner spent and wearied then by ordinary drawing or bearing he would
have been: and thus neither better nor worse, hath been the fate of our
Monarchs and their Ministers, to be continually throughout the Journey of
their Lives hit on this and 'tother side, and bruised with the Thills of Popery
and Presbytery, while they were keeping up Religion to a Ballance; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
'twill appear a shame to us that they should be thus the <hi>Ludibria</hi> of
Fortune any longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Author <hi>of</hi> the present State of <hi>England, Part. 2. saith,</hi> That the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Charge of his Majesty's Navy in times of Peace continuing in Harbor, is
so well regulated that it amounts to scarce 70000 l.</p>
            <p>Had he heard my Lord-Keeper <hi>Bridgeman</hi>'s Speech to the Parliament,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1670. he would there have been informed, <hi>That His Majesty finds that
by his Accounts from the year 1660 to the late War, the ordinary Charge of the
Fleet,</hi> Communibus annis, <hi>came to</hi> 500000 l. <hi>a year, and that it cannot be
supported with less.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> in that <hi>Speech</hi> mentioning <hi>to what proportion our Neighbours
had augmented their Fleets, and how it imported His Majesty to keep pace with
them, if not to outgo them in number and strength of Shipping,</hi> minds me of
the Force of that <hi>saying</hi> of <hi>Cicero</hi> to <hi>Atticus,</hi> L. 10. Ep. 7. <hi>Qui mare tenet,
eum necesse est rerum potiri,</hi> and the truth of it is much more applicable to
the State of the World now, then that in his time: and we shall always be
but <hi>damnati ad insulam,</hi> if we do not by a vigorous industry so supply
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103047:146"/>
our selves as to be able to supply our Princes, and so as to enable them to
make the Naval Strength of <hi>England,</hi> as proportionable to that of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as it can be made.</p>
            <p>As the ordinary charge of the Fleet for several years, came to the great
above mentioned Sum, so I believe that the ordinary Naval Charge never
since amounted to less then 200,000 <hi>l. per Year,</hi> beside the vast Charge in
building new Ships and rebuilding old, and the Charge of Summer and
Winter Guards, and of Convoys and of Ships against <hi>Algeers:</hi> and His
Majesties most exact care of the defence of the Walls of the Kingdom hath
been such, while he beheld the emulous endeavours of Nations to excell in
Naval Power, that he hath enrich'd his Realm since the <hi>Year</hi> 69, with a
more valuable Fleet then it had before: and the great Cordial that Nature
allows us against <hi>Wars, and Rumors of Naval Wars,</hi> when we are dejected
with the shame of our Civil Wars having occasioned the Neighbouring
World to augment its Naval Force, and consequently too our own vast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Charge in the augmenting ours, is that by the necessary encrease of
our industry we are capable of defraying it, and herein Providence is but
just in treating us in the Confinement to our Island, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> do <hi>Idlers</hi>
sent to their <hi>Work-houses,</hi> where care is taken that if they do not the Work
appointed them, the <hi>Sea</hi> will come in upon them: and 'tis well for us that
accordingly as is shewn in the 8th <hi>Chapter</hi> of Sir <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Political Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
there are spare hands enough among the King of</hi> England'<hi>s Subjects to earn
Two Millions</hi> per Annum, <hi>more then they now do, and there are employments
ready, proper and sufficient for that purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His expression of the <hi>spare hands</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> minds me, how we who
did before our <hi>Commotion</hi> only pay to our Kings, the 6<hi>th part</hi> of <hi>the spare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
part of our Estates,</hi> (for that was what Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> afterward <hi>Lord
Chief Iustice</hi> declared in the House of Commons, to be the proportion that
men were to be taxed in the old gentle way of Assessments, called Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
were forced upon those manifold payments to the Usurpers, that
amounted to one entire <hi>Subsidy</hi> in each Week of the Year, when as what
we payed before exceeded not usually one <hi>Subsidy</hi> or 15<hi>th</hi> in two or three
years space.</p>
            <p>And afterward when instead of <hi>the demanding of Five Members</hi> from the
Parliament, above 400 were forcibly secluded from it, most Exorbitant
Taxes were Levyed in the Name of a <hi>House of Commons,</hi> in which instead of
508 <hi>Members</hi> as the legal Complement of its number, and of 78 <hi>Knights</hi>
of <hi>Shires</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> and 12 for <hi>Wales,</hi> there were no <hi>Knights</hi> of the
<hi>Shire</hi> at all sitting in that House for these 26 <hi>English</hi> and 11 <hi>Welch</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
following, viz. <hi>Bedfordshire, Cornwal, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,
Dorsetshire, Essex, Glocestershire, Hartfordshire, Herefordshire,
Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Middlesex, Monmouthshire, Norfolk, Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Oxfordshire, Surry, Shropshire, Southampton, Suffolk, Somersetshire,
Sussex, Westmerland, Warwickshire, Yorkshire, Anglesey, Brecknock, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganshire,
Carmarthinshire, Carnarvanshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morganshire,
Pembrokshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire,</hi> and but one <hi>Knight</hi>
of the <hi>Shire</hi> in each of the 9 following Counties, <hi>Berkshire, Cheshire, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtonshire,
Kent, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Staffordshire, Wiltshire
Worcestershire,</hi> and only the full number of <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Shire</hi> in <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamshire,
Nottinghamshire, Rutlandshire, Merionethshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>York, Westminster, Bristol, Canterbury, Chester, Exeter, Oxford, Lincoln,
Worcester, Chichester, Carlile, Rochester, Wells, Coventry,</hi> had no <hi>Citizens</hi> in
the House, and <hi>London</hi> had only 1 instead of 4, and <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi>
alone of all the <hi>Cities</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> had their full Number, and by a parcel
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103047:146"/>
of about 89 permitted to sit, was the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> as well as <hi>Layety</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Taxed.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be forgot that after the great Usurper by his own Authority,
only laid a Tax of 60,000 <hi>l. per Month</hi> on us, he afterward found a <hi>giving</hi>
Parliament that Calculating the Charge of the Nation, judged it in the
whole to amount to 1300,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> whereof 200,000 <hi>l.</hi> for the
Protectors support, 400,000 <hi>l.</hi> for the maintenance of the Navy and
Ports, and 700,000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Army, as we are told out of the <hi>History of
the Iron Age</hi> printed in the year 1656: and that they who grudged the
best of Kings the ordinary yearly Revenue of less then half a Million, were
brought to settle more then double that Sum on the worst of Usurpers,
<hi>viz. 1,300,000 l. per Annum,</hi> and that by their helping him into the Power
to break the Ballance of Christendome as he did, they have entailed on us and
our Heirs, a necessity of <hi>labouring</hi> hard for ever, to expiate the Guilt and
Folly of their idle Politicks.</p>
            <p>The Plenty and Pride and <hi>Idleness</hi> here that occasioned our Civil Wars,
and the <hi>Tessera</hi> of one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, <hi>Militemus,</hi> and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
discriminating words and signs of Religion, have brought us to the
<hi>Tessera</hi> of another of them which will stick by us, namely <hi>Labore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as 'tis to be seen in <hi>Scobels Collection</hi> of <hi>Acts, Anno</hi> 1656. cap. 6. in
<hi>the humble Petition and advice of Cromwel</hi>'s Parliament, the 7th <hi>Paragraph,</hi>
which Enacts the Revenue, mentions nothing in particular of the 1,300,
000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, to be settled for the Protectors support, but provides that as
a constant yearly Revenue for the support of the Government, and the
safety and defence of these Nations by Sea and Land, 1000000 <hi>l. be settled
for the Navy and Army,</hi> and 300,000 <hi>l.</hi> in general for the support of the
Government.</p>
            <p>I should not dilate on the Subject of those past Calamitous Times of our
Country, but that so great a Number of those who experimented them,
and were Actors or Sufferers therein is now dead, that this Age wants the
<hi>Poize</hi> or Ballast of their experiences to keep it steddy and secure, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overset by Waves of Sedition, or <hi>Winds</hi> of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> There are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Latine <hi>Sayings</hi> about War, of which the Pedantly Citation is nauseous, as
was particularly <hi>Sorbiers</hi> valuing himself on the <hi>Motto</hi> of <hi>Pax bello Potior:</hi>
but there is another saying familiar to Grammar Schools, whence the most
Oracular Men in Cabinets of State may, and indeed ought to take their
Measures and Estimates of the probable Continuance of the publick Peace in
any Country, and that is from the Consideration of the Numbers of the
Inhabitants that never felt the misery of War, and that <hi>saying</hi> is, <hi>Dulce
bellum inexpertis,</hi> a saying that was thought to give an Ornament to the
Monumental Inscription of our <hi>Harry</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> among the <hi>Westminster</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,
the Epitaph of which Prince whose Reign moved so much in the
bloody Track of War being there thus,
<q>
                  <l>Tertius Henricus jacet his pietatis amicus.</l>
                  <l>Ecclesiam stravit istam quam post renovavit.</l>
                  <l>Reddat ei munus qui Regnat Trinus &amp; unus.</l>
                  <l>Tertius Henricus est Templi conditor hujus, 1273:</l>
                  <l>Dulce bellum inexpertis.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And long before that obtained as a Latin <hi>Adage,</hi> it was one in <hi>Greek,</hi> viz.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and it is well said in <hi>Vegetius De Re militari,</hi> lib. 3.
cap. 14. <hi>Nec confidas satis si tyro praelium cupit. Inexpertis enim dulcis est pugna.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:103047:147"/>
And in <hi>Pindar</hi> 'tis said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
i. e. <hi>dulce bellum inexpertis, ast expertus quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam

            </p>
            <p>the sense of this weighty <hi>Adage Horace,</hi> applyes to the Contracting
Friendship with Great Men,
<q>
                  <l>Dulcis inexpertis cultura potentis amici,</l>
                  <l>Expertus metuit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And no doubt but the reason that induced the <hi>Romans</hi> to place their <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi>
in the <hi>Van</hi> of the Battel, was that their not knowing all the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties
and horrors of War, would contribute to their eagerness in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.
Partly to this purpose Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> in his <hi>Behemoth</hi> or <hi>History of our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars</hi> observes well, <hi>That there were at first in the Parliaments Army a
great many</hi> London <hi>Apprentices, who for want of experience in the War,
would have been fearful enough of death and wounds approaching visibly in glis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Swords, but for want of judgement scarce thought of such death as comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly
in a Bullet, and therefore were very hardly to be driven out of the
Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now therefore should any Great Person descend to ask my poor Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the proportion of the danger we are in of a Relapse into the Plague
of War, I would give it by bringing the Doctrine of <hi>Dulce bellum,</hi> &amp;c.
into use and application thus, namely, I would <hi>Calculate</hi> the number of the
<hi>inexperts</hi> now here living, and who were not living in the time of the
last War, a thing not hard to do sufficiently for my purpose: and thus I
essayed to do it the last year when I fancied to employ my thoughts on that
Subject, diverting my self with these <hi>Queries. 1. What part of the People of</hi>
England <hi>now living, are</hi> inexperts, i. e. <hi>who are now alive that were born
since the year in which our Wars ended, or were then Children,</hi> viz. <hi>Of such
years as not to have experienced, or been sensible of the miseries and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of the War? 2. What numbers of those who lived in 1641, about
which time the War may be supposed to have begun, are now dead? 3. What
proportion of those now living, who lived in that time of the War, did gain by
the War;</hi> for it may be said that perhaps War may be sweet to such survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>experts. 4. The War of</hi> Ireland <hi>ending about the year 1653, how many
may the number of such</hi> inexperts <hi>there be supposed to be? 5. The People of</hi>
Scotland <hi>being now above a Million</hi> (as are the People of <hi>Ireland</hi>) and the
<hi>Scotch</hi> War ending at <hi>Worcester</hi> Fight, <hi>September</hi> the 3<hi>d, 1651. How many
are now living in</hi> Scotland <hi>that lived there that day, and what may be the number
of the</hi> inexperts <hi>there?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the satisfying my self in these Queries, tho I know that
many do make the Civil Wars of <hi>England</hi> to end with the surrender of
<hi>Oxford</hi> in Mid-summer 1646, yet because several Acts of War in <hi>England</hi>
were committed long after 1646, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Lancashire, Kent,</hi> at <hi>Colchester,
Worcester,</hi> I supposed not the <hi>English</hi> War to end till 1651, about the same
time with that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> both Kingdoms as they are but one Island, so
intermixing and bringing mutual Calamities on one another: and besides,
a few years at that distance of time would not much alter the State of this
Case: so then as to the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>last</hi> Queries, I thus concluded that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Island in the year 1651, were and always are about one half of
them under the age of 16, (before which time as they are reckoned unfit
for War, so may they likewise be thought <hi>inexperts</hi> as to the miseries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
and the other half above that age; and that of this latter half more
then one other Moyety are dead in these 28 or 29 years, which have passed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103047:147"/>
from 51 to near 80. For if we reckon only <hi>Arithmetically</hi> without any
Consideration of <hi>Geomerrical</hi> proportion in the Case, (which with reason
enough the <hi>Observator</hi> on the <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> takes in) yet 28 ½
(the number of years in 51, in which the said half are supposed dead) and
27 ½ (for the years of the other half surviving) and fifteen (for the Age
of the <hi>Inexperts</hi> from 1651) makes 72, the full Age of Man: so that the
surviving <hi>Experts</hi> are not a <hi>fourth</hi> of the whole. And again at least one
half of this <hi>fourth,</hi> either through forgetfulness by Age or Dotage, or for
want of understanding all their whole life time, may be very well count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among the <hi>Inexperts</hi> also. And thus the <hi>Inexperts</hi> will be above <hi>seven
eighth</hi> parts of the whole People.</p>
            <p>And if in answer to the third <hi>Query,</hi> we shall add the Number of the
Gainers by the War, (which perhaps some will estimate but small) and of those
who lost by the Peace and Settlement on the Kings Restoration, with the
Heirs, Executors and Principal Legatees of both, (and to these three last
sorts, the War was so very sweet, that they may very well be reckoned
for the Equivalent of three or four, or perhaps many times more the
number of the other common <hi>Inexperts</hi>) we may on the whole matter
judging modestly, conclude the <hi>Inexperts</hi> of all the former sorts, not to be
less then (9/10) <hi>nine Tenths</hi> of the whole People: and to these also they
who have spent their Estates, and cannot well live in Peace may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
added.</p>
            <p>I satisfied my self as to the fourth <hi>Query,</hi> concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> that it may
bear at least the same proportion, with what was asserted in relation to
Great <hi>Brittain:</hi> and tho the War in the former lasted some years longer,
yet there are other Considerations obvious enough, that would more then
ballance that.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Query</hi> about how many are now dead who were living in 41,
the Principles I have variously discoursed of out of the <hi>Observations</hi> on the
<hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality,</hi> may easily satisfie Curiosity therein.</p>
            <p>I account that of the Lords Temporal in the Kings Long Parliament,
that sate the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1661. there were dead 77 at the Dissolution of
that Parliament, in <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 25<hi>th,</hi> 1678. And of the 26 Bishops that sate
on the 8th of <hi>May</hi> in that Parliament, only 2 were alive in the 25<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1678. And of the <hi>House of Commons</hi> which sate in the 8th of <hi>May</hi>
1661. And consisted of about 520 odd Members there died during their
sitting, <hi>viz.</hi> in 17 <hi>Years</hi> and 8 <hi>Months 307 Members,</hi> viz. in each year
about 1/17<hi>th</hi> part, which is one in about 30 of the whole of that House eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year.</p>
            <p>And these things considered, we may well conclude that of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that sate on the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1640, there are few living, and I
think that of that turbulent House of Commons, scarce 16 are now living,
and that of the <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> that met the first of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1643. all the
<hi>Divines</hi> except 2 are dead. The Sculls of many of those hot Spurrs of Church
and State, that troubled us so much on the Stage of the World, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
since diverted us in the Scene in <hi>Hamlet,</hi> and no doubt but of the
poor handful of surviving <hi>Experts</hi> of them, the most considerate are not
now considering how by any Projects to put the World either in Tune or
out of it, but are tuning their fancies to the <hi>still Musick</hi> of the Grave.</p>
            <p>We see that many of the Sons of the Divines of that <hi>Assembly,</hi> and of
other Presbyterians, are true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and are of
the Clergy in it.</p>
            <p>But tho I am no Concurrer with their Estimates, that make the number
of those who gain'd by the War to be small, for as the Judicious Author of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103047:148"/>
               <hi>Regal Apology,</hi> Printed in the <hi>Year</hi> 1648, (and by the <hi>Oxford Antiquities</hi>
said to be, Dr. <hi>Bate</hi> the late Eminent <hi>Physitian</hi>) in <hi>p.</hi> 49 estimates, <hi>That the
Revenues of King, Queen, Bishops, Deans and Chapters, and Delinquents in the
hands of those Vsurpers were almost one Moiety of the Kingdom, besides many rich
Offices,</hi> &amp;c and as to the multiplicity of Offices then, a very ingenious
<hi>Pamphlet</hi> written in those days, call'd <hi>the City Alarum,</hi> with a <hi>Treatise of the
Excise,</hi> mentions in <hi>p. 33. That 'twas easie to demonstrate that more then</hi>
200,000 l. per Annum, <hi>was then consumed by superfluous Officers:</hi> (which
by the way sufficiently shews the ill Managery of the publick Treasure in
those days) and tho I have put the rate of the Heirs of such above that of
common <hi>Inexperts,</hi> yet I am not without hopes that possibly some what
like a sort of <hi>Experience,</hi> that many of those Heirs have from the latest
Histories and Traditional Accounts had of the breath of the People ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
blown away that mighty <hi>Ballance</hi> of Land out of the hands of the
unjust Poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssors, and all their <hi>Models</hi> of Government built thereon, and of
many of their Ancestors who had by their Swords acquired ample shares
of the Spoyles of the Crown, and Church, and Cavaliers Estates, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ashamed of their unjust Victories, and the Yoke they have brought
upon themselves and the Kingdom, and affraid of their Estates and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
not being ensureable under a fluctuating Military Oligarchy, thought
it the best of their Game to aspire with their <hi>All</hi> to the feet of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Soveraign, and to be his Restorers without Capitulation, may incline a
considerable part of such, and who are not desperate in their Fortunes, and
have perhaps inherited the Blessiing of their Ancestors penitence, by their
Peaceable Morals to make such an exception in this case, as may confirm
the Rule and make them according to the expression before used, become
<hi>sound parts of the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another momentous thing cannot but be obvious to the thoughts of the
Considerate among them, and all Orders or Parties of men here, that if
the devesting the unjust Proprietors of about half the Land of <hi>England,</hi>
by the necessary Course of the Law at the Kings Restoration, did in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
so many persons and their dependants <hi>Paupers,</hi> and useless in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the Land, and many to be Nusances in it, as troublesome
Sollicitors and Barrettors, and many likewise to withdraw to our Forraign
Plantations, and to our <hi>insula Sanctorum</hi> call'd <hi>Ireland,</hi> unavoidably make
the price of our Land sink to the proportion it hath since done, that if any
Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> and disloyal persons, should be ever able by a new <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to introduce the old Confusions among us, and dispossess the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of about half our Land as formerly, that <hi>England</hi> it self would turn
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and our Land perhaps be valuable but at ten years purchase.</p>
            <p>And tho the <hi>Experts</hi> now in being among us are comparatively few,
yet is the work of the Loyal part of them so easie to demonstrate to
their Vicinage, every where the dreadful inconvenience of essaying to mend
the World by War, that one <hi>Harvy</hi> could not more easily among the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
propagate a general Notion of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Blood, then may a
thousand of these shew to Millions of others, the impious folly of <hi>Blood guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
again incircling our Land, and especially when all our Blood and our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is necessary to be preserved for the Defence of the Realm, in a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
that hath put Christendom <hi>in procinctu:</hi> and therefore 'tis but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Course of Nature, that in such a season the generality of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
minds here should manifest such an <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of both the <hi>Irish</hi> and
<hi>English</hi> in 41, and that the <hi>Religion-Trade</hi> which had us at its feet, being now
at ours, if it should again struggle to get uppermost as formerly, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from so many to find the salute of the rising blow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:103047:148"/>
And as I love to think of these things without asperity, or offering the
least Violence to the Sacredness of the great Established <hi>Amnesty,</hi> so do I
observe the same inclination to be very prevalent among the weightier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the several Parties.</p>
            <p>The smalness of the Number of Persons now living that wanted that
<hi>Amnesty,</hi> makes men generally concur in not esteeming it, <hi>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti</hi> to wish it
broken; but tho most of our former Empirical State-Physicians are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Earth, their Errors are not, and People seem generally sensible that
both the present, and in likelyhood the future State of <hi>England</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of Political Physicians, trying more Experiments on us, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the former churlish ones that succeeded ill, and especially in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
when nature is by necessity leading us to a Convalescence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As in</hi> Boccalines <hi>Politick</hi> Touch-stone, <hi>Where</hi> the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> is
represented, throwing her Physician out of the Window, and <hi>Apollo</hi> desiring to
know the Cause of it, she told him how about 40 years ago, she asking Counsel of
her Physician, he prescribed her a tedious and chargeable Purge of divers Oyls of
Holy Leagues, of Insurrections of People, of Rebellions, of Cauteries and
other very painful Medicines that had wasted and weakened her spirits, and
that he prescribing just such another Purge as before, was therefore thrown out at
Window, <hi>so would such Purges and such Purgers as we were troubled with
forty years ago, be here deservedly dealt with now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ridiculous will any Demagogue now appear, that should in an
<hi>English</hi> Parliament harangue it against supplying the King, in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> did 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> 
               <hi>Caroli,</hi> who then (as <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s
Collections tells us) <hi>moved in the House of Commons not to yield the King
Tunnage and Poundage, till they had first settled Religion, touching the Points
of Ariminianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They might as well have moved that the King might have no Money, till
they had found out the <hi>Longitude,</hi> and likewise discovered the <hi>Quadrature</hi>
of the Circle, and they by that motion would have ensured to him the name
of <hi>Pochi-Dinari,</hi> that my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> in his <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> says, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> for his famed want of Money.</p>
            <p>But that wantonness of Popularity, did shew the worse in those two great
<hi>Demagogues</hi> of their Age, for the ingratitude it carried with it, they moving
so in the House of Commons as they did so soon after the great Royal
Concessions as to the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and might well excuse the Great
Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s then quitting their Company.</p>
            <p>But I shall here observe to your Lordship, that after the discovery of
the <hi>Gun-powder</hi> Treason, <hi>viz. 3 Iacobi,</hi> the Parliament gave him <hi>three
Subsidies,</hi> and <hi>six Fifteenths and Tenths</hi> of the Layety, and <hi>four Subsidies</hi> of
the Clergy, all which by estimation amounted to 453000 <hi>l.</hi> and it was but
just in them then so to supply the Crown after the detection of that Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
because it appeared by several Examinations, <hi>That if it had taken
effect, an Association of Forraign</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>Princes by a Solemn Oath
like that of the Holy League in</hi> France, <hi>was desigued to have assured the business
afterward:</hi> and it was but natural for the Parliament believing the same, to
enable their Prince with a Counter mine of Gold, to blow up the Associated
Purses of those Forraign Princes; and no doubt but by the very Noise of
that liberal Supply being heard abroad in the World, that Association was
Thunder-struck, as any one else must be in a Conjuncture when the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
abroad shall see our Prince provided with effects, as King <hi>Iames</hi> was as
aforesaid, a Conjuncture I despair not of seeing, nor of its influencing the
World with Terror as did the very sound of the supplying the King by
the last <hi>Pole-Act,</hi> to enable him for a War with <hi>France,</hi> and which was the

Cause that the <hi>Panic</hi> Fear in some of our rustical <hi>Plebs</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> landing
in the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Purbec,</hi> and when some of the poor adjacent <hi>Mobile,</hi> in the air of
their fancies heard the noise of <hi>adventare Gallos,</hi> as <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro,

that fear of the <hi>French</hi> that marched off an Army and Royal Fleet so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly

evaporating of the <hi>French</hi> Forces from thence, as it was a sufficient indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

there been any perfect good understanding between him and them, the nois'd
<hi>Adventare Anglos</hi> would not have exorcised them out of the body of that
Kingdom) so it perhaps proved an occasion of the perfect <hi>French</hi> Hatred against

            <p>How favourably such Estates were Taxed when <hi>Subsidies</hi> were in use, I
have shewed, and how very little they came to in the Execution of the last
<hi>Poll</hi> Bill is fresh in Memory, and yet in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Republic, when the
States raise an extraordinary Tax sometimes of the 1000<hi>dth,</hi>
sometimes of the 500<hi>dth,</hi> sometimes of the 200<hi>th</hi> part of every Mans
Estate richer or poorer, and men are Taxed therein according to
Common Fame and Report by their Magistrates of their several Cities and
Towns, and the Party grieved at his Assessment declaring on his Oath that
his Estate is not worth so much will be always relieved, it is very rarely seen
that any man makes himself poorer then common Report speaks him, by
means whereof that Tax is very considerable: and therefore for us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base

how, to provide for <hi>Equality</hi> in Taxes, Mens Estates may be as accurately
weighed as they were of old by the <hi>Roman</hi> Prudence, which for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
instituted the Office of <hi>Censors</hi> (and when in the <hi>Censes</hi> the <hi>Civil Law</hi>
ordered the <hi>Censors</hi> Estimates to be registred, and both the <hi>bona Mobilia</hi>
and <hi>Immobilia</hi> to be registred, and even the Sums of Money at Interest to
be registred and the names of the Debtors, and this upon Oath, and in
the registration of Lands their true value was set down and how they were
fertile or barren, and every Tax was Collected where the Estimate was
made) and that the <hi>Quota</hi> of Taxes might not be sunk by Peoples being

in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, when the securing the Protestant Interest
at home and abroad, made them so inclinable to look on the giving her
Mony to be the great <hi>quid agendum,</hi> and on which they thought <hi>depended
both the Law and the Prophets</hi> in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and when as we are
told it in <hi>townsend</hi>'s <hi>Collections</hi> very great masterly skill was shewn in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates

            <p>The long Parliament of 1640. seem to me in their Taxes in <hi>London,</hi> and
the Associated Counties to have provided only that their concern in the
Kingdom might <hi>vivere in diem,</hi> but hath occasioned the disproportionate
and immoderate weight of the Taxes in some places of those Counties to be
perpetual. And the prodigious Taxes laid on the Inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi>
during the War after 41 did not end with it, insomuch that <hi>Lilly</hi> the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger

               <hi>In the Parliament in</hi> Anno Domini 1605. <hi>and</hi> Anno Reg. Iac. 3. <hi>there
was passed</hi> an Act for the granting 3 entire Subsidies and six fifteenths and
tenths granted by the Temporalty to his Majesty, with the Reasons why grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the great advantages his Majesty hath been to the Kingdom. <hi>And
in the Act it is</hi> inter alia <hi>said,</hi> A first and principal Reason is that late and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Attemps of that cursed Crew of desperate Papists, to have destroyed
your Excellent Majesty, the Queen and your Royal Progeny, together with the
Reverend Prelates, Nobility and Commons of this Land; assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the great Confusion and Subversion of this Kingdom. The barbarous
Malice in some unnatural Subjects, we have thought fit to check and encounter
with the certain demonstration of the universal and undoubted love of your
Loyal and Faithful Subjects, not only for the present to breed in your Majesty
a more confident assurance of our uttermost Aids, in proceeding with a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Resolution to repress them and to furnish your Majesty against Hostile At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
both by Sea and Land, but also for the future times, to give their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and Partakers to understand that your Majesty can never want in this
Kingdom means of defence of your Rights, Revenge of your Wrongs, and
support of your Estate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They had immediately before said,</hi> We do further think fit to add and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
these reasons special and extraordinary, which have moved us hereunto,
lest the same our doing may be brought into precedent to the prejudice of the
State of our Country, and our Posterity.</p>
            <p>As hidebound as King <hi>Iames</hi> found Parliaments afterward (for as I
said) he in his <hi>Speech</hi> in Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1620 mentioned, <hi>That in all his
Reign he had but 4 Subsidies and six Fifteenths,</hi> yet their Belief of that
<hi>Popish</hi> Gun-powder <hi>Plot</hi> fired the Zeal of their Supplyes, and (as I may
say too) made their Money burn in their Pockets, and pass with speed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Exchequer, and with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the <hi>Caution about not drawing that
Act into a President,</hi> &amp;c. Had I been in the Parliament that sate after the
Discovery of the last Popish Plot, I should have moved that the belief of
that Plot might have shewn it self by works of supply to the King, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering that the Protestant Interest was then abroad, <hi>inter sacrum
&amp; saxum,</hi> and do hope that the belief thereof will so shew it self in any
Parliament his Majesty shall call, that we shall that way Expostulate with
the <hi>quare fremuerunt Gentes,</hi> abroad against the Protestant Religion. And
such a golden Age do I expect for the Crown from future Parliaments, that
I believe that nothing of Prerogative that safeguards the Kingdom, will be
ask'd as the price of any Supplyes, and that as I thought it very absurd in
a Country Fellow, when he called for a quantity of an Opiate Medicine his
<hi>Doctor</hi> had prescribed, to ask angrily, <hi>shall I have no more for my Money?</hi>
when as if he had had more it would have poysoned him, it will generally
appear as absurd on any Supplies to swallow up so much of the executive
part of the Regal Power, as would prove in effect destructive to the Body
Politick.</p>
            <p>We shall have so much occasion to come for shelter under the Branches of
Regal Power, that we shall not be tempted by any leisure to lay its roots bare.
And considering that even in Republicks both Ancient and Modern, there
hath been a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> of Dictatorian or Monarchic Power in times of War,
and that all the times that all the living now in Christendom are to be fencing
with all the way in their March to the Grave, may perhaps be times of War,
I may well account that the <hi>Sir Politics</hi> will every where appear ridiculous,
who shall trouble the World with Models of Republicks, <hi>Agrarian Laws,</hi> and
<hi>Rotations,</hi> and spending time in the contrivance of <hi>Ballotting</hi> Boxes, and
raise a dust in mens eyes with the <hi>Ballance</hi> of Land at home, when we shall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103047:150"/>
be forced still to look out sharp to keep the ballance of Power exact in the
whole World abroad, and shall think time better imployed in notions of
the building great Capital Ships to defend our Interest, in and by the Ocean,
then in furnishing such little wooden ware for a Fantastick <hi>Oceana,</hi> and
shall essay from an <hi>Oceana</hi> or <hi>Vtopia</hi> to introduce an Establishment of one
Assembly only to <hi>propose,</hi> and another only to Enact such things as the
other shall <hi>propose,</hi> a thing that an <hi>English</hi> House of Commons would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
as much loath as to be tyed from eating any meat, but what a House
of Lords should chew for them; and yet is this divided or <hi>double-bottom</hi>
Supream Power of the two Assemblies by our Airy <hi>Dreamers</hi> made essential
for the preventing the <hi>Divulsion</hi> of their Government. I lately mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>proponentibus legatis</hi> to be the thred of Controversie that ran
through the whole Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and he who reads all Father <hi>Pauls</hi>
History of it, will find that question to animate the whole, and to be
there, <hi>tota in toto</hi> and as it were all in every part of it. The chiefest of
the <hi>Cardinals</hi> were the Popes <hi>Legates</hi> in that Council, and they were by
their Interest tied sufficiently to <hi>propound</hi> nothing but what should promote
the Papal Power, but in <hi>Book</hi> 6th 'tis said, <hi>That the Pope had advice
from his Nuntio in</hi> Spain, <hi>that the most Catholick King was much displeased
with the Style of</hi> Proponentibus legatis, <hi>allowed in the first Session, and that
the Pope excused it as introduced without his privity, but that however he
would not quit it nor have it permitted that every turbulent person there
might propound what he pleased.</hi> And there in <hi>Book</hi> 7th 'tis said, <hi>That the
Pope on further application from the Ambassadors of Princes that that
Clause might be damned, as contrary to the liberty of Ambassadors and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in propounding what they thought profitable, those for their States and
these for their Churches, the Pope gave them good words about it but did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
and <hi>Book</hi> 10th, <hi>The</hi> Spanish <hi>Ambassador desiring the Retractation of
that Clause, and that otherwise the Council could not be called free, and that
its freedom was to be dated only from the time of such Retractation, and
that the Emperor insisted on its abrogation, and that by reason of that Clause
no</hi> German <hi>had yet come to that Council, yet nothing was effected for its revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and still the</hi> Proponentibus legatis <hi>stood</hi> as a Rock, and all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
dash'd themselves in pieces, producing nothing but the froath of
excusatory words from the Pope about it: and in fine all that could be
gained was, in the end of the <hi>Council,</hi> after that <hi>Clause</hi> had had its full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and done all its Execution against the freedom of the <hi>Council,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of the Ambassadors and Bishops there, and was like a Post-horse ridd
to his Stage, and had brought all the <hi>Cloak-bags</hi> with the Holy Ghost from
<hi>Rome,</hi> to turn it to grass with a Formal Declaration or Protestation contrary
to Fact, that the meaning of the <hi>Synod was not by that Clause to change in
any part the usual manner of handling matters in general Councils,</hi> &amp;c. A
crying <hi>Con licensa</hi> to the Bishops and Ambassadors after the cutting of the
Throats of their Liberties. And now can any <hi>Opiniatre</hi> yet further
think that a Representative of <hi>English</hi> Commoners will ever think those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican
Projectors of liberty, who do bare faced cut them off from the
freedom of their share in Enacting any thing but what another House shall
<hi>propound,</hi> and that nothing shall have the Sanction of Law, but what
enters the Stage with a <hi>proponentibus Patriciis,</hi> or by the <hi>Proposition</hi> of any
<hi>other House,</hi> the Style of one of <hi>Cromwels</hi> two Houses, and who do set
up for Inventors in Politics by reviving the exploded Constitution of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>
among whom <hi>Anacharsis</hi> observed, <hi>Wise men did consult and Fools
determine.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:103047:151"/>
But the days are pass'd and gone, that gave People of subtle and uneasie
Brains the leisure of digging in Politics further than the Center, which
whoever doth, digs not downward but upwards, and that Center I account
the ancient <hi>lex terrae</hi> to be, and he who hath got beyond that doth dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
upwards destroy the real Foundations of Churches and States, while he
is laying imaginary ones.</p>
            <p>But since according to the saying <hi>in hieme nil movendum,</hi> men of Sense
who love to be tampering with Physick in other seasons, will in that be
averse from stirring the humours and trying Conclusions on themselves and
in the churlish State of the World abroad that is in prospect, all State Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics
that would any where advise a change of Fundamental Governments,
will find an unruly Patient of the World, and all our sober Political <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osi</hi>
will be necessarily inclined to study how to maintain and support our
old Government, instead of projecting any new one. And in order to the
support of our old one, I dare say that there will be no more suspension of
Royal Aids on the account of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Controversie, or the freedom
of our Wills, while we are busied in preparing to defend the freedom of our
Estates and Bodies from Forraigners, and securing both Prince and Peoples
not being predestinated to ruine by them.</p>
            <p>The Extinguishing the maintenance of the Clergy will not pass for a
<hi>new</hi> Evangelical <hi>Light,</hi> but the exactest provision for the Enabling Crown'd
Heads to support their Civil Government and their Clergy, and with the
observance of equality and proportion in the same respecting the State of
their Kingdoms, will be worthy the thoughts of the most <hi>illuminated</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:
for as among the Divines it is on all hands agreed, that from the
40th <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to the end of that <hi>Book,</hi> the thing chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
designed in the Portraiture of the great <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Prophet</hi> is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the figure of Church and State under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> so there is great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
kept in the same, and not only the curious <hi>colouring</hi> but the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>draught</hi> and <hi>design</hi> required in a great <hi>Historical</hi> Painting; and no
wonder if the same appeared so express'd on the Table of the <hi>Prophets</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
when God himself was pleas'd there to paint it partly after the
exactness and proportion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy, and with many Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Curiosity, and to which tho a litteral interpretation is not applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and on which tho no expectance of the Erection of another material
Temple at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or in <hi>Iudea</hi> is to be founded, or of 12000 <hi>Reeds</hi> of
<hi>Land</hi> for the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> yet may it thence be naturally inferred
that the preserving of orderly proportion in the Revenue of the Prince and
Priest, and with respect to number Weight and Measure in the Future times
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> was then the care and design of Providence. The 45th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that doth so nicely assign the Portion, for the Prince and Priest, ordains
or rather predicts a Royal Patrimony for the Prince in the way of a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Land, as 'tis said in the 8th Verse, <hi>In the Land shall be his Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in</hi> Israel, <hi>and my Princes shall no more oppress my People, and the rest of the
Land shall they give to the House of</hi> Israel <hi>according to their Tribes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The consideration of this may probably reforme the men of curious ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
who are still making the <hi>Metal</hi> of Government more fine than the
Standard, and thinking to leave out there the necessary Mixture of the
baser allay that the frail State of humanity requires to make it currant, and
without which it would be too brittle for use, and projecting how to make
the Government of Church and State with ease to live upon nothing, or on
Taxes in a confused and blundering manner laid, when the thought of an
inspired <hi>Prophet</hi> in this <hi>Vision</hi> relating to the time of the Gospel the which
is called by the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, the time of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:103047:151"/>
applied all the exactness of Mathematics to the supporting both the
<hi>Crown,</hi> and use of the Keys by an ample and certain Revenue. And as
the great <hi>Tax</hi> of <hi>Augustus</hi> on the <hi>Roman</hi> World or <gap reason="foreign">

or <hi>Pole</hi> near the time of our <hi>Saviors</hi> Birth, served to confirm
the Christian Religion in the accomplishment of the Prediction of <hi>Christs</hi>
being born in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and to cause <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>'s going thither, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
effect in the Confirmation of the most rational kind of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, I mean the Protestant, do I expect from our Future Legal
and Equal Taxes; and as I mentioned my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s saying of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
being yet in debt to the Church since <hi>Harry</hi> the 8ths time, so it
may perhaps as justly be said that they are in <hi>debt</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> for the
safety of the Protestant Religion since Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, who as I have
been informed from some well Vers'd in our Exchequer <hi>Records</hi>) alienated
more of the Patrimony of the Crown then any <hi>English</hi> Prince ever did,
and that in order to her raising those great Sums before mentioned, which
were necessary for the securing the Protestant Religion, and rivetting it in
fast to our Laws and Government, and I am the more apt to credit such
my Information because I see not by what other way she could raise those
vast Sums, but by such alienation of the Crown Lands, her ordinary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
probably coming near such her receits, which one may partly guess
by what Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> in his <hi>abstract of the Records of the Tower touching
the Kings Revenue</hi> affirms, (<hi>Ex Computo Dom. Burleigh The saurar.</hi>) that
<hi>Anno 12, her Revenue besides the Wards, and Dutchy of</hi> Lancaster <hi>was</hi>
188197 l. 4 s. <hi>and the Payments and Assignmets were</hi> 110612 l. 13 <hi>s. of which
the Houshold was</hi> 30000 l. <hi>Privy Purse 2000 l. Admiralty 30000 l.</hi> and Sir
<hi>Robert Cotton</hi> in that <hi>Book</hi> mentions that she did <hi>pawn her Iewels in the Tower,
and often morgage her Land:</hi> which no doubt she was constrained to do for the
great end aforesaid, her ordinary Revenue and extraordinary Supplies of
<hi>Subsidies</hi> not being adequate to the great Sums that her Measures of State
and Religion caus'd her to expend. And to how low an Ebb the Crown
Lands were fall'n in the late Kings time, from what they were in the 12th
year of her Reign (and when they were perhaps about 200,000<hi>l. per Annum</hi>)
appears in a Book of <hi>Mr. Christopher Verion</hi> an Exchequer man dedicated to
Sir <hi>Iohn Culpeper under Treasurer of his Majesties Exchequer, where 'tis said
that the Revenues of the Kings Lands now in charge before his Majesties Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
amounted in the whole to</hi> 100,000l. per Annum, <hi>and consisted then for
the most part of Fee-Farms and certain Rents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have before mentioned that <hi>she laid the Foundation of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
being here <hi>semper eadem:</hi> &amp; as in the Metropolis of <hi>Holland</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a House ordinarily costs as much as the superstructure, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceful
to the Crown did the Foundation of Protestancy by her prove: and
she needed not the Precaution in these words of St. <hi>Luke, For which of you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to build a Tower, sits not down first and counts the cost whether he hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficient
to finish it, lest happily after he hath laid the Foundation, and is not able to
finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</hi> saying, <hi>This man began to build
and was not able to finish.</hi> She laid the Foundation of our <hi>English</hi> Gospel so deep
in the Law of the Land, that (God be thanked) the Romanists have not been
able to mock it further then by calling it a <hi>Parliament-Religion,</hi> and by my
consent let them that way still <hi>mock on,</hi> and I shall mock at them who think
that any Religion but protestancy here will ever have a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and if Popery had not been a Parliamentary Religion here in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
dayes, her Reign had not (as I may say) been infamous by the occasion
of any <hi>Noble Army of Martyrs,</hi> nor the <hi>Eclipse,</hi> of Justice and Mercy, and
the <hi>English</hi> good nature in her vile <hi>Quinquennium</hi> been made an <hi>Epoche</hi> of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103047:152"/>
Horror in the <hi>English</hi> Story, as great <hi>Eclipses</hi> of old in <hi>Chronology,</hi> like
notches in the Line of Time for Mens Memories to fasten on, served as
dates of <hi>Epoches</hi> to measure it by; and setting aside some just ground of fear of
Poperies being here permitted by Heaven to be an <hi>Epidemical</hi> opinion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as a just Punishment of <hi>such</hi> defection from Morality, I think the fear
of the Kingdoms being Shipwrack't on it, and sustaining thereby such perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
as was in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> would be as much to be mocked as <hi>Shakespears</hi> Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the fear of the Writ <hi>De haretico comburendo</hi> grillading
any more Christians be as ridiculous as <hi>Lithgows</hi> mentioning in his <hi>Travels,</hi>
that in a hot Country he saw Geese roasted in and by the Sun.</p>
            <p>But <hi>My Lord</hi> (raillery apart) the Protestant Religion that before Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign was only like a <hi>Picture</hi> hanging on the Wall, and easie to
be removed without Fatal Prejudice to the Kingdom, hath since been so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into our Laws, and the heart of our Politicks, that like the old
<hi>Fresco</hi> Painting appearing on Walls and there wrought deeply in, it cannot
be removed but with the Wall it self: and whatever Popish <hi>Bishops</hi> or
<hi>Iudges</hi> any Prince of that persuasion may possibly hereafter appoint, they
must till some of our <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament can be Repeal'd, which declare
<hi>Popery</hi> to be against God's Law, give Judgment, that it is so; accordingly
as 'tis rationally resolved in <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Reports in the Case of <hi>Thomas Hill
vers. Thomas Good,</hi> where 'tis occasionally said, <hi>That if a Marriage be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by Act of Parliament to be against God's Law, we must admit it to be so,
for by a Law, that is, by an Act of Parliament it is so declared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing I am more ashamed of in many Protestants who pass
for first-rate ones, and carry not only swoln Sails of Profession of it but
<hi>Flaggs</hi> as Demagogues, then to see them as I said value themselves on
their excessive Fears of Papists and Popery. I would wish that such inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated
Protestants (if really they suffer that <hi>Passion,</hi> and are afraid of
the Fire of those <hi>Faggots,</hi> that they are more distant in nature from, then
from the heat of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> and talk after the Rate of the <hi>Martyr</hi> in his
Letter to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that they must prepare to hold out to the Fire <hi>Inclusive</hi>)
would not by their pittiful ill boding fears stain the Noble <hi>Prophecies</hi> of some
<hi>English</hi> Martyrs, when the Fire was kindled about them at the Stake. The
<hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> will tell them how at the Martyrdom of <hi>Ridley</hi> and
<hi>Latimer, That when a Faggot was kindled with fire and laid down at</hi> Ridleys
<hi>Feet,</hi> Latimer <hi>spake to him in these words, Be of good comfort Mr.</hi> Ridley,
<hi>and play the man; We shall this day light such a Candle in</hi> England, <hi>as I
trust shall never be put out.</hi> But what is somewhat more extraordinary and
which I remember not to have heard any one observe out of the <hi>Acts and
Monuments,</hi> is in the Relation of the Tryal of <hi>Roger Holland</hi> a Merchant-Taylor
of <hi>London,</hi> how Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> heard him say after the Sentence of
Condemnation was read, <hi>God hath heard the Prayer of his Servants which hath
been powred forth with Tears for his afflicted Saints, whom you daily persecute.
But this I dare be bold in God to speak, which by his Spirit I am moved to
say, that God will shorten your hand of Cruelty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For after this day in this
place shall there not be any by you put to the Tryal of Fire and Faggot:</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> saith, <hi>That after that day there never was one that suffered in</hi>
Smithfield <hi>for the Testimony of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Prophetic <hi>Impetus</hi> of <hi>George Sophocard</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Minister was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable (as <hi>Buchanan</hi> in his 15th <hi>Book</hi> of his History relates it) and
when the <hi>Cardinal</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> and his Train of Priests were Spectators
of the Tragedy of the <hi>Martyr,</hi> he fixed his eye on the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and said,
<hi>That the Cardinal who there gazeth on me with so much Pomp and Pride, within
a few days shall fall there with more Ignominy then he now sits with State, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103047:152"/>
so it fell out that the Cardinals Carcase was shortly dragged with infamy by that
very place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is somewhat natural for dying men, and perhaps for all unfortunate
men to offer at <hi>Prophecy.</hi> They who have good Cards dealt them in one
Game, trouble not themselves to Prophecy that they shall have either good
or bad ones in the next; and few who have sound minds in sound bodies
and with sound Estates, can tune their thoughts to Divination. But as I
would not rashly embrace, so neither would I trample on the Predictions of
Pious men in their last Agonies, and particularly of what they who
are Gods Witnesses or <hi>Martyrs</hi> Predict about the Cause of Religion: for it
is the Lot of Witnesses in any Cause, to be frequently entrusted with the
Secrets of it. But however the most raised Intenseness of Humane Nature
near its period in any men may tempt them to believe that the things they
wish to the World will have their certain Birth in it, yet whether
God doth then inspire them with the knowledg of Futurity I know not:
but know that the very Prediction of Future things from dying men of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
Fame, is according to natural Causes, an Engin in the hand of Fate
to bring the things predicted to an accomplishment. For it being sound
that Sagacious men on the Confines of Eternity have foretold any alterations
in the World, such as wish the same will think them first possible, and
then by degrees likely, and then by the next thought certain to come to
pass, and that therefore they are safe by Heavens Office of Ensurance that
their Embarquing in Designs to bring those things into practice will be
prosperous. However when we see those Martyrs both living in Story,
and their Predictions in Nature, and when our <hi>Martyrology</hi> hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us with what an Heroick Bravery their Souls flew up to Heaven
from the Flames, like the <hi>Eagles</hi> cut loose and Towring aloft from the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Piles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors as they were going to be made <hi>Divi,</hi>
can we be dispirited by dull fears and suppositions of Protestancy, and our
Laws loosing their Vigour, and be <hi>Proditors</hi> of the honour of out dying
<hi>Martyrs?</hi> I do rather both hope and believe that as dead mens Sculls do
serve to strengthen the heads and feet of the <hi>Epileptick</hi> living, that the ashes
of those <hi>Marian</hi> Martyrs will confirm the faltring paces of our weaker Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
from staggering into an excess of the fears of Popery.</p>
            <p>And as in the Hospitals of the mad it is often seen that an Hypochondriac
Person whom irrational fears and fancied dangers brought thither, is by a
real danger, imminent on his Family or Estate, frightning him into his
Senses led out from thence; such a Restoration of People to their Wits, do I
expect from the present and probable Future State of Christendom, and
that it will necessarily rescue us from unnecessary fears as likewise from all
Curiosities, that would imply our ingratitude to Heaven while we would il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally
mend our own Country after the example of other parts of the
World that is almost the only quiet part in it: and <hi>Propounders</hi> will I believe
every day grow more out of request who would make Earthquakes by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us of the danger of falling Skies. It may perhaps be rationally estimated
that the greatest part of mad men becomes such by extravagant <hi>Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and that the <hi>Quid si Coelum ruat</hi> is the Foundation of most <hi>Bedlams,</hi> and
likewise the subversion of most States by Intestine War, making them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
as much the <hi>Ludibrium</hi> of Fortune, as was the Story'd Fate of the <hi>two
Brothers</hi> killing one another on occasion, tho not of falling Skies, yet of
their imaginations travelling thither, and ones <hi>Supposition</hi> of his having
Pasture Ground as spacious as the Firmament, and the others of his having
as many Sheep as there were Stars there, and his demanding their being
pastured there, and fatally resenting its being denyed him.</p>

What a grave piece of madness is it in the common <hi>Writers</hi> of <hi>Politics</hi> to
make it a kind of Proverbial saying, as I find it used by <hi>Reinkingh</hi> in his
<hi>Tractatus de Regimine seculari &amp; ecclesiastico</hi> as well as by other dull Learned
<hi>Writers</hi> of <hi>Politics,</hi> namely, that a Prince may be resisted <hi>Si navem Reip. in quâ
ipse cum subditis navigat, perforare velit.</hi> 'Tis a degree of madness to suppose
it; and the like I thought of a <hi>Supposition</hi> in a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> printed not long
after our 41 <hi>Commotion,</hi> and called <hi>Observations on some of his Majesties late
Answers and Expresses,</hi> where in <hi>p.</hi> 4. 'tis gravely said, <hi>That if a Generalissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
should turn his Cannons upon his own Soldiers, they might disobey him,</hi> &amp;c.
or thus supposing with <hi>Gerson, That if the Pope goes to strike and box any one,</hi>
or with <hi>Alacius de Privileg.</hi> l. 1. c. 8. that if the <hi>Emperor doth so,</hi> that it is
lawful in such Case to lay violent hands on either of them, and thence
gravely to conclude <hi>that the Party so uncivilly and outragiously treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
thereby the Deputy and Lieutenant to nature, which is a common and
equal Soveraign to them all,</hi> as one Persons words of inference in this Case
are from those <hi>Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bodin</hi> doth therefore very wisely in his <hi>De Rep.</hi> check the affected wisdom
in a <hi>Venetian</hi> Edict against two <hi>Banditi</hi> who were <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and
offering the <hi>Son</hi> his Liberty and Estate if he would bring in his <hi>Fathers</hi> head:
and being angry with the <hi>supposition</hi> of such a things being done faith, <hi>That
'twere better that the whole City of</hi> Venice <hi>had been swallowed up by the Sea
then that it should have rewarded so detestable a Villany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is a madness for any to trouble the World by putting wanton im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
Cases, and extending the Gold of Reason to such a thinness that
will make it lose its weight and value.</p>
            <p>To an <hi>over subtle</hi> Case put, that blundering Answer of a Lawyer was good
enough, <hi>Non est ejusmodi casus dabilis.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> in his <hi>Behemoth</hi> doth to
the Question, <hi>What if my Prince should command me with my own hands to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
my Father, in case he should be condemned by the Law,</hi> answer well
enough, <hi>this is a Case that need not be put. We never have read or heard
of any King or Tyrant, so inhumane as to command it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will suppose better things of the Future State of <hi>England,</hi> then to
believe it will ever suffer such real madness and real dangers, as formerly
from <hi>Suppositions</hi> and <hi>Fictions,</hi> not of <hi>Law</hi> but of <hi>Injury,</hi> and when some
injurious <hi>Demagogues</hi> did often acquire both Popular Air and bread by
their but seeming to suppose what they seduced the people really to do,
and to be really thereby impoverished.</p>
            <p>When I think how some men by false Alarmes of suppositions, would
for the lengthening their Interests, lengthen the fears of any persons, and
among Mortal men make the dangers of Plots immortal, I call to mind that
'tis not very long ago that a Forraigner who was Physician to King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First, I mean Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne</hi> occasioned an Universal Out-cry of
the Disease of the <hi>Spleen</hi> here, and was observed in many Cases where the
Disease proceeded from the fowlness of the Stomach or other Causes, yet
to attribute it to that part of the Body which tho all <hi>Animals</hi> have yet most
if not all may live without, I mean the <hi>Spleen,</hi> but however he got his
Living thereby and so plentifully, that it may be said, that he (as it were)
<hi>made</hi> the <hi>Spleen,</hi> and the <hi>Spleen</hi> made him. And thus doth a <hi>Spleen</hi> of some
Popish Sham-Plots, and the continuance of the fears and danger from a true
one, <hi>make</hi> some persons perhaps who made the former and the continuance of
the fear of the latter: and such State Empyricks would be as much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished
by the utter abolishing of the same, as some of our great Merchants
who Trade in Companies and with Convoys, would be if there were no
<hi>Argeer;</hi> but as the swelling of the <hi>Spleen</hi> proves the emaciating of the other
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103047:153"/>
parts of the Body, so hath the swoln <hi>Spleen</hi> of the Popish-Plot, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not more enriched some Merchants that Traded therein, than it hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverished
the Kingdom in general, and I do believe that a Tax of a Million
of Money raised in <hi>England</hi> in the way before mentioned, would not have
been universally so heavy a burthen as the Popish-Plot in its Effects and
Consequences hath been.</p>
            <p>But what by the bravery of the <hi>English Genius</hi> to which (as was said)
the continuance of any sort of fear is unnatural, and despair which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
grows from Sloth and Cowardize appearing so dull a thing (hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature being apt easier to descend into it, than to ascend by
presumption) and what by Peoples being Convinced of the smallness of
the Papists numbers here comparatively, and of the ridiculousness of the
rumour'd greatness thereof in particular places, as for example, of there
being 60,000 <hi>Papists</hi> in St. <hi>Martins</hi> Parish, where there dying ordinarily
about 2000 in a <hi>Year,</hi> there cannot be judged to live 60000 Souls of Men,
Women, and Children, according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of 1 in 30 dying each year,
and what by the late great <hi>divulsion</hi> of the <hi>double bottom</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> appearing by his Decree of <hi>March</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> before mentioned,
(which makes all thinking People as much to expect its Shipwrack as do
the throngs of the <hi>Plebs</hi> resorting to the shore in Tempests expect the
Ruine of Navigating Vessels, and to look on <hi>Papisme</hi> as saying in effect to
<hi>Iesutisme, nec tecum, nec sine te</hi>) and what by the Notion so much in
<hi>Vogue</hi> and so likely to be more, that 'tis as improper to call some of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
of Popery by the Name of Religion, as 'twould be professedly to
mis-call any thing obvious, as for example, to call Musick the Art of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric,
or Grammar Logic, or to call Astronomy or Dyalling, by Surveying or
Gawging, and that 'tis only that that is <hi>Religion</hi> indeed, that is to be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured</hi>
(according to that expression in the Scripture, <hi>honour Widows that
are Widows indeed</hi>) and what by the urging Fate of Christendom now
so loudly as with the voice of Thunder repeating it to us, that <hi>this Nation
must either now be quiet, or that the World abroad can never be so,</hi> and that
the hand of this Realm must be steady, if ever it will keep the Ballance of
Christendom so, and what by the Nations having outlived all the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Symptomes of the Plague of its Fears, I think on the whole matter,
we may without any thing of the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and only from the
<hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> presage that the excessive fear of Popery as well as its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
will here be exterminated.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but the former as well as later experiences of the Papists here
concerning the Inconveniences of their Artifice of making or increasing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensions
in the Kingdom (the dividing of which by them as well as other
Religion-Traders hath prejudiced it more than the so much talk'd of <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Fleet</hi>) will in the present Conjuncture of Affairs incline the sober
Party of them to joyn with the Body of the People of <hi>England,</hi> in being
sharp Abhorrers of the Principles of the <hi>Iesuites:</hi> for they can hardly go
any where now in the Land without seeing a <hi>Cain</hi>'s Mark set on <hi>those who
cause divisions,</hi> or still drive the old Trade that the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Nobleman <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas
ab Habering field</hi> in his Detection of the Popish Practices mentions,
that Sir <hi>Toby Mathews, Maxwel</hi> and <hi>Reade</hi> those Jesuited Political Interlopers
did in the Reign of the Royal Martyr, namely, to mis-represent the Court
and the Puritans to one another, and to endeavour to perswade male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
People, that that Pious Prince designed their Slavery, a thing so
false that he was <hi>Reverâ</hi> their <hi>Martyr,</hi> as he with great Justice said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
on the Scaffold, and which great name he might challenge even on the
account of Natural Justice, if there had been nothing relating to reveal'd
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103047:154"/>
Religion in the case to entitle him to it: for <hi>St. Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was a
Martyr, and yet died for no Article of the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>It may be justly said that our Monarch fell a <hi>Martyr</hi> for the People, by
not violating the <hi>lex terrae,</hi> that he was by his Oath bound to maintain, and
by his therefore not owning the Jurisdiction of the Vile Court over him; and
moreover the Law of Nature obliging him indispensably to do nothing that
by his exemplary abdicating any Right Inherent in the Crown would have
incapacitated him and his Successors from protecting their Liege-People in
their Inheritance of the Laws, and it being a thing certain that the Law of
Nature is as much the Law of God, as is the Law positive or his written
Word (and indeed as <hi>Gataker</hi> saith well in his Book of <hi>Lots, The Law of
Nature written in Mans heart, is the very same so far forth as 'tis yet unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
with the Law of God, revealed in the Word</hi>) it may be with reason
averr'd, that any Member of Mankind whether Prince or Subject who is put
to death by any Court of Justice, or Armed Force, or by the hands of Russians
or <hi>Bravos,</hi> on the account of his discharging his Obligations to the Law of
Nature, may enter his just Claim to the Name of Martyrdom. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
supposing that <hi>Godfrey</hi> lost his life by vile hands for discharging with
Courage the Duty to his Prince, that the Law of Nature and of the Land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
from him, have given the Name of Martyrdom to his Fate, and I should
ascribe the same Name to any one that should suffer the same Fate by the hands
of any Ruffians that called themselves Protestants, for his asserting the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Law Established, and discountenancing the Doctrine of <hi>Resistance,</hi> and
the Principles that subvert the Right of the Inheritable <hi>English</hi> Monarchy,
and doing what he was by the Law of Nature and the Land obliged to,
for the asserting the one and discountenancing the other. Thus therefore
do I judge that Name due to the Dire Fate that the late <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of St.
<hi>Andrews</hi> sustained from the hands of those execrable Presbyterian <hi>Bravos,</hi>
who defiled their Land and the light of the Sun there with the open Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that Prelate.</p>
            <p>And supposing that the great <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who was so
abandoned by Heaven to little Fears on Earth, as when the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi>
was perswading him not to recall the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> to answer him thus, <hi>Give
me then security for my Life,</hi> did yet receive the doom of the <hi>Fearful</hi> in this
World for his continuing his Protection to his Protestant Subjects according
to the Laws of Nature, and of his Realm; I shall not deny the right that
the Nature of his Fate hath to be Crown'd with the Name of Martyrdom.
'Tis very possible that some wretched Protestants so call'd, may to the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of the Name of Religion design Out-rages and Sedition, and the late
Publications of many Seditious <hi>Pamphlets</hi> by them, and the Re-printing
of some of the most Rebellious ones that faced the Light in the times of
the Usurpation, (and for example of the <hi>Political Catechism,</hi> and of <hi>the
Rights of the Kingdom,</hi> in which latter the Murder of the King is justified,
and the Right of the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy struck through the 5th Ribb, by
the Authors making it Elective) hath given the Government a just Alarm
of the designs of the Publishers of such Pamphlets and of their Abettors,
and they serve among Men of Caurion as a suspicious sign of some mischief
intended by them, as the extraordinary Commotion of the Waters is to
Whale-fishers, an indication of a Whale approaching, and from such as well
as from some of the Emissary Slaves of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> here, what can any who
act with the highest zeal in their several Capacities to assert the Rights of the
Crown and Church expect but according to the Stile of <hi>Cicero</hi> against <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taline,
Nisi ut notent &amp; designent oculis ad caedem unumquemque nostrum.</hi> But
as to any who for the just discharge of their Natural Obligation and Duty,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103047:154"/>
as Magistrates or private persons shall suffer the worst of Fates, I shall not
deny the name of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> so neither shall I think him worthy the name
of an <hi>English</hi> man, or a Regarder of the Divine Natural Law, who doth
not if a Magistrate by the due Execution of the Laws, or if a private person
and of Signal parts and Learning by his discourse and writing notifie the
absurdities and inconveniences of any Seditious Principles chargeable, on
any perswasion of Religion whatsoever, every Subject being under Moral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
duly to represent to the <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and to his Brethren Subjects
the dangers imminent over them by any destructive Principles or Practices,
whatever disguise of Religion the same may assume; and it is most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the most generous dispositions that can be in men who own the love
of their Country, with Monuments of Praise to honour the Memories of
those <hi>Heroic</hi> Persons who were so unnaturally dealt with for asserting the
Rights of the God of Nature, and thus fell its Noble Victimes, and who in
the Race of their Lives were Agonists for it, and to resemble the Justice of
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> among whom those that died for their Country were
proverbially said, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and were Crown'd with <hi>Olive</hi> and other
Branches, and with Praises Extoll'd to the Skies: and to this Custom probably
the words of the <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have a reference, where he saith to
<hi>Timothy, <gap reason="foreign">

and <hi>St. Paul</hi> sutably was but just to himself, when writing to <hi>Timothy, I
am ready to be offered up,</hi> &amp;c. he added, <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> &amp;c.
And thus too may our Royal <hi>Martyr</hi> be said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how great an <hi>Agonist</hi> and <hi>Confessor</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was, and how
often she was designed for Martyrdom by some of her Romish <hi>Antagonists,</hi>
the <hi>Londoners</hi> were but just to her, when adorning their Churches with
the figure of her Monument they placed over her <hi>Effigies,</hi> the Inscription
of, <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as the old Agonistical Games were among the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi>
instituted in honour of their Gods, and as critical seasons for their shewing
their love to their Country by their then making Leagues and agreeing
on the great Concerns of Peace and War, and Men, then in various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of the Body and Mind shewed their utmost Abilities, so doth the
Divine Natural and Positive Law oblige all Christians in any Conjuncture
or Season of Colluctation between true and false Religionary Principles, to
shew their Athletic Habits of mind in the most consummate manner, <hi>and

made it their chief business but in one thing to resemble one of the old Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistic

annointed with Oyl to strengthen themselves, did then that they might the
better lay hold on one another, and might not slip out of each others hands,
<hi>Se mutuo pulvere sive arenâ aspergere, ac propemodum faedare,</hi> a thing too many
among us have done outright, and thereby shewed themselves not to be so
much as <hi>almost Christians,</hi> and a <hi>ridiculing</hi> humour of throwing dirt that
the <hi>Colluctations</hi> about the Land on the <hi>Continent</hi> of Christendom, will I
believe <hi>ridicule</hi> out of our World at least, and unteach us the turpitude of

            </p>
            <p>And as the more ingenuous and true sober part of the people, is now
moved with pity to <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> for being led away by the Nose from
our Churches by the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (a thing that Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> himself affirms in his

is one constant design of</hi> Satan <hi>in the variety of ways of Religion, he
hath set on foot by Iesuites among us</hi>) and doth the more pity them for that
some well meaning persons among them who were blindfolded into some of
their Nonconformity by <hi>Iesuitic</hi> Emissaries, had not heretofore their Eyes
opened to see that the same persons were often Sollicitors with Magistrates,
to do their duty and put the Laws in due Execution against them for their
Nonconformity, and that such Emissaries had thereby an occasion of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them according to the Style of the <hi>Chief Priests,</hi> after they had
blind-folded our Saviour, and then smote him, <hi>Prophecy who is he that
smote thee?</hi> and for that such well meaning persons have been observed at
the same time to importune the Almighty, <hi>That he would open the Eyes of
Kings and Princes,</hi> so hath it likewise general resentments of Scorn and
Anger against the Principles of those <hi>bantring</hi> Popish Seducers, who as they
have some Emissaries here to kill Souls and others probably ready on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to kill bodies, have distended the Doctrine of Popery abroad in the
World to such an excess of Cruelty that no man can Calculate the number
of Gods it hath made, or of men it hath destroyed; and I hope that such <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited</hi>
Emissaries will in time generally appear not only hateful but ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to our Papists themselves: for who indeed can choose but laugh at the
discussing or deliberating of the <hi>Question</hi> in p. 98. <hi>Of the Mystery of Iesuitisme,</hi>
viz. <hi>Whether the Iesuites may kill the Iansenists?</hi> So very hateful are their
Principles to some of our ingenuous <hi>English</hi> Papists, that I have heard a Great
and <hi>Noble</hi> Person mention it with Contentment, that some of that Order of
<hi>False Prophets</hi> were since the Popish Plot executed for it, tho yet he doubted
of the Veracity of the Witnesses against them. I very much differ'd in my
Judgment from that of that Noble Person, and would have no man dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
in the least for the greatest Crime, but by Witnesses greater than
all exception, and do account it easier to give Heaven an occount
of Mercy than Justice: but yet on the recollecting of my thoughts I
have found it so incident to humane nature to delight by ill Witnesses to
punish the avowers of false Religionary Principles, that I have read it among
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103047:155"/>
some <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Observators of the Customs of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that they anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
allowed of false Witnesses against false Prophets, and of whose being
such the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> did cognosce, and so they impiously reputing <hi>Christ</hi>
to be such, did barefaced bring forth false Witnesses against him, and he
could not be allow'd to except against their Persons but only against their say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as discordant: and to this purpose we find it in the Gospel of St. <hi>Mathew,
Ch. 26. Vers. 59, 60. Now the Chief Priests and Elders and all the Council sought
false Witnesses against Iesus to put him to death, but found none: yea tho many
false Witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false Witnesses,</hi>
and in <hi>St. Mark, Ch. 14. V.</hi> 56. and 59. 'tis declared how the Testimony of the
<hi>False Witnesses</hi> agreed not together. I have mentioned this as not in the
least intending to reflect on the testimony of any one Witness ever produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in behalf of the Crown in any Criminal Cause in any age of time,
and do think that according to the saying that <hi>defensio non est deneganda
Diabolo,</hi> and that as a railing Accusation is not to be brought against the
Devil, so much less ought a false Testimony. And I am moreover in any
Point relating to the safety of Princes Lives, and when there are exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Parties in a Kingdom, criminating and recriminating each other about
the same, inclined to do what is fairly to be done to support the Credit of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
considering (as the Observation is) that as he who is bound to the
King, his Bond is good for nothing to any one else, so he that during such
a Conjuncture is a Witness for the King is liable to so many Volleys of Dirt
from some one of the inraged Parties, and to have all the particular exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and extravagances of his Life so display'd, as to endanger his Testimonies
usefulness in other cases. But yet if any Magistrate finds the Testimony of
Witnesses he would support to be insupportable, and doth not believe them
to be <hi>fide digni,</hi> he is obliged Morally to avow such his Sentiment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
when he is legally put upon it.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot pretermit an occasion of mentioning your Lordships
great Courage and Justice in an Affair that my Correspondent writ to me
of, namely, that when some Witnesses had in the House of Lords been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
about a Popish Plot in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the Vote of every one in
that House was given for the reallity of that Plot except your Lordships,
you entered your dissent as not believing any such Plot in <hi>Ireland</hi> as was by
the Witnesses sworn, which was certainly most worthy of your Lordship to do,
if you thought not the Witnesses worthy of your belief, and your Caution in
your so judging, that the Papists in <hi>Ireland</hi> designed not such a Plot to be
Executed in that Kingdom, was the more remarkable in regard that 'twas
some time since published in a large Pamphlet of <hi>the Growth of Popery,</hi> that
the <hi>Irish</hi> Plot was a thing contrived only to divert and hound us away from
the pursuit and Examination of the <hi>English</hi> one. And yet the same Witnesses
(as I was inform'd) obtain'd that belief from a Loyal and Honourable
House of Commons concerning the <hi>Irish</hi> Plot, that caused the Vote of its
reallity to pass with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi> there.</p>
            <p>What Fautors of false Testimony the Jesuites principles are, I have shewn,
and at the same time afforded my Testimony to the Heroic Vertue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and think it great and pedantical kind
of Injustice to charge all Lay-Papists with a readiness to obey their
Priests Commands by being ministerial in Cruelty to Protestants. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I have read it in a printed <hi>Speech</hi> of Sir <hi>Audly Mervin</hi> the <hi>Speaker</hi>
of the House of Commons in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a <hi>Speech</hi> glowing with anger enough
against the <hi>Papists,</hi> where yet 'tis said p. 24. <hi>In the Barony of</hi> Enishoan
<hi>there are above two thousand</hi> Irish <hi>Papists can bring hundreds of Protestants
to witness their Civil demeanor through the whole course of the distemper in
this Kingdom.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:103047:156"/>
And as the bloody Sect of the <hi>Zealots</hi> grew at last so odious among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and another Order of such <hi>sicarii</hi> among the <hi>Turks,</hi> so I suppose that
of the Jesuites will naturally do among Christians, and the Jesuites writ <hi>de
haeretico Assassinando,</hi> grow obsolete, and especially in places where the
Scene of Mr. <hi>Coleman's Northern Heresie</hi> lies, it being an old observation
that <hi>Northern</hi> Countries are more hospitable and less cruel, than <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the very time of the dawn of Learning ushering in that of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
it presently grew odious to the first-rate <hi>Ingeniosi</hi> to draw Heretics
blood. Our Famous Countryman <hi>Tunstal</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> (who had
imbibed so much of the Mathematical Sciences, that <hi>Vossus de Scientiis
Mathematicis</hi> saith p. 40. <hi>Ante annos Centum &amp; quod excurrit, magnâ cum
laude praecipue ob sermonem purum, &amp; perspicuum de arte supputandi egit
Cutbertus Tunstallus,</hi> and whose Book of <hi>Arithmetick</hi> writ with such pure
Latinity is commonly extant) was of such a temper that (as <hi>Fuller</hi> tells us
in his <hi>Church History</hi>) the <hi>Bishopric of</hi> Durham <hi>had halcyon days of Peace
and Quiet under God and good</hi> Cutbert Tunstal <hi>the Bishop thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> of whom 'tis said, that 'twas writ on his Tomb, that
he was <hi>furibus haereticis<expan>

Blood: and in his <hi>Chapter</hi> there <hi>concerning the Religions in Vtopia,</hi> he
makes <hi>divers kinds of Religion not only in sundry parts of the Island, but also
in divers places of every City, some worshipping the Sun and some the Moon,
and some other of the Planets, and the wisest of them worshipping God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and some embracing the Faith of Christ at first without the help of a
Priesthood, and minding to choose a Bishop among themselves, without sending
out of their own Country for the Order of Priesthood,</hi> and makes them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting
none to or from the Christian Religion. And that that <hi>Book</hi> of
his may rather be thought an Original of his Mind than a mere Copy of
his Countenance, we have the Suffrage of Dr. <hi>Danne</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
where having said, <hi>That Sir</hi> Thomas Moor <hi>was a man of the most tender
and delicate Conscience that the World hath seen since St.</hi> Austin, and citing
of his <hi>Vtopia.</hi> l 2. c. <hi>de servis,</hi> he saith, <hi>He was not likely to write there any
thing in jest mischievously interpretable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if a man would quote things of <hi>Erasmus</hi> his great Humanity to all

led him from any brutal ferity toward <hi>Heretics,</hi> your Lordship will see by
this passage in his <hi>Supput. error. Bedae. Dic ecclesiae, quod si non audierit sit

            <p>Our Martyrologist Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> could not have expressed more anger against
a Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> than <hi>Erasmus</hi> a Papist hath here against Popish Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Prelates. Had <hi>Erasmus</hi> then known of one practice enjoyn'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
by the <hi>Canons</hi> to Popish Bishops at their Condemning of Heretics,
to <hi>salve</hi> the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of their <hi>irregularity</hi> by intermedling in <hi>Causâ san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis</hi>
(and about which your Lordship shewed me once some remarkable
quotations in a <hi>Letter</hi> writ to you by the Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and of
which quotations I beg a Copy from you by the first opportunity) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>efficaciter &amp; excorde,</hi> to intercede with the secular Judge to whom they
deliver the Heretic over, <hi>to bring no pain of death or mutilation of member
to him,</hi> I believe the great Wit of <hi>Erasmus</hi> would after his ingenious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
aforesaid of the <hi>Tragedy</hi> of the Condemned Heretic, pleasantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
himself and Posterity with the wanton cruelty of that <hi>Farce</hi> that
ensued it, and let us see how the Popish Bishop then using the Speech fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
to some Tooth drawers just before their operation, <hi>I will do you no
harm and put you to little or no pain,</hi> did at the same time make use of the
power of the secular Magistrate, but as the Linnen Clout or Silk to wrap and
hide the tormenting Pincers of Holy-Church in.</p>
            <p>But to return to my observation of all Popish Canonists themselves, not
allowing that wanton mode of the cruel usage and interceding with the
Magistrate, <hi>Efficaciter &amp; ex corde,</hi> to do the Condemned Heretic no harm,
I think the same quotations mention how the famous <hi>Panormitan</hi> did brand
the Hypocrisie of that Practice: and the truth is, 'tis very abominable that
Heretics neither living nor dying, can be free from suffering <hi>Shammes</hi>
by some Papists.</p>
            <p>But again on the other hand 'tis with Justice to be said, that some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
whose names the Age riseth up to, for their great advancement of
real Learning, I mean <hi>Peiresk, Descartes, Gassendus, Mersennus,</hi> had as much
tenderness for any differing in judgment from them as Protestants can have:
and that mighty hunter after knowledg <hi>Peiresk</hi> was so far from eagerness
in pursuing the blood of Heretics, that being one of the Judges for Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Causes in <hi>France,</hi> he would always come off the Bench when Sentence
of death was to be given, though against the most outragious Murderer,
and he always carried in his mind a charity large enough to embrace the
whole World, and maintain'd a constant Correspondence with <hi>Salmasius,
Causabon</hi> and other Protestants, and did put <hi>Grotius</hi> on the writing his <hi>De
jure belli &amp; pacis,</hi> that hath taught more Civility to Nations than the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Papal Christianity hath done, and who hath there so perfectly manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Secular Magistrates from being obliged implicitly to execute the
Sentences of Ecclesiastic Judges, that he hath there asserted it <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 26.
§. 4. <hi>Quin probabile est etiam Carnifici qui damnatum occisurus est hoc tenus
aut quaestioni &amp; actis inter fuerit aut ex rei confessione cognita esse debere
causae merita ut satis ei constet mortem ab eo commeritam: idque nonnullis in
locis observatur, nec aliud spectat lex Hebraea cum ad lapidandum eum qui
damnatus est testes vult prodire populo.</hi> Deut. 17.</p>
            <p>By the 7th <hi>Verse</hi> of that <hi>Chapter the hands of the Witnesses were
to be first on him to put him to death,</hi> which Law no doubt had the
effect of a <hi>Caveat</hi> with men against their <hi>ambitus</hi> of the standing
Office of Witnesses by tacking thereunto the standing Office of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.</p>
            <p>Moreover both common observation and Cursory looking into Books,
and indeed common sense will teach us that the Papal Principles do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103047:157"/>
men at once to fence against Heretics lives, and against impossibilities,
nor to endanger themselves by fighting with the <hi>Wind-mills</hi> in Heretics
Brains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That great</hi> Cardinal D' Ossat <hi>whom I have so often here cited, and who
was so renown'd for his probity as well as comprehensive knowledg of
matters of State, doth in the 86th</hi> Letter <hi>that is to</hi> Villeroy <hi>in the</hi> Year 1597.
<hi>give him an account of his discourse with the</hi> Pope <hi>on the occasion of his
Holyness angrily resenting</hi> Harry <hi>the 4ths observing the</hi> Edict <hi>of pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that</hi> D' Ossat <hi>thereupon said,</hi> That it was necessary for the Peace
of <hi>France</hi> that the Edict should be observ'd: that for want of such an Edict
<hi>France</hi> had not been quiet for 35 years. That the Date of the Edict, 1577.
shewed 'twas not the present King, but the late King 12 years before his death
that made it, that the late King and King <hi>Charles</hi> his Predecessor and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
did not make such Edicts of Pacification with their good liking and
frankly, but were constrain'd to it by necessity, even for the good of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Religion, and the Realm after having found that many Wars made by
Heretics served for nothing but in many places to abolish the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and in a manner all Ecclesiastical Discipline, Iustice and order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And that besides that necessity hath no Law in whatever Subject and Matter
it be, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath taught us in his Gospel to tolerate the Chaff in our
Fields, when there was danger of plucking up with it and spoyling the good
Corn: that other Catholick Princes used so to do, whom none spoke ill of
for it. That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> as great a Zealot as he makes himself for the
Catholic Religion doth tolerate Heretics in their Religion, in the three Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of <hi>Italy,</hi> of which he is Lord. That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> did as much not
only in the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden</hi> but of <hi>Poland:</hi> that all the Princes of the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and who are Celebrated for being Pillars of the Catholic
Church, did as much not only in the Towns of the Empire, but also in their
own proper Estates, as in <hi>Austria</hi> it self from whence they take their Name, in
<hi>Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, Stiria, Carinthia,</hi> and <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atia.</hi>
That <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th Father of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was he that
taught the King of <hi>France</hi> and other Princes to yield to such a necessity by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>Interim</hi> (that every one knows) even after his having Conquered
the Protestants of <hi>Germany.</hi> That his Son the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at this day
who is reputed to be Archi-Catholic, and to uphold the Catholic Religion as
<hi>Atlas</hi> doth the Heavens, doth yet tolerate in his Kingdoms of <hi>Valencia</hi> and
<hi>Granada</hi> the <hi>Moors</hi> with their Mahumetanisme, and hath caused to be offered
to the Heretics of <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Heretics in the Low-Countries,
the free exercise of their pretended Religion, if they will for the
future acknowledge and obey him, <hi>&amp;c. And concludes his discourse to the
Pope saying,</hi> That the Kings ablest Counsellors were of opinion that if his
Holyness saw things so near as the King did, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> was to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>France</hi> in the State the Realm was at present, his Holyness would not
in this point do less than the King did. <hi>To all which</hi> D' Ossat <hi>saith,</hi> The
<hi>Pope</hi> made no reply.</p>
            <p>And I think it may with parity of reason be affirmed, that if the <hi>Pope</hi>
himself were to Command <hi>England</hi> in the State it is in at present, he
would be no hammer of Heretics so as to knock any one of them on the
head.</p>
            <p>I know that after the date of that Letter, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1597. of <hi>D' Ossat</hi>'s
last mentioned, the various Revolutions in Christendom made the Scene of
the toleration of Heterodoxy in those Countries to be altered with a Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
for six years after the death of <hi>D' Ossat, viz.</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1610.
King <hi>Phillip</hi> the 3d of <hi>Spain</hi> made an Edict for the exterminating the <hi>Moors</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:103047:157"/>
with their Mahumetatisme out of his Realms, and which was executed with
great Cruelty; and the <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Vtrecht</hi> entered by the Provinces in 1579,
and the blow given to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in 1588,
and the Patronage the United Provinces had from her and the kindness they
found from <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th of <hi>France,</hi> made his Conditional offers of favour to
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Heretics not thank-worthy, but even at this very day, tho in the
Low-Countries both of the United and <hi>Spanish</hi> Provinces there is a certain
reciprocal liberty for the Papists in the Dominions of the States, and for the
Protestants in the Dominions of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet is the liberty not equal: for
in the United Provinces the States allow the Papists a certain number of
Priests to officiate among them <hi>in sacris,</hi> which is done by an express Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
But in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominions there is no such Concession, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
who there privately officiate among Protestants do it at their peril.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Year 1599. Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> expelled the <hi>Lutherans</hi> out
out of his Provinces: and in <hi>Austria, Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> and all the heritable
Lands of the House of <hi>Austria, Franconia, Bavaria,</hi> and the upper <hi>Palatinate,</hi>
no Protestants are permitted to have the publick Exercise of their Religion:
and the Effects of the Emperor's Persecuting the Protestants of <hi>Hungary</hi> the
World knows and feels, and have with horror gazed on the Protestants of
<hi>Transylvania</hi> putting themselves under the Protection of the <hi>Turk,</hi> that they
might enjoy their Profession of Christianity. And how the <hi>Bohemians</hi> were
treated by a Jesuited Emperor twenty years after 1579 I have spoken, when
I gave an account of the Jesuites Emblem painted on the Arms of <hi>Austria,</hi>
viz. <hi>I have practiced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> practiced nothing of Cruelty to his Heretical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the <hi>Valleys</hi> about the time 1597, those poor Protestants may under
God thank their old friend <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th, who in the year 1600 took almost
his whole Country, after his having been before in a Contest with him by
way of demand for the <hi>Marquisat</hi> of <hi>Salusses,</hi> and his having applied to the
Pope to interpose therein, the Emperor having likewise demanded that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisat</hi>
in Right of the Empire; and while that Duke was in fear of being flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Pope and Emperor, and <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th, 'tis no wonder if he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Heretical Subjects to graze or sleep in whole Skins in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Valleys of <hi>Piemont;</hi> but in the year 1655 there ran in those Valleys such
a torrent of Protestant blood as did bear away all the dire Examples of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
before it that History could shew, as appears out of <hi>Sir</hi> Samuel More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
<hi>History of the Churches in those Valleys,</hi> and <hi>Book</hi> 4th, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. where
in his <hi>Audience Speech</hi> as Envoy to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the behalf of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
in those Valleys, on that sad occasion, he saith, <hi>Si reviviscant omnes

            <p>And as for the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> the fear of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Power then
gave the Prince there no leisure to attend squabbles about Heresy and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics:
and as for the interest he had in <hi>Sweden,</hi> which too in the year 1599,
had a Popish King (as <hi>Sandys</hi> saith in his <hi>Europae Speculum</hi> that year writ)
yet were the Papists there then (as he saith) few, and consequently the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics
too many to be persecuted.</p>
            <p>The very <hi>Interim</hi> spoke of by <hi>D' Ossat,</hi> or <hi>Formula inter-Religionis</hi> as 'twas
called, was a double bottom of Popery and Protestancy, and nothing was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be its Fate but Divulsion. <hi>Alsted</hi> in his Chronology mentions its
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103047:158"/>
Date with the words of <hi>Infaelix partus,</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Constance</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they would embark in that double bottom, threw themselves
overboard into the Sea of the Power of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> and
Brother of <hi>Charles,</hi> who soon used them not as their <hi>Protector,</hi> but their
Conqueror: and 'tis notorious that the <hi>Interim</hi> was professedly designed to
continue only till the Council of <hi>Trents</hi> determinations were ended, and 'tis
likewise as notorious that that Council was called designedly and <hi>reverâ</hi> for
the <hi>exterminium</hi> of Heretics; and its being called <hi>ad restituendos collapsos ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesiae
mores,</hi> was but <hi>umbrage</hi> and <hi>shamme.</hi> And what Quarter Heretics were
to expect from the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Spirit, Father <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us in his History,
<hi>p.</hi> 693, and that as to the year 1563. <hi>Advice came to</hi> Rome <hi>that the King of</hi>
France <hi>had made a Peace with the Hugonots, the particular Conditions being
not known of yet: And the Pope thinking it proceeded from some Prelates, who
tho they did not openly declare themselves to be Protestants, yet did follow
that Party, he resolved to discover them, and was wont to say he was wronged
more by the Masqued Heretics then by the bare-faced. Whereupon the last
of</hi> March <hi>he gave order that the Cardinals who governed the Inquisition
should proceed against them. The Cardinal of</hi> Pisa <hi>answering that there was
need of proper and special Authority, the Pope ordain'd that a new Bull
should be made which was dated the 7th of</hi> April, <hi>and contained in Substance
that the Pope being Vicar of Christ, to whom he hath recommended the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Sheep, and to reduce those that wander, and to bridle with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Penalties those who cannot be gain'd by Admonitions, he hath not since the
beginning of his Assumption omitted to execute this Charge, notwithstanding
some Bishops are not only fallen into Heretical Errors but do also favour other
Heretics opposing the faith. For Provision wherein he commands the general
Inquisitors of</hi> Rome <hi>to whom he hath formerly commended this business
to proceed against such, tho Bishops and Cardinals inhabiting in places
where the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Sect is Potent, with Power to cite them to</hi> Rome
<hi>by Edict, or to the Confines of the Church to appear personally, or if they will
not appear, to proceed to Sentence, which he will pronounce in private Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
The Cardinals in Conformity to the Popes Commands cited by Edict to
appear personally at <hi>Rome,</hi> to purge themselves from imputation of Heresie,
and of being favourers of Heretics, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Aix,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and other <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Holyness it seems thought that Cardinal and the Arch-Bishop and the
Bishops to be <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> and has given an example to some
<hi>Furiosi</hi> among Protestants thus to miscal some of the better sort of
them.</p>
            <p>In fine that which I aim at by referring to these Historical Passages is
this, to shew that some of the very Grandees of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hold
Principles in Religion that allow indulgence to the persons of Heretics. I
have instanced how <hi>D' Ossat</hi> in the Popes presence was a Confessor for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in this kind, and spake like a skillful <hi>Divine</hi> when he said, <hi>That
Christ hath taught us in his Gospel to tolerate the Chaff in our Fields, when
there was danger of plucking up with it, and spoyling the good Corn:</hi> and
<hi>Theophylact</hi> on that place tells us, that by Tares are meant <hi>Heretics.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be unknown to men of great thought among the Papists, that
the sanguinary usage of Heretics, hath much encreased their number, not
perhaps will it be denyed by the Critical Judges of things in the Papal
World, what was by one of our <hi>beaus esprits</hi> and great States-men, I mean
the Lord Viscount <hi>Falkland</hi> observed in Print, <hi>That the Massacre in</hi> France
<hi>made more Protestants in one night than all</hi> Calvins <hi>Works have done since
their first publication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:103047:158"/>
According to that Observation, <hi>That nothing surfeits soner than man's
flesh,</hi> 'tis but natural to suppose that the Papal World must be surfeited with
it at last. And indeed the experience Popish Polititians have had of their
success by <hi>dividing</hi> us formerly (as was said) would tempt them to omit
other courses and to persist still in that if it were not now generally seen
through.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>in viridi observantiâ</hi> how our Famous great Usurper <hi>Cromwel</hi> who
founded his Dominion in pretended Grace or Religion, and was afraid of
Thunder from every Cloud of Enthusiasme he saw over his head, and
was awed likewise by the Serene and Rational Religion of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> had no other Game to play in order to the dividing the several
Religionary Parties but by in some manner tolerating all according to the
Mode of <hi>Iulians</hi> Politics.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> were the first who miscalled any of our <hi>English</hi> Princes by
the name of <hi>Iulian,</hi> and that they did in the Case of King <hi>Iames</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in his Learned <hi>Apology for the Oath of Allegiance</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1609.
where being much concerned for his being so termed (and that too by
no meaner a man then <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) he doth with great strength there
largely prove that that name was congruous (as his words are) <hi>in no point
save one, that is, that</hi> Julian <hi>was an Emperor and I a King:</hi> and indeed
'tis a very impotent humour of Calumny in any Protestant to call any one
an <hi>Apostate</hi> or especially the Apostate, merely for the alteration of his
Judgment in some controvertible points of Faith between Papists and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and which are denominable by the name of Religion; and 'tis a
great folly to cherish immoderate fears that any <hi>English</hi> Prince who possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
may happen in such Controvertible Points to change his perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Religion, will if a Papist attempt <hi>á la Iulian</hi> to plant Divisions
among his Subjects by the Instrument of Religion, for that their being
kept undivided and all of a piece will be essential to the life of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as the State of Christendom is likely to continue; nor is it probable
that any such Prince can ever think in the single course of his life to make
this Nation all of a piece or united under the perswasion of Popery. For if
any one would suppose it possible that in the Reigns of three or four Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Princes of that perswasion, the nature of things might be so far
forced as that Millions of men might by artifice be made to abandon a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Religion, and one that is framed to support the Government, for
one that is not so, such one Prince must be supposed to have acquired the
gift of long life that <hi>Ante-diluvian</hi> Patriarchs had, and to extend the Span
of his life to that of three or four Princes. It is a known Rule relating to
<hi>Mathematics, That there is no reconciling time and force,</hi> and he who
would have one man do as much as four, must allow him to be as long a
doing it as four one after another.</p>
            <p>But the surviving <hi>Experts</hi> have seen too much of the effects of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all Civil and Ecclesiastical Polity by a Protestant Usurper, ever to wish
for another in any Case, and to have the ballance of Christendom again
broken, and the Kingdom be again divided to preserve his Families interest
and to keep that entire, which is notorious to have happen'd under the
aforesaid Usurper both of Religion and the Kingdom: and the name of
<hi>Iulian</hi> is most properly applicable to him or any Protestant Usurper,
and who will be necessitated to follow him in his Track of Politics: and
the notion of which <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus lib.</hi> 22. set us right in, where
he shews that <hi>Iulian,</hi> that he might weaken the Power of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion which he feared, knew no way so easie as to endeavour to do
it by it self, and therefore recall'd the Bishops banish'd by <hi>Constantius,</hi> and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103047:159"/>
gave them and the People leave to be Christians tho himself was a Heathen,
<hi>Nullas infestas hominibus bestias ut sunt sibi ferales plerique Christianorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus,</hi>
i. e. because he had never found Beasts so cruel to one another as
he had most Christians, and therefore as he travelled through <hi>Palaestine,</hi>
cryed out, <hi>O Marcomanni, O Quadi, O Sarmatae, tandem alios vobis inquietiores
inveni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the Usurper promote the Animosities among Religionary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and was enforced thereby to weaken the Kingdom to strengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
some indulgence he shewed to Congregations where Divines of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> worship God in the way of its Church, yet permitting
none to have Benefices but such as were of the Presbyterian perswasion ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
and among such and the Independants he distributed his Donatives
of preferment in the Universities, and he took care that no form of Church
Discipline or particular Church might preponderate by his being a Member
therein. He made some Lay-men and some Divines differing in Judgment
about Presbytery and Independency to be <hi>Tryers</hi> of Ministers fitness for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
and Commissioned many ignorant Lay-men in the several Counties
to be Judges of the sufficiency of Ministers, for their continuing in Livings.
The press was open to all unlearned Wranglers about Religion. Many of
his Military Preferments he placed on <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and did suffer many of
the <hi>Fifth-Monarthy</hi> Religionaries to disturb the <hi>Apocolypse</hi> and the World
thereby, gave freedom to <hi>Muggleton</hi> the Impostor to set up for a Prophet,
and <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>two Witnesses,</hi> and was a particular Patron to <hi>Manasseth ben
Israel,</hi> and in treaty with him here to introduce the <hi>Iews,</hi> and tolerated
<hi>Biddels</hi> Congregated Church of <hi>Socinians,</hi> further likewise so far giving an
occasion to Mr. <hi>Marvels</hi> Writing a Book then of <hi>the Growth of Popery,</hi> that
Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> called, <hi>A true and perfect Narrative of what was done,</hi> &amp;c.
Printed in the Year 1659. saith in p. 57th, <hi>That Sir</hi> Kenelm Digby <hi>was his
particular Favourite, and lodged by him at</hi> White-hall, <hi>that</hi> Maurice Conry
<hi>Provincial of the Franciscans in</hi> England, <hi>and other Priests had his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
under Hand and Seal, and that he suspended Penal Laws and Executions
against Popish Priests and Iesuites, tho sometimes taken in their Pontificali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
at Mass, and were soon after released, and that he endeavoured to stop
the Bill against Papists the very Morning he was to pass it, by his</hi> White-hall-<hi>Instruments,
who moved its suspension for a time, as not suting with the then
present Forraign Correspondencies, against whom it was carried by 88 Votes,
that it should be sent up with the rest then passed, and that he writ to</hi> Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
<hi>to excuse his passing that Bill as being carried on by a violent Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Party much against his Will, and that yet it should not hurt them tho
passed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And I suppose an Author more profound in his Observations than Mr.
<hi>Pryn,</hi> doth in a Loyal Pamphlet Printed in the <hi>Year 1656. Called a Letter
from a true and lawful Member of Parliament,</hi> &amp;c (and generally conceived
to be writ by the late Lord <hi>Hollis</hi>) there in <hi>p.</hi> 58. and the following

and transforming themselves into several shapes among the divided Sects
here, and saith, <hi>What liberty the Priests and Iesuites take, how far they prevail
on the People, what Countenance they receive from this Government is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
enough by not proceeding against them in Iustice, as if no Laws were in
force for their punishment. Your private Negotiations with the Pope and your

sufficiently known and understood: and of their dependance upon and devotion to

Romish Priest, and dedicated to your Favourite Sir</hi> Kenelm Digby, <hi>Entitled,</hi>

ought to be so far from performing any promise or observing any Oath that you

albeit they foreseeing all that you now see, did therefore bind you by Oath not
to do it, and that you offend both against your Oath and Fidelity to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

distrust of the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation was Treating to bring over a Body of
<hi>Swiss</hi> to serve him as the <hi>Ianisaries</hi> do the <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Declaration</hi> here referred to was <hi>Cromwels</hi> Declaration of <hi>October
31, Anno</hi> 1655, and which was supposed to have been worded by his
Lord Keeper <hi>Fiennes,</hi> wherein all the measures of Justice toward the
Cavaliers, and particularly the Public Faith of the Parliament, for the
punctual and exact performance of Articles with them after the vast gain
that had accrued to the Parliament by their <hi>Compositions,</hi> and an <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Oblivion</hi> afterward granted to the <hi>Royal</hi> Party, are avowedly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
and in <hi>p.</hi> 36. of that <hi>Declaration,</hi> 'tis said, <hi>If the Supreme Magistrate
were tyed up to the ordinary Rules and had not liberty to proceed upon the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations
of reason, against those who are continually suspected, there would
be wanting in such a State, the means of Common Safety,</hi> &amp;c. and before in
<hi>p.</hi> 12, and 13. the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are out-done as to the <hi>keeping of no faith with
Heretics,</hi> by the asserting in effect in general, that <hi>nulla fides est servanda,</hi>
and the humour of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th is Repeated, who as the Author of
the <hi>History</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> tells us, declared it in the <hi>Consistory,
That 'twas Heresie to say the Pope can bind himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we are assured out of Mr. <hi>Peter Walsh</hi> his <hi>History and Vindication of
the</hi> Irish <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> that <hi>Edmund Reilly</hi> the titular Popish <hi>Primate</hi> of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> who at a public Dinner boasted that he never had been friend or
well wisher to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>two Brothers</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> did
yet write <hi>Precepts</hi> under his <hi>Seal</hi> to all the Province of <hi>Armagh</hi> to pray for
the Health, Establishment, and Prosperity of <hi>Cromwell</hi> Protector and his
Government.</p>
            <p>More need not be said of the danger of Popery and Arbitrary Power
to the Nation, if God and man had not hindered <hi>Lamberts</hi> Usurpation
over it. I have mention'd how some of the <hi>Plot-Winesses</hi> have deposed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
thereof: and some of his Countrymen have in discourse affirm'd
his having been there a <hi>Fautor</hi> of Papists: and my self observing it to a
worthy Gentleman of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> that one of the Popish <hi>Lords</hi> in the Tower
did in <hi>February</hi> 1662, pass a Grant from the Crown of several Mannors
in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> forfeited by the Attainder of <hi>Iohn Lambert,</hi> he averr'd to me
that <hi>Lamberts</hi> Son enjoys that Estate at this day. It had been just for the
Almighty to have punished the extravagance of the Fears and Jealousies that
Reigned in the time of the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> about his not being a Protestant
(a Character of Religion he had constantly own'd in the view of the
World, both by his publick <hi>Devotions</hi> and <hi>Alliances,</hi> and particularly that
with <hi>Holland</hi> which chiefly his Zeal for that Religion made him to ensure
by the Marriage of his Daughter with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the time
that the War between the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and the States was depending)
by permitting a private Gentleman whose name perhaps had not come to
public knowledg but for the figure he made in illegal Arms, so far to march
with his Religion undiscern'd through the Quarters of all the gathered
Churches and the Classical ones too, that he <hi>deceived</hi> in that point so many
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103047:160"/>
that called themselves <hi>the very Elect,</hi> and who were as well vers'd in the
business of all Religions as <hi>Iews</hi> are in Coines and in the way of adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, and who after that Religion had always been the <hi>Staple</hi> Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of <hi>England</hi> as much as Wooll, did almost nothing else but Weave and Dye
and Tenter the same with all subtilty of Art possible to them: and as the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
marched out of <hi>Egypt</hi> without the farewel of a <hi>Dogs</hi> barking at them,
we were then near the point of being driven back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to Civil and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Slavery without the least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arm given us by any of our best and deep
mouth'd Dogs against Popery. But the extreme danger to Protestancy
from that intended Usurpation hath been long since over; nor do I expect
that any fatality of that kind can ever happen to it from any Prince of the
Right Line, how much a Papist soever he may be, that is to say, from one
who was swathed with the Laws in his Cradle, and will be Circumscribed
with them in his Crown.</p>
            <p>According to that great severe truth I observed before of the fate of the
<hi>ten Tribes,</hi> after they had made a defection from the Line of <hi>David,</hi> that
they were punished with a Succession of 10 Kings, and not one 'good one in
the whole Pack, and their falling at last as a Prey to Forraigners, it was the
Lot of <hi>England</hi> justly to suffer what has been here described, from various
Governments and Governors for its defection from the Royal Line, and the
experience of our disastrous past Calamities must needs convince all men of
serious thought and sense, that we can have no Usurper how true a Religion
soever he may own, but will be false to the Interest of the Nation, and that
particularly by diving it, and thereby as much <hi>depretiating</hi> it in the view
of all Christendom, as a great <hi>Diamond</hi> would be if cut in two: for tho
<hi>Diamonds</hi> or <hi>Pearles</hi> be equal and like in their Figures, Waters, Colours,
and Evenness, yet if they differ in their Weights and Magnitudes, those are
the Roots of their Prices, and a Diamond of <hi>Decuple</hi> weight is of <hi>Centuple</hi>
value.</p>
            <p>I therefore think the Kings Loyal long <hi>Parliament</hi> did consult the public
Security when in the great Act of the Test they enjoyn'd the taking the
Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and thereby the laying on the <hi>takers</hi>
an Obligation to the Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> that was to outlast the

            <p>Of the Obligation to the Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> arising from those
Oaths, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> in his <hi>Concordia Discors,</hi> Printed in the <hi>Year</hi> 1659. hath
writ usefully: but because since the time of the late <hi>fermentation,</hi> many

relating to a Popish Successor, and none that I have heard of has professedly
writ of the Casuistical Part thereof, and particularly with relation to those
<hi>Oaths,</hi> and because I have heard that in some discourse about the same in
some good Company where the Obligation by those <hi>Oaths</hi> to the Kings Heirs
in point of Conscience hath been asserted, some good men have been blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
but of their apprehending the same, by mistaking the saying in the
<hi>Civil-Law,</hi> that <hi>nemo est haeres viventis,</hi> and likewise some things obvious
in the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and I did fear that it might thence grow a common and
vulgar error that there is no such Obligation resulting from those Oaths,
and that as a Supine neglect of the use of means to find the true sence of
the same, would be very culpable, so that a serious and dispassionate repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the same would to all men that regard the weight of an Oath, be
very acceptable, I have with as much recollection of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And indeed as I should not think I dealt candidly with any person of
the Popish perswasion if I should be severe to him, before I had a Moral
Certainty of his having imbibed any of the Principles imputable to
Popery, that may be called unmoral or inhumane, so it would especially
seem to me somewhat like the <hi>drawing on a naked man,</hi> for a Protestant at
this time to write for the devesting any Popish Prince of his legal Property,
when few or no Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> either do, or dare, for
fear of offending the Pope, draw their pens for the preservation of such
his property, without respect to any Religionary Tenets he may
hold.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Pope</hi> did to obstruct King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Succession, I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and what favour any Protestant Prince can hope for from the Holy See,
may appear out of <hi>D' Ossat</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Villeroy</hi> in the <hi>Year 1598. Book</hi> 4th,
where having spoke of the Artifices used to the Pope to make him believe,
that if <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th recovered the <hi>Marquisate</hi> of <hi>Salusium,</hi> it would be
Commanded by <hi>Hugonots,</hi> he thereupon adviseth the King to declare the
Contrary to the Pope and adds, <hi>I would not interpose to write this to you, if
I did not know that the Pope and all this Court hold that to maintain the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Religion in a Country, and to preserve it from Heresie, his Holyness
may and ought to deprive the true Lord and Possessor of it, and give it away
to any other who hath no property therein, and who shall be more able and
willing there to preserve the Catholic Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I met with some passages lately in a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> that concerned the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi>
where the <hi>Author</hi> having liberally descanted on the words <hi>Heirs</hi>
and <hi>Successors,</hi> in the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> saith, <hi>as I will not
take up Arms without the Kings Commission, nor enter into any Association to
commence in his life time against his Consent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so any one by whom or for
whom any resignation of his Majesties Power shall be extorted shall not reign
over me:</hi> and there was another very course expression there applyed to a
very fine Person, and one so every way truly great that every Age doth not
produce <hi>viz. That the House of Commons conned little thanks to</hi> George <hi>Earl
of</hi> Hallifax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but according to the licence of Speech used by that <hi>Author,</hi>
I shall venture to declare that where ever I have a Suffrage in the Choice
of a Parliament-man, if any Candidate shall tell me that he served in the place
before and was for an <hi>Exclusion Bill,</hi> rather then the Kings Offers, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
advising with his Country would have any one of the Royal Line Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from his Title to the Throne, on the account of any Religionary
Tenet (for our <hi>English</hi> Antiquities afford Footsteps of Parliament-men
on some weighty matters, consulting their Towns or Counties that chose
them) such a one if I can help it, shall never represent me: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
he who doth not with acknowledgments of Honour and Gratitude to
the Earl of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> mention that <hi>Bill</hi> that he brought into the House of
Lords, in order to the extermination of Popery, that I spake of before,
and with it lodged in our Statute Book, that man if I can help it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
represent me.</p>
            <p>I am not so rash in my efforts against Future time as perhaps that Author
was, and can cite a great <hi>Name</hi> for the reasonableness of <hi>Representatives</hi>
advising with those they represent in matters of great moment to the State,
and to this purpose the Lord Viscount <hi>Fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>land</hi> Secretary of State, in a
Printed Draught of a <hi>Speech</hi> concerning <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> &amp;c. saith p. 4. <hi>Mr.
Speaker, Tho we are trusted by those that sent us in Cases wherein their
opinions were unknown, yet truely if I knew the opinion of the Major part of
my Town, I doubt whether 'twere the intention of those that trusted me that
I should follow my own opinion against theirs,</hi> and thereupon his Lordship ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103047:161"/>
the House of Commons not to do any thing against <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
and at least to stay till the next <hi>Session,</hi> and consult more particularly
with their Electors about it. And if according to the example of that
great man any of our Contenders against <hi>Popery</hi> had thought fit to consult
with those they represented, about the meeting those Royal and Frank
offers with hearty embraces, they would perhaps have found the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of those they represented, zealous for their so doing: and if they that
perhaps with a well intended Gallantry of Courage and scorn of Popery,
threw out the <hi>Bills</hi> that came from the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1677, should
ask those they represented if they do not now wish those Bills had then
passed into Laws, I believe they would say, they did: and if they were
asked whether that Bill I mentioned before that was brought in by the Earl
of <hi>Hallifax</hi> had not likewise passed into a Law, I believe they would wish
it had.</p>
            <p>I presume not to inveigh against any of our late Loyal <hi>Parliaments</hi> whatever
slips in Politics were by any there made, or Arbitrary Votes there passed
against particular Persons, and am as impatient when I hear any inveigh
against our Representatives who in the contention of Popery exerted all the
strength of the faculties of their minds what ever errors they fell into, as
I should be if I heard any Principal speak unkindly of his Second, who
contending for him in <hi>loco lubrico,</hi> or fencing on the Ice did slip, and shall
be as apt as any to wish and hope that now such have consulted with their
Country as the <hi>Agonothetae,</hi> and know their opinions better then formerly,
that they will take other measures; and especially when they see the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State of Christendom importuning us to be quiet more then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and thus in the old <hi>Agnonistic</hi> Games many of the <hi>lapsi athletae</hi> came to
be Crown'd. The <hi>Rule</hi> in those <hi>Games</hi> was that the Agonists were to make
three Attaques on each other, and he that did slip or go back in the first
and second, if yet he overcame in the third On-set was lawfully Crown'd,
and <hi>good luck</hi> (say I) <hi>have they with their honour,</hi> who having an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of a third Assault against Popery, shall out-do not only others but
themselves: and I have the Charity to believe that what the great <hi>Athletae</hi>
did in the Exclusion Bill was thought lawful by them, and that they
thought therein they did not <hi>transilire metas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis but with Justice that the generality of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
seem as <hi>Agonothetae</hi> to have judged of the temper of our Prince in this
Religionary <hi>Certamen:</hi> and I believe whatever time can cause, that yet
among all composed and sedate Minds, his Majesties deportment in the
late Conjuncture will never happen to be forgot, and particularly his
<hi>wrestling</hi> with his Parliaments (as I may say) by several Gracious Offers
and Messages relating to the security of the Protestant Religion, and to
the making of <hi>English</hi> Men everlasting <hi>Comprehensors</hi> of the same. He
notified it to them by the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> on <hi>March</hi> the 11th 78. <hi>That this
is the time to secure Religion at home and strengthen it from abroad, by
strengthening the Interests of all the Protestants in</hi> Europe, <hi>&amp;c. The results
of this Council seem to be decisive of the fate of this Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And I must confess I wish that <hi>tempus acceptabile</hi> (as I call'd it before)
had been accepted of, that great Critical <hi>Moment</hi> of time when the curious
needed no intelligence from that Oracular States-man of the measures taken
abroad to extirpate Protestancy, and when its Enemies in some Countries
thought they had the <hi>life</hi> of that Religion as sure within their gripe as he
had that of the <hi>Bird,</hi> when out-braving the <hi>Oracle,</hi> he ask'd if the Bird
in the hand were dead or alive, and when all his Majesties real <hi>acceptable</hi>
offers were thus reiterated to all the noble Contenders, and offered like the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103047:161"/>
               <hi>water of life</hi> to prevent their fainting in their Race, and that <hi>without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and without Price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because his Majesties Title hath appear'd as due to his <hi>Agonists</hi>
Crown as to his Inheritable Royal one, for having in the several <hi>periods</hi> of
his life at home and abroad <hi>contended</hi> so <hi>earnestly</hi> for the Protestant <hi>Faith,</hi>
and purchased an immunity from Envy it self (and that according to the
right of that <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Code,</hi> that restrains the obtaining of <hi>Immunities</hi>
only to such a one who hath striven <hi>per omnem aetatem, cum coaevis,</hi> and
hath to the <hi>Athlotletae</hi> given proof of his valour from his youth, and who
hath at least <hi>in tribus agonibus</hi> been Conqueror) I think the rather that
a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi> is laid up for him both in time and in eternity for his
preserving the property of his <hi>Line,</hi> in some of those his earnest <hi>Messages</hi>
aforesaid, and for that he did not by the infringing the Legal Rights of
that (as I may say) <hi>transilire lineas,</hi> or by doing any thing of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
whereof he doubted and much more of the Injustice whereof he was fully
convinced.</p>
            <p>As the figure of a Crown must be entire, so must every good Action
consist of entire Causes that is to be rewarded with it: and any Prince
who doth deliberate of the doing a thing in it self unjust has need of the
<hi>Caution</hi> given to the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church in <hi>Philadelphia, hold fast that
which thou hast, that no Man take away thy Crown:</hi> and indeed for a Monarch
to do an Act of Injustice is a greater misfortune to him than to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the latter being but the evil of punishment, and the former of sin. I
reading lately in <hi>Klockius de aerario</hi> was ashamed to see the 41. <hi>Summari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
of <hi>Chap.</hi> 109th, <hi>Book</hi> 2d, to be this, <hi>viz. A Iustitiâ licite in parvis sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde
variariut in majoribus inviolata sit:</hi> and ashamed to find in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Tacitus</hi> quoted by him for it, and saying, <hi>Habet aliquid ex iniquo omne
magnum exemplum,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> cited for saying, <hi>A justitia in parvis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
nonnunquam abeas, si salvam eam voles in magnis.</hi> But honest <hi>Cicero</hi>
tells us better things, and that, <hi>Nihil honestum esse potest quod justitiâ va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat;</hi>
and the Christian Morallity I am sure prohibits the doing of one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Act, tho the effect of it would be the restoring the whole Creation
<hi>in integrum</hi> to its first State in Paradice, and it enjoyns the fortitude of <hi>not
fearing those that kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul,</hi> as our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi>
words are in <hi>St. Math.</hi> 10. 28. and where he doth not say, <hi>fear not those
that can kill the Body,</hi> but who do actually and frequently kill the Body:
<hi>but are not able to kill the Soul,</hi> implying that unjust men often labour
to do that, and would do it if they could, and their cursed sollicitude
therein is not capable of being practised more then by endeavouring to
prevail on Men by fear of imminent bodily danger to warp from principles
of Justice, and the Scripture doth annex <hi>the Crown of Life</hi> to the condition
of being <hi>faithful unto death,</hi> and to not <hi>fearing the things to be suffered,</hi> as
'tis said in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. the <hi>ominous</hi> Text Preached on at the <hi>Coronation</hi> of
the Royal <hi>Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is a saying that <hi>Must is for the King,</hi> so <hi>he that Rules over Men
must be just, ruling in the fear of God,</hi> as part of the last words of King
<hi>David</hi> assures us, and must not by fear of Man do any unjust thing that
would imply his intermitting the filial fear of Heaven, which is justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by being abandon'd to the Servile Fear of Man, and to that <hi>fear
bringing a Snare</hi> (as that <hi>Kings</hi> Son hath in his <hi>Proverbs</hi> told us) and
when otherwise he might have made his own wrath <hi>as the roaring of a Lion
as</hi> Solomons <hi>words are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis when exact Justice is as it should be fixed in the Firmament of a
Princes Mind, that its brightness is above being Ecclipsed by any popular
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103047:162"/>
temptations or fears, that it resembles the fixt Stars whose great height
dazles the eyes of gazers and which Stars cannot be eclipsed by the shaddow
of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>The Populace and their Multitudes and Commotions are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
frequently compared to <hi>water</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> and like that, they are apt to
be eating towards the Roots of the Powers of Soveraigns; but while the
Mountains of their Power are bottom'd on Natural Justice, all the preying of
the Sea of the People there makes but the promontory more surely guarded,
and appear more majestic as well as be more inaccessible. And of this Sea
of the Peoples as I would wish every Prince in the just observance of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Laws of his Country to espouse the Interest as much as the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> doth his <hi>Adriatic,</hi> yet should I see one for fear of Popular Envy or
Obloquy forbearing to administer <hi>Iustice,</hi> and to follow the real last Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of his practical understanding rightly informed and servily giving up
himself to obey any mens pretended ones, I should think it to be as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
a Madness as <hi>Hydrophoby,</hi> or fear of water, on the biting of a
Mad Dog; and while a Sovereign observes the immutable Principles of
Justice, he may acquiesce in the results of Providence, and expect that the
<hi>troubling of the waters</hi> may be like that of the <hi>Angel</hi> before the time of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or a Conjuncture of the Peoples being possessed of healing Principles:
and in fine, a King when he finds the Waters of Popular Discontent more
tumultuous by Religionary Parties as <hi>two Seas</hi> meeting, as for example,
Papists and Presbyterians, he may depend on his being near Land, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always near where two Seas meet: and let every Prince be assured that
'tis not only <hi>Popery</hi> but <hi>Atheisme</hi> in <hi>Masquerade</hi> to do an unjust Act to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know that it hath been incident to some good men to strain pretences
beyond the nature of things for justice Causes of War abroad in the World
to advance the Protestant Religion. And thus in the last Age, the Crown
and Populace of</hi> England <hi>being</hi> clutter'd <hi>with the Affair of the</hi> Palatinate,
<hi>the Prince Palatine had here many well-wishers to his Title for the</hi> Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian
<hi>Crown: and</hi> Rushworth <hi>tells us in his</hi> 1st Vol. Ann. 1619. That he
being Elected King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> craved Advice of his Father in Law the
King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> touching the acceptation of that Royal Dignity:
and that when this Affair was debated in the Kings Council, Arch-Bishop
<hi>Abbot</hi> whose infirmity would not suffer him to be present at the Consultation,
wrote his mind to Sir <hi>R. Nauton</hi> the Kings Secretary, <hi>viz.</hi> That God had
set up this Prince his Majesties Son in Law as a Mark of Honour throughout
all Christendome to propagate the Gospel, and protect the Oppressed. That
for his own part he dares not but give advice to follow where God leads, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the work of God in this and that of <hi>Hungary:</hi> that by the P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ece
and Peece the Kings of the Earth that gave their power to the Beast shall leave
the Whore, and make her desolate, that he was satisfied in Conscience that the
<hi>Bohemians</hi> had just Cause to reject that Proud and Bloody Man who had taken
a Course to make that Kingdom not Elective in taking it by Donation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>&amp;c. And concludes,</hi> Let all our Spirits be gathered up to animate this
Business, that the World may take notice that we are awake when God
calls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rushworth</hi> saith, that King <hi>Iames</hi> disavowed the Act of his accepting that
Crown, and would never grace his Son in Law with the Style of his new
Dignity.</p>
            <p>And in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firsts time, in the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> relating to
the Royal Family, the Prayer runs <hi>for</hi> Frederick <hi>Prince</hi> Palatine <hi>of the</hi>
Rhine, <hi>and the Lady</hi> Elizabeth <hi>his Wife:</hi> yet in the Assemblies <hi>Directory</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:103047:162"/>
afterward as to the Prayer for the Royal Family, that Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is
Styled <hi>Queen of</hi> Bohemia.</p>
            <p>But our Princes not being satisfied, it seems that the <hi>Palatine</hi> of the
<hi>Rhine</hi> had a just Title to the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Crown, thought it not just for them
to assert it.</p>
            <p>However, that Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> the <hi>Achilles</hi> of the Protestants here
in his Generation, thought that the <hi>English</hi> Crown ought to descend in its
true <hi>Line</hi> of Succession whatever profession of Religion any Member
thereof should own, appears out of Mr. <hi>Pryns Introduction to the History of
the Arch Bishop of</hi> Canterburies <hi>Tryal,</hi> where having in <hi>p.</hi> 3. mentioned
the <hi>Articles</hi> sent by King <hi>Iames</hi> to his Embassador in <hi>Spain</hi> in order to the

            <p>The <hi>Demagogues</hi> of the old long Parliament who made such loud Out-cries
of the danger of Popery here and of their strenuous endeavours to

the right of any Heir to the Crown for the being a Papist. <hi>The exact
Collections</hi> afford many instances of their declaring, <hi>That they would provide
for the greatness of his Majesty and his Royal Posterity in future times,</hi> and in
which there was no <hi>Proviso</hi> respecting any Religionary Tenets they should

               <hi>It appears in Mr.</hi> Pryns <hi>memorable</hi> Speech <hi>in that</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Commons <hi>on</hi>
Monday <hi>the</hi> 4th <hi>of</hi> December, 1648. touching the Kings answers to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of both Houses, whether they were satisfactory or not in the Isle <hi>of</hi> Wight
<hi>Treaty, that that Parliament that was concern'd for the saving of their own
Credit as well as the Souls of the People to make that Treaty to end with
the extermination of Popery from</hi> England, <hi>did not in the application of the
most proper means for that purpose, judge the debarring any</hi> Popish <hi>Prince
here from his Inheritance of the Crown any proper, or necessary one.
For in</hi> p. 58. <hi>of that</hi> Speech '<hi>tis said,</hi> As to any danger to our Church from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
there is as good Security and Provision granted us by the King, as we
did or could desire even in our own terms. <hi>First,</hi> He hath fully consented to pass
an Act for the more effectual disabling of Iesuites, Papists and Popish Recusants
from disturbing the State and deluding the Laws, and for the prescribing of a
new Oath for the more speedy discovery and Conviction of Recusants. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
To an Act of Parliament for the Education of the Children of Papists by
Protestants in the Protestant Religion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To an Act for the due Levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Penalties against Recusants, and disposing of them as both Houses shall
appoint. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To an Act whereby the practices of the Papists against
the State may be prevented, the Laws against them duely executed, and a
stricter Course taken to prevent the saying or hearing of Mass in the Court or
any other part of the Kingdom: whereby it is made Treason for any Priests to
say Mass in the Court or Queens own Chappel. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To an Act for abolishing
all Innovations, Popish Superstitions, Ceremonies, Altars, Rayles, Crucifixes, Images,
Pictures, Copes, Crosses, Surplices, Vestments, bowings at the name of <hi>Jesus</hi> or toward
the Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By all which Acts added to our former Laws against Recusants, I
dare affirm we have far better Provision and Security against Papists, Iesuites,
Popish Recusants, <hi>&amp;c</hi> for our Churches and Religions Safety and States too,
then any Protestant Church, State and Kingdom whatsoever: so as we need not
fear any future danger from Papists or Popery if we be careful to see those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
duely put in Execution, when turned into Acts, and our former
Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And afterward in that</hi> Speech <hi>p. 110. he shews how dear the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to pass</hi> five <hi>such</hi> Acts <hi>cost him: for saith he,</hi> The Iesuites understanding
that the King beyond and contrary to their expectation hath granted all or most
of our propositions in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and fully condescended to five new Bills
for the Extirpation of Mass, Popery and Popish Innovations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and putting all Laws in Execution against them, and for a speedier Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Conviction of them then formerly, <hi>&amp;c</hi> are so inraged with the King and
so inexorably incensed against him (as I am credibly informed) that now they
are mad against him and thirst for nothing but his Blood.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> had mentioned in that <hi>Speech</hi> before, that some Jesuites and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited
Agitators had engaged the Army to dissolve that Treaty with the
King: and 'tis no wonder if that prying <hi>Order</hi> who knew the Kings
Aversion to Popery, as well as the most stupid of his Enemies did when
they saw him consenting to pass <hi>five</hi> such <hi>Bills,</hi> was the more brisk in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
its Designs against him, and that as Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> saith in his <hi>perfect Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi>
a Priest present at the Kings death flourished his Sword with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
<hi>That now the greatest Enemy we had in the World was gone.</hi> But
this by the way. I had not mentioned how dear the consenting to those
Bills that would have been so fatal to Popery and have prevented the
<hi>Phrase</hi> of its <hi>growth</hi> from being used at this time of day, but that some
persons not vers'd in the passages of those evil days, seem to think that
there was nothing of Religion to support that Kings Title to <hi>Martyrdom,</hi>
but what concern'd his Adhesion to Episcopacy and its Revenue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:103047:163"/>
In the very <hi>solemn League and Covenant</hi> its takers declared, <hi>they had before
their Eyes the honour and happiness of the Kings Majesty and his Posterity.</hi>
And I have seen a printed paper of the Presbyterian <hi>Divines</hi> of one of the
<hi>Associations</hi> in the late times, wherein they do expresly affirm and argue it
that any of the Royal Posterity here ought not to be debarr'd from their
Hereditary Right to the Crown, by being either Papists or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we look so far back as the great Conjuncture in the beginning of King</hi>
Iames'<hi>s Reign, namely in the year 1605. we shall find that there was
then a Paper before mentioned published in Print called a</hi> Protestation of the
Kings Supremacy made by the <hi>Nonconforming Ministers which were sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
or deprived that year, and that the first</hi> Paragraph <hi>or</hi> Tenet <hi>in
that</hi> Protestation <hi>is this,</hi> We hold and maintain the same Authority and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
in all Causes and over all Persons Civil and Ecclesiastical, granted by
Statute to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and expressed and declared in the Book of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements
and Injunctions and in Master <hi>Bilson</hi> against the Iesuites, to be
due in full and ample manner (without any limitation or qualification) to the
King and his Heirs and Successors for ever, <hi>&amp;c. And the</hi> 4<hi>th</hi> Paragraph <hi>in
that</hi> Protestation (<hi>part whereof I have before recited) is,</hi> viz. We hold
that though the Kings of this Realm were no Members of the Church but very
Infidels, yea and Persecutors of the Truth, that yet those Churches that shall
be gathered together within these Dominions, ought to acknowledge and yield
the same Supremacy to them. And that the same is not tyed to their Faith
and Christianity, but to their very Crown, from which no Subject or Subjects
have power to separate or disjoyn it. <hi>And in the</hi> 18<hi>th</hi> Paragraph <hi>they say,
That</hi> if the King subjecting himself to Spiritual Guides and Governors shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
refuse to be governed and guided by them, according to the Word of
God, and living in notorious sin without repentance, shall willfully contemn and
despise all their Holy and Religious Censures, that then these Governors are to
refuse to Administer the Holy Things of God to him and to leave him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
ond to the secret Iudgment of God, and wholy to resign and give over that
spiritual Charge and Tuition over him, which by calling from God and the
King they did undertake. And more then this they may not do. And after
all this we hold that he still retaineth and ought to retain entirely and solidly,
all that aforesaid Supreme Power and Authority over the Churches of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
in as ample a manner as if he were the most Christian Prince in the
World.</p>
            <p>If therefore any shall think it reasonable to pronounce that the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Interest of Protestancy, and of the Kingdom doth <hi>Stare moribus antiquis
virisque,</hi> I have pointed them to Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> to Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi>
the Antagonist to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (under the weight of whose Arguments
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> fell in the <hi>Certamen</hi>) and to others of our old <hi>Counsellors</hi> of
State, and particularly <hi>Arthur</hi> Baron <hi>Chichester</hi> of <hi>Belfast,</hi> Lord Treasurer
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> your Lordships Noble <hi>God-Father,</hi> (in comparison of many of
whom when we look on some of our great <hi>Politic</hi> and <hi>Protestant-would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be's</hi>
of this Age, and who would let none be Protestants but themselves,
we may well cry out, <hi>In qualem paulatim fluximus urbem</hi>) and have shewn
how those great <hi>Confessors</hi> by their Overt Acts provided against the belief
of the Doctrine of Popery, without the barring any of the Royal Line
from the inheriting the Crown. And when I see some of our (till of
late) unheard of <hi>Statists</hi> so eager to dispossess the Land of the <hi>Evil Spirit</hi>
of Popery by illegal means, and the use of the great Name of <hi>Protestancy</hi>
as a <hi>Spell,</hi> I fancy to my self that they may be call'd on by it, as the <hi>Iewish
Exorcits</hi> were in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who <hi>taking on them to call over
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103047:164"/>
them which had evil Spirits, the Name of the Lord Iesus, saying we adjure
you by Iesus whom</hi> Paul <hi>preacheth, the evil Spirit answered and said,</hi> Jesus
<hi>I know, and</hi> Paul <hi>I know, but who are ye?</hi> Thus to any who shall say that
there is no way possible to secure <hi>English</hi> Mens continuing Protestants,
but by breaking in on the Succession in the Right Line, may it be returned
by Popery, the old Protestants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> I know, and the
old <hi>Nonconformist Protestants,</hi> and the old <hi>Covenanting</hi> Presbyterian Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<hi>I know,</hi> who knew otherwise to secure Protestancy, and likewise
the <hi>French</hi> Protestants <hi>I know,</hi> who never practised any Out-rage against
the Great <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th of <hi>France's</hi> Government after he had left Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
<hi>but who are ye?</hi> The truth is, the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> so vastly
numerous in his time (which any one may imagine, who considers that
the most careful thinking men in that Realm make them now to be two
<hi>Millions,</hi> and that a judicious <hi>French</hi> Author hath writ, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
have lately computed them to be above a <hi>Million</hi> and a half) have shewn
the World a great example of their Protestant Loyalty in that they were
ready as chearfully to obey their Prince when he was a Papist, as when
they served him in <hi>set</hi> Battles against the Power of the <hi>holy League,</hi> and
the majority of his Nobles, and of his <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and of the chief Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
in his Realm.</p>
            <p>After they saw him go to <hi>Mass,</hi> they never call'd him <hi>Iulian,</hi> or <hi>Lampoon'd</hi>
him in <hi>Hymns,</hi> or <hi>demurred to his Beard,</hi> or had any fears or jealousies
of his touching a hair of their heads, nor threatned him that the <hi>Galilean</hi>
would foil him: and no Language could have more truly expressed their
Sentiments then that of the Famous <hi>Pierre du Moulin</hi> in his <hi>defence of the
Faith, Nous sommes prests d' exposer nos vies pour la defence de nos Rois,
contre qui que ce soit, fust-il de nostre Religion. Quiconque feroit autrement,
ne defendroit point la Religion, mais serviroit son ambition, &amp; attireroit un
grand blame sur la verite de l' evangile.</hi> i. e. <hi>We are ready to expose our
lives for the defence of our Kings against whomsoever it be, although of our
own Religion. And whosoever should do otherwise, should not defend Religion,
but serve his own ambition, and would draw a great reproach on the truth of
the Gospel.</hi> Considering the indeleble Character of <hi>Hary</hi> the 4<hi>ths</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Good Nature, his Subjects of that Religion did prepare their thoughts
to be <hi>Lachrymists</hi> for <hi>him,</hi> rather then <hi>themselves,</hi> and knew that by his
Coversion to Popery, <hi>if in this life only he had hopes, he was of all men most
miserable,</hi> and that his absolution left him only in the State of a Crown'd
Victime.</p>
            <p>I have before mentioned the <hi>Apology</hi> for that <hi>Scholar</hi> of the Jesuites <hi>Iohn
Chastel,</hi> which endeavours to prove that <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> was by that
Assassin not only wounded <hi>very fairly</hi> according to the <hi>Language</hi> of the
<hi>Brothers of the Blade,</hi> but in the <hi>Style</hi> of their Honour according to the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> Morals very heroically, and as the <hi>Contents</hi> of <hi>Cap. 1. Part.</hi> 3<hi>d,</hi> of
the <hi>Apology</hi> expresses it, <hi>Actus Castelli heroicus est in substantiâ

not simply on the power of the Keys so to do, <hi>and in fine, makes the

<hi>Answer</hi> was made to the same by the <hi>Vice-Chancellor and Doctors, and
Proctors, and Heads of Houses in the Vniversity of Oxford,</hi> and printed in
the <hi>Year</hi> 1604.</p>
            <p>Methinks a <hi>Humble</hi> Petition with a <hi>thousand</hi> hands is a kind of <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio
in adjecto.</hi> But the <hi>Vniversity</hi> in their <hi>Animadversions</hi> on the <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
do observe that the two contrary Factions of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> did
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103047:165"/>
shew themselves by their Petitions discontented with the present State and
Ecclesiastical Government. They mention particulars as parallels wherein
their <hi>Petitions</hi> agreed and resemble them to <hi>Samsons Foxes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I had occasion before to mention to your Lordship the</hi> Supplication of
the Papists to King <hi>James, that was Contemporary with that of the</hi> Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
<hi>and printed too in the same year; and tho I remember not any of
our</hi> Historians <hi>to have given the World an account of that memorable Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
yet the Impartial</hi> Thuanus <hi>doth it: and in</hi> Book 135. <hi>and on the</hi>
Year 1605. <hi>going to relate the</hi> History <hi>of the</hi> Gun-powder <hi>Treason, he saith,</hi>
Ad libellum supplicem pro libertate Conscientiarum à Majorum Religioni ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictis

            <p>
               <hi>And as to the</hi> Puritans <hi>Petition to King</hi> Iames, The Resolution of the
Lords <hi>and likewise of the</hi> Iudges <hi>assembled in Star-Chamber shortly
after, doth I think refer to it in the</hi> 3d §. <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it was an offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
punishable and what punishment they deserved, who framed Petitions and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
a Multitude of Hands thereto to prefer to the King in a publick Cause, as
the Puritans had done with an intimation to the King that if he denied the Suit,
many thousands of his Subjects would be discontented, where to all the Iustices an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that it was an offence finable at discretion and very near Treason and Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the punishment, for they tended to the raising of Sedition and Rebellion, and
discontent among the People, to which resolution all the Lords declared that
some of the Puritans had raised a false rumour of the King how he intended to
grant a toleration to Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Lords severally declared how the
King was discontented with the said false rumour, and had made but the day
before a Protestation to them that he never intended and would spend the last
drop of Blood before he would do it.</p>
            <p>I remember not in the <hi>Millenary</hi> Petition any such expression as the
insolent intimation, that <hi>thousands would be discontented if it were not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
but do on the occasion of this ruffianly way of petitioning by Papists
and Puritans, remember what <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> speaks of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
who worshipped <hi>Fire,</hi> that <hi>they did once in their supplicating their God,
threaten him that if he would not grant their Request they would throw him
into the water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was therefore no imprudent Act of the <hi>Nonconforming Divines</hi> who
had been deprived of their Livings to publish voluntarily such a <hi>Protestation</hi>
of their Tenets as aforesaid, after the detection of the Papists <hi>Gun powder</hi>
Treason Plot, and by which Act the Government was diverted from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
such a Cautionary <hi>Test</hi> on their Party as was on the Papists by the
<hi>Oaths</hi> of Allegiance and Supremacy.</p>
            <p>Certain it is that both the Parties appeared very rude in the manner of
their Petitioning. In the <hi>Decrets</hi> where the <hi>Text</hi> saith that a thing is done
<hi>Contra fidem Catholicam,</hi> the <hi>gloss</hi> explains it to be <hi>Contra bonos mores,</hi> and so it
may be said that both the Petitioners for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith, and for
the others alledged Catholick Faith were injurious to each by their <hi>unmannerly</hi>
Petitionings, as well as to their Prince: and their being both such frequent
<hi>Aggressors</hi> against his quiet, gave occasion for the <hi>Question</hi> to vex his Reign,
viz. <hi>Which were the worse of the two, or whether they were not equally bad,</hi> and so
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103047:166"/>
many may carelessly render them according to the saying, <hi>Rustici res secant
per medium.</hi>

               <hi>What Bishop</hi> Elmore <hi>the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>thought in such a Case I have

<hi>And a great</hi> Son <hi>of the Church and</hi> Minister <hi>of the</hi> State, <hi>hath judiciously
in a publick</hi> Speech <hi>inculcated the different regard to be had</hi> to those who

Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>in a</hi> printed <hi>Sermon, having said,</hi> That in many places
Lutherans are no less and in some tbey are more fierce against the Calvinists then
against Papists; <hi>adds,</hi> like a strange sort of People among our selves, that
are not ashamed to own a greater aversion to any sort of Dissenters then to the
Church of <hi>Rome. I hope the</hi> Authority <hi>of that great</hi> Divine <hi>and excellent
Person will in the point of this Comparison help to allay such a mistaken
Aversion to some mistaken Dissenters. I care not who knows the great
deference I have to the judgment of that great</hi> Historian <hi>of our</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>and whose History of which as the</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Commons <hi>has done right
to by one of their Votes, so likewise hath the highest Judicatory in</hi> England,
<hi>I mean the</hi> House <hi>of</hi> Lords <hi>by a late</hi> Order <hi>of theirs, by which</hi> the Thanks
of that House are given him for the great service done by him to this
Kingdom, and to the Protestant Religion, in writing the History of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> so truly and exactly, and that he be desired to
proceed to the perfecting what he further intends therein with all convenient
speed, <hi>&amp;c. As the words in the</hi> Iournal <hi>are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My reading lately ten small printed <hi>Controversial</hi> Discourses between two
<hi>Baronets</hi> of <hi>Cheshire</hi> near of kin to each other (in which are many references
to Historical Antiquities) concerning the <hi>Illegitimacy</hi> of one <hi>Amicia,</hi>
Daughter to one of the Earls of <hi>Chester,</hi> and my observing that one of
those <hi>Authors</hi> blames the other <hi>for not better learning the duty to his deceased
Grand-mother</hi> (as his words are) <hi>then by divulging the shame of her Illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
and saith, <hi>there is no Precedent in Scripture of any man that did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
the shame of any person, out of whose loyns he did descend except the
wicked</hi> Ham, and that the other <hi>Author</hi> thinks himself on the account of
truth, and for its sake to assert her <hi>Illegitimacy,</hi> those many Tracts passed
about that Controversy from the Year 1673 to 1676, occasioned my
thinking that thus have some Writers that would take it ill perhaps not to
be thought legitimate, and true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> took too
much pains to prove the Birth of its <hi>Reformation</hi> to be illegitimate, to the great
Applause of the Papists, and that our Reverend <hi>Historian</hi> of it, did seasonably
come in to Aid his Mother Church, by publishing the very <hi>Records</hi> that
would secure her from a blush on that account, and leave that <hi>Mauvaise honte</hi>
(as the <hi>French</hi> call it) to be Enemies, and hath appear'd by his very labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and judicious Writings, to be a Person as of very great Abilities, so of a
great and frank inclination to employ them even to the <hi>over-obliging</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and which though naturally attended with envy from some must too be
with acknowledgements from others of that Dignity and Authority that
his mind is possessed of, and such as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> speaking of as
<hi>innate</hi> in Famous Men who have no <hi>extrinsic</hi> Authority, saith of it, <hi>Quam
rectè quis dixerit longum &amp; beatum honorem esse sine honore.</hi> And he who
in the course of his <hi>History</hi> and his other Works hath appear'd so Impartial
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103047:166"/>
and Accurate in his Observations of Men and things, may very well be
supposed not to have been partial in his comparison of Papists and Dissenters,
nor do I think he receded from his usual close judging of things, when in
one of his Books he said, that <hi>it is not to be denied that it were better there

            <p>I will not with our Learned and Reverend <hi>Iudge,</hi> undertake to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
how many times Popery is worse then the Religion of the <hi>Romans:</hi>
but this I will say that had I been in the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate and had there heard
any one propound to them a removal of their minds out of that Coast
of Religion which by the light of Nature lay open before them, into the
Region of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Morals, I would have said, <hi>My Masters let us keep
where we are:</hi> and should have expected that the Reasons I would have
urged for their so doing, would have had the effect of the good <hi>Omen</hi> that
happen'd in that remarkable <hi>Crisis,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators were debating
whether they should qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

coming on the Guard, and his Captain being heard to cry out to him, <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niser

            </p>
            <p>I think that no Protestant who compares the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
<hi>Divines</hi> in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time with the <hi>Tenets</hi> of Popery, will prefer
the latter before the former. But it is not deniable that before King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
time, and then and since many <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Nonconformists</hi> have made
great Schisms in the Church and disturbances in the State, and that espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in some particular <hi>Conjunctures.</hi> The great <hi>Epoche</hi> of 41 in <hi>England,</hi>
and likewise in <hi>Ireland,</hi> will in our Histories preserve the Memory of the
outragious Principles of many <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines in the one Kingdom,
and of <hi>Popish</hi> ones in the other: but if any shall be so partial to the <hi>Papists</hi>
as either to justify their <hi>Commotion</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or to deny all part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
that <hi>Commotion</hi> had on ours here, he will find himself a vain impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser

Presbyterian, Independant, or Anabaptists had been able to have done

was on great and pressing necessity which hath no Law, and to that degree of
necessity as the two Houses had driven him, so the Consequences were to be set on
their Score not his own, yet even then in his Letters about that Affairs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by themselves, he doth insist on it that the Bargain may be made as good
as can be for him. But I have seen other Letters from one of his Secretaries
to the <hi>Irish,</hi> which I am assured were true, wherein where these expressions
after expostulation of their delays in his Assistance, He is inform'd that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantage of his low Condition, you insist on something in Religion more
then formerly you were contented with. He hath therefore commanded me to
let you know that were his Condition much lower, you shall never force him to
any further Concessions to the prejudice of his Conscience and of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion in which he is resolved to live, and for which he is ready to
die; and that he will joyn with any Protestant Prince, nay with these Rebels
themselves how odious soever (<hi>meaning his two Houses</hi>) rather then yield
the least to you in this particular.</p>
            <p>I should with extreme reluctance touch the Sores of these <hi>Sects</hi> who yet
have both at several times given such deadly wounds to the peace of the
Kingdom, but that they are Nusances to the publick quiet in raking up the
odious Comparisons of one anothers practices, and that the Papists on the
occasion of any of the worse sort of Protestants or Nonconformists being
Convicted of Sedition or Treason (a thing that may be expected from
the degeneracy of Humane Nature to happen oftener from some of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

are so apt to expect that the World should acquit the present Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and former practises of that Sect from Disloyalty on their Out-cry
that they are no Puritans or Presbyterians, and as ridiculously as if a false
<hi>Coyner</hi> Arraigned for the Fact, should trouble the Court with a Plea and
Noise, that he was no <hi>House-breaker,</hi> and but that on the detection of a
<hi>Plot</hi> of <hi>Papists,</hi> several persons that have in their publick Capacities done
many Acts of Hostility to the Interest of the Kingdom, yet entirely by
being more busie <hi>Anti-Papists</hi> then others, have been immediately admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the good Graces of the People, and cried up by them as <hi>Patriots</hi>
and <hi>Hero's,</hi> and by their afterward <hi>espousing</hi> the true Interest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as to the point of Popery, all their former <hi>spurious</hi> Actions have been
not only <hi>pardoned,</hi> but almost according to the <hi>Canon</hi> Law <hi>legitimated;</hi>
and as the Popes in any <hi>Croysad</hi> for the <hi>Exterminium</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi> were
wont to give plenary <hi>Indulgences</hi> for all Sins past and to come for many
years, so have the People heaped such Indulgences on such Persons that in
any Conjuncture shewed their zeal in the extermination of Popery.</p>
            <p>And though to an ordinary view these mens <hi>Title</hi> to their Fame may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

that they believe are assistful to them in the attaquing of the Romish <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and look on them as their <hi>Saviours,</hi> and as captious as they are against
others, yet think of nothing but <hi>saving them and all that they have;</hi> as was
in the case of <hi>Rahab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it to be wonder'd at that Men who have so much to account for
to the Public should be thus discharged by the populace, tho many of
them are <hi>Gallios</hi> in Religion, and were no more concern'd for the Eclipse
of Protestancy or the light of the Gospel in the <hi>year</hi> 1678. or 1680. then
they were for the four Eclipses of the Luminaries, <hi>viz.</hi> two of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
two of the <hi>Moon,</hi> that will be in the year 1701. and particularly of that
of the Sun, which will be in <hi>Ianuary</hi> then and not seen by us, but only by
our <hi>Antipodes;</hi> but there is that adherent to Popery, that if it could rivet it
self into our Law here, it would make the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> not worth the
looking on, namely the <hi>Confiscation</hi> of the Goods and Estates of those that
<hi>Holy Church</hi> calls <hi>Heretics,</hi> and the throwing them into such forlorn Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
where they could see neither Sun or Moon: and therefore as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
those Seducers in Chains are hated by Men, because they know those
Fiends <hi>would</hi> destroy their lifes if they <hi>could;</hi> for the same reason all that
lye open to the Name of <hi>Heretics,</hi> will be animated with a brisk hatred
against Popery, and magnify those as their tutelar Angels that shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to defend them from it; tho such did before conspire against them.
But therefore because a Zeal against Popery is a remedy so cheap and so
easie to be had, and yet so infallible a one against the Peoples being discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with Men who did before so much by their Principles poison the
Realm, 'tis the common interest of us all, both Protestants and Papists, out
of love to our Country, to wish that no Men may be tempted so fatally to
injure it hereafter, by being beforehand sure of purchasing both Pardon
and Adoration, from the People on such easie terms.</p>
            <p>The strong currents of <hi>Inclination</hi> I find in my self, and observe in others,
not only to <hi>Pardon,</hi> but to extol and magnifie, nay to <hi>bless</hi> all Men that
help their Country, as it is contesting with Popery or Presbytery, or either
of those or any <hi>Religion-trade,</hi> and to say to them as the Expression is in
the Psalms, <hi>We bless you in the name of the Lord,</hi> will I hope be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
with such an <hi>Extirpation</hi> of it as will not leave any <hi>Fibre</hi> behind it in
our <hi>English</hi> World.</p>
            <p>As it need not be told to our <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
they are under no obligation to strain any point of Courtesie whereby to
render the <hi>Papists</hi> generally not worse than <hi>Puritans,</hi> and that their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
hath been by the <hi>Papists</hi> all along render'd more vile than that of
the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and that <hi>Doleman</hi> in his <hi>Book of the Succession, weighing</hi> the
Parties in <hi>England,</hi> and having first spoke of the Protestants of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> afterward <hi>p.</hi> 242. saith, <hi>That the Puritan party is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
favour'd throughout the whole Realm, with all those which are not of the
Roman Religion, then is the Protestant upon a certain general persuasion that
the profession of the Puritan Party is the more perfect, especially in great
Towns, where Preachers have made more impression in the Artificers and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,

            <p>I have granted that the <hi>Puritan</hi> and the <hi>Popish</hi> Petitioners did both in
the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi> his Reign offend <hi>Contra bonos mores:</hi> but if
any should ask me which <hi>Sect</hi> was the more peccant by such incivility, I
will say that in one regard the <hi>Puritans</hi> were so, for that they were bred
to the Knowledge of better things: but that in another regard the <hi>Papists</hi>
most certainly were so, if <hi>Thuanus</hi> may be believ'd, who in the place I last
cited out of him, relating to the <hi>Gun-powder</hi> Plot, (by which it appears
that their Petitioning was but a stalking-horse, or as I may say, a <hi>Trojan</hi>
Horse to hide and enclose armed Men) further shews, That <hi>the Iesuites in</hi>
England <hi>employ'd one privately into</hi> Spain <hi>in the Name of the Catholics with
Letters of Commendation to</hi> Creswell <hi>the Iesuite there residing, to negotiate
with the Government there, to send an Army into</hi> England <hi>in the latter end
of Queen</hi> Elizabeth'<hi>s Reign, and that afterward one</hi> Wright <hi>was sent into</hi>
Spain <hi>upon the same Errand, and that then likewise</hi> Guy Faux <hi>was by some
of the Iesuites sent thither to</hi> Creswel <hi>to hasten the Design, and that</hi> Faux
<hi>was instructed to take Care that it should be signify'd to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>that
the Condition of the Roman Catholics would be worse here under King</hi> James
<hi>than it was under Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and that it might be effected that</hi> Spinola
<hi>should then Land an Army in</hi> Milford <hi>Haven.</hi> And then saith the great
Historian, they not being able to effect that, proceeded to the Plot of the
<hi>Gun-powder</hi> Treason.</p>
            <p>The Popish Petitioners then did essay how they might <hi>flectere superos</hi> and
<hi>Acheronta movere</hi> at the same time.</p>
            <p>But in truth, as in <hi>Whale-fishing,</hi> 'tis customary for Marriners apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Danger to the Vessel from the greatness of the Whale, to throw out an
empty Barrel into the Sea, for the Whale to toss about on the Waters, and
to receive some diversion from it, that while he is so diverted, they may
the more securely wound him with their dead-doing Irons, thus did the
Papists throw out their empty Petitions to that King only to divert
and amuse him, that they might surprize him with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Yet now if any one should put the Interrogatory to me, which Person I
had the least Kindness for, namely, a Non-Conformist that favour'd the
Doctrine of <hi>Resistance,</hi> or a Papist that believ'd the Grounds and School-Conclusions
of the Doctrine of Popery, as King <hi>Iames</hi>'s before mention'd
Expression was (and which <hi>whoever did,</hi> he said, <hi>could neither be a good
Christian or a faithful Subject</hi>) I shall by way of Answer crave aid from a
Judgment given by <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who having heard the Merits of a
Cause or Complaint that happen'd between two lewd Persons, gave the
Decree, That <hi>one of them should presently fly out of</hi> Macedon, <hi>and that the
other should run after him as fast as he could.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But against any Seditious Protestant, I would wish more severity exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
than against such a Papist: for the former doth not only rebel against
his Prince as the latter; but doth according to <hi>Iob</hi>'s Expression, more <hi>rebel

            <p>The well meant pains of the Compilers of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> in inserting
there some good Prayers out of the Mass, to render it more agreeable to
the Papists, was it seems all lost; and that perhaps occasion'd that angry
Exclamation of Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> of old, <hi>That in Ceremonies we ought to
comply with the Turk rather then the Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I acquainted the Discoursers that Mr.</hi> Fox <hi>in the</hi> Edition <hi>of</hi> the Acts and
Monuments <hi>printed together in one Volume in</hi> London, <hi>in the</hi> Year 1596,
<hi>doth Combat this mighty</hi> Question <hi>in</hi> p. 702, <hi>and in the</hi> following <hi>Pages,
viz.</hi> Whether the Turk or the Pope is the greater Antichrist, <hi>and at last
saith</hi> p. 710. In comparing the Turk with the Pope if a Question be asked
whether of them is the truer or greater Antichrist, it were easie to see and
judge that the Turk is the more open and manifest Enemy against Christ and
the Church. But if it be asked whether of them two hath been the more
bloody and pernicious Adversary to Christ and his Members, or whether of
them hath Consumed and Spilt more Christian Blood, he with Sword or this
with Fire and Sword together, neitheer is it a light matter to discern, neither
is it my part here to discuss, who do only write the History and Acts of them
both.</p>
            <p>And I then telling the Nonconformist that the <hi>Iews</hi> for many obvious
reasons did prefer the Doctrine of <hi>Mahumetanisme</hi> to that of <hi>Popery,</hi> some
<hi>Papists</hi> beforemention'd had prefer'd it to Protestancy, and as he the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist
had preferred it to Popery, he mention'd his fears that a sort of
<hi>Enthusiasts</hi> among us called <hi>Seekers,</hi> might hereby be in great danger of
stumbling on the Religion of <hi>Mahumetanisme,</hi> accordingly as of old when
one went to demand of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of the several <hi>Sects, which was the
best of them,</hi> every one named his own <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Party</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> place, but
all of them in the <hi>second</hi> place granted <hi>Plato</hi> to be the most eminent, that
is the <hi>next best:</hi> whereupon those <hi>Seekers</hi> preferred <hi>Plato,</hi> because setting
aside prejudicate Affection and Self-Love, <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philosophy had thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Garland.</p>
            <p>I then took occasion to tell the Company that I thought 'twas extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unjust to prefer Mahumetanisme with the many ridiculous and senseless
things it comprehends to Christianity in Papists, blended with many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
<hi>Tenets</hi> which yet are capable of the name of Religion, and such as
those great pious Papists beforementioned, <hi>viz.</hi> Father <hi>Paul, Thuanus, D'Ossat,
Erasmus, Peiresk</hi> perhaps own'd the belief of, as many thousands of others
may still likewise do: but frankly interposed my opinion that I thought
that <hi>Popery</hi> complicated with the real belief of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Morals, and their
vile Casuistical <hi>Tenets</hi> branded by the present <hi>Pope,</hi> was as unworthy of
God and Humane Nature as any <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of Religion could be: and
I as frankly told the <hi>Nonconformist</hi> whom I looked on as one who would not
outrage the Law of the Land to advance the Gospel, that tho some erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
points relating to Nonconformity, might without absurdity assume
the name of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet among whomsoever those <hi>Tenets</hi> should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
with the real belief and practice of the lawfulness of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of <hi>Resistance,</hi> and of any persons Reforming the World by Arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Warrant from the Municipal Laws so to do, yet such a <hi>Faith</hi> would be
<hi>Faction,</hi> and such a Nominal Religion would be a real Rebellion, and much
worse then <hi>Mahumetanisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I farther acquainted the Company that according to the discreet <hi>Motto</hi>

            <p>There was one thing that I told the Gentleman, who was the <hi>Papist,</hi> in
the Close of this Discourse that much surprized him, namely; that those
two <hi>Anti-Christs,</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> have sometimes held a good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
together, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> has been a <hi>Pensioner</hi> to the
<hi>Turk.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>King</hi> Iames <hi>in his</hi> Apology for the Oath of Allegiance <hi>doth in</hi> p. 74 <hi>mention</hi>
how <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> took of <hi>Bajazet</hi> two hundred thousand Crowns to kill
his Brother <hi>Gemen,</hi> or as some call him <hi>Sisimus</hi> whom he held Captive at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and how he accepted of his Conditions to poyson the Man and had his
pay.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> voucheth for the History of this Fact <hi>Paul. Iovius,</hi> and
<hi>Guicciardine,</hi> and <hi>Cuspinian.</hi> It was a vile Ministry to the <hi>Turk</hi> that that
pretended Vicar of <hi>Christ</hi> then engaged in. King <hi>Iames</hi> mentions not
there how that Popes predecessor, <hi>Innocent</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> was likewise <hi>Bajazets</hi>
Pensioner in the same detestable Affair: for 'twas in his time that <hi>Sisimus</hi>
having rebell'd against his Brother and retired to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> was brought to
that Pope to whom <hi>Bajazet</hi> sent the Title of our blessed Saviours Cross in
<hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as a present, and effectually obliged him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Brother in Custody during his Pontificat: and that Pope had a
yearly Pension of 40,000 Ducats from the <hi>Turk</hi> for the continuing his
Brother a Prisoner; and it seems that <hi>Charles</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
War against Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> who was not able to resist him, the Pope
was constrained to conclude a Peace, and one Condition was that he should
set the <hi>Turks</hi> Brother at liberty. But then his Holiness being thereby to
lose the said yearly Pension of 40,000 Ducats, received from the <hi>Turk</hi>
the gracious offer of 20,0000 Crowns to cause <hi>Geme</hi> or <hi>Zizimus</hi> to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
and so he was. These faults are particularly set down in <hi>Cyprian

<hi>Sabellicus, Tome</hi> 2d, of his <hi>Works, Ennead. 10. Book</hi> 9, says that <hi>Bajazet</hi>

            <p>I shall here observe to your Lordship one thing that occurred to me not

one of the most learned men in <hi>Oxford</hi> in his time, and a most
faithful Citer of Authors, the famous <hi>Hosius</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cited
for a more intolerable Blasphemy against the holy <hi>Iesus,</hi> then any I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Crackanthorp <hi>arming his</hi> Logick <hi>against the errors of Popery doth in his
Chapter,</hi> De loco arguendi ab authoritate, <hi>say, that,</hi> ipsi primarii sacerdotes
quos maximè ab errore immunes fecit Mosis Cathedra &amp; promissio illa Dei

            <p>But as inhumane as any Principles of <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> or
any <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> or as desperate as the very <hi>Iesuites</hi> beforementioned ones
are supposeable to be, and as much as any of Mankind can strive to delude
others by Implicit Faith, yet as it is in no mans power presently to believe
what even his own, and much less what his Guides appetite would have
him, notwithstanding any Ecclesiastical Association he may have prosessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
linked his Faith in; so no man can ensure the continuance of his Belief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

any mens <hi>Tenets</hi> are, I shall expect them to be the less believed, and
for the less time, and it is more then Holy Church can know that any one
at all believes as it believes, how great soever the number that pretends so to
do, appears.</p>
            <p>Of all Papists not professing themselves bound to withdraw their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
from Heretical Princes, and even from such as by a particular <hi>Bull</hi>
were Excommunicated by the Pope, History affords many Examples,
and particularly of the many <hi>Loyal</hi> Papists, who when the inheritable Right
of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was devolved on the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and as such Excommunicated, with their Lives and Fortunes asserted
his Title to the Crown. Any of the Readers of <hi>Thuanus</hi> know that in
<hi>Book</hi> 93 'tis related, how when many Papists would have debarred him
from the <hi>Succession,</hi> and that the minds of those <hi>qui in Castris erant,</hi> were
in that point variously affected, yet <hi>Major &amp; sanior pars sic existimabat
nullam publicae salutis spem superesse, nisi servato legitimae successionis ordine,</hi>
and so were for <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>ths</hi> Right therein, and whom they believed
was late reconciled to the King his Predecessor for that he did <hi>per eum res
administrare</hi> as the <hi>Historian's</hi> words are, i. e. <hi>Harry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> a Protestant
<hi>Successor,</hi> was <hi>Primier Ministre</hi> to <hi>Harry</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> a Papist.</p>
            <p>And not only the Major part and the sober Party of the Popish Souldiery,
(<hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Thuanus</hi> his words <hi>sanior pars</hi>) was loyally addicted to the Right of
the Protestant Successor, but several of the Grandees of the Popish Clergy
were so, and particularly the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> whose Speech for that purpose
<hi>Thuanus</hi> Book 106. sets down, wherein 'tis said, <hi>Neque verò aut Regis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonam,

but I believe the World will grow more modest then to burn
men for immodesty: and 'tis most certain that as the World grows the
nearer to its Period and growing more and more populous, that populous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will naturally tend to unite all Countries at home by preparing them

And this I believe would have been the fate of the sicarious <hi>Morality</hi> of

he has done, and their <hi>Consecrastis manus Iehovae</hi> be absolete, how
much soever many of them think to out-brave the Popes Decree, who I
wonder that they are not so hardy to write to the Pope to revoke it, in
the comtemptuous Style of <hi>Merbizan</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> that when <hi>Pius</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> in a Discourse of his, printed in the <hi>Year</hi> 1675.
saith, that <hi>the Iesuites were then</hi> i. e. in the time of the late Usurpation,
<hi>and are now the principal directors of the Consciences of the</hi> English <hi>Papists.</hi>
And there was published in the <hi>Year</hi> 1662, a Pamphlet writ by a Person
of no vulgar understanding, and who I suppose was a Papist, and the
Title of it was <hi>an expedient or a sure and easie way of reducing all Dissenters</hi>
&amp;c. wherein the Author saith, <hi>of the Papists</hi> (meaning in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales) there are 7 Parts of 10, Gentlemen and People of great Quality:</hi>
and therefore since the Jesuites have formerly made the <hi>Pope</hi> infallible in his
judgment of matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and that the Pope hath thus <hi>de facto</hi> thrown
that <hi>turpitude</hi> of their Principles (that one may call <hi>lutum sanguine mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum</hi>)
from his Court and even from that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Inquisition, and
the <hi>Sordes</hi> whereof Gentlemen could never receive into the Cabinets of
their mind without fear and shame, they must now either be ashamed of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103047:172"/>
their Jesuitical Guides, or of their Pope, and the more ingenious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
sort of Jesuites will by natural instinct be more and more ashamed of
such Principles, and be sometimes pale with fear, and sometimes red with the
Die of Blushes, as they observe the World picqued with their Dishonour
pronounce against them as the Pope their infallible <hi>Censor</hi> hath done, and
the Jesuites see that the Principles are too hot for them to touch where
there is an Inquisition and too foul where there is none.</p>
            <p>According to that great Moral Observation of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s, <hi>Omne malum
aut timore aut pudore natura perfudit,</hi> all the <hi>fair-killing</hi> Principles of the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites

            <p>Time was in the old Monastic days when the Popish Clerical Actors
were so numerous on the Stage of the World and so rich, and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
so few and so poor, that it was dangerous for these to his at them or
not to applaud them, but 'tis now otherwise, and the Scene of
Time is altered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Tables are turned since the Author of a Popish Book called,</hi> The
Right and Iurisdiction of the Prelate and the Prince, <hi>imprinted with</hi> licence
of Superiors, <hi>Anno Dom. 1617 was so hardy as in</hi> Chap. 15<hi>th,</hi> p. 269. <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spoke of the Oath of Allegiance, to say,</hi> The King after this Oath is
no more secure than before, because the Catholicks who take this Oath against
their Conscience, know that they are not bound to keep their Oath. Yea the
Prince thereby bringeth himself into greater danger, for by so unwonted and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an Oath so contrary to his Subjects Consciences, he cannot but make himself
odious, <hi>and there having insinuated the great</hi> numbers <hi>of the Papists, to
apply then very gravely to his Prince that saying of</hi> Cicero <hi>in his</hi> Offices,
Multorum odiis nullae opes, nullae vires resistere queunt: <hi>and that</hi> Author
<hi>further tells us out of</hi> Tully, quem metuunt oderunt. Men hate whom they
fear: <hi>and then doth like a grave</hi> Animal <hi>thus proceed very honestly telling
us,</hi> And what security hath a Prince among them that hate him? when Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
hate their Prince, they are discontented; when they are discontented they are
desperate; when they are desperate, they care not for their own lives; when
they care not for their own lives, let then the Prince fear his; for as <hi>Seneca</hi>
saith, <hi>Qui suam vitam contemnit, tuae dominus erit.</hi> He that contemneth
his own life will be Master of thine. And from this Source proceeded the late
Gun-powder Plot.</p>
            <p>But I believe not only <hi>fear</hi> but <hi>shame</hi> would divert Papists from writing
at this rate at this time of day: and I look on it as either a <hi>Sham</hi> or infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a Protestant writer, who in a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> whose haughty Title was
<hi>the Humble Remonstrance and Petition of</hi> English <hi>Protestants against</hi> English
<hi>and</hi> Irish <hi>Papists, to the Right Honourable the Lords and Commons Assembled
in Parliament,</hi> and which was published not long after the discovery of the
Popish Plot, when in <hi>p.</hi> 2. the Author saith of the Papists and the Plot,
<hi>Nor will the more impudent of them deny the thing in general, but much the
contrary insulting to us with</hi> Tertullian<hi>'s</hi> implevimus omnia <hi>against the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
We fill your Courts, your Armies, your Navies: it must take, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid it, 'tis a just cause to extirpate Heresy root and branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe there were no Papists so void of shame and sense as to speak
then what this Author mentions.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Dutchess, Ianuary</hi> the 24<hi>th,</hi>
1670. and since printed, speaking of those, <hi>who were averse from Popery or
afraid of it,</hi> saith that, <hi>their number did take in 99 parts of 100 in the whole
Nation.</hi> His <hi>Lordship</hi> was a very modest <hi>Calculator</hi> in making the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103047:172"/>
of those who then <hi>de facto</hi> feared Popery to be no larger: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
according to the Rule of <hi>quem metuunt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>derunt,</hi> referred to by the
<hi>Author</hi> of <hi>the Prelate and the Prince,</hi> the great number of those here
who <hi>hated</hi> Popery was very visible, and made the <hi>implevimus omnia</hi> to be
a very empty and ridiculous suggestion. But were the number of Papists
much greater then any timid Protestants seem to make it, the great real
encrease of Mankind, and mens being thereby preserved, must render the
<hi>turpitude</hi> of the former Principles of Cruelty to be very shameful.</p>
            <p>In the Style of the Heathen Morality 'twas usual to call any thing <hi>turpe</hi>
that was not <hi>honestum,</hi> or honourable, or contrary to the generous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man, and therefore to brand with the name of <hi>turpitude</hi> many
<hi>lawful</hi> Actions, for <hi>Non omne quod licet honestum:</hi> and thus what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Man or a Christian to do is often so called in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and 'tis an error in any mens judgments or fancies to appropriate so
much the meaning of that word to fleshly Lusts. The Devil is called an
<hi>unclean Spirit</hi> in the <hi>New Testament</hi> though not supposeable to use bodily
Lusts or to confine his temptations to them. The <hi>filthiness of sin</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and St. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 21. commands <hi>the laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all</hi> filthiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Sentence obtain'd from a Judge that was given by Bribery is said to be
<hi>lata per sordes,</hi> and for the <hi>turpitude</hi> of such a judgment a Judge was long since
brought to a shameful end in this Realm, and in his Enditement for Bribery
'twas said that he did <hi>violare sacramentum Domini Regis,</hi> and the reason
thereof was, that the Oath of our Kings relating to the doing of Justice
to their People, such corrupt Judges did by their injustice do violence to
that <hi>Oath</hi> of our Monarchs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in like manner all Kings generally being
by their Coronation Oaths bound to protect and defend their People, I
ask what King on earth can do it, if either an outragious Pope or the General
of the Jesuites shall secretly cause men to be killed by their Emissaries, and
what Subject can any were enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Tacit</hi> Paction between
him and the Law to the effect of <hi>fac hoc &amp; vives,</hi> if he must hold his life
by the Tenure of a Jesuites <hi>Caprice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Orders</hi> sicarious Principles must therefore be naturally as fatal to
it as those of their <hi>Calumny</hi> beforementioned, and indeed this their affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Arbitrary Power over Hereticks lives is liable to the Battery of fear and
shame from the other Papists; for if such believing the Justice of the
Pope's <hi>Decree,</hi> shall speak ill of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Contumacy, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
render that Society disobedient to Holy Church and scandalous to
the same, will not <hi>Tenet</hi> the 30<hi>th</hi> condemned by the Pope, viz. <hi>It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a Person of Honour to kill a man that intends to calumniate him if
there is no other way to avoid that Reproach,</hi> render the lives of such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
forfeitable to the Jesuites Assassins: and again will it not render the
Jesuites lives forfeitable by their own Principles to such Papists, and thus
our Popish Layety and the <hi>Iesuites</hi> be in a State of War, instead of such
Layety being amicable Disciples and bountiful Patrons to them?</p>
            <p>Neither the Law of God or the Land do trust the punishment of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
to private persons: but as <hi>Tolosanus de Repub.</hi> tells us, l. 13. c. 132.
<hi>Processum fuit judicialiter &amp; sententiâ excommunicationis contra vermes radices
segetum edentes in diocesi Curiensi &amp; constantiensi,</hi> (and he there sets down
such a Sentence of Excommunication pronounced against those <hi>animalcula</hi>)
so much more ought such <hi>Locusts</hi> tho now as to the Pope <hi>they have no King,</hi>
(I allude to <hi>Solomon's</hi> words, <hi>The Locusts have no Kings, yet go they forth in
Bands</hi>) and tho their Principles would eradicate the Lives of our Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Kings and their Subjects to have the legal benefit of Judicial Proceedings;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103047:173"/>
but the turpitude of such Principles and Practices as pollutes the Land
with Blood, and may bring a Curse upon it, is likely to bring them many
an extrajudicial Curse from the Popish and Protestant Populace; and if as
<hi>Tully</hi> tells us in his <hi>Offices,</hi> that <hi>there was a Law at</hi> Athens, <hi>that ordered
publick Execrations against all that did, viam erranti non monstrare,</hi> such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
as by insinuations put people out of the right way by vile irreligio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
casuistical Principles so fatal to Souls and Bodies, must naturally be ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized
by them.</p>
            <p>Thus likewise by <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> in our populous <hi>English</hi> World must all
Bloody and Rebellious Principles own'd by any Persons that assume the
the name of Protestants be naturally hated: and if any are not ashamed or
afraid togive just occasion of Jealousie concerning such Hostile Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
secretly harboured in their minds, others will be ashamed and afraid to
keep them Company, and as if there were some speedy Judgment impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on those who conversed with them, according to that Proverb of
the Jews, <hi>Migrandum est ex eo loco in quo Rex non timetur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The last prefatory</hi> Paragraph <hi>before the Bishops</hi> Survey <hi>is, that</hi> the
Heads and Preachers of the several Factions are such as had a great share in the
late Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Such men tho like the <hi>Trumpeter</hi> in <hi>Alciat,</hi> they made part of the
fighters, and had been fairly dealt with by the <hi>Amnesty</hi> if they had not
been permitted any more in their profession to have <hi>lifted up their voices
like Trumpets</hi> again, or trusted to make any harangues to the People in
publick, yet at the time of that <hi>Survey</hi> were very few, and are now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as silent in the Region of the Dead as <hi>Meroz</hi> was when they <hi>curs'd</hi>
him; and themselves are according to my Calculating Observation turn'd
to Earth, whose Voices like Air in the wrong place made such Earthquakes
in Church and State: and both fear and shame might teach them how <hi>in
bello non bis peccare,</hi> if their being <hi>Experts</hi> of the inconveniences of War
had not naturally excited in many an aversion to it; but with the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
Experts there doth undoubtedly a <hi>reminiscentia</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
calls a <hi>re-conning</hi>) survive, how that the long Parliament had not former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more fears and jealousies of Popery then of Presbytery, and of some of
the <hi>Divines</hi> of that perswasion designing to trouble every Parish with a
New <hi>Court-Christian,</hi> after the tremendous example in <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
for Heretical Pravity</hi> being first committed to the Orders of the
<hi>Dominican</hi> and <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryars, and without any <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and which by
their zeal in preaching they afterward obtain'd with a vengeance, and to
the Scandal of Humane Nature; and how that that Parliament as <hi>Fuller</hi>
observes in his <hi>Church-History, would not trust the Presbyters to carry the Keys
of Excommunication at their Girdle, so that the Power thereof was not intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, but ultimately resolved into a Committee of eminent Persons of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in which</hi> Thomas <hi>Earl of</hi> Arundel <hi>was first named;</hi> and moreover
how that <hi>England</hi> was then turned into such a common shore of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Opinions that one of the most Learned of the Presbyterian <hi>Divines,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Iames Cranford</hi> in a <hi>Sermon</hi> of his called <hi>Haereseo-machria</hi> preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen at S. <hi>Pauls</hi> on <hi>February</hi> the 1<hi>st,</hi> 1645.
and printed in the following Year, saith there in <hi>p. 47. In eighty years there
did not arise among us so many horrid opinions and blasphemous Heresies under
Episcopacy (a Government decryed as Antichristian) as have risen in these few
years since we have been without a Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He had before in</hi> p. 5. <hi>said,</hi> it is lamentable what success errors have had
among our selves in these last 3 or 4 years of Ecclesiastical Anarchy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

whether we respect the numbers of Errors of the erroneous. <hi>Amsterdam,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103047:173"/>
Poland, Transylvania,</hi> Places most infamous for Heresies, are now righteous
if compared with <hi>England, London,</hi> which in so short a space have broach'd
or entertain'd above 160 Errors, many of them damnable.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do not wonder that in a Pamphlet called, <hi>The exact
Collection of the Debates in the House of Commons</hi> in the last Parliament,
one Member is there brought in, observing in his Speech concerning the
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> that <hi>'tis not probable that ever they will have a King of their
opinion, nor yet a Parliament by the best discoveries they had made of their
strength at the last Election. For according to the best Calculations that I
can make, they could not bring in above 1. in</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>The present <hi>Gentlemanly</hi> Temper appearing in the People of <hi>England,</hi>
as to the not having Aversion or Resentments of Anger against any Mens
persons or their Converse by reason of their asserting controvertible points
that are capable of the name of Religion, must naturally make any asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to vex their patience and disturb their security by asserting Principles
that really are <hi>Irreligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any one did rake in the dust of Libraries for Names of absolete
<hi>Heresies</hi> to render the Papists or any else the fouler thereby, he would in
effect but needlessly foul his own fingers; as for example, if any one
should say the Papists have borrowed their Practice of extreme Unction
from the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Heracleonites,</hi> their Notion of the Orders and
Quires of Angels from the <hi>Archonticks,</hi> the use and worshipping of Images
from the <hi>Carpocratians,</hi> the praying to the <hi>Virgin-Mary</hi> from the <hi>Colliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
the Veneration of the Cross from the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the Baptism
by Women from <hi>Marcion,</hi> the Baptizing in an unknown Tongue
from the <hi>Marcosians,</hi> and the voluntary Poverty and single Life of Priests
from the <hi>Apostolici,</hi> the using of small Bells in Celebrating the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Religion from the <hi>Meletians.</hi> Nor would any be much concern'd
whether any old or new unheard of Hereticks communicated the Disease
of these Notions to the weak minds of the erring, since it doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Humane Society.</p>
            <p>And there are several Traditions mentioned in some of the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi>
as Apostolical, which tho the Papists do not observe, yet the World would not
make any angry Exclamations against them if it heard they did, as namely,
the mixture of Milk and Honey given to them that are newly Baptized,
the abstaining from washing a whole Week after, Oblations for the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
yearly, not to fast or kneel in Prayer or worshipping of God on the
the Lords Day, nor between <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> all which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Nor would any be now angry with another that
held either part of the Question, <hi>viz.</hi> If the <hi>Hallelujah</hi> may be sung in
<hi>Lent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Controversy about <hi>Easter</hi> that heretofore put all the World
in a <hi>Rattle,</hi> and almost shook it to pieces, what a Toy is it self now repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
insomuch that our latest Ascertainers here of the time of its Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
seemed not to think it <hi>tanti</hi> to be awake when they were about it;
and tho our lately having in our Almanacks two <hi>Easters</hi> in one year easily
awakened the Non-Conformists, to take notice of it and to say, that
therefore they could not give their unfeigned assent and consent to all and
every thing contained and prescribed in and by the Book intituled the Book
of Common Prayer, &amp;c. And tho thereupon a person of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
profoundly knowing in all the Mathematical Sciences, and likewise in the
knowledge of Theology and of the Canon Law, and the Ecclesiastical
Law of <hi>England,</hi> hath published an infallible way of fixing <hi>Easter</hi> for ever
(and that it may be no longer a Fugitive from the Rule of its Practice as it
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103047:174"/>
often is at present (nor dance away from it self, as I may say, in allusion to
the vulgar error of the Suns <hi>dancing</hi> on <hi>Easter day</hi>) and fixing it so as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
none else could have done, nor possibly himself any other way; yet
hath this great right done to that great day been by the generality of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not so much regarded as would <hi>an Advice to a Painter,</hi> or such
like Composure have been.</p>
            <p>Any one that would design to make another fermentation in the World
by the terms of <hi>Homo-ousios</hi> and <hi>Homoi-ousios</hi> would no more effect it, than
by the Criticks Controversy in <hi>Boccaline,</hi> whether <hi>Consumptum should be
spelled with a</hi> p <hi>or no:</hi> to which purpose I heard one cite it out of <hi>Luther,</hi>
that he said <hi>anima mea odit terminum istum Homo-ousion,</hi> tho yet he knew
<hi>Homo-ousios</hi> was the right opinion and <hi>Homoi-ousios</hi> the wrong.</p>
            <p>And that one word <hi>Heresy</hi> that hath produced such furious Tempests in
the World that have torn up States and Kingdoms by the Roots, how is it
now generally among men of ingenuity and wit here reduced to its quiet
and primitive signification, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking of an opinion, or a private
opinion without reference to truth or falshood, and to import nothing
more of affront then when used by <hi>Tully,</hi> as <hi>Non sum in eadem tecum haeresi;
I am not of your opinion:</hi> and the common Vogue of <hi>Heretics</hi> amounts to
<hi>opiniátre,</hi> and <hi>Heresy</hi> to <hi>opiniátrete:</hi> and as a Whirl-wind may be supposed
to have blown some one thing into its place, as each other thing out of it,
so have the Whirl-winds <hi>Heresy</hi> hath disturbed the World by, happened at
last to blow its signification into its right and original State.</p>
            <p>Our Courts Christian which in order to the <hi>Salus animae</hi> might still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
Men for <hi>Heresy,</hi> as well as <hi>Vsury,</hi> have given no <hi>Heretics</hi> or <hi>Vsurers,</hi>
any Cause of Complaint for molestation; tho yet in the Articles of <hi>Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
this is one, <hi>is there any person a known or reputed Heretick or Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
But as in the Diocesess in the Country and even in the Cities there,
the Church-wardens having not troubled themselves to know what <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
a <hi>Heretick</hi> is, so neither is our Layety in our Metropolis in the humour
to mind the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Differentia</hi> in the definition of a <hi>Heretick.</hi> Nor
will they be ever likely to make any such Presentment as Mr. <hi>Nath. Bacon</hi>
said in one of his printed <hi>Discourses;</hi> he hath seen, made formerly by some of
St. <hi>Mary Overies, Item we saine that</hi> John Stephens <hi>is a man we cannot well
tell what to make of him, and that he hath Books we know not what they
are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>English Genius</hi> is so improved by the excellent temper and discourses
of that <hi>breed</hi> of rational <hi>Divines</hi> our Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been blest
with since the King's Restoration, that it generally abhors the thoughts of
punishing a <hi>Heretick</hi> as such with death, as a severity that hath in it the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude
of injustice and cruelty. And since the very Fathers and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
could never agree about the point who are formally <hi>Hereticks</hi> and
that the acutest among them make the formality of <hi>Heresy</hi> to consist in
Pertinacy or Contumacy, which are inward Acts of the Mind and which
none but the <hi>Scrutator renum</hi> can know, it may well seem shameful for
any to agree in punishing it with death.</p>
            <p>What a shameful narrowness of mind was there in the <hi>Divines</hi> that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
our Church in the times of the late <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> when those <hi>Triers
of Ministers</hi> would allow none to have a Living or Cure of Souls that
asserted the Tenets of <hi>Arminius</hi> in Religion, which yet carry a face of so
much probability to be maintained, that a man who having used his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
care in the investigation of truth therein asserts them, may claim it
as his due by the purchase of Christs Blood, that when he is required to
deliver his opinion about the same, his asserting it that way should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103047:174"/>
him to punishment. And there is no Controverted Religionary Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Point of that Nature wherein there is among Learned Men <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilis
causa litigandi</hi> (and in some Cases too where it may touch too
close upon our <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homilies</hi>) in which liberty of differing in
Judgment is here either prejudicial to their Interest or common Esteem.
Thus tho all the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches make the Pope to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and
particularly our Church of <hi>England</hi> in its <hi>Homilies</hi> hath done so, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> adventured as he thought himself obliged in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to publish it, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was the man.</p>
            <p>The most judicious Comparers of times are sensible that there is now a
more valuable <hi>libera theologia</hi> in <hi>England</hi> then was during the Usurpation.
How glad would many of the Independent, and Presbyterian Divines
then have been of the liberty to have taught their Flocks the Notions they
then thought of importance as to the Divine Decrees, tho they had been
allowed to have so done only in <hi>Surplices,</hi> or in Vests of <hi>Indian</hi> feathers,
or any habits imaginable? The old way of arguing about speculative points
in Religion with passion and loudness and being tedious therein, is grown
out of use, and a Gentlemanly Candour in discourse of the same with that
moderate temper that men use in debating natural Experiments has succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in its room, and 'tis accounted <hi>Pedantry</hi> for any one in good Company
to pass for a <hi>Victor</hi> in Notions by having the last word, and seeming a
<hi>Baffler</hi> in dispute. And the truth is, our <hi>Divines</hi> and the Lay <hi>Literati</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
since the King's Restoration been more addicted to the Study of real
Learning then formerly, which requires quiet of thought in its pursuit,
hath brought noise out of Request.</p>
            <p>I need not again mention the Obligation our Land hath received from
the <hi>Royal</hi> Society, in making so great a Plantation of real knowledge in it.
'Twas high time at last when the Kingdom was settled on its proper <hi>Basis</hi>
to improve it with such strong and nervous knowledge, that would be
like the <hi>strong man</hi> keeping <hi>Possession</hi> in mens understandings, during which
either Poperies or Presbyteries <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi> cannot overthrow
our <hi>Quiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were in the Year 1599. reckoned in <hi>Christendom 2,25044 Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,</hi>
and from whence all the great Revenue there bestowed on men to
<hi>think,</hi> sent not perhaps one Notion of real Learning into the World. But
their professed business was to extinguish the light of Knowledge, and not
to increase it, and that which they made their real Study was to find out
Artifices to make Mankind fit still and quiet in the dark, and to invent
torments and punishments for those that would not do so: and to <hi>ridicule</hi>
those who pryed into nature and but looked toward Arithmetick and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
by the Name of <hi>Students</hi> of the <hi>black Art</hi> and <hi>Conjurers,</hi> a humour
that was not quite exterminated hence from the time of Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> to
my Lord <hi>Bacon:</hi> for our pious <hi>Martyrologer</hi> mentioning occasionaly Dr.
<hi>Dee</hi> the Mathematician, called him Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> the Conjurer.</p>
            <p>Thus Almighty God tho the first thing he made for the World in general
was external light, yet one of the last things he hath made or so much blessed
the World with, is real Learnings intellectual Light, and even that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we so knowingly converse with his works of Nature: and so careless
was Mankind in considering the frame of their own bodies, that Dr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>
a late Ornament of the <hi>Royal</hi> Society hath truely observed it in his
Book of <hi>Fermentation, That within the Compass of this last Century the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Anatomy hath been enriched by a full third part at least.</hi> Mankind
was so busie in murthering one anothers bodies of old under the Notion of
<hi>Christians,</hi> and afterward as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that it had no leisure to dissect
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103047:175"/>
them, and was wholly taken up by studying experiments of Cruelty equal
to the making of live Anatomies of each other. And tho the Holy
<hi>Iesus</hi> came into the World <hi>not to destroy mens lives but to save them,</hi> and
for that purpose tho the Divine <hi>Philanthropy</hi> chose that time for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the World when the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was arrived at a greater
heighth then ever before, yet by the depraved nature of man perverting
and corrupting the use of Religion, the fantastick vile sacrificing of men
hath since encreased.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Infanticidium</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi>'s that was presently after the Birth of the
<hi>Holy Child Iesus, Samuel Siderocrates</hi> saith, that there were slain of Infants
of 2 years old and under that Age, 444000: and <hi>Paulus Volzius</hi> makes
them to be a <hi>Million</hi> and 44 <hi>Thousand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And afterward among the Heathens, he was accounted the</hi> Magnus
Apollo, <hi>not who could find ways of saving, but destroying Christian
men. No fewer than seven Books were writ by</hi> Vlpian <hi>to shew
the several punishments that ought to be inflicted on Christians. And tho</hi>
Livy <hi>saith of the</hi> Romans, in hoc gloriari licet nulli gentium mitiores placu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse
paenas, <hi>yet</hi> Tacitus <hi>tells us of the Christians in the</hi> 15th <hi>Book of his</hi>
Annals, Primo correpti qui fatebantur, deinde indicio eorum multitudo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens
haud perinde in crimine incendii, quam odio humani generis convicti sunt.
Ea pereuntibus addita ludibria, aut ferarum tergis contecti, laniatu canum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terirent,
aut crucibus affixi aut flammandi, aut ubi defecisset dies in usum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturni
luminis urerentur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Several Authors relate it as a Decree of</hi> Nero'<hi>s,</hi> Quisquis Christianum se
esse confitetur, is tanquam generis humani convictus hostis, sine ulteriori sui
defensione, capite plectitor.</p>
            <p>Enough hath been already said to parallel the Cruelty of new <hi>Rome,</hi>
with that of old toward the Heterodox: and how ingenious the <hi>Virtuosi</hi>
of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> have been in finding out such torments for Heretics, as can
multiply one death into a thousand, I with horrour think of. How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
a submission and deference to the unaccountable Will of Heaven doth
this Consideration require, namely, that Christs <hi>little Flock</hi> even in the
<hi>Ark</hi> of his Church, is not only endangered by a deluge from without,
but by one within, and that of its own blood, and that the Sheep of Christ
appear to a common eye to be (as it were) made on purpose to feed the
<hi>grievous Wolves that are entred in among them,</hi> and as it may be supposed that
thousands of harmless Sheep were in the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> employed to feed,
perhaps about 20 <hi>pair</hi> of the hurtful Carnivorous Beasts: nay which is
more, that Heaven should permit such great slaughters of its <hi>little Flock</hi>
to feed the very vitiated fancies of the worst of men, as was before insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated!</p>
            <p>But who can without shame for depraved Mankind, and a heart inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bleeding, think of the result of the Popes Gift of <hi>America</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> where so many Millions of the poor Natives having had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
of the Law of Christianity, and were accountable to God only
for the violation of the Law of Nature, were so unnaturally murthered by
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that it would seem incredible that God <hi>having made of one
blood all Nations</hi> (as 'tis said in the <hi>Scripture</hi>) and there being <hi>a natural
Cognation between all Humane kind</hi> as the expression is in the <hi>Digests,</hi> they
should depopulate that part of the World of a greater number of Souls
than is now living in the flourishing Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> if that Famous
<hi>Spanish</hi> Bishop <hi>Bartholomaeus de las Casas</hi> hath made a true Estimate of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Cruelty in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> namely, that in about 45 years the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
by several monstrous Cruelties put to death 20 <hi>Millions</hi> of <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:103047:175"/>
At this rate of murderous Mankinds thus outraging one another, the
World would seem to be likely to end before it was (as I may say) to
purpose begun, I mean the purpose of God Almighty.</p>
            <p>But the thought of the shame of being outwitted by our Neighbour
Nations, and the fear of being outdone by them in strength, populousness
and riches, and our certain knowledge, (as was partly before hinted)
that toward the latter end of the World by the growing populousness of
Mankind, we must naturally and without any eye on prediction in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more and more <hi>hear of Wars and rumours of Wars,</hi> and the shame of
our encouraging a few Traders in <hi>Contraband</hi> Religions to hope they can
ever destroy the Peace and Trade of the Kingdom again, must (supposing
Heretics to be men) naturally make the former <hi>Mode</hi> of killing them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not more barbarous then ridiculous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir</hi> W. P. <hi>having in his excellent</hi> Manuscript, <hi>called</hi> Verbum sapienti
<hi>made excellent Computations of the</hi> wealth of the Kingdom, <hi>and of the</hi>
value of the People, <hi>and of</hi> the several expences of the Kingdom and of its
Revenues, <hi>and in his last</hi> Chapter <hi>there considered</hi> how to employ the People and
with what great industry, <hi>doth like a Noble</hi> Philosopher <hi>conclude it with these
two Queries and their Answers, viz.</hi> But when should we rest from this great
industry? I answer when we have certainly more Money than any of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
States, (tho never so little) both in Arithmetical and Geometrical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
(<hi>i. e.</hi> when we have more years Provision aforehand, and more present
Effects.) What then should we busie our selves about? I answer in ratiocinations
upon the Works and Will of God, to be supported not only by the indolency, but
also by the pleasure of the body, and not only by the tranquility but serenity
of the mind, and this exercise is the natural end of man in this World, and
that which best disposeth him for his Spiritual Happiness in that other which is
to come. The motions of the mind being the quickest of all others afford most
variety wherein is the very form and being of pleasure, and by how much the
more we have of this pleasure, by so much the more we are capable of it, <hi>ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thanks be to Heaven we have no <hi>Isthmus</hi> in Nature to dig through,
which yet by our many hands might be done. 'Tis but the removal of
the <hi>broken Fence and bowing Wall</hi> of a Religion-Trade, which we can well
look over and easily see through as now broken and bowing, and which is
the more loath'd for having so long and so much debarred us from real
Trade and real Knowledge, and too from real Religion, and this flowry
Coast will be as free to the feet of us <hi>Northern</hi> Heretics so called, as 'tis
now to our Eyes, and we through the effects of our populousness, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
necessitated to industry, be secured from any fear of sharing in a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick</hi>
Calculation that might be called, <hi>The Burthen of the North,</hi> made
by a late Author of a <hi>Discourse</hi> of Trade, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>without the
use of their Iron, will command all the Silver of the</hi> North <hi>and sweep it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thence by the over-balance of Trade.</hi> But after all the <hi>Souths</hi> raillery
on the <hi>North,</hi> they will find that the <hi>Northern</hi> half of the World hath
more Earth, more Men, more Ships and Sea-men, more Stars, more day,
and more light of the Gospel, and I may add, more good nature and
frankness, more bodily strength and fewer Plagues, and Earth-quakes
then the <hi>Southern.</hi> And where most people are 'tis no <hi>Heresy</hi> nor Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastic
<hi>Prophecy,</hi> to say that there will in time be most Trade: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by <hi>England</hi>'s not being afraid to throw the Die of War against both
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in the beginning of the Reign of the Royal
Martyr.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:103047:176"/>
As the over-balance of Trade is insensibly lost in any Country, it is
likewise so regained, and in time will appear regain'd, and like health in
the body of a man of a strong Vitals after his being seized by and recovered
from a <hi>Chronical</hi> Disease, and of the time of the beginning and ending of
which by unforeseen Accidents, no shadow of a Dial or sound of a Clock
could give the indication.</p>
            <p>I shall assign an instance of this in our own Kingdom. The <hi>Author</hi> of
<hi>Britannia languens</hi> calculates 2,50000 l. <hi>per Annum</hi> to have been formerly
at a <hi>Medium</hi> for 76 years brought into <hi>England</hi> by the balance of its whole
Trade in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Committees</hi> of Parliament have worthily laboured in several <hi>Sessions</hi> to
model and draw <hi>Bills</hi> for the making us wear our own Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and many who have writ <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Proposals</hi> about <hi>Trade,</hi> have
very honestly endeavoured to perswade us so to do. But as the saying is,
<hi>accidit in puncto,</hi> &amp;c. an <hi>Accident</hi> too low for our States-mens considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath for several years caused <hi>England</hi> to gain more then it did by the
aforesaid <hi>Balance</hi> of Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> the said 2,50000 <hi>l.</hi> at a <hi>Medium</hi> for 76
years; and this <hi>Accident</hi> is the general fashion of Womens wearing Crape.
And because I have conversed with none who has observed the effect of
this Accident, and which tho seeming small, is very momentous, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
(as many things in Trade do) like great Weights hanging some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on small Wires, I shall divert your Lordship by Calculating <hi>en pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi>
what <hi>England</hi> gains thereby, in such a way as the Nature of the thing
will bear, and may passable serve to have it done in.</p>
            <p>A pound of Wooll makes 15 yards of Crape. Each Female one with
another may be supposed to wear about 10 yards of Crape in her Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
There are in <hi>London</hi> probably about 100,000 Females that wear
Crape. It may be supposed that in all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> there being ten
times as many Females as in <hi>London,</hi> that one half of this proportion of
the <hi>London</hi> Crape-wearers may wear Crape in the Country, <hi>viz.</hi> half a
<hi>Million</hi> in all. It may be supposed therefore that the Crape-wearers one
with another wearing ten yards a piece, that five <hi>Millions</hi> of Yards of
Crape may be yearly worn in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and that one pound of
Wooll making fifteen yards of Crape will occasion the Consumption of a
third part of a Million of Pounds weight of Wooll <hi>per Annum, viz.</hi> 333000
and 333 pounds weight of Wooll which (accounting fine Wooll such as
makes Crape to be worth one Shilling <hi>per</hi> Pound) amounts to 16000 <hi>l.
Sterling.</hi> The labour of the People in Manufacturing the same, amounts
to about thirty times as much as the Wooll, <hi>viz.</hi> half a <hi>Million</hi> of Pounds
<hi>Sterling:</hi> and this yearly gain <hi>England</hi> cannot miss of while the Women
of the Court continue the fashion of wearing Crape, whom the Women
of the City and Country will imitate in their garb.</p>
            <p>If any shall think that the allowance of 10 yards to be yearly worn
by each Female Crape-wearer may seem too much, he may consider that
some Crape used by men about their Apparel, and the great quantity
thereof employed in shrouding the Dead, pursuant to the late <hi>Act</hi> (and
which but for the invention and use of the Manufacture of Crape, perhaps
would not have been effectually put in Execution) may probably incline
him to be of an opinion that <hi>England</hi> gains more vastly by this new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
of Crape, then I have supposed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ridiculing</hi> humour of so many in the Age, may perhaps move them
to think observations of this kind to be unimportant. But if any shall
take a Prospect of the substantial and great wisdom of our Ancestors in our
<hi>Statute-Book,</hi> he may find there 11 <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament about <hi>Thrums</hi> and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103047:176"/>
               <hi>Yarn,</hi> and many about <hi>Fustians,</hi> and 26 about <hi>Worsted,</hi> and <hi>Worsted-Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
and another Statute of <hi>Pouledavis:</hi> but there is that of moment in
my Account relating to <hi>England</hi>'s Gain from Crape, that after 145 Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
made to advance our Wooll and Drapery and Dyers and our Woollen
Manufactures, so much decayed in spight of them all, this seeming poor
little thing hath without any <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> enriched us.</p>
            <p>And many are the Foundations of Manufactures laid in our Country
Cities, and daily growing since the time that Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> Arch-Bishop of
<hi>York</hi> in his Speech in the Parliament of 1640. in defence of the Bishops Votes
observed, that <hi>Tapsters, Brewers, Inn-keepers, Taylors and Shoo-makers do
integrate and make up the body of our Country Cities and Incorporations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho the <hi>Northern</hi> Heretics are <hi>crasso sub aere nati,</hi> yet have they (as
was said) compensative Advantages from nature, and as if nature meant
them more then others for Lords of the Sea and Navigation, the
Pole of the <hi>Magnet</hi> which seateth it self <hi>North,</hi> hath been observed
to be always the most vigorous and strong Pole to all intents and purposes,
and the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Virtue impressed on the Earth is there more
strong likewise, I mean on the Church Land seized on from the Papal Idlers
and Burthens of that Earth to support the necessary defence of the State,
and therefore will necessarily attract mens Iron and their understandings
with Justice to keep it. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Geography</hi> in <hi>Folio</hi> tells
us, that <hi>'tis not so much the Authority of</hi> Calvin, <hi>or the Malignant Zeal
of</hi> Beza, <hi>or the impetuous Clamors of their Disciples which made the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Order to grow out of Credit, as the Avarice of some great Persons in
Court and State, who greedily gaped after the poor Remnant of their Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho nothing like an over-Balance of the Clergy in the wealth of
the Kingdom ought to have sunk that Order and its Revenue in <hi>England,</hi>
(where perhaps ten times as much is spent either on the <hi>Law</hi> or on <hi>Physick</hi>
as is on the Clergy) it need not be wondered at, that in those Countries of
the <hi>North</hi> where they are continually standing to their Arms at least of
defence, and Calculating their Provision for War, that the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Princes (as <hi>Heylin</hi> saith) have divided the Episcopal Function from its
Revenue assuming to themselves much of the latter, and sometime giving
part thereof to their Nobility, with the Title of Administrators of such a
Bishoprick, and of super-intendent to those who have there the Pastoral Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude,
and with some proportion of the Revenue for their maintenance not
much exceeding what is usually received by <hi>Calvinist</hi> Ministers.</p>
            <p>And if my Lord Primate <hi>Bramhal</hi> may pass for a good Casuistical Judge
of the Law of God, who in <hi>p.</hi> 39. of his <hi>just Vindication of the
Church of</hi> England, speaking of an excessive Revenue of the Clergy and
their over-balancing the Layety, saith, <hi>And if the excess be so exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
that it is absolutely and evidently destructive to the Constitution of the
Common-wealth (it is lawful upon some Conditions and Cautions not necessary to
be here inserted) to prune the superfluous Branches, and to reduce them to a
right temper and</hi> aequilibrium <hi>for the preservation and well being of the
whole Body Politick,</hi> and if any Credit ought to be given to the Account of
Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> shewed to me within these few hours, relating to the over-Balance
of the old Ecclesiastick Revenue here, after he had used all his
own diligence and that of others to prepare a Calculation of the same for
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and had sent 3 <hi>Reams</hi> of Paper of this to the <hi>Pope</hi> that are now
in his <hi>Archives,</hi> and had acquainted the Pope therein, <hi>That it was visible
that had not the Church here fallen into the Shipwrack of its Revenues, the
Ecclesiasticks had here in a short time insensibly rendred themselves Lords of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103047:177"/>
the whole Kingdom, and that there were more Colleges and Hospitals in</hi> England
<hi>than in</hi> France, <hi>which exceeds</hi> England <hi>by two thirds both in Lands and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of People,</hi> we may very well conclude that had any accidental force
in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time renversed the alienation of the Church Lands, that
force would not have long continued, and should any as wild Imaginers
may suppose, happen for the future here, or perhaps in other Kingdoms of
the <hi>North,</hi> those Lands would soon appear to all to have such a <hi>Magnetical</hi>
Vertue as is in the <hi>Globe</hi> of the Earth, whereby as to its natural points
it disposeth it self to the <hi>Poles,</hi> being so framed and ordered to those points
that those parts which are now at the <hi>Poles</hi> would not naturally abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Aequator,</hi> nor <hi>Green-land</hi> remain in the place of <hi>Magellanica;</hi> and
thus it may be said that if the whole Earth were violently removed,
it would not forsake its Primitive Points nor pitch in the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West,</hi>
but very soon return to its <hi>Polary</hi> position again, and resemblingly in any
new forced over-balance of those Church Lands, the very dull Earth's
<hi>Animus revertendi,</hi> to the just libration of States and Kingdoms would
soon be apparent; and neither the <hi>Popes</hi> moving the Earth, or even <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi>
his doing it would have been of any importance: and the Papal
Pride elevating him to say with <hi>Lucifer sedebo in monte testamenti in lateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Aquilonis, I will sit in the sides of the North</hi> would soon be attended
with the Exclamation of <hi>How art thou fallen, O Lucifer, Son of the Morning,</hi>
&amp;c. and, <hi>Is this the man that made the Earth to tremble? France</hi> that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
exceeded <hi>England</hi> by two thirds in the number of People in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s time when Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> made his Estimate thereof, did securely
heretofore suffer great numbers of its People to be unemployed in it, as
namely, the Beggars and others of the lower ranks, and through want of
opportune means of subsisting at home to seek their Fortunes abroad, and
that not as 'tis in the Case of so many <hi>Scots</hi> yearly leaving their Country,
(the which perhaps is not able well to nourish more Inhabitants than it
hath) but through the abovementioned want of encouragement to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that opulent and fertile Kingdom, a Kingdom that <hi>Grotius</hi> doth
but right to, when in the Dedicatory Epistle of his <hi>De jure belli &amp; pacis</hi> to
<hi>Lewis</hi> the just, having mentioned the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> he saith, <hi>which
Kingdom only is better then yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis no wonder if the <hi>Ministers</hi> and Counsellors of State there did not
concern themselves to make rational Estimates of the growing Populous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, and particularly of <hi>England,</hi> when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that kind was perhaps so much as attempted here before the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inferences of the Observator on the <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> made about the
same.</p>
            <p>As to the former unconcernedness of <hi>France</hi> in preserving or encreasing
the numbers of its People, there is an observation of Sir <hi>Thomas Culpeper</hi>
Knight, in his <hi>Discourse</hi> about <hi>Vsury</hi> where he saith, France <hi>tho so good a
soyle lies half of it waste, the Natives even loathing their own Country, and
burdening all the habitable World with their beggarly Colonies, one third of
the Lacqueys and Valets in</hi> Europe <hi>being</hi> French <hi>Men.</hi> Witness <hi>Dr.</hi> Heylin
who tells us, that <hi>once at</hi> Madrid <hi>they banished them all as dangerous for their
numbers, finding the</hi> French <hi>Servants in that Town alone to exceed Thirty
Thousand, so just and natural is it for oppression to disarm it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have already mentioned it that the present Great <hi>French</hi> Monarch,
not more renowned for his <hi>Armaforis</hi> then his <hi>Consilium domi,</hi> and his able
Counsellors there, doth by Accurate Measures study the encrease of his
People, and 'tis very remarkable that in the <hi>Code Loüys</hi> which he publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>April,</hi> 1667. he made some <hi>Ordinances</hi> with great care for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistring</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:103047:177"/>
the <hi>Christenings</hi> and <hi>Marriages</hi> and <hi>Burials</hi> in each <hi>Parish</hi> in his
<hi>Realm,</hi> as appears by <hi>Title 20. Article</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. there from <hi>p.</hi>
107, to 112. and with much more exactness then the Bills of Mortality in
our <hi>Metropolis</hi> are ordered, and the which that Great Prince thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be enjoyned in his <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi> having perhaps been informed by
his Ministers that many Political Inferences as to the knowing the numbers
of People and their encrease in any State are to be made from the Bills of
Mortality, on the occasion of some such published about 3 years before
by the Observator on the Bills of Mortality in <hi>England,</hi> and where tho
many are apt to think that the <hi>Registring</hi> of the <hi>Births</hi> of People was first
used and invented by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8<hi>ths</hi> time; yet is the thing as old
as the ancient times of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and among them introduced by <hi>Servius
Tullius,</hi> who to ascertain the number of Births and Burials, ordered that when
a Child was born, the Kindred of the Child should bring a piece of Money
into the <hi>Aerarium</hi> of <hi>Iuno Lucina,</hi> and so likewise in the Exchequer of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
libitina</hi> when any died or came to Age. And this Custom being quite
abolished, was revived by <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> at the Birth of Children as <hi>Lips.</hi>
on <hi>Tacit.</hi> observes.</p>
            <p>But what was worthy of the <hi>French</hi> King's providing for the stability
of his Throne, he further ordered an exact <hi>Registry</hi> to be took of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his half Subjects, I mean the <hi>Regulars</hi> and <hi>Seculars</hi> by the following
<hi>Articles</hi> there, namely, the 15<hi>th, 16th, 17th,</hi> in that Title.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Pepys</hi> that Great Treasurer of Naval and Maritime Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and of that great Variety of the Learning which we call <hi>recondita
eruditio,</hi> having Communicated to me the sight of a Paper mentioning
that in the whole Number of Men in the Realm of <hi>Spain,</hi> long since when
by secret Survey, there were returned a 11 <hi>Hundred</hi> and 25 <hi>Thousand</hi> and
3 <hi>Hundred</hi> and 90 Men, (and which secret <hi>Survey</hi> I suppose was made some
time before the Year 1588.) I observed that the number of the Regular
and Secular Clergy was not included in that Survey.</p>
            <p>But I think the numbring of the many Regulars there who (no doubt) so
often say in their hearts, <hi>Nos numerus sumus,</hi> &amp;c. had been of as much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the Government, as the numbering of the Lay-men, and for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of which the <hi>Code Loüis</hi> hath as aforesaid so carefully provided, and
thereby made the prudence of this <hi>French</hi> Kings <hi>Code</hi> outweigh <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s,
and hath discovered to the World the acuteness of his understanding, to be
not inferior to that of his Sword. And the Expences of the Crown being
under the Government of this Monarch so very much greater than in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
time, have necessarily occasioned such an exact knowledge of the
Numbers and Wealth of his Realm, as hath provided him his strong Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
for War.</p>
            <p>Thuanus <hi>on the</hi> Year 1615. <hi>tells us how that</hi> Lewis <hi>the 13th,</hi> Having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
some Persons to compute his Expences and Receipts for the Year 1614.
That one and twenty Millions and fifty thousand Livres. <hi>i. e. (at</hi> 20d. <hi>a Livre)</hi>
one Million, 7 Hundred, 54 Thousand, 66 Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> were issued out
of the Exchequer, <hi>and that</hi> 17 Millions <hi>and</hi> 8 Hundred Thousand Livres,
<hi>i. e.</hi> 1 Million, 4 Hundred, 83 Thousand, 3 Hundred 30 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> were
brought into it, and so his Expences then exceeded his Receipts three Millions
seven Hundred Thousand Livres: <hi>i. e.</hi> 2 Hundred 70 Thousand 8 Hundred
33 <hi>l. Sterling: and beside those</hi> Receipts <hi>and</hi> Expences <hi>the</hi> Historian <hi>saith,
that</hi> there were eighteen Millions of Livres Collected out of the Provinces <hi>i. e.</hi>
1 Million 5 Hundred 8 Thousand 3 Hundred Thirty Three Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi>
and which were distributed in them for the Pay of the Officers there employed
for other Expences there. <hi>So that the Expences and Receipts of that Crown
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103047:178"/>
since the Year 1614. were more then quadrupled in the Year 1673, of the
which I mentioned the Total before and abstracted the same from a Paper
that some Merchants gave in to the Loyal long Parliament, wherein the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Sums accruing from the respective</hi> Generalities <hi>in</hi> France <hi>are set
down, as likewise others are in</hi> Klockius de aerario <hi>for another Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have already found that it is not so many of our Peoples taking the
name of this great and wise Monarch in vain, that will do our Business,
or their wishing the Ocean of the Wealth of that Kingdom exhausted
that will do it; and 'tis now visible to all that nothing can prevent its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
but the stopping up the Rivers of Money that run into that Sea, from
our Countries and others for the Commodities and Manufactures of that
Kingdom, that can only produce that effect, and which not so much our
hatred of <hi>France,</hi> as love of our selves will necessitate us to produce, and
which therefore must stop up the Rivers of Contributions, that from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
or Enthusiastic People formerly ran into the Religion-Trade, and
then the great Cry of <hi>Templum Domini</hi> get as little Wooll from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as it hath brought to it, and the zeal of the very <hi>Vox populi</hi> drive such
<hi>Buyers and Sellers and Money changers</hi> out of it that formerly made it <hi>a Den
of Thieves:</hi> and indeed if it should be supposed that the Balance of solid
Trade should continue for the future to be against us, to the proportion it
has been estimated of late years, neither <hi>Papists</hi> nor <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would
be able to maintain a double Clergy as now they do, I mean their own,
and that by Law established.</p>
            <p>'Tis fresh in Memory that the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> in the Kings long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
ordered the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the <hi>Customs</hi> to compute for them
what Goods went hence to <hi>France</hi> in a year, and their value, and what in
that time came from thence hither and their value, and that they computed
that the value of those exported hence into <hi>France</hi> was about 1 <hi>hundred</hi>
and 70 <hi>thousand</hi> Pounds, and the value of those imported here from <hi>France</hi>
was about 1 <hi>Million</hi> and a half, beside 6 or 7 <hi>hundred thousand Pounds</hi> worth
of Goods, they supposed were brought in by stealth as Silks, Embroyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> at which rate 'tis possible we may have about a 3<hi>d</hi> part of the
Current Money of <hi>England</hi> yearly carried into it: and indeed all our grave
Laws against sending Money <hi>in Specie</hi> out of the Country when the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Trade is against us, are but <hi>hedging in the Cuckow:</hi> and so we have
by necessity of Nature the Prospect of a busie World before us, that we
may recover that <hi>Balance</hi> on our side. And during that Conjuncture of
<hi>Business</hi> all the Nerves of our Minds must be extended to prevent our doom,
from that forementioned Sentence of late so much in <hi>vogue,</hi> and which I
have heard some men living falsly vouch'd for the Authors of, <hi>viz. Res
nolunt malè administrari;</hi> for it is in <hi>Tully,</hi> who I suppose had it from <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
to whom <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> who died 949 years ago, refers in his <hi>Axio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata
Philosophica</hi> printed at <hi>London</hi> in 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, as the Author of it in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint

Among <hi>Bedes</hi> works 2d Tome <hi>p.</hi> 151. the <hi>Axiome</hi> is thus worded,
<hi>Nolunt entia malè gubernari.</hi> Men may ill Administer their understandings,
as by Credulity, Supineness and the like, and they may think by the Artifice
of Laws to pinion the wings of our riches from flying away, and as absurdly
as <hi>Sylla</hi> would by an <hi>Edict</hi> be judged fair: but things meant by the
word <hi>entia</hi> or <hi>being</hi> will not be ill administred: and 'tis easier to fix Quick-silver
then the <hi>being</hi> of our Silver here, if our importations preponderate.
The gravity of our Laws can no more make it stay still here than the
<hi>Vox populi,</hi> and the Almanacks can make a real <hi>Solstice,</hi> or the Sun at the
time of the year they call the <hi>Solstice</hi> not to move forward in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi>
as much as at any other times.</p>

The <hi>Being</hi> of Money in a populous Country that hath no competent
Mines in it, depends on the <hi>Being</hi> of Trade, and the <hi>Being</hi> of the so many
Millions of Mouths in our Realm, will necessitate the Millions of hands
to work, and the growing dearness of Provisions, and cheapness of Wages
will enforce men to work harder, and the <hi>res parta labore</hi> will not be ill
administred, nor sacrificed to Idlers, nor false Gods as formerly
find true Perfumes here, nor Metaphysical <hi>Entities</hi> or Notions rob
men of useful Chymical <hi>Essences,</hi> or rob Kingdoms of their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and enriched, by destroying the <hi>Beings</hi> or Lives of so many Men as
Hereticks, and <hi>Beings</hi> that the Papacy endeavouring to administer ill,
and by its enslaving men making <hi>Persons res,</hi> caused so many defections
from it; nor that precious thing called time suffer it self to be ill admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
by Presbyterians erecting ten thousand new <hi>Tribunals,</hi> or (as one
may call them) Ecclesiastical Courts of <hi>Pye-powder,</hi> that is one in each
of our Parishes, when as those men have been heard to complain of the
Grievances Trade hath found from one Court-Christian in a Diocess: and
the same necessity which did make our Manufacturing Peoples Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
for their Daily Bread to be the <hi>ingenii largitor,</hi> or whet their Wits for
the invention of Crape, may in all probability produce Manufactures of
Hemp and Flax as considerable as that of Wooll hath been and is,
which I think must naturally happen from the many <hi>French</hi> Protestants
and others here lately planted, and a more important Linen Manufacture
be here by them introduced, then was the woollen one set up by the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Protestants, whom the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Persecution brought hither: and
which no <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament here or Projects of Work-houses would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
have effected, or necessity else have brought in among us in some
Ages. And hence will a great improvement of our Land and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our People probably happen by the sowing of Hemp and Flax,
for which so much Money goes out yearly hence <hi>in specie,</hi> and then design
of sowing which hath hitherto proved Abortive in several Parliaments,
and particularly in one of the last Parliaments of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and
likewise in the King's long Parliament. Considering how easie it will be
for those of the <hi>French</hi> Nation who are here, and who were used to make
Canvas and Sail-cloth for our Naval uses, (and for which <hi>France</hi> hath
long had so much Money from us) to make it here and by the Bait of
the Gain thereby accruing, to engage several of our Poor to work in that
Manufacture, our Nation is not likely to be long without it here advanced,
and many of our People therein busied: and 'twill easily appear necessary to
all to promote the making the same here, who shall recollect that the <hi>French</hi>
King in that last War with him did forbid the importing it hither. And
that coarser Manufacture once introduced will naturally make way for
the Manufacture of fine Linen, and those Manufactures found generally
gainful will naturally employ the Proprietors of Land in sowing great part
of the same with Hemp and Flax, and our good Land hereby retriving
its former value of years purchace, be no longer ill administred.</p>

               <hi>I believe therefore that if shortly the</hi> Curious <hi>abroad shall send to their

that old Question,</hi> Quid rerum nunc geritur in Anglia, <hi>The</hi> Return <hi>they will
receive from</hi> England <hi>will be to the following effect,</hi> viz. That People in
that Noble and very Populous Country do there mind things, that the
Trade <hi>of words is spoiled,</hi> that the business of sowing Tares is over, and that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103047:179"/>
he will be the <hi>inimicus homo</hi> to himself who doth it; that the sowing the
Wind of Errors in the Church, and the reaping the Whirl-wind of Confusion in
the State is grown hateful: that they have done weaving of <hi>jus Divinum,</hi> and
dying of Religion with false Colours, and preparing Nets and Snares of death
for one another: <hi>and that the most ungovernable</hi> Animals troubling others
with Projects of Government of the Church is out of fashion; that they have
done there with Science falsly so called, and <hi>quae non habet amicum nisi igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem,</hi>
and with Trade falsly so called, the false Religion-one that hath no
friend but the knave; that their eyes are there opened and they see, that <hi>res
accendunt lumina rebus,</hi> and their hands are at work in Trade and Lucre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
turpitude; that they can no more be brought <hi>like St.</hi> Francis <hi>his Novice to
set Plants with the head downward,</hi> nor at the instigation of factious Heads of
Religionary Parties, to do with their Notions as <hi>Fryar</hi> Iohn <hi>at his</hi> Abbots
<hi>Command, did with a</hi> dry withered stick which he planted, and twice a day
for a whole year fetched water two Miles off to water it, <hi>and omitting it no
Festival day;</hi> that they speak more of <hi>Christ and talk less of Anti-Christ,</hi>
and do promote Christianity by solid Industry and Charity; and the living there
are Aparrel'd with their own Linen as the Dead are with their own Wooll,
and are grown so dexterous in the Linen Trade that it may be said of them
what <hi>Klockius</hi> doth of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> 'tis to be doubted, <hi>plusne in lanificio an
vero in linificio illi praestent;</hi> and thus by means <hi>of a true and undefiled and
laborious Religion</hi> there, <hi>Antichristus lino periit,</hi> as I may say with Allusion
to a forementioned Phrophecy. The Genius and Interest that <hi>England</hi> hath in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Conjunctures been intent on devouring the Religion-Trade (and which still
hath slip'd from its seisure) hath now at last effectually swallowed it up:
and just as a Cormorant swallowing an Eel, and the Eel slipping out through its
Body, is soon by that potent Creature again swallowed, and again slipping
through its Body, is at last certainly macerated and dissolv'd in its Stomach,
and still the Cormorant hath weakened the Eel in its passage through it, thus
hath it in <hi>England</hi> fared with the <hi>Religion-Trade:</hi> that as <hi>Luther</hi> said of
one great point in Religion, it was <hi>doctrina stantis &amp; cadentis Ecclesiae,</hi> the
Notion of the not getting or losing by Religion there, is accounted the <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
stantis &amp; cadentis Reipublicae.</hi> That time hath laid so close and long a
Siege to the Popish and Presbyterian Religion-Trade, that as it was in the
Siege of <hi>Ostend,</hi> there is no more Earth left it to defend. That as Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
observe of <hi>superfetation</hi> in Women, if it be made with considerable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
the latter most commonly proves Abortive, for that the first being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
engrosseth the Aliment from the other, it hath happened so in <hi>England</hi>
to the superfetation of Reformation. That the Trade of Reformation unduely
prosecuted by Art, hath been diverted by the Reformation of Trade resulting
from Nature, and the over spreading the Land with such a great and useful
<hi>Linen-Trade</hi> and Materials for the same, as hath in a manner exterminated
Poverty from the same.</p>
            <p>And while now <hi>Nature</hi> seems to Court our Expectation with the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of this new <hi>Scheme</hi> of Trade, and Manufacture, (and which
perhaps will stay with us till the <hi>Scheme or fashion of this World shall
finally pass away</hi>) I shall take occasion to discharge my self of a promise I
long ago made to your Lordship, when you were Treasurer of the Navy,
which was to send you an account of the rough Hemp and Flax, and Sail-Cloth,
and of all the other Manufactures of Hemp and Flax, imported
into <hi>England</hi> yearly: and now that it may appear what quantities of
<hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> and the <hi>Manufactures</hi> thereof have been here imported,
and from what Countries, and that thereby we may usefully take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
about the proportion, to which this new Trade and improvement of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103047:179"/>
our Land should at least be advanced, and because likewise the former
measures of computing what <hi>Sail-Cloth</hi> and <hi>fine</hi> Linen have been here
imported, were taken generally from blundering Estimates and random
Calculations, and that we may see it possible, tho <hi>France</hi> hath got the start
of us in the Linen Manufacture, that we may yet overtake it in the Race,
for that 'tis apparent tho much Sail-Cloth, yet little or no fine Linen
hath thence come to us, I shall here entertain your Lordship with
an <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Linen-Cloth, Canvas, Linen Yarn, Hemp, Flax</hi> and
<hi>Cordage</hi> imported into the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1668. to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi>
1669. which was drawn up for me by the favour of one of the
late Farmers of the Customs. I happened to make choice of that year
for the quantity of those importations, as being a year of Peace, but was
since told by the Merchants that that year being the second after the Fire
of <hi>London,</hi> there was then imported into <hi>London</hi> about a 3<hi>d</hi> part less of
those Commodities than was in common years; the which happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the year before being the next after the Fire, an extraordinary glut
of those Goods was then brought in.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship thereby seeing what then came into the Port of <hi>London,</hi>
will in effect see what came into the whole Kingdom, the <hi>Out-Ports</hi>
bearing a proportion of a 3<hi>d</hi> to that of <hi>London:</hi> and by finding that we
have so much Hemp from the <hi>East Countries</hi> now we are put to it to go to
Market there with ready Money instead of our woollen Manufactures as
formerly, (as we likewise do for our <hi>Pitch</hi> and <hi>Tar,</hi> and <hi>Masts</hi>) find that
we are more closely concerned in point of interest, to have our <hi>Hemp</hi>
provided at home.</p>
            <p>And it will appear high time for us to begin somewhat like a Linen
Manufacture, when a running view of this Account presents us with so
great a quantity of old Sheets imported from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> (tho
perhaps designed by us for our <hi>Plantations</hi>) and of <hi>Linen Yarn</hi> and some
<hi>Linen</hi> from <hi>Scotland:</hi> and since in that year by an Abstract of the exportations
of <hi>Ireland</hi> I have seen, that Country so long unsettled, had yet so much <hi>Linnen
Yarn</hi> and <hi>Linen Cloth</hi> for its own use, that 522 pieces of <hi>Linen Cloth</hi> of
40 Ells in a <hi>Piece,</hi> and 4 <hi>Thousand 6 Hundred,</hi> and 25 <hi>Hundred</hi> weight
of Linen Yarn then were thence exported.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Account</hi> I mentioned is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

That little sowing of Hemp and Flax here that hath been, hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
met with as much encouragement as this comes to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, that 'tis
all bought up by the years end: and in our way to the Manufactures of
Hemp, the above Account doth so far encourage us as to let us see that
almost all our Cordage is made in <hi>England;</hi> and since by some Accounts
I have seen of the Importations in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> almost as much Hemp
and Flax is there brought in yearly as into the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi>
the necessity that will be driving us on to the Linen Manufacture, will be
accompanied with this comfortable Consideration, that as 'tis possible for
us to overtake <hi>France</hi> therein, so we may <hi>Holland</hi> (at least in the making of
Sail-Cloth) in regard we may if we will have as much Hemp and Flax
growing in our own Soil as they send for to <hi>Riga</hi> and elsewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Protestants at <hi>Ipswich</hi> have lately made finer Linen than
ever was made in <hi>England,</hi> namely, of 15<hi>s.</hi> the <hi>Ell:</hi> and for which tho
they had their Linen Yarn from <hi>France,</hi> yet afterward they sowed Flax
near <hi>Ipswich</hi> whereof to make Yarn, and it was observed to grow so high,
that the People resorted from all parts adjacent of the Country to see it,
they having never seen any so high before.</p>
            <p>A Judgment so penetrating as your Lordships will easily find how the
said <hi>Account</hi> may be many ways useful to the publick in point of Trade,
as for example, the Consideration is obvious that those Countries we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no Hemp or Flax or their Manufactures from, we may profitably
in the way of Traffick hereafter carry them to, and by that means know
our proper Markets, as particularly <hi>Spain, Italy, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That great <hi>Bankrupsy</hi> in <hi>London</hi> that hath thence like a Plague infected
so many of our Country Traders, and laid there too so much Land in
some sort desolate, will by natural necessity oblige them to countenance this
improvement of the Realm by new Commodities and Manufactures: and
that which hath in many of our poor <hi>Idlers,</hi> Created such an Aversion
from the sowing of <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> namely, the toyle of beating the
same, will soon cease by the acquainting them with the Invention of a
<hi>Mill</hi> near a Rivolet by which as much Hemp may be beaten in a day as
can be by two hundred men: and they who have been incessant in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of others being <hi>French</hi> Pensioners, and thought themselves slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
because they were not so, shall by the Protestants of that Nation thus
leading us by the hand to a rich Manufacture, find <hi>France</hi> to have thus
sent Donatives to our whole Land. And from the example of their innate
Loyalty to their Hereditary Monarch, and thankfulness to ours for their
protection, I doubt not but many of our Male-contents will imbibe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of obedience to Government and a sense of their safety under that <hi>Asy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum:</hi>
and such persons whatever their pretensions are, will deserve ill of the
Kingdom and its Trade and Manufacture, who by their excessive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the danger of Popery and of the <hi>Fantome</hi> of that pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
frighting us out of our Laws, shall really deter more such Protestant
Strangers from planting among us. But as men may be said to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by shame from fearing any thing in throngs, and where they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from robbery, and can suffer only by <hi>petty Larceny,</hi> so I believe will
this populous State of our Country insensibly wear off the excess of our
fears; and do expect such a future State in <hi>England</hi> as will make men asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of their past fears, and their former deference to ill bodeing <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gassendus</hi> in his <hi>Works</hi> tells us, that <hi>all the Astrologers of</hi> France <hi>concluded,
that by reason of the great Conjunction of watry signs in</hi> Piscis <hi>and</hi> Aquarius
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103047:182"/>
               <hi>in the Year 1524, that there should then be another deluge in that Realm,
and in</hi> Germany, <hi>in the Month of</hi> February, <hi>a rainy Month, and that many
of the People thereupon went with their Goods and Cattel from the Low Lands
to the hilly Country, and yet that Month proved the driest Month that ever
was known:</hi> and thus do I expect that many of our Melancholy Prophets
in <hi>England</hi> will be <hi>toto caelo,</hi> mistaken in their auguries. And if natural
Considerations did not induce me thus to foretel good to my Country,
another Consideration might tempt me to predict ill, namely, the warding
off all the risque of a false Prophet: for among the <hi>Iews</hi> if a man prophesied
of future ill to a Person or State, and it came not to pass, he was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pronounced a false Prophet, by reason of the infinite goodness of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
inclining the Divine Nature to avert its threatned Anger; but if he
Prophesied of good Success, and it happened not, he was then reputed a
false Prophet, for that (<hi>they said</hi>) Heaven never cancelled a Decree of
Mercy.</p>
            <p>Considering how often things at random predicted have come to pass,
and tho like Seeds carelessly thrown into the Field of Time have yet
grown up, and how many even of the higher <hi>Class</hi> of understandings,
have been tempted to believe the predictions of the illiterate, and that
such could read the Book of Fate who yet could read no other (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> and Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> being tainted with some belief
of the <hi>holy Maid</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi>'s Sayings, or at least seeming so to be) and that the
prediction of things as I partly before hinted may help as a Natural Cause
to give them Birth, I wishing so well to my Country and its Religion by
Law Established, have however adventured from Natural Causes to give
my judgment for the future State thereof as I have done, not despairing of
its influences on some present Despairers.</p>
            <p>And moreover the <hi>Class</hi> of <hi>Magna nomina,</hi> who have faulter'd in their
measures of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> is so great that an obscure mistaken person may well
hope to hide himself among them</p>

               </gap>s <hi>Doleman,</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Succession,</hi> doth <hi>p.</hi> 258. give
his final Conjecture of the great future Event of the Succession after the
death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> saying, <hi>My opinion is that this Affair cannot possibly
be ended by any possibility moral without some War at leastwise for sometime at
the beginning,</hi> and gives his reasons for that his opinion. And how all our hot
Apocalyptick Men and <hi>Teazers</hi> of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> have erred in the times of the
great Changes they have predicted in the World, is obvious: and therefore
the most sagacious of that sort of <hi>Expositers,</hi> have made the things they
have foretold to be far distant in time, and before which they knew they
should long be in the number of <hi>Non entes doctores,</hi> as one calls the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi>
and thus likewise the ingenious <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Treatise of Taxes and
Contributions,</hi> printed in <hi>London</hi> 1667, doth <hi>p.</hi> 23. say, that <hi>Before five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years we may be all transplanted from hence into</hi> America, <hi>these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
being over-run with Turks and made wast as the Seats of the famous
Eastern Empires at this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> our pious <hi>Vates,</hi> made Religion standing a <hi>tiptoe</hi> to take its flight
thither many years ago. And the ingenious <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Zelanders Choice</hi>
hath therein told us that the <hi>French</hi> would never part with <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> and
that our King's <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Indulgence</hi> would never be recalled; but the
contrary happened in both Cases, and the <hi>Vote</hi> of the <hi>House of Commons</hi>
in order to his Majesties recalling the latter, was carried by the Party there
favouring the Nonconformists, and could not have been without them,
which that Author did not foresee, and that those Nonconformists would
be well neither full nor fasting, and therefore their reflections on the King's
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103047:182"/>
Ministers for denying Indulgence to them since, ought to be very
gentle.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Martyrology</hi> in one <hi>Volume</hi> p. 694. gives us this conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural
prediction that the Turk will seize <hi>Rome,</hi> and founds one of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for it on the 18 <hi>Ch.</hi> of the <hi>Rev.</hi> and that he shall consume it with
fire, and <hi>Ribera</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14th of the <hi>Rev.</hi> saith, <hi>Romam igitur

Neither Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> nor the <hi>Iesuite</hi> name any particular time when <hi>Rome</hi> shall
be consumed with Fire: but many whose Enthusiastic fancies have played
with the fire of <hi>Rome,</hi> adventured to lay the Scene of its ruine in the
<hi>Year</hi> 1666: and to assert this, a Latin <hi>Book</hi> was professedly writ and called,
<hi>Romae ruina finalis Anno Dom.</hi> 1666. and printed in <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi>
1663. in the Title whereof 'tis said, that <hi>Rome</hi> shall be <hi>incendio delenda,</hi>
in the <hi>Year</hi> 1666.</p>
            <p>And no doubt our many Prophetic Writers that read that Sentence as
from Gods Tribunal, that <hi>Rome</hi> shall be destroyed that year, angered the
<hi>Conclave</hi> there; and they might well think that to such hot heads there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
incendiary hands; and accordingly as it was before cited out of
the Pamp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>let called, <hi>The Arts and pernicious designs of</hi> Rome, <hi>wherein is
shewn what are the Aims of the Iesuites,</hi> &amp;c. the Author makes <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration
of</hi> London (<hi>in case it were a practice of Humane Contrivance) to
have been caused by</hi> Rome <hi>and the Consistory there, and the Iesuites as being
willing to signalize that year of 666, with some remarkable mischief done to
Protestants in check to the fancies of some that predicted</hi> Romes <hi>utter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
then,</hi> 'tis possible that they might grant against our City the <hi>reprisal</hi>
of performances for our Prophecies against theirs: which if they did was
a Revenge very disproportionate; for according to that rule of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
revenge,</hi> namely, an <hi>Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth,</hi> they
should only have equipped Airy Prophecies against us, and not Fire-ships,
and by a little obvious Art have hounded the <hi>number of the Beast</hi> 666 upon
us. And though I am sufficiently convinced by the Quotations out of the
<hi>Canon</hi> Law, and the <hi>Canonists</hi> referred to in <hi>Gundissalvus</hi> that the <hi>Tenet</hi> of
<hi>burning whole Cities if the Majority thereof are Hereticks, is chargeable</hi> on
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>approved</hi> by it, and tho the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> and two
Houses of <hi>Commons,</hi> and the Magistrates of <hi>London</hi> have given their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Causers of that Fire as aforesaid, and tho one of our great
<hi>Divines</hi> and whose <hi>Name</hi> all Protestants in our Land must mention with
great honour, Dr. <hi>William Lloyd</hi> Dean of <hi>Bangir,</hi> hath in his <hi>Funeral
Sermon</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmund Godfrey</hi> p. 38. speaking of the <hi>incredible patience
found in the Citizens of</hi> London <hi>at the time of its Conflagration, as an effect
of the Protestant Religion,</hi> further said, <hi>Tho so many believed and very few
much doubted whence it came, that it was from the same hands which we justly
suspect for this wickedness</hi> (meaning the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmund Godfrey) yet
was there no Tumult rose upon it, no violence done that extended to the life of
any Person,</hi> yet shall I never without the knowledge of convincing proofs
of such a Fact projected, or modelled by some in Authority in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Spiritual Guides of our Lay-Papists, charge the <hi>Odium</hi>
of the Fact on more of them than make the least of numbers, nor yet the
allowance of this <hi>Tenet</hi> on the generality of Papists here at home, or
abroad in the World, and would say that as <hi>infallible</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> was, <hi>he
knew not what spirit he was of,</hi> when he thus in his Law called for <hi>fire</hi> on
Heretical <hi>Cities;</hi> I allude to our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words to the Disciples that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103047:183"/>
importun'd him to call for Fire from Heaven to burn the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Author of the forementioned Pamphlet,
called the <hi>Arts of Rome,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>Epistle</hi> of it, saith of the Jesuites and
Fryars, that <hi>what they hold lawful to be done, they may be justly presumed to do
whensoever opportunity serves, and that they see it conducible to their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to do it.</hi> Thus likewise <hi>Iudges</hi> of Ecclesiastical <hi>Courts</hi> when the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Nullity of a Marriage by reason of <hi>fear</hi> resulting from
<hi>threatnings</hi> is before them, do carefully regard this point concerning the
<hi>Menacer, an solitus est minas exequi,</hi> a thing the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have not been
wanting to do, when Power and Opportunity have not been wanting:
and there is no doubt but the <hi>Iesuites</hi> by reason of their 4th <hi>Vow</hi> to the
Pope, over and above the Implicit Obedience they have sworn to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
are to execute whatever he shall command: nor is it doubtable
but that when it is said by the <hi>Canonists</hi> that the Pope hath power to burn
Heretical Cities, he will reduce that Power into Act when he sees conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient;
and as Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> in his <hi>Pseudo Martyr</hi> well notes, <hi>the Lawyers
teach us that the word</hi> potest <hi>doth often signifie</hi> actum: for which he quotes
<hi>Bartolus</hi> on the <hi>Digests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe the truth of his <hi>Computation</hi> where he saith in <hi>p.</hi> 228 of that
<hi>Book, That the Iesuites are in poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssion of most of the Papists hearts in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
but I likewise believe his other <hi>Computation</hi> in that <hi>Book,</hi> where in
<hi>p.</hi> 127. he saith, quoting <hi>Rebadenira, that in the Year 1608. the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Society of the Iesuites were</hi> 10581. and that tho their number
is much encreased since, there are not so many in <hi>England</hi> as were when
the Book was printed, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anno</hi> 1610. and the <hi>Dr.</hi> whose <hi>Style</hi> was as
the <hi>Oxford Antiquities</hi> say of Mr. <hi>Foxes, in Romanenses satis acerbus,</hi> (tho
I think neither of their Styles was so a jot too much) doth in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10th of
that <hi>Book,</hi> very learnedly and largely shew that many Eminent and Popish
Writers have bitterly inveighed against <hi>Gratian</hi> the <hi>Compiler</hi> of the <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
of the <hi>Canon Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt that Law was never <hi>in gross</hi> received in <hi>England,</hi> in the times
of our Popish Ancestors, and so neither did nor doth bind <hi>English</hi> Papists
in the Court of Conscience, more than the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth in some
Popish Countries where it never was received: and I find <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cited
by the <hi>Dr.</hi> for saying, that <hi>there are many things in the Decretal Epistles
which do not make a matter to be</hi> de fide, <hi>but only do declare what the opinions
of the Popes were in such cases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe that no <hi>un-jesuited</hi> Papist (nor perhaps some sober Party in
that Order) will think the worse of me for calling the <hi>Decretum</hi> of the
Popes Canon Law, by reason of its empowering him thus to burn Cities,
<hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rrendum Decretum:</hi> and it may perhaps appear ridiculous as well as horrid
in the Pope in that Law, to rake in the Ashes of sweet St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> for fire to
burn Heretical Towns, and to make him, who was in a manner Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by the Pope for rebaptizing such as were baptized by Hereticks, to be
the Founder of that wild <hi>Tenet</hi> of converting guiltless Lime, and Brick and
Timber to rubbish, because they had afforded dwelling places to People, that
differed in judgment from <hi>Rome:</hi> and to make him, who in the <hi>Year</hi> 258.
was a Martyr for not being an <hi>Idolater,</hi> to be the Author of burning Cities,
that would not adore the Host.</p>
            <p>But moreover it may be said that in the <hi>Decrets</hi> made by the <hi>Pope</hi> to <hi>Ape</hi>
the <hi>Pandects,</hi> and to consist chiefly of <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> sayings of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>

               <hi>Authors,</hi> giveth it only the weight that <hi>Cyprian</hi> and they had in their
proper works: and the Stream of Authority from their Writings in
<hi>Gratian</hi> is not to be supposed able to rise higher than the Spring: and
thus the <hi>Canonists</hi> agree on this as a Rule, that the things quoted in

and they tell us, that if any things that are said to be <hi>impia, hiulca, barbara,

be passed by as <hi>Gratian Dreams, ut nec confirmatio Pontificum generalis ad

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssographer Andreas,</hi>
himself doth often turn his <hi>gloss</hi> into an Animadversion on his <hi>Master</hi> (for
that name he bestows on <hi>Gratian</hi>) and saith sometimes, <hi>Magister hic non
tenetur</hi> (meaning <hi>Observatur</hi>) and sometimes <hi>Superficialis est magistri ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentatio,</hi>
and elsewhere with a strain of <hi>Ruffianism, fateor te plane menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

            </p>
            <p>And if any one will read <hi>Pere Veron</hi>'s Book of <hi>the Rule of Catholick
Faith,</hi> Dedicated to the <hi>Lords of the Assembly general of the Clergy sitting
at</hi> Paris <hi>in the Year</hi> 1645. he will find, he saith, <hi>as for</hi> Gratian<hi>'s Decrees,
and the Gloss, they can claim nothing of Faith, the Author being a particular
Doctor and Subject to many mistakes even in the Citation of Authors, nor doth
he pretend to any such thing: much less weight hath the Gloss than the Decrees,
where many silly and ridiculous passages are discovered. As for the Papal Decrees
contained in the body of the Canon Law, or published since, none of them do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
an Article of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Bellarmine <hi>makes no difficulty to acknowledge
Errors in several of them: as for example, where the</hi> Canon <hi>out of</hi> Gratian
<hi>is objected,</hi> quod proposuisti, <hi>extracted out of</hi> Gregory <hi>the</hi> 3d, <hi>where 'tis
said, that if a Woman should be sick and by that means unable to render her
duty to her Husband, the Husband if he have not the gift of continency may
take another Wife: he replys thus, that the Pope failed through ignorance,
which we do not deny may happen to Popes, when they do not properly define
but only declare their opinions, as</hi> Gregory <hi>seems here to have done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no doubt but every <hi>Papist</hi> laughs at the <hi>definition</hi> of a <hi>Whore</hi> in
the <hi>Decrets,</hi> i. e. <hi>Quae multorum libidini patet,</hi> and at the <hi>gloss</hi> there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I discoursed frankly of all these last mentioned matters to
my <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Friend, who (I said) would joyn Issue in the Plea
about Religion, if the Pope's Power of firing Heretical Cities, were a
Tenet chargeable on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and have perhaps said as much
to throw off the Obligation on any <hi>Papists</hi> to obey the Pope or his <hi>Canon</hi>
Law, in the infliction of such dire Vengeance on whole Cities, as they
would wish said, and do think my self indispensably obliged when I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with any of Mankind about any <hi>Quaesitum</hi> relating to natural truth,
and much more to Theological, with all possible candour to say what the
matter will fairly bear on both sides, as accounting any mans Judgment
given <hi>ex parte</hi> to be of little or no value, and esteeming him a <hi>falsarius,</hi>
who conceals any thing of truth.</p>
            <p>But this Gentleman being a close pursuer of truth told me, he knew
well enough that the <hi>Canon</hi> Law did not as such bind all Papists <hi>in foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiae,</hi>
but he would stay in no Church that he should find to be built in
any <hi>Akeldama,</hi> or Field of Blood, that is, a Church that approved of <hi>Tenets</hi>
destructive of Civil Societies, or condemned not <hi>Tenets</hi> that where any
other Religion than the Popes was, would Condemn men like <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezor</hi>
to grasing and to solitude, or if they would live in Towns or Cities,
make them live there in Houses under Ground, as Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> in his <hi>Travels</hi>
saith, <hi>He saw some Towns in the</hi> Turkish <hi>Dominions where Christians so lived
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103047:184"/>
like the</hi> Troglodytes, <hi>and subterraneous Nations about</hi> Egypt, and which
might be occasioned by many Armies marching that way and burning of
Towns <hi>en passant;</hi> and that till the Pope disclaimed this power, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
such <hi>Tenet</hi> in his <hi>Canon</hi> Law, that hung up there a Light conspicuous
to the World, for the lawful kindling of the Torches that should set fire
to Heretical Cities, such Cities as he called Heretical would be in fear of
their being <hi>incendio delendae;</hi> and that in the mean time the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who
assert the plenitude of his power, would implicitly obey his Commands,
and their Emissaries execute theirs, without considering whether <hi>Gratian</hi> as
a Fool, or a Knave misapplied <hi>Cyprian:</hi> and he granted that if, as an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<hi>Censor morum,</hi> the Pope did Command the <hi>Iesuites</hi> or others to inflict
spiritual Censures in Cases of Sin, or Non-belief of any Religionary No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and those Censures were not to operate beyond the Soul, that Civil
Societies might yet be maintained; but to give the Pope power to issue out
Orders to burn the Cities and Towns, where the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is not professed, is (said he,) to give him Arbitrary Power over a
great part of the World, and to leave it to his Arbitrage, whether there
shall be any Political Government and Commerce in the States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of Hereticks, and the World might suffer Confusion by the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's
having this power <hi>de facto,</hi> as much as if it had it <hi>de jure,</hi> and that
several places have been burned as Heretical, and when certainly they had
a <hi>right</hi> not to be so served, and particularly the Heretical <hi>Villages</hi> at the
<hi>Massacre</hi> of <hi>Merindol,</hi> of which Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Geoghraphy</hi> in <hi>Folio,</hi>
makes mention, saying, that in the Year 1560. <hi>there were above 1250
Churches of the Hugonots in</hi> France, <hi>which cannot in such a long time but be
wonderfully augmented, tho scarce any of them have scaped some Massacre or
other. Of these Massacres two are most memorable,</hi> viz. <hi>that of</hi> Merindol
<hi>and</hi> Chabiers, <hi>as being the first, and that of</hi> Paris <hi>as being the greatest. That
of</hi> Merindol <hi>happened in the Year 1545. the instrument of it being</hi> Minier,
<hi>the President of the Council of</hi> Aix: <hi>for having Condemned those poor people of</hi>
Heresy, <hi>he mustered a small Army and set fire on the Villages.</hi> He directed
me further for the proof of that Fact to <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s History of <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
Book 2d,</hi> where he mentions the <hi>Decree</hi> of the Parliament of <hi>Aix</hi>
to which <hi>Heylin</hi> refers, and saith <hi>Maimbourg</hi> of it, <hi>Par le quel il Condamn'
par Contumace dix neuf de Ces Heretiques à estre brasléz,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ordonne que
toutes les Maisons de</hi> Merindol <hi>qui sont toutes remplies de Ces Heretiques soient
entierement démolies, &amp; renverses de fond en comble,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He further said, that there was another guess Fire projected by the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
as was before mentioned out of <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and which was abetted by
the Pope, which shewed there was another Pope beside <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that
thought the burning of Heretical Cities lawful and meritorious: and he
referred it to the Consideration of the Criticks in <hi>Gun-powder,</hi> how far so
great a quantity of it lodged in a strait Vault, might have tended to the
demolishing of the Heretical Cities of <hi>Westminster</hi> and even of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
if the experiment of the Gun-powder Treason had took effect,
for said he, the utmost power of Gun-powder was never yet tryed. He
told me that <hi>Osborn</hi> in his King <hi>Iames,</hi> having spoke of the <hi>Gun-powder
Treason</hi> saith, <hi>I never met two of the like conceit concerning any effect or extent,
this Powder might have reached had it not failed of success: some men confining
it to the Circle it lay in and no farther: whereas the judgment of others no
less experienced, delivered at least the whole Isle to the fury of it:</hi> and then
he quotes it as the more probable Conjecture, then <hi>that it could not but work
dire effects on the City it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:103047:184"/>
He further discoursed that in this Case, of securing Protestant Cities
from Fire at the Popes pleasure, <hi>Pere Veron</hi>'s artifice in making the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> chargeable with nothing to be believed but <hi>what is proposed by the
Catholick Church in her general Councils, or by her Vniversal Practice to be
believed, as an Article or Doctrine of Catholick Faith,</hi> or any Papists in
this Case joyning with Protestants to decry the Canon Law, is but trifling
away time, as to any giving light to our understandings or keeping Fire
from our Cities: for if each Pope <hi>believes</hi> he hath this power, and the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
too <hi>believe</hi> it, the <hi>Notion</hi> of a things not being <hi>de fide,</hi> will not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to save our Cities, when the Incendiaries even by the Doctrine of
<hi>probability</hi> may save their Souls, and when they shall have such Doctors as
the Pope and <hi>Gratian</hi> and (as they may think) <hi>Cyprian</hi> for the opinion of
burning the Nests of Heretical Hornets.</p>
            <p>He moreover mentioned how <hi>Bellarmine as to the Tenet of all Christian
Monarchies owing subjection to the</hi> Pope, <hi>said, the contrary to it is Heretical,</hi>
tho he well knew that no <hi>definition</hi> of the Church ever made it <hi>Heresy,</hi>
and might as well have called the denial of this Incendiary Power of the
Pope against Heretical Cities, to be Heresy.</p>
            <p>Moreover he told me he had read <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cited in that <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Donne</hi>
p. 277. for writing against a <hi>Doctor,</hi> who had defended the <hi>Venetian</hi> Cause
against the Popes Censures, and reprimanding that <hi>Doctor</hi> in these words,
viz. <hi>It is a grievous rashness not to be left unpunished, that he should say the
Canons as being but Humane Laws cannot have equal Authority with divine:
for this is a Contempt of the Canons, as tho they were not made by the direction
of the Holy Ghost:</hi> and yet saith <hi>Donne,</hi> citing that <hi>Doctor</hi> that impugned the
<hi>Canons,</hi> those <hi>Canons</hi> that he referred to were but <hi>two,</hi> and cited but by
<hi>Gratian.</hi> And that <hi>Donne</hi> further in that Page observed, that <hi>when</hi> Parsons
<hi>is to make his advantage of any Sentence in</hi> Gratian, <hi>he uses to dignify it
thus, that it is translated by the</hi> Popes <hi>into the Corps of the Canon Law, and
so not only allowed and admitted and approved but commended and commanded,
canonized and determined for Canonical Law, and authorized and set forth for
Sacred and Authentical by all</hi> Popes <hi>whatsoever.</hi> Treat. <hi>of</hi> Mitag. ca. 7.

            <p>That moreover tho we know that neither the <hi>Decrets</hi> nor <hi>Decretals,</hi>
were ever <hi>as such</hi> received as Law in <hi>England,</hi> yet the Pope and Jesuites
saying that they ought so to have been, and that they were and are obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
upon us, it will follow that by reason of an unlucky Proverb of <hi>Ben

               <hi>Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth,</hi> and
for that there are some little People ready to apply that little fire, when
the Pope or Jesuites would have them, the <hi>Majority</hi> of the Papists here,
being Jesuited (as was observed) and that part of them not being of the
<hi>Gentry,</hi> would not be byassed by generous education and temper against
the Commands of the mercenary Pope or Jesuites, and for that even in the
Jesuited Gentry here, there were Bigots found to plot and to prepare to
execute the <hi>Gun-powder Treason,</hi> it is apparent that the Pope may if he
will be very troublesome to our Cities with his Writ <hi>de Civitate comburen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dâ,</hi>
and that he or the Jesuites can command numbers of instruments to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
that his <hi>Writ</hi> (as I may call it) who will think that therein that
they do as lawful an Act, as if the <hi>four</hi> first General <hi>Councils</hi> had expresly
warranted the same.</p>
            <p>He said that the Popes <hi>Decrets</hi> and <hi>Decretals</hi> are in several Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
so much regarded, that to encourage men to study the same, <hi>Academick</hi>
Degrees are conferred, namely, of <hi>Doctores decretorum,</hi> and <hi>Doctores decreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.</hi>

That in <hi>France</hi> where the <hi>Canon Law</hi> was never <hi>in gross</hi> received;
as <hi>Minier</hi> the <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Aix</hi> did set fire on the Heretical
Villages as such, so he hath heard that <hi>Boerius</hi> an eminent Lawyer of <hi>France,</hi>
and President of a Parliament there, and who has published a Volume of
<hi>Decisions,</hi> hath in <hi>Tractatu de seditiosis</hi> asserted this <hi>Tenet</hi> of the Pope's
power to burn Heretical Cities. That the Christians of old when they
groaned under the heaviest weight of the Pagan Persecution, abhorred
this revenge against their idolatrous Enemies, as appeared by <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s
<hi>Apology,</hi> and their sense of the ease with which this revenge might have
been executed, <hi>Quando vel una nox pauculis faculis largitatem ultionis posset

vindicetur Divina secta,</hi> i. e. <hi>One night with a few Fire-brands would yield
us sufficient Revenge, if it were lawful for us to discount evil with evil: but
God forbid that the followers of the Divine Religion should either revenge
themselves with Humane Fire,</hi> &amp;c. That the very <hi>Heathens</hi> of old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
there was <hi>turpitude</hi> in promoting not only their own profit, but

Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> or any of them had industriously published it in
Print, that we might lawfully employ Emissaries to burn <hi>Rome,</hi> or any
City where all or the Majority were Papists, and that such Writing of
theirs was never censured by Authority, and impugned by any of our
Divines, tho yet by occasion thereof no Anti-Papists had ever been
the Incendiaries of Popish Cities, I would not however withdraw from
the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till I saw such <hi>Tenet</hi> of those
<hi>Divines</hi> publickly branded, and till such Writing had received the usage
that the <hi>Canon Law</hi> had from <hi>Luther,</hi> when he cast it into the Flames; I
plainly told him that I would: and the like he said he was inclined to as
to Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if he found that the Fact of
that fiery <hi>Tenet</hi> against Heretical Cities, was chargeable on the Pope in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103047:185"/>
his Law and in the Writers thereupon as aforesaid. And as little Credit
as I wish all <hi>Mushroom</hi> Prophets and Prophecies may find, I am of opinion,
if ever any clear discovery should happen in time to be made of that Fires
having proceeded from the Councils of great numbers of <hi>Iesuites, Friars,</hi>
or other <hi>Papists,</hi> (a thing I never Expect) that Popery would thereby
be loaded with such a lasting general <hi>Odium</hi> here and in Forraign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
both Popish and Protestant, as it would hardly breath under the
weight of, and the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the effects of the <hi>Year</hi> 1666, would cry
that their <hi>predictions</hi> did hit right, and boldly say to us their upbraiders,
that 66 in its effects is not yet past, just like the <hi>Sooth-sayer</hi> who being

            </p>
            <p>There is another happy effect, I expect from the grown and growing
numbers of our populous Nation, and all mens errors, being necessarily
the more visible to each other by their close Vicinage, namely, that men
will be ashamed to aggravate the supposed Political Errors of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of our Princes as formerly, and much more not to take it patiently
when their Princes pardon them.</p>
            <p>How shameful a thing was it that the Kings <hi>Pardon</hi> was not allowed as

<hi>Odium</hi> of its signification, as many Words and Phrases have done, and to
import no more stated hatred or enmity in any man to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
than do the expressions of Course put into <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Prohibition;</hi>
or <hi>Mandamuses,</hi> to our <hi>Bishops</hi> and their <hi>Officials,</hi> viz. <hi>Of intending
our disherison, or machinating against our Crown and Dignity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103047:186"/>
any thing of Treason in them which yet the words so expresly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tully</hi> tells us in his <hi>Offices,</hi> that the Original use of the Word <hi>Hostis,</hi> for
one who was <hi>perduellis,</hi> came from the lenity of the <hi>Romans: hostis enim</hi>
(saith he) <hi>apud majores nostros is dicebatur quem nunc peregrinum dicimus:</hi>
and according to this acception of the Word <hi>Enemy</hi> for <hi>Stranger,</hi> I shall
venture to say that I think they were <hi>Strangers</hi> to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Hallifax,</hi>
and persons misinform'd (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his Expression was) who in the
late Loyal <hi>House of Commons</hi> did think him to be <hi>hostis patriae,</hi> and whom
they who know him, do know likewise to bear no Enmity to any part of
the Creation of God, and to be one that is so far from any inclination to
injure his Country for his Prince, that either or his Prince or his Country
he would not injure the most abject Member of Mankind.</p>
            <p>How shamefully void of sense have I observed some few querulous people
here to be, who have professed to doubt that a very honourable man hath
of late remitted somewhat of his fervour, in the defence of our Religion
and Laws, who hath so long on every occasion in every place been such an
unwearied <hi>Agonist</hi> for both, and one who would not fear to be an <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius
contra mundum,</hi> whenever he should in his Province be lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to be its <hi>Antagonist;</hi> and that with contempt too even of the <hi>Bribe</hi>
of Popularity: and of the continuance of whose confirm'd and obstinate
habit of an Heroical Love to his Country, they who have long known
him have never doubted, but have agreed in this point of his perseverance
in what <hi>Tully</hi> calls the <hi>pietas in patriam,</hi> to pronounce as the warier <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
do concerning <hi>Grace,</hi> viz. that there is a State of <hi>Grace</hi> attainable in
this life, from which it is difficult if not impossible to fall away.</p>
            <p>With as little Art and faint Colours as I have here drawn the Picture of
this Great Man, any one will say it is very like the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Radnor:</hi> and the
truth is, considering that this same <hi>pietas in patriam,</hi> and the inflexible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Justice, have not been so much incarnate in the lives of later
Christians, as of ancient Heathens, nor perhaps so legible in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
(and therefore as if that <hi>Practice of Piety</hi> had been too among
<hi>Pancirols Res deperditae, Boccaline</hi> held it a proper Advertisement, <hi>That
all the Princes of the World should beseech</hi> Apollo, <hi>that he would insert
into their People the love of their Country</hi>) when I would occasionally in
discourse do Justice to this Great <hi>Exemplar</hi> of it, I endeavour to whet my
imagination with thoughts out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, and do think of
<hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tumacy</hi> in <hi>Vertue</hi> (according to <hi>Pliny</hi>'s using that word in a good sense)
and of the <hi>inexplebilis virtutis veraeque laudis homo,</hi> and of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

            </p>
            <p>Some here who Correspond with Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> asking me if I had not
heard that you were prayed for at <hi>Mass</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I told them I had, and
that the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> mentioned the same in the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> and that
your Lordship replied, that if any well meaning <hi>Papists</hi> in their <hi>Mass-house,</hi>
or <hi>Iews</hi> in their <hi>Synagogue,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans</hi> in their <hi>Mosc</hi> unask'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
to, pray'd for you, you would be glad to be the better by their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tho yet you believed that none of them did ever, yet supplicate Heaven
in your behalf. I told my friends here that if that thing had been true
(and tho on the account of what hath been beforementioned, I believed
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103047:186"/>
it not to be so in the least) yet they would soon cease to infer thence that
your Lordships love for the Protestant Religion was diminished, if they
would reflect on the Case of <hi>Rawlins White</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments,</hi>
where it appears that the Bishop of <hi>Landaff</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1555. just before
he Condemned the said <hi>Rawlins</hi> to the Fire as an <hi>Heretick,</hi> ordered a
<hi>Priest</hi> to say a <hi>Mass</hi> for him: and as that Bishop in vain Courting him a
little before, to abandon the Protestant Faith, and then asking him <hi>how he
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, and how he found himself inclined,</hi> the poor Captive replied, Rawlins
<hi>you l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thus constant your Lordship will prove to your Religion and your self, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any thing that can happen; and that whoever shall write the Story of
your Lordships life after you have finished your Mortality, will have cause
to say of you as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> p. 411. mentions, that one who writes of <hi>Wicliff</hi>
recorded of him that he persevered in his Religion, <hi>ita ut cano placeret
quod Iuveni complacebat,</hi> that the same thing pleased him in his old Age,
which did in his youth.</p>
            <p>Nor do I indeed doubt but that when your Lordship shall be upon your
passage to the other World, you will take your long leave of your friends
in the <hi>Style</hi> with which Dr. <hi>Holland</hi> the <hi>Regius Professor</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> at
<hi>Oxford</hi> was observed commonly to bid his friends <hi>farewel,</hi> viz. <hi>Commendo
vos amori Dei &amp; odio Papatus;</hi> and that your Lordship who hath been so
successful an <hi>Agonist</hi> against Popery, will share in the Glories of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
from Heaven, <hi>To him that overcomes will I give the Morning Star:</hi>
and that as the Morning Star is the same with the Evening one, and in the
Morning is call'd <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> and in the Evening <hi>Hesperugo,</hi> so the Protestant
Religion will appear in the Evening of your Life, with the same brightness
that it did in the Morning thereof, and so continue till you shall arrive at that
Region, where <hi>all the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God
shouted for joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How unreasonably rigid are they who when the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Princes
are studying and procuring the ease of Mankind, as your Lordship hath
done, will in spight of fate disquiet themselves in rendring the lives of
such Ministers uneasie; a temper that I think shewed it self over much in
a late <hi>Speech</hi> in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> of Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> who, if my Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be true, did not reverently use the power of his Popularity, when
with much Acrimony reflecting on some in the Kings <hi>Council,</hi> he was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have aimed at your Lordship in words to this effect, <hi>There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Council a Noble Man too among the Kings Ministers, and a Lawyer,</hi>
but if <hi>we cannot reach him, do not impeach him;</hi> intimating that he would
have been glad of any being able with Articles and Proofs concludent, to
have reached your <hi>Lordship</hi> in order to Impeachment.</p>
            <p>There is another Honourable Person who is your Collegue in the
King's <hi>Council,</hi> a Great Man and a <hi>Lawyer</hi> too, whom I was sorry to find
by the printed <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>House of Commons</hi> that were sent into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
so many persons were endeavouring to reach with matter of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I mean, my <hi>Lord Chief Iustice</hi> North. It seem'd to me a thing
worthy the name of <hi>News,</hi> that <hi>the advising and assisting in the drawing up
and passing a Proclamation against Tumultuous Petitions,</hi> should be thought
a sufficient ground to proceed upon to an Impeachment against him for
high Crimes and Misdemeanors.</p>
            <p>The security and quiet of Kings and their People are to be so tenderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
that the drawing one Proclamation after another to prevent the
<hi>blowing or breathing in the Kings Face</hi> (I allude to the words in one
of the <hi>Articles</hi> against <hi>Woolsy</hi>) by Tumultuous Petitioners (a thing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103047:187"/>
punishable at <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and likewise by the severity of the <hi>Council-Board</hi>)
seems strangely imputed as a Crime to a Judge and Privy <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people petitioning in Multitudes are so far from being like the <hi>Horse</hi>
not knowing his own strength, that their coming in such numbers shews
they have <hi>Calculated it,</hi> and perhaps with more nicety than the Author of
the Discourse before the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> concerning the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Duplicate
Proportion</hi> had Calculated the strength of <hi>Animals,</hi> the which strength he
saith, <hi>is as the square roots of their weights and substance, and if 1728 Mice
were equiponderate to one Horse, the said Horse is but 1/144 part as strong as all
the said Mice;</hi> and so might easily strip the Horses Neck of the Thunder
that God and Nature (according to <hi>Iobs</hi> expression) have cloathed it with;
and their petitioning in numbers being a real Proclamation of their power,
it was the part of so good a <hi>Councellor</hi> of State, and <hi>Mathematician</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
his Prince and his Country not to be taken in a Trap by the Petitioning
Mice: and it was worthy of so knowing a <hi>Iudge,</hi> to forewarn them of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entrapped by the Law, and as the <hi>Millenary</hi> Petitioners were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd
in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time.</p>
            <p>What occasioned the <hi>Proclamation</hi> referred to by the <hi>House of Commons,</hi>
I know not; but by what I have observed of his accurateness in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Justice in his great <hi>Sphere,</hi> and of his Mathematical
<hi>Genius</hi> even not receeding from it self while on the Tribunal he in every
Cause demonstrates the rationality of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and makes Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
there in its Arithmetical and Geometrical proportion so visible to all,
and by what I have seen of the serenity of his temper in having had once or
twice the honour of his Conversation, I believe that as a Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
he would too as much occasionally assert any Legal Right the Subject
hath to Petition his Prince, as he would the Right of the latter not to be
illegally and with the apparent Menace of Members addrest to, a way
of Petitioning that hath so often and so lately been the Prologue to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Tragedy of War.</p>
            <p>I was very much pleased to hear how this Learned <hi>Iudge,</hi> being once
moved to grand a <hi>Prohibition</hi> to the Court Christian in a certain Cause, and
that the Council fencing with Presidents <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> that came not home
to the point, his Lordship declared in words to this purpose, that in any
proceeding that was against Universal Reason he would grant the <hi>Writ;</hi>
and I think it was as proper for him as a States-man to advise a <hi>Prohibition</hi>
in the way of a <hi>Proclamation</hi> against <hi>Tumultuous Petitions,</hi> than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more against <hi>Vniversal Reason.</hi> But if a person who is so
great a Master of that Reason, and indeed of Universal Learning, and of
that part of it that deserves the name of <hi>Real,</hi> and whose single Learning
would serve to vindicate a whole profession from <hi>Erasmus</hi> his Aspersion of
<hi>doctissimum g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nus indoctorum hominum,</hi> and of knowing nothing of the Sense
and Reason of the World beyond <hi>Dover,</hi> and the brightness of whose
parts hath given a Lustre to the Science of the <hi>Law,</hi> and by whom if by
any of this Age that may be thought possible to be done that our Great
Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> advised King <hi>Iames</hi> to Crown his Reign with, namely, the
bringing the Body of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> or our <hi>jus non scriptum</hi> into a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,</hi>
I say if a person thus accomplished cannot have the skill to walk
through the World free from Impeachment, it will be sufficient to make
all men of Illustrious Abilities and Godlike Inclinations to do good, retire
from dangerous Mankind, and not adventure to Aid Princes who are Gods
Vice-Roys in the Government of the World, and to be happy in themselves
without preserving it, as the first being was before he made it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:103047:187"/>
What a <hi>diminution</hi> was it to the honour of the Age, that the Popularity
of Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> a person who in the florid part of his youth, appeared but an
<hi>Entring Clerk,</hi> or one who <hi>entred</hi> Judgments for Attorneys, and in the
greatest Figure he made in Parliament, or the Court acquired no fame by
various Learning and Skill in the Politicks, or by having profoundly stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
the great Book of the World, should yet as with the <hi>Impetus</hi> of an
<hi>Oracle</hi> run down the great Characters of this <hi>Lord,</hi> and of your <hi>Lordship</hi>
and the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> that are known to the World to be so great for
Loyalty and Learning, and the Comprehensive Knowledge of the present
and past State of Christendom: and that after that Loyal and Learned
Person, and undefatigable assertor of our Laws and Religion, Sir <hi>L. Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
had with great Reason and Courage in a <hi>Speech</hi> in the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
against the <hi>Exclusion Bill</hi> affirmed, that the passing the same would be
contrary to the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
answering it with the <hi>Non est haeres viventis,</hi> he had somewhat like
a general <hi>humme</hi> of Applause from the House, and almost as if his had
been the <hi>voice of God and and not of Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on this occasion I should be unjust and too reserved to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
if I should not tell you that a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of good parts and a great
Estate, a Member of that Parliament, acquainted me that he being then
one of the great Admirers and Followers of Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> and frequently
present with him in the most private <hi>Cabals,</hi> did observe him to be full of
fears of the <hi>Courts</hi> being brought to favour the Exclusion-Bill, as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that the Parliament would be thereby engaged to part with great
Sums of Money: and that he observed Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> and others of the <hi>Cabal,</hi>
were at a stand in their Politicks as not knowing what steps to make next
if that <hi>Bill</hi> had passed, and the Consideration whereof (he told me)
made him not desirous to participate further in their Councils.</p>
            <p>Thus just is it for Heaven sometimes to blind and confound and abandon
good men in their Councels, when they abandon plain Principles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Reason, and when they will not do what they know, to suffer
them not to know what they do, and particularly not to know while they
were so busily <hi>founding Dominion or Empire</hi> in <hi>Grace,</hi> that they were riding
<hi>Post</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> as fast as ever that <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Trent-Council</hi> did, who was
so often employed to the Holy See to bring thence the Holy Ghost in a
Cloak-bag.</p>
            <p>It is some Consolation to your Lordship to have fellow sufferers in the
Obloquy cast upon you, by the Tongue of a young Man, in a matter so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from verisimilitude, and not worth the twice naming, and whose
Person I thought not worthy the naming once, however a Loyal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thought his Accusations worthy the Press: and in whose reproach
that Honourable Person, and your Lordships old friend the Earl of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
shared with you. But by what I have found to be the judged
Character of that <hi>Lord,</hi> among the most Impartial Studiers of Men in the
Age, I may justly say that the honour of the Age was a fellow sufferer
with you both, by the publick Countenancing of the dirt by so obscure
a hand thrown on a Person of so Noble Descent both from Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of so much Courage and Loyalty and Learning, and on whom
his great knowledge of all History Ancient and Modern, hath so much
accomplished as a States-man, and one who in his Travels in the World
abroad left there such impressions of his real value on the most Critical
Observers, that his Prince thought him to be the most proper Person to
employ abroad as Ambassador, in negotiating the Marriage between his
<hi>Royal Highness</hi> and the <hi>Princess</hi> of <hi>Modena,</hi> whereby we may yet hope for
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103047:188"/>
an Heir Male to inherit the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> I never heard that any
thing but <hi>sham</hi> could represent this Lord otherwise than a true Son of the
Church of <hi>England:</hi> and having once or twice seen him <hi>en passant</hi> at
your Lordships House, and observed the lineaments of Honesty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in his looks, do think that his very face may serve to confute thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of such Tongues as that which aspersed him. But both his Lordship
and yours have likewise in that Persons Accusations, and in the greatest
Circumstances of improbability, been fellow sufferers with the greatest
Subject, and therefore need not be ashamed of your fate, according to
what the Famous <hi>Historian</hi> so well said, <hi>Post Carthaginem captam vinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Yet having said all this, I shall say that perhaps had it been the fortune
of that Loyal Parliament to have sate longer, it might too have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that none of your Lordships that I have named would at last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and attract a general popular love, which after all its <hi>variations</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again to you.</p>
            <p>But 'tis high time for me to take off my hand from this Map of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State of <hi>England,</hi> that as a <hi>Predicter</hi> rather than a <hi>Prophet</hi> I have
here so particularly delineated, and as one who according to what is in
St. <hi>Mathew, When it is Evening, say it will be fair weather, for the Sky is
red,</hi> &amp;c. and from Natural Causes have as well as I could, discern'd <hi>the signs
of the times,</hi> and what it may be a shame for any one that is a piece of a
Philosopher to be wholly ignorant of, when the inspired <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, that
<hi>the</hi> Stork <hi>knoweth her appointed times, and the</hi> Turtle <hi>and the</hi> Crane <hi>and
the</hi> Swallow <hi>observe the time of their coming,</hi> and that 'tis obvious that the
Beasts of the Field as well as Birds of the Air foresee unseasonable weather,
from the disposition of the Air.</p>
            <p>Nor is it hard for any <hi>Considerer</hi> now in relation to some of the Popish
and Protestant Recusants to undertake what the <hi>Magicians, Astrologers,</hi>
and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> durst not to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I mean to tell them what
their <hi>Dream</hi> was: they <hi>dreamt</hi> to rule us still by a <hi>Nation within a Nation</hi>
as the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> did <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they <hi>dreamt</hi> of <hi>Offices</hi> and like idle <hi>Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of <hi>Lactantius</hi> his golden Age, <hi>when the Cliffs of the Mountains shall
sweat out Honey, and the Springs and Rivers shall flow with Milk and Wine,</hi>
and of a <hi>pingue solum</hi> that shall tire no Husbandmen, and of such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
as <hi>Campania</hi> the Garden of <hi>Italy</hi> that shall not be called <hi>terra del lavoro.</hi>
But I do <hi>predict</hi> that the noise of the World, and their being necessarily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
by the busie in whose way they stand will awaken them, and that
if they will have any food to raise the vapours, that will again feed sleep
in them, they must work for it, and that no Papists and Presbyterians
will in their sleep cry out of <hi>Persecution</hi> as formerly, and that no Papist
will hereafter applaud either the Justice or temper of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as aforesaid to the <hi>Inter-Nuncio,</hi> of the Execution of the Penal Laws
against the Papists, and saying, <hi>Which are so insupportable that 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any that is reach'd by them to have wherewithal to eat Bread, if they be
executed according to the said Proclamation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor I believe will such Complaining be <hi>heard in our Streets</hi> from any
of the Non-Conformist Divines, as I have read in Print from one Learned
Divine of them, viz. <hi>some of the ejected Ministers</hi> are so reduced and find
so little succour, that they <hi>live upon brown Bread and Water, some have died
through the effects of want, we will be thankful to be under no severer usage
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103047:188"/>
than Colliers and Barge-men, and Sea-men, than begging Rogues and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds
have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as among the <hi>Augurs</hi> of old, the <hi>Poultreys</hi> not eating their Meat
or Bread, served as an indication that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was not then to
fight, so I hope that the same thing was meant by the <hi>sullenness</hi> of Mr.
<hi>Colemans</hi> Augury and the others Complaint, and that both Papists and
Protestants will here eat the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Quietness</hi> with <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And considering the great number of <hi>Attorneys</hi> and <hi>Sollicitors and Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
towards the Law,</hi> that hath long over-spread the Land, and planted in
the same such a general proneness to litigation, and over-ran it so with
Briars and Thorns of the Law that our Country is not more famous for
our Wooll, than infamous for our so much fleecing one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how another thing hath occasionally put so many men to be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Masters of the <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Defence</hi> with the Weapons of the Law, I
mean the farming of so much of the publick Revenue, I may well <hi>predict</hi>
that if such a wild probability should happen as any Princes hereafter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
by any illegal Course to advance Popery, that tho good and
loyal people would be <hi>Lachrymists</hi> to him, they would be soon apt to
make all ministerially concerned therein to be <hi>Lachrymists</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>Altho <hi>England</hi> had a King, namely, <hi>Harry</hi> the 1<hi>st,</hi> of whom 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
that <hi>reforming the old and untrue measures, he made a measure after
the length of his Arm,</hi> yet as we have one who hath graciously measured
the Arm of his Power by the Laws, so I may safely adventure to foretel
what his lawful Successors will do; and it is to this purpose in some of the
most subtle seditious <hi>Pamphlets</hi> notified in Print by the ill wishers to the
next Heir to the Crown, <hi>viz.</hi> that they fear more mischief from him as
Chief Favourite and Minister to his Prince, than they would from him if
ever he should live to wear a Crown: for then (say they) we shall
know how to be provided against him by the Course of the Law.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be doubted but that he who never was known to advise his
Prince, to incommode any one contrary to the Law, will never employ
his own power to the illegal detriment of any man. During this time
that his Prince hath so justly placed so much of the Royal Favour on him,
may he not as to his administration thereof say with the same Justice as the
great Prophet, <hi>Whose Ox or Ass have I taken?</hi> May it not be asked whom of
the mad sort of Cattle that with an infinity of Calumnies and Shams gored
his reputation, or wild Asses that kick'd at the same, did he hurt with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or yet take the fair advantage of the Law against, till his many loyal
friends who were secret true <hi>Lachrymists,</hi> for the publick false misreports
spread against him, did importune him so for the Kingdoms good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his honour, and that they might no more be punished by seeing the
limbs of his reputation lie torn and mangled in every Coffee-house, who
had so often exposed those of his Body to Bullets and Chain-shot in Sea
Fights, for the saving the life and honour of their Country?</p>
            <p>Those therefore that could in earnest write to the effect abovemention'd
in such seditious Pamphlets, let them talk or look as gravely as they
will, I shall yet think but in jest while at other times they are amusing any
with questions about their being <hi>Lachrymists</hi> under such a Prince; and
they put me in mind of a famous <hi>Musician</hi> we had in the Court in King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s time, Dr. <hi>Iohn Dowland,</hi> who printed a Book of <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Pavans</hi>
for the <hi>Lute</hi> with the Title of <hi>Lachrymae,</hi> and Dedicated it to Queen <hi>Anne,</hi>
and in the <hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Book,</hi> several of them are thus remarked, <hi>viz.
Lachrymae antiquae, Lachrymae gementes, Lachrymae verae,</hi> and he observes
there in the <hi>Epistle</hi> what is obvious enough that <hi>Tears are not always shed
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103047:189"/>
in sorrow, but sometimes in joy and gladness.</hi> But there is another thing of
more weight that occurs to my thoughts from the remembring that Mr.
<hi>Henry Peacham</hi> in his <hi>Book,</hi> called the <hi>Compleat Gentleman,</hi> doth on the name
of this Lutinest <hi>Iohannes Dowlandus,</hi> bestow the <hi>Anagram, annos ludendo
hausi,</hi> and that is, that many in several Parliaments who thought they
could do no right to Protestancy but by doing wrong to the next Heir, did
too much and too long play with the <hi>Royal</hi> Offers, and when they might
(if they pleased) have effected as quick a prevention of the growth of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
under any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiek Successor, as was took care of in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet however I have said enough for my continuing to think that as in
that Kingdom, there are are few or none that fear that the belief of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
can ever there gain much ground, and ever be the Paramount Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
there, and who think not that the words of <hi>arise</hi> Peter <hi>kill and eat,</hi>
will sooner bring the <hi>Scots</hi> to eat Hogs Flesh, and believe there is a <hi>Divine
Right</hi> for their so doing (St. <hi>Peters</hi> Sheet from Heaven in the Vision ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had that <hi>Animal</hi> in it) than to swallow the belief of Popery, or of
the <hi>Iure-Divinity</hi> of the Pope, so the fears of its growth in <hi>England,</hi> or of
any occasion for the Virtue of the <hi>Lachrymae antiquae</hi> of the Primitive
Christians will daily grow more and more moderate, and in time be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</p>
            <p>The late Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> estimated the number of Papists
and their Children in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be but about a <hi>thousand:</hi> but their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> is vastly more, insomuch that
the ingenious Author of the <hi>Policy of the Clergy of</hi> France <hi>to destroy
the Protestants of that Kingdom,</hi> mentions, that there are in <hi>Holland, a
Country of small extent, ten times more Popish Ecclesiasticks than there are
Protestant M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nisters in all</hi> France, <hi>which is very large. There is a compleat
Clergy and Hierarchy.</hi> Amsterdam <hi>and all the other great Cities have their
Bishops. Those Bishops have their Chapter and their Priests. There are even
religious houses. They are somewhat disguised, but are as well known as the
Ecclesiasticks are in</hi> France, <hi>and are not in the least assaulted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There
was one day in a Long-boat or Ship a Priest dressed in black Cloths who was
not otherwise disguised than that his Coat was short, who said his Breviary
before a hundred persons, with as much Liberty as he could have done in</hi>
France.</p>
            <p>And yet perhaps the number of those who in <hi>Holland</hi> fear them, or
who pretend to fear them, is but the least of numbers.</p>
            <p>I think too in this sharp sighted age, where <hi>Art</hi> among the Inquisitive
follows <hi>Nature</hi> as carefully as <hi>Equity</hi> doth <hi>Law,</hi> one may safely <hi>predict</hi>
that in the Dividend of our time little will come to the share of <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,</hi>
or the considering how <hi>Metaphysica agit de iis quae sunt supra natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi>
and that the World being infinitely busie will not trouble it self with
<hi>Arriagàs infinitum infinito infinitius:</hi> and Christendom's being universally
employed in preparing its defence against War, and giving us time only
for real Learning will divert us from either much opposing or defending
the old point, whether <hi>Vniversale</hi> be <hi>ens reale,</hi> or whether <hi>Vniversalia</hi> are
<hi>res extra singularia.</hi> If by <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> we could find a real Answer to the
Question, <hi>what is truth,</hi> or what is time, of which it hath devoured so
much, or learn how to measure it by knowing <hi>what's a Clock,</hi> we might
go on with its <hi>entitas,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> well englisheth, the <hi>isseness</hi> of a

saith, only <hi>what is what,</hi> I think as <hi>Filesac. de authorit. opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

punished with Excommunication the exscribing, reading or having that Book,</hi>
our time will hold little Communion hereafter with <hi>Second</hi> Notions on
those who Trade in them, and that as it will seem very absurd to sacrifice
much time to the enquiry if <hi>Vniversale</hi> is a real being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whether <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalia</hi>
are <hi>res extra singularia,</hi> and to sacrifice men for believing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
so it will likewise seem to enquire Whether there be one <hi>Catholick,</hi>
or <hi>Vniversal</hi> Apostolick Church existent apart from particular Churches,
which sense and reason tell us are and must be many, tho the Catholick
Church be but one, and for the want of considering which so many People
have been decoyed into the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the things that an ordinary Philosopher may predict concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Rome,</hi> and particularly varying from the Prophecy, that it was to
be destroyed by Fire, may soretel <hi>Romam fore luce delendam,</hi> and as <hi>Tully</hi>'s
words are in his Book <hi>de Naturâ Deorum, Opinionem Commenta delebit dies,
veritatis judicia confirmabit.</hi> And thus too it is easie to predict that the light
of Reason and Experience will forever blot out here the Innovations that
came from <hi>Geneva</hi> as well as those from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Jewish <hi>Rabbins</hi> have
from the words of the <hi>Sol Iustitiae</hi> arising with <hi>healing in his wings,</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a <hi>Proverb</hi> of <hi>The Sun ariseth, the infirmity decreaseth,</hi> meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that the Diseases that make Mortals groan and languish in the
Night, are somewhat abated by the rising Sun: and thus the State of
our Nation will be attended with greater health on the decay of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi>
Kingdom of <hi>Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Walls</hi> of its <hi>Iericho</hi> are fallen down flat with the <hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi>
of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> own <hi>Sayings,</hi> so usefully published.</p>
            <p>Tho I have said enough to speak my opinion of all <hi>Dissenters</hi> to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of our Church, not owning such sanguinary Principles as are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
on some <hi>Papists,</hi> yet the <hi>Dissenters Sayings</hi> have proved enough what
some of their Principles were. Nor can it be forgot that King <hi>Iames</hi> did
very justly in the <hi>Conference</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> accuse the <hi>Notes</hi> in the
<hi>Geneva</hi> Bible to be <hi>Seditious and to savour of Traiterous Conceits,</hi> and that
he instanced there in the <hi>Notes</hi> on <hi>Exodus 1. 19. Where they allow of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to Sovereign Kings and Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As absurd as that <hi>Tenet</hi> beforementioned in the <hi>Decrets,</hi> and there founded
on the 13th of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is, I would wish no <hi>Presbyterian</hi> to insult over
any <hi>Papists</hi> for it: for it is visible in no meaner a <hi>Book</hi> than the <hi>Assemblies
Annotations</hi> on <hi>Zechary</hi> 13. 3. where the Father and Mother of a false
Prophet are commanded to say to him <hi>thou shalt not live,</hi> and 'tis said, <hi>his
Father and Mother that begat him, shall thrust him through when he Prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
The Comment on the words, <hi>Thou shalt not live</hi> affirms, that <hi>the equity
of the Law of</hi> Deut. 13. 6. 9. <hi>remains under the Gospel: and with less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is a Thief, an Adulterer, a Witch tolerated than such an Heretick and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer.
The present pleading for liberty of Conscience in Preaching and Practice
is a thing extremely shameful, dangerous and destructive:</hi> and the Comment
on the the words <hi>His Father,</hi> &amp;c. is, <hi>His Parents themselves shall not spare
him, preferring therein their Zeal and Piety towards God before the Affection
and Love which naturally they bear toward their own Children.</hi> See <hi>Deut.
13. 6. 9. No less Zeal is required under the Gospel than was under the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray God deliver all Mankind from the cruel rigour of the <hi>Equity</hi>
(as those <hi>Divines</hi> term it) of that <hi>Iudicial</hi> Mosaic Law binding under the
Gospel: and from that kind of <hi>Zeal</hi> binding under the Gospel that did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, by virtue of the 6th and 9th <hi>Verses</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> and
from the 16th <hi>V.</hi> of which <hi>Chapter</hi> the Obligation for <hi>firing</hi> Heretical Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

The Church of <hi>England</hi> illuminates us with better Doctrine, and our

the Conscience of a Christian,</hi> i. e. <hi>as it was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>for that every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saic
Law as such was positive, and did oblige those only it was put upon,</hi> i. e.
<hi>the Iews,</hi> and shews that the Precepts of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> oblige, not because
<hi>Moses</hi> commanded them, but because of their being consentaneous to nature,
and confirmed by the Gospel, and so doth manumit the Christian World from
the Yoke of the <hi>Iudicial</hi> Law that was made only for the stiff necks of
Jews. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself on that place of <hi>Zachary</hi> 13. 3. doth blunder as
shamefully as did our <hi>Assembly men:</hi> for he there makes the Penal Jewish
Laws to bind under the Gospel. His words there are these, <hi>Sequitur ergo

point the <hi>Fanatick,</hi> and not the contrary opinors: and deniable it is not,
that several of the <hi>Calvinistick</hi> and <hi>Lutheran Divines</hi> beyond Sea did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe
the error of <hi>hereticidium</hi> from the same mistaken Principle of <hi>Monk

either in any Presbyterian <hi>Synod</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or in any new Popish
General Council beyond Sea, will (I believe) be utterly over.</p>
            <p>And tho perhaps the <hi>Centum gravamina</hi> did heretofore cause the last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
General <hi>Council</hi> to be called, I mean the Famous <hi>Tridentine</hi> one, I
may, looking on the Course of Nature, conclude, that there will never be
any General Council more; and that not only for that the Pope hath been
<hi>hors de page,</hi> since the breaking up that of <hi>Trent,</hi> but because that having
been <hi>Revera</hi> a Council of <hi>Pensioners,</hi> and having stood the Papacy for <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
in 3000 <hi>Crowns</hi> a Month, (<hi>i. e.</hi> in 750 <hi>l. Sterling</hi>) and having put
the Popes to that Charge during its sitting for 18 years, as it is easie to
<hi>Calculate</hi> how much in pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> that Council cost the Popes in all,
so it is as easie to foresee that if the Pope should have occasion for the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to that Council, he would not have that quantity of Money to spare
for the same.</p>
            <p>There is another thing that I may from the Course of Nature fortel
much quiet to my Prince, and happiness to my Country by, and that is
the extermination of all Mercenary Loyalty, and of an inglorious <hi>Loyalty-Trade</hi>
as well as of a Religion-Trade, and mens not thinking they are to
have <hi>Offices</hi> or <hi>Donatives</hi> for not being Villains, or that by Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing
to themselves the name of the <hi>Loyal,</hi> they should expect
therefore a lucrative <hi>Monopoly,</hi> the which would stain their Loyalty
indeed, and make it as null and void as any <hi>Monopoly:</hi> for the word
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103047:190"/>
               <hi>Loyal</hi> being used for <hi>Lawful,</hi> he is not <hi>homo legalis</hi> in one sense, who is
bought to be just.</p>
            <p>The apparent vast number of the Kings Subjects rendring them too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to hope all for <hi>largesses,</hi> and the too great probability of the Future
State of <hi>England</hi> according to my Notion, requiring for the support and
defence of the Government, all that to be employed in order thereunto,
what giving Parliaments can well give, will make People ashamed to
cling to the Royal-Oak like Ivy, and by preying on its vigour make it
the less able to give shelter by its branches.</p>
            <p>I was overjoyed with a piece of News a Gentleman sent me, namely
that he discoursing once at dinner with the Lord <hi>Hide,</hi> the first <hi>Commissioner</hi>
of the <hi>Treasury,</hi> concerning the Insolence of some mens expecting to be
rewarded by the King, for not doing mischief to his Government or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,

Great Master, the resolving against <hi>taking off</hi> of men by Pensions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
was settled as a new Fundamental Rule in the <hi>English</hi> Politicks, as I
am informed it was, I shall think his <hi>Lordship</hi> deserves to find an everlasting
Triumph in the <hi>History</hi> of the Age, and to be more honoured by <hi>England</hi>
than if as Commander of an Army he had vanquished very many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of its Enemies: for that the <hi>taking off</hi> of <hi>Hydra</hi>'s Heads by Gifts
(as was beforementioned) would be an endless work, and the ill
effects thereof inclusive of so much Hostility to the publick, would
be innumerable. But God be thanked the <hi>King</hi> by the Political
Conduct of this his <hi>Minister</hi> is now made <hi>Victorious over all those
Enemies:</hi> and if I had heard that any near his Majesty had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for a <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> by reason hereof, I should not have
wondered at it; the thing being of so great importance to <hi>England.</hi> And
no doubt but the shame of any mens diminishing the Royal Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
by begging from the Crown will be the greater, when the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
improvement of our Land by our numerous People shall have
enriched as many as deserve to be so, and when to all, who are industrious,
there will every where be <hi>multiplex praeda in medio posita,</hi> and the effects
of diligence fill all hands with profit, and eyes with pleasure.</p>
            <p>This is one kind of a <hi>New Heaven</hi> and a <hi>New Earth,</hi> that perhaps we
may shortly see in old <hi>England,</hi> and when men shall by enquiries about
Religion design only <hi>lucriferous</hi> experiments, and not <hi>luciferous</hi> as my Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi>'s Phrase is; and men shall improve their fortunes by the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and culture of the Earth: and to this effect we find the <hi>Prophecies</hi>
of Prosperity to the <hi>Iews</hi> in the old Testament expressed by <hi>the Trees
yielding their fruit, and the Earth their encrease, the Seed shall be prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
the Vine shall give her Fruit and the Ground shall give her encrease,
the Earth shall hear the Corn and the Wine and the Oyl,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And they who are now by seducers that augment wild fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
directed to look up for strange Prodigies to the Sky, will need no Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to behold with joy the unusual fruitfulness of the cultivated Earth: and
therefore I think that one Philosopher looking on the Future State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
may well say to another,
<q>Aspice venturo laetentur ut omnia saeclo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then shall men on the account of Profit <hi>turn their Swords to Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shares,</hi>
and the Religion-Trading false Prophet baffled by fate, shall then say
as 'tis in <hi>Zachary, Non sunt Propheta, agricola sum.</hi>

I do not wonder at some mens menacing our <hi>English</hi> World with ill news
from Fate. It is no irrational thing to suppose that the false <hi>Prophets</hi> in all
ages did often find it turn to their private account to foretel evil rather than
good to Kingdoms; for that many might hope to mend their fortunes by
the publick ruines, and would therefore be well pleased with the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of ill to the publick, and would celebrate the Predicters; and therefore
it was not without cunning contrived that the prolation of Events by the
ancient Oracles, should be in a double sense sometimes, because it might
then be a moot point whether the Party of those that desired the quiet or
disorder of great Bodies of People was most considerable.</p>
            <p>The most sagacious sort of false Prophets whose chief business it was to
be true to themselves (as the falsest Dice of Gamesters are most true to
the users) did often choose to alarm the People with disastrous Events:
and thus the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi> chose to make the <hi>Shamm-Samuel</hi> entertain
<hi>Saul</hi> with the prediction of his and his Sons death the next day. But 'tis
time for us to follow that great admonition of <hi>Beware of false Prophets,</hi>
when we hear so many foretelling us, as by inspiration, of nothing but <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
and weeping and great mourning in</hi> England, for the continuance
of the decay of Trade, and unavoidable ruine of the Protestant Religion,
and when many such deluders and counterfeit <hi>Lachrymists</hi> cannot (I
fancy) about our weeping on this account, take their measures together
without smiling, according to that Say of <hi>Tully, Potest augur augurem videre
&amp; non ridere?</hi> It is a very great saying of <hi>Tully</hi>'s in his 2d <hi>Book de Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,
Nam ut vere loquamur, superstitio fusa per orbem oppressit omnium fere
animos, atque hominum occupavit imbecillitatem.</hi> And as wise as <hi>Socrates</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Oracles</hi> were necessary
to the preservation of Common-wealths, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth alledge experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in Confirmation thereof; and the murmuring <hi>Iews</hi> thought themselves
ill used by Providence when the age wanted a Prophet among them, tho yet
the Prophets were so frequent in denunciations of wo to them, and like Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
they liked weather that was somewhat like a storm, rather than to lie

Your Lordship hath formerly among the great transactions of your life
shewn your self a noble Adventurer, for the honour and danger that this
kind of <hi>Augury</hi> can import, and particularly by your carrying at once
your Law in your head, and your life in your hand in the sight of a Party
that had been so successful with their Swords and even to <hi>wind-ward</hi> of all
others by inspiration, and when the Conduct of your Politicks so highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
your Prince's Restoration, and so much helped to effect the quash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all the furious <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Monarchy ceasing in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Not without apologizing for my guilt of a solecism like his who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of <hi>War before Hanibal,</hi> by my having so largely addressed my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of the Future State of <hi>England</hi> to such an <hi>Oracle</hi> as your Lordship,
I must at last say,
<q>Non ego sum Vates, sed prisci conscius aevi, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
and have only taken my measures from natural Causes, and judging of
things to come by what have been, and by nature's most firm Constancy to
it self, and things not being ill administrable; and at this rate can further
very safely predict that according to <hi>Iuvenal,</hi>
               <q>Nunquam aliud natura, aliud sapientia dicet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And moreover I have in my predictions of the Future State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
interspersed many Remarks that may be directive, and naturally tend
to enrich the Land and advance its Trade and Industry; and thus I do
account that our Writers of <hi>Almanacks</hi> do some way compensate the loss of
Peoples time employed in regarding how they turn the hand of the Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of Fate round the World, and foretel various Revolutions and Events
here at home and abroad, by their likewise telling them in what <hi>Months</hi>
to set Quick-sets and Fruit and Timber-Trees, dig Gardens, fell Timber,
uncover the Roots of Trees, and to trim all sorts of Fruit-trees from
Moss, Canker, and superfluous Branches, when to transplant Trees and
when to remove Grafts or young Trees, and when to sow all manner of
Garden Seeds and Herbs, when to sow Wheat, and to sow Hemp and
Flax, and by raising in them rational expectations of the Future State of
the Earth meliorated by its Culture.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord,</hi> according to the common connexion of thoughts, it here
comes in my way to think that it is usual in the Scripture and in several
Books, to express the sense of placing <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Tenets</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> in the
World, by the Terms of <hi>Seeds</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> and the spreading of the same
by the growth encrease and <hi>propagation</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and the ceasing of
them by the Terms of <hi>decrease, withering</hi> or <hi>extirpation.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour's</hi>

Laws now are and likely forever to be, Protestants here may not only take
their measures of the natural duration of their Religion, from the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the sublime <hi>Prophet,</hi> viz. <hi>as the days of a Tree are the days of my
People,</hi> but from the stability of the <hi>Lex terrae</hi> and the very Earth.</p>
            <p>I have before spoke of the Papal Power ending in <hi>England</hi> under <hi>Harry</hi>
the 8th, <hi>per simplicem desinentiam,</hi> and by the power of Nature: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Midwifery of the trouble of his Conscience, or any Artifice in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Academies</hi> of Christendom about his Marriage with
his Brothers Relict, the birth of Fate would by necessity of Nature have
(I think) happen'd as it did. Alas! His Marrying her, who had been his
Brothers Wife, was only against the <hi>Iudicial</hi> Law of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and I am
sure was not against the Law of Nature, as all granting the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be indispensable, and the necessity of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> Marrying
their own Sisters, and Gods Commanding them to <hi>increase and multiply,</hi>
and God's calling <hi>Sara Abraham</hi>'s Wife, who yet was his Sister, (when as
that Matrimonial Contract if it had been against Nature had been null)
and granting likewise that God, who never commanded any thing against
the Law of Nature, did yet in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law Command a Brother to
take his Brothers Wife to Marry her, and to <hi>raise up Seed to his Brother,</hi>
must grant: I therefore concluded, that without <hi>Harry</hi> the 8ths either
having any Conscience or any Trouble in it, the weakest pretence in the
strong hand of Nature would have been an effectual Weapon, to have
then beat down the Papal Power in <hi>England,</hi> It was <hi>Nature</hi> that did, as I
may say, <hi>raise up that strong Seed</hi> at that time both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and elsewhere, that ended in the Divorce of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and many Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
from the <hi>Papal</hi> Power.</p>
            <p>And to resume the Comparison of the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> 'tis obvious to
us to consider that while our Ships Royal were formerly made of the <hi>Oaks</hi>
in our <hi>Forests</hi> that were generally <hi>self-sown,</hi> that is, such as sprang from
Acorns dropping from Trees, or that Birds in their flights let fall, it may
be said that those materials for rearing the Walls of the Kingdom, were
themselves reared by the hand of Nature, and that those Seeds falling in
a Soyle proper for them, and by the Forest Laws guarded at first from the
fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of Men or Beasts, and by the Autumnal Rains naturally beaten into
the Earth, and defended by the procerity of many other Trees from the
injuries of the Wind and Sun, were by the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of the God of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:103047:192"/>
brought within the high <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>Arbores Dei,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is. And moreover while it many times happens, that we see one
Timber Tree grow out of the Body of another, and particularly an
<hi>Oak</hi> out of a <hi>Beech</hi> (and which may be well supposed to have so happened
from an <hi>Acorn</hi> dropt by a Bird into the hollow part of a decaying <hi>Beech</hi>)
and there meeting with a reception from the putrid parts of the <hi>Beech,</hi>
and the Rain there furthering its passage downward; and the Dews there
watering it from Heaven, and the Beech fencing it conveniently from the
Wind and Sun, the Stem of an Oak doth there naturally shoot up, and
as naturally pierce its way for its strong Branches through the sides of the
Beech, and work its Root into the ground through the Root of that Tree,
and in time causeth it as certainly to be thrust out of Nature as it could
have been by any extirpation; and when a decaying Oak is thus powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vanquished by the Seed of a less famous Tree, (as to this purpose we
are told by Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> in his excellent Discourse of <hi>Forest Trees,</hi> that
<hi>persons of undoubted truth have asserted it, that they have seen a Tree cut in
the middle whose heart was Ash-wood and the exterior part Oak)</hi> we may
justly say that Nature did produce all these effects. And the <hi>Energy</hi> of nature
thus casually causing one Tree to penetrate through another into the Earth,
and there without noise forever to displace it, is as perfectly applicable to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary
<hi>Tenets</hi> and <hi>Doctrines:</hi> and thus (as I may with a running view
observe) the Seed of the Christian Religion, being (tho from some mean
and obscure hands) dropt on the decaying great Trees of <hi>Iudaism</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism,</hi>
presently wrought it self through their Bodies and Roots; and
afterward the nobleness of the temper of the Primitive Christianity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
in the World, that Religion, whose heart of Oak had lasted so long,
and outbraved all the Storms of Persecution, was yet pierced through by
<hi>Arrianism:</hi> and <hi>Arrius</hi> perplexing the simplicity of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion
with such Intrigues of <hi>vain Philosophy,</hi> that instead of converting mens
hearts turned their brains, and even <hi>Constantine</hi>'s own (as appeared by his
banishing <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and then recalling, and then banishing him again) and
when the Christian <hi>Divines vexed every vein of his heart</hi> more than they
did <hi>Iulian</hi>'s, and very laudably in his Council of <hi>Nice</hi> presented him with

obvious to the view of the gazing World, and the Branches of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
and <hi>Calvinistick</hi> Tenets appearing through its sides, the quiet and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Order of <hi>Capuchins</hi> was invented for the praying for its growth and
flourishing in the <hi>Year</hi> 1530. and ten years afterward the Active Fiery Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> was invented to extirpate the Men that wished ill to its
growth, and after that the Fathers of the Oratory were set up to extoll
and preach up the Tree, but Nature would not be extirpated: the Potent
Seminal Virtue of the Rational Religion dropt on the Tree of the other,
hath passed its roots through and through, and (as I may say) tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated
it self through them, and rooted it self deep both into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
World, and into States and Kingdoms and their Laws, and will
in time probably leave not one <hi>Fibre</hi> or <hi>Capillamentum</hi> of the Roots of the
Irreligionary part of the Tenets of Popery remaining in Nature: and shew
the World that the <hi>Schisma Anglicanum</hi> that <hi>Sanders</hi> and other Papists cry
out of as so unnatural, was a mere natural <hi>Scissure</hi> or <hi>Rupture</hi> of the parts of
the decaying <hi>Tree</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that came to pass from the Seed
of the Protestant Religion being cast thereon.</p>
            <p>And such a Natural <hi>Scissure</hi> hath the Religion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
made through the sides and roots of Protestant Recusancy: and the
Seeds that by the hands of Non-conformists, probably guided by <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
have been laid on the Royal-Oak of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which they
vainly thought decay'd, were in effect thrown away: and as the old <hi>Prophetic</hi>
Fiction represents it, that every great Tree included a certain <hi>Tutelar Genius</hi>
and still living with it, it may be said that Nature it self is the Tutelar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of that <hi>Plant of Renown,</hi> that (according to the Scripture expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
we may call the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and will ever live with
it.</p>
            <p>The Numbers of our Non-conformists are daily decaying, and the names
of their Tenets will probably be in a short time forgotten.</p>
            <p>We are told in <hi>Townsend</hi>'s Collections that Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> mention'd
it in one of the Parliaments of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> viz. in <hi>Anno 1593. That
there were then near 20000 Brownists in</hi> England: a number somewhat
near as great as that of the Papists to be estimated from the <hi>Bishops Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</hi>
The name of those <hi>Schismaticks</hi> is evaporated, and their Tenets are
not more known or enquired into by the <hi>Populace,</hi> then are the <hi>Heresies</hi>
of the <hi>Bardesanistae,</hi> the <hi>Aquei,</hi> the <hi>Abelonitae,</hi> the <hi>Messaliani,</hi> and some

            <p>As was remarked concerning the late Non-Conforming <hi>Divines</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

and Retail-Traders in Corporations, (where before the King's Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the Professors of the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
and how vastly such Professors do every where over-shoot the
Dissenters in numbers: and how the Seed of the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath
as naturally and with as much ease pierced through the Body of theirs
and dissolved its Roots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as doth the Seed of an Oak often growing in the
Body of a decayed Willow.</p>
            <p>The times were known in the <hi>Reigns</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi>
and King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, and likewise since, (till within these late years)
that some <hi>States-men</hi> when their Court-Interest was decaying and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

would plant their perswasion in the Church, plant themselves the better
in the State: but (<hi>humanly speaking</hi>) such Conjunctures of time will
come here no more: and the seeming <hi>Eradication</hi> of such a <hi>Religion-Trade</hi>
in Church and State, is a strong Indication, <hi>That our Heavenly Father</hi> or
(as I may say) the God of <hi>Nature never planted it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if there were no Laws in being to <hi>extirpate</hi> any Dissenters <hi>Schism,</hi>
or separation from our Church, or to Mulct or Excommunicate the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Separaters, or if any of those Laws were never Executed (as through
the vigilance of our Magistrates they have been) yet is there one apparent
way whereby the Conformists to the Church of <hi>England</hi> could now as
easily lessen their numbers, and consequently extirpate their Potency every
where, as they can frame a thought or resolution to do it, and by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Engine than that with which our Universities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>

but by <hi>discommuning</hi> them, that is to say, by forbidding
the <hi>Scholars</hi> to Trade with them.</p>
            <p>Their own forbearance of buying from Conformists the Wares that

<hi>handful</hi> of Popish and Protestant Recusants both in Corporations, and out
of them too when they please, and in effect reduce them to the Condition
the many <hi>Empericks</hi> in our Land would be in, if they only sold <hi>Physick</hi> to
one another.</p>
            <p>I affect not to be a <hi>Propounder</hi> of any new Law, or of the execution
of any old that may give the least Addition of trouble to any Member of
the Realm, whose Principles and Practices are not justly suspected to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the disturbance of the whole: and my being informed by some of my
Correspondents, who are very impartial observers of things, that many of
the <hi>Dissenters</hi> of this Age have made the Press send forth several of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timoniarchical
Principles of the former, and as if they designed to revive its
Rebellion, and that tho the same <hi>Laws</hi> that have secured our Religion, have
likewise secured the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> solely to the King, and Enacted,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103047:194"/>
that <hi>it is not lawful on any pretence to take up Arms,</hi> &amp;c. yet that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is justly apprehensive of many <hi>Dissenters</hi> and their <hi>Pastors,</hi> own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the former Doctrine of <hi>Resistance,</hi> I could wish (as I did in behalf of
the Papists) that they would themselves offer to his Majesty's Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
such a way of a <hi>Test</hi> or Assurance of their being become <hi>sound parts of
the State,</hi> and that they aim at no power of disturbing it; and as to his
Royal Wisdom may appear substantial and satisfactory till they do so I wish
that not only the Magistracy but all private loyal persons would have such
a regardful eye on them as is had in Foreign parts on those that come for
<hi>Prattiques</hi> from infected places, and bring no <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Health,</hi> and that
they would have <hi>Prattique</hi> or Commerce with such of them: which would
soon enforce them to <hi>live by themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in this Discourse already acknowledged it to your <hi>Lordships</hi> just
praise, that you <hi>are not of too narrow a Spirit or Principles as to Protestant
Dissenters,</hi> as supposing that you had such <hi>Sentiments</hi> of the usage fit to
be afforded to some of them, that our Learned <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Winchester</hi> own'd
in a <hi>Letter</hi> to your <hi>Lordship,</hi> which you once shewed me: and I was as
ready to be their Excusator as any of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could be till
I saw their ingratitude so instrumental in Cancelling the <hi>Declaration of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence:</hi>
and still out of a natural inclination do, as I said in the Case of
the <hi>Papists,</hi> wish them all that share of the Royal Favour that would not
undo themselves and others: and (as I said in the Case of the Papists) do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the continuance of the old Laws against <hi>Protestant</hi> Recusants necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in this Conjuncture, that the King in whom the Executive Power of
the Laws is lodged, may sharpen the edge against any one of the Party
that should be an aggressor against the Peace of the Kingdom, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering how often many of the <hi>Puritans</hi> have took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the publick pressures of the Crown in former Ages, and that
while it was <hi>in procinctu</hi> to withstand a Foreign Invasion. My Lord
Keeper <hi>Puckering</hi>'s Observation of their Temper expressed in his memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Speech is known to all: and the present apprehensions in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of danger from Dissenters, have sufficiently evinced the Prudence of
his Majesty's Measures in not repealing the Penal Clauses in our <hi>Statutes</hi>
against Protestant <hi>Recusants.</hi> When they who were regarded as <hi>weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
do now <hi>fortiter Calumniari</hi> and <hi>Libel</hi> the Government, and call whom
they will <hi>Iulian,</hi> 'tis necessary that the Prince by having the power of
the Penal Laws in his hand, should be able to discriminate those who have
not yet discriminated themselves: and in the Case of Persons stupid
and perverse, 'tis fitter <hi>that Children should be Lachrymists than old
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have of late from one end
of the Land to the other alarmed the People with Exhortations against
<hi>Disloyalty,</hi> as loud as those in a late Conjuncture against Popery, and the
King's Ministers were informed of the <hi>Altum silentium,</hi> in the Conventicles
as to any making the <hi>English</hi> Bibles there support the Rights of our
<hi>English</hi> Kings, and that the <hi>Iulians</hi> there were <hi>Apostates</hi> from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Non-Conformists in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time, and had forgot how
<hi>Reynolds, Whitaker, Cartwright, Dod, Traverse,</hi> &amp;c. had in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
disowned the assigning it as a Cause of the Primitive Obedience,
<hi>Quia deerant vire,</hi> and that a new Sect of false <hi>weak Brethren</hi> had learned
to urge the <hi>deerant vires,</hi> 'twas time for the King to keep the strength of
the old Laws in his hands, and occasionally to arm them against the
<hi>petulant insolence</hi> of any Seditious Protestant or Popish Recusants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:103047:194"/>
I have been far from recommending in this <hi>Discourse</hi> the <hi>Exterminium
haereticorum,</hi> or <hi>Extirpation</hi> of any <hi>Recusants:</hi> but have endeavoured
with the sedateness requisite in a Philosophical or Political Disquisition, to
give my Judgment of the Natural Causes that induce me to expect the
<hi>Extermination</hi> only of things, or Principles Relionary, and indeed to
speak more properly, of that <hi>part</hi> of Mens Principles only that is <hi>irreligio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
and against Nature, and to expect such parts being <hi>luce delenda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I expect not that all the Debates of the <hi>Religionary</hi> part of <hi>Presbytery</hi>
should here among all men cease, tho yet I have conjectured that they
who should write professedly of that Subject here would want Readers, and
as I believe too Discoursers of the <hi>Latitudinarian Hypothesis</hi> would likewise:
and do think that many little Religionary Speculative Notions about the
meaning of some obscure passages in <hi>Scripture</hi> may to some of our Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
seem great, and employ their time in Debates, and as when the famous
<hi>Ainsworth</hi> and <hi>Broughton</hi> heretofore had before their Congregations of
Dissenters who went hence to <hi>Holland</hi> many and fierce disputes about the
Controvesie, <hi>whether</hi> Aarons <hi>ephod were blew or Sea-green,</hi> a Controversie
that puzzled all the <hi>Dyers</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> (as <hi>Fuller</hi> says of it in his
<hi>Church History</hi>) as well as it did our separatists there, that took so much
pains to be therein illuminated, and which I think the light of a Farthing
Candle brought in any night among them, might have easily settled (or as
I may say deleted) in regard that <hi>blew</hi> and <hi>yellow</hi> making a <hi>green,</hi> the
<hi>yellow</hi> of the flame of the Candle would have made what appeared <hi>blew</hi>
by day, to have seem'd <hi>green</hi> at night, and prevented their further <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematising</hi>
one another as Schismaticks about the same.</p>
            <p>And as I beforementioned it out of a late <hi>Book</hi> of a <hi>Divine</hi> of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> that some of the <hi>Reliogionary</hi> parts of Popery he instanceth
in, viz. <hi>Invocation of Saints, Transubstantiation, Purgatory, are and will be
learnedly and voluminously defended to the Worlds end,</hi> I believe the same
may be so in Popish Countries abroad, and that the same will be believed
by many Persons here, tho yet the voluminous discussion of the same
hath long been (and is like to be) out of fashion here, and reflections on
the same <hi>en passant,</hi> or only in short <hi>Treatises</hi> may be thought by our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
sufficient to guide their <hi>Auditors</hi> from mistakes therein, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to confute: and I believe that our <hi>English</hi> Church will never be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the <hi>growth</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> under any
Prince, we may have who shall believe it, nor of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
under any Prince of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> perswasion, nor of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s
<hi>horrendum decretum</hi> relating to <hi>reprobation</hi> (as 'tis call'd) under any
Prince that may believe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Calvin,</hi> tho yet till the Peace of
<hi>Munster</hi> the timid People of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Religions hating
one another more than they did Papists abroad in the World, were so
much imposed on by fears and jealousies in Case a <hi>Lutheran</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi>
Prince should by the right of Lineal Descent come to rule them.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Munster Peace</hi> has taught them better things: and should I ever
hear that any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Prince here did according to the power
by Law reposed in him, relax some of the Penalties of the Law in Case
of Recusancy, that as things now are, Recusancy would not be thereby
rendered considerably prolific with <hi>Converts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho I have given my opinion as beforementioned concerning the Fact
of the encrease of the number of the <hi>Papists</hi> in the Conjuncture of the
<hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> and do not think fit to alter it, yet I can tell
your <hi>Lordship</hi> that a Person of great Sagacity who I believe considered
the State of their Numbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here then very carefully, and entirely believe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103047:195"/>
what he published thereof in Print, I mean the Author of the <hi>Catholick
Apology</hi> with a reply, &amp;c. there saith, that <hi>during the Year</hi> 1672.
(and which he calls <hi>a year of Peace) there was not one Priest, one Mass
one Conversion more in</hi> England, <hi>than in the Year 1663, 1666. or any other
time of trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in this Discourse spoke of such a <hi>perfect hatred against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
as may always consist with a perfect love to Papists, and cinge not
a hair of their heads more than a Lambent fire.</hi> I have acknowledged
<hi>the great mortifications austerities and zealous devotions, not only among
many of the Religious Orders of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but of the common
People,</hi> and have allowed a <hi>sober Party</hi> to the <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselves, and
have reason to believe that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, that hammer of Heretical
Princes, as his <hi>Works</hi> shew him, was yet of so soft and gentle a disposition
as would not permit him to hurt a Fly or tread on a Worm: and I have
reflected on no other Principles of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> with any sharpness than
what the present Pope hath done, and which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Inquisition</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>
or elsewhere would have allowed me to do: and I have been as I still am
so free from any thing of rancour or acerbity in my Principles, relating to
the usage of the Papists that an <hi>English</hi> Priest of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Author of the remarkable Book beforementioned, called the <hi>Advocate
of Conscience Liberty, or an Apology for toleration rightly stated,</hi> publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Year 1673. (and the most considerable Book that had for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years been writ in favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and a Book our
Learned Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> refers to in a very excellent printed Sermon of
his <hi>p.</hi> 43. and called, <hi>The Reformation justified,</hi> and Preached before the
<hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London</hi>) doth me the honour there to adopt as his own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sayings of mine, he found in a printed Discourse of mine that was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive
of the use of force in matters of Religion, and gave me occasion
when I read some passages in his 14th, 25th, 26th, 34th, 43d, 54th, 55th,
62d, 94th <hi>Pages</hi> there, to call to mind that I had read them elsewhere: and
much good might any thing in my Writings do that Author, and he
was as welcome to them as if they had been his own: and I am sorry that
his not citing an <hi>Author</hi> where he should have done it, was accompanied
with another misfortune of citing one where he should not, I mean his in
<hi>p.</hi> 225. citing of <hi>D' Ossat.</hi> He might have cited another passage of mine
against <hi>Hereticide</hi> as being impolitic if he had pleased to have took notice
of it among its fellows, and where I observed, that <hi>the putting of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Catholick Priests here to death, did propagate their Religion: and that
that Faith was given to the Assertors of</hi> Popish <hi>Opinions, because they were
dying, which they could not have drawn from me but by raising the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I still own what in <hi>p.</hi> 93. he partly cites of mine as said by another <hi>Author,
That if it be not lawful for every man to be guided by his private Iudgment in
things of Religion, 'twill be hardly possible to acquit our separation from the</hi>
Romish <hi>Church from the guilt of Schism,</hi> &amp;c. and if any Papist shall as to
any <hi>Tenet</hi> that can properly come within the <hi>denomination</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> tell
me, that his private Judgment guides him to receive the guidance of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that therefore I a Protestant ought not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to bear hard upon him on the account of such adhesion to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Judgment, I shall own the <hi>Argumentum ad hominem</hi> so far as to tell
him that I am not inclined <hi>eo nomine</hi> to he severe to him.</p>

once, that I had not resolv'd to view twice, I intend to improve some
Intervals of leisure hereafter in <hi>reviewing</hi> of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> and shall explain
some passages therein on occasion and <hi>add</hi> others: and if I doubt of any
thing particularly in the various matters of <hi>Calculation</hi> herein contained
(and of many of which few or none perhaps have written) or shall
alter my opinion therein, or in any thing else, I shall acquaint your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
why I do so; and do as much value my self on my natural temper
of acknowledging a quick and ready assent to any proposition of Reason
that convinceth my understanding (how contradictory soever the same
may be to any former Notion of mine) as any man can value himself
on his thinking he never erred, or on his Abilities either by Eloquence
or Sophisms to make others think so, and to make them erre with him:
and do still account this to be one of the best properties in the best <hi>Ship,</hi>
namely, the soonest to <hi>feel</hi> its <hi>Rudder:</hi> and do think, that as none but

            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> after the Efflux of the various Intervals in which this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
was written, it having happened that the <hi>Papists</hi> are to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
satisfaction of impartial Judges of Men and Things, become as found a
<hi>part</hi> of this Nation as they were and are of the <hi>Dutch</hi> States, (and as
throughout this <hi>Discourse</hi> I always supposed them capable of being) and
that the <hi>Body</hi> of them is as <hi>Loyal</hi> as can be <hi>wished,</hi> and likely forever so
to continue, and that none but the <hi>Factious</hi> would have them now to
groan under the Penal Laws as formerly, I will not despair of many of our
<hi>Dissenters</hi> improving hereafter in <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as likewise of
<hi>Conformity,</hi> but hope they will <hi>really</hi> deserve to be thought as <hi>Loyal</hi> as
they were so <hi>de facto,</hi> by many greater Judges than my self at the time
of the beginning of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> and when so many in our Loyal <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
were so extravagant in their Charity to <hi>Dissenters,</hi> as to think
that St. <hi>Peters</hi> Ship was the only <hi>Fire-Ship,</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> a quiet
trading <hi>Merchant-man,</hi> and being hared with <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi>
were so eager to have the very <hi>Laws</hi> against <hi>Protestant</hi> Recusants Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
            <p>But as I hinted the <hi>distinguishing</hi> between <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cks
to be absurd, and as a gross Error about <hi>Proportion</hi> or <hi>Numbers</hi>
would appear more ridiculous in <hi>Archimedes</hi> than in an ordinary <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician;</hi>
so true <hi>Protestants</hi> Non-sense or true <hi>Protestants</hi> Rebellion is to
be no <hi>favourable</hi> Case: and the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Protestants</hi> must not more than
that of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> be allowed as a <hi>Charm</hi> to raise the <hi>Devil</hi> of

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Luther</hi> and those who of old deserved the Name of True <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
abroad as great Co-workers with <hi>Nature,</hi> in introducing the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> were almost deafen'd by their <hi>Papal</hi> Adversaries Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes
of the <hi>tunica inconsutulis,</hi> and when particularly as <hi>Sleidan</hi> tells us in
his <hi>Commentarys, Granvill</hi> the <hi>Emperors</hi> Deputy in an <hi>harangue</hi> he made to
the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Wormes</hi> did so passionately conjure them, <hi>That they would not
tear Christ's seamless Coat,</hi> the Protestant <hi>Populace</hi> was so far from being
<hi>aw'd</hi> out of their way by those <hi>words,</hi> as that they gave their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Inconsutulistae,</hi> or <hi>the seamless men:</hi> and as little will
any of our false and <hi>jesuited</hi> Rebellious <hi>Dissenters</hi> effect any thing but the
<hi>abuse</hi> of the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing</hi> of <hi>Protestancy,</hi> and the <hi>ridiculing</hi> themselves
by their usurping on a <hi>pretence</hi> to be <hi>TRVE PROTESTANTS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It comes here in my way to observe that some of our <hi>Dissenters</hi> and
other <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestants, who are so apt without sense or reason to call
others <hi>Enemies to the King and Kingdom,</hi> have really appeared <hi>such</hi> to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103047:196"/>
both, by their having so much encreased <hi>Divisions</hi> in our <hi>State</hi> as well as
<hi>Church,</hi> and by their having been the <hi>Aggressors</hi> in the dividing the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace
here by spightful <hi>calling</hi> of <hi>Names,</hi> which yet I have not thought
fit to mention in this <hi>Discourse,</hi> and whereby the <hi>Loyal</hi> have been forced
some way to <hi>retaliate,</hi> not only out of a generous scorn, but that they
might speak intelligibly: such <hi>Aggressors</hi> have likewise notoriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the <hi>Divisions</hi> in the Kingdom by their too much encouraging
the <hi>Plot-Witnesses</hi> (and particularly that <hi>Recorded</hi> Profligate who so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
perjured himself in the Case of your <hi>Lordship,</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Peterborough</hi> and a <hi>High-born</hi> Prince) and by extreme acerbity and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
relating to the Persons of <hi>Papists.</hi> But their most fatal injury to
their Country hath been their weakning its <hi>Reputation</hi> (a thing which
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> must necessarily subsist by, as well as <hi>private</hi> Persons) through
their studied Artifice of making a Popish Plot to be thought so long li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed,
and when <hi>England</hi>'s reputation for its <hi>strength,</hi> or which is all one
for its being <hi>united</hi> within it self, was much more necessary for its well
being, than in any <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of time that perhaps ever happen'd.</p>
            <p>Considering therefore that the present <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth, and
that the probable Future State of it will call so peremptorily on all his
Majesty's Subjects to preserve their Country by the <hi>Exterminium</hi> of all
<hi>Divisions,</hi> as I think I have not brought any disreputation to my own
Judgment by adventuring to predict the necessary <hi>growth</hi> of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yalty</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all <hi>England</hi> to become in time one <hi>Sober</hi> Party; so I am sure I have
provided for the <hi>Reputation</hi> of my <hi>Country</hi> thereby as well as I could.</p>
            <p>I am not so angry as to think that many of our Religionary <hi>Recusants</hi>
will either on the account of the Divine <hi>Prayer</hi> of the holy <hi>Iesus</hi> for the
<hi>uniting</hi> his Flock, or of any <hi>Scripture-predictions</hi> of the more <hi>pacific</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
that Christians shall at last be blest with, be thus inclined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to shew themselves (as I may say) honest <hi>Inconsutulists,</hi> and to
forbear <hi>dividing</hi> our Realm as formerly: but by their <hi>Interest</hi> so visibly
and palpably concerned in the strengthening the Kingdom, I suppose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of <hi>Nature</hi> may be instrumental in the accomplishment of such
Scripture-predictions: and just as the <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Concern</hi> of the <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
in the <hi>Gospel</hi> who hoped to have Christ's <hi>seamless</hi> Coat come to their
<hi>share,</hi> inclined them not to <hi>rend</hi> it and to cast <hi>Lots</hi> for the same, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Scripture</hi> was <hi>fulfilled</hi> as is said in the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have mentioned it out of the <hi>Scripture</hi> that the <hi>Stork knoweth her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
times, and the Crane and the Swallow observe the time of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:</hi>
and I may (thinking of a great Prince abroad) add, that the sight
of a <hi>numberless</hi> Flock of <hi>Stares</hi> making somewhat like a <hi>Cloud</hi> in the Air,
and safely flying close together, while there is a <hi>Falcon</hi> towering above
them, will direct the <hi>Populace</hi> of several parts of <hi>Christendom</hi> to Loyalty
and to the natural <hi>Garranty</hi> of <hi>Vnion</hi> at home under their respective Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,

            <p>As I have in this <hi>Discourse</hi> entertained your <hi>Lordship</hi> with somewhat like
a short <hi>Historical</hi> Account of the accidental encrease and natural decrease
of the Numbers of the <hi>Papists</hi> in several <hi>Conjunctures</hi> since the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
so I shall in my intended <hi>Review</hi> with the like of those of the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi>
and impartially take notice of the respective <hi>Conjunctures</hi> of their
<hi>petulant insolence:</hi> and whereby I shall shew to what strange <hi>Principles</hi>
of Out-raging our <hi>Municipal</hi> Laws they were gradually abandoned.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Specimen</hi> hereof I shall observe, That <hi>Ames</hi> a Learned <hi>Dissenter</hi> of
the former Age, in the <hi>Preface</hi> of his <hi>Puritanismus Anglicanus,</hi> printed in
the <hi>year</hi> 1610, speaking of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Clerical</hi> Dissenters, saith,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103047:196"/>
That the <hi>Crime</hi> they were adjudged guilty of in <hi>England</hi> was, <hi>Quod obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naverunt

            <p>But we may with <hi>horror</hi> ask, <hi>what kind</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> is it, that those have
<hi>Outraged</hi> since 41, and some of them since the <hi>year</hi> 60, and since a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

OBLIGATION
Relating to the King's

In point of
Conscience discuss'd,

the Takers of those Oaths proved to be thereupon
become bound to bear Faith and True Allegiance
to those HEIRS and SUCCESSORS
in the Due and Legal Course of DESCENT.</head>
            <p>I Shall without <hi>Proem</hi> or <hi>Passions</hi> here approach to the Great <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagus</hi>
of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and having <hi>stated</hi> the <hi>Question</hi> of
<hi>what Obligation</hi> to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> results from the
<hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> in point of <hi>Conscience,</hi> shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
my judgment of the same in some <hi>Conclusions,</hi> and answer <hi>Objections</hi>
that may occur.</p>
            <p>I shall here take Notice that the word <hi>Obligation</hi> from being Originally
a <hi>Band</hi> or <hi>Ty</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Payment</hi> of Debts, hath been since fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
applied to the discharge of <hi>Moral</hi> Offices. <hi>Obligatio est juris
vinculum quo necessitate restringimur alicujus solvendae Rei. Instìt. de Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligationibus.</hi>
And <hi>pursuant</hi> hereunto men may be properly said to <hi>pay</hi>
their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to Princes in discharge of their Natural <hi>Obligations</hi> and
their <hi>Oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I consider not the extent of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of the <hi>Natural</hi> Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
that <hi>English</hi> Subjects <hi>owe</hi> their Monarchs, nor yet their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Allegiance from the <hi>Divine</hi> Law <hi>positive,</hi> nor from the <hi>Lex terrae;</hi>
tho yet I account it very plain that we are on all those accounts <hi>bound</hi>
to <hi>pay</hi> them <hi>Allegiance:</hi> but do choose to confine my discussion of the
<hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as resulting from the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and
<hi>Supremacy,</hi> and as mentioned in our <hi>Statutes</hi> in relation to our King's
<hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> and most <hi>particularly</hi> from that CLAUSE in
the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> viz. <hi>I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103047:200"/>
Majesty, his</hi> HEIRS <hi>and</hi> SUCCESSORS, <hi>and him and them
will defend to the uttermost of my power against all Conspiracies and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
whatsoever, which shall be made against his or their Persons, their
Crown and Dignity,</hi> &amp;c. And THAT in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> viz.
<hi>And do promise that from henceforth I shall bear Faith and true Allegiance
to the King's Highness, his Heirs and lawful Successors, and to my power
shall assist and defend all Iurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
granted or belonging to the King's Highness, his Heirs and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>And I here enquire, how far the Obligation resulting from those Clauses
in those Oaths, in Relation to such <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> may be judged in
point of Conscience to extend?</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Question</hi> thus <hi>explained</hi> and <hi>stated</hi> I shall lay down these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Conclusions;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That those Oaths (and indeed all others) do respect a Duty
to be performed in the Future time; that is, at the least <hi>some</hi> time tho
perhaps a very <hi>small</hi> one after the Obligation contracted, as is well open'd
by <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his first <hi>Lecture</hi> of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Oaths,</hi> and where he
shews that <hi>this happens in every Oath assertory as well as promissory: for
whoever sweareth obligeth himself</hi> ipso facto <hi>to manifest the truth in that
which he is about to say, whether it be in a matter past or present by an Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
or in a Future matter by a</hi> Promissory <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by that part of an Oath <hi>Promissory</hi> contained in the
forementioned <hi>Clauses</hi> of the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by all other Oaths <hi>Promissory,</hi> the Party swearing is bound to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for the Future as much as in him lieth by his <hi>Deeds</hi> to fulfil what
he hath sworn in <hi>words:</hi> and this <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his second <hi>Lecture</hi> hath well
asserted as to an <hi>Oath</hi> Promissory, viz. <hi>That he who endeavours not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that which he hath promised is guilty of Perjury in the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain that in an <hi>Assertory</hi> Oath, if I took the same with a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
mind, and have given my <hi>Testimony</hi> truely, I have <hi>discharged</hi>
my Duty, and have my <hi>Quietus</hi> from my Conscience for the same. But
in an Oath <hi>Promissory,</hi> and particularly in the <hi>Promissory</hi> part of the <hi>Oaths</hi>
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> I am not <hi>discharged</hi> by the sincerity of my
intention in my <hi>promise.</hi> I have engaged my self to <hi>Action,</hi> and have
lanched my self into a Sea of Business from that time forward till the
end of my life, and as there is occasion and opportunity I am to DO
what in those <hi>Clauses</hi> I have promised to the King and his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</hi>
And thus the <hi>Style</hi> of DOING runs in <hi>Numbers 30. 2. If a
man swear an Oath to bind his Soul with a Bond, he shall</hi> DO <hi>according
to all that procedeth out of his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That those</hi> Oaths <hi>and all others are to be taken in the</hi> sense <hi>of
the</hi> Imposer. <hi>For the</hi> Oath <hi>being taken that the</hi> Imposer <hi>may be assured
that the</hi> promise <hi>of the Person swearing shall be effectually made good to
him, there would be no assurance thereof in the least, if the Oath were
to be interpreted otherwise than in the Imposers</hi> sense: <hi>and under this</hi>
Conclusion <hi>it may be properly added,</hi> that <hi>where that</hi> sense <hi>is sufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in the</hi> words, <hi>it is exactly to be stood to, as</hi> Sanderson <hi>hath well
shewed in his second</hi> Lecture <hi>of the aforesaid</hi> Subject, <hi>and where having
shewed how</hi> we must take heed that we impose not on the Oath we have taken,
or any part thereof other sense than that which any other Pious and Prudent
Man (and who being unconcerned in the Business is of a freer Iudgment) may
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103047:200"/>
easily gather out of the Words themselves, <hi>he saith, That</hi> we become without
question guilty of the heinous Crime of Perjury, if that milder interpretation
which encouraged us unto the Oath chance to deceive us. <hi>And in his 6th</hi>
Lecture §. 7. <hi>he saith,</hi> As it is one kind of Perjury to strain the words du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Act of Swearing unto another Sense than that wherein they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the Auditors, so it is another kind of Perjury having sworn ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
not to proceed sincerely, but to decline and elude the strength of the
Oath (tho the words be preserved) with some new forged inventions, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
turning and dressing the words to cloak the guilt of their Conscienc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s as
<hi>Tacitus</hi> saith of some: <hi>and he concludes that</hi> Section <hi>by saying, That</hi>
where the words of an Oath are so clear in themselves, that among honest men
there can be no qu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stion of their meaning, the Party swearing is obliged in
that sense which they apparently afford, and may not either in swearing or
when he hath sworn, stretch those words upon the last of his Interest by any stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
interpretations.</p>
            <p>There appeared nothing more detestable to the Eye of the old <hi>Civil</hi>
Law then <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>trick,</hi> and particularly the destroying the true <hi>Sense</hi>
and meaning of a <hi>Law</hi> by a cavilling fraudulent <hi>interpretation</hi> that retains
the words but confounds the ends for which the Law was made; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
'tis said in the <hi>Digests, In fraudem legis facit qui salvis verbis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,
sententiam ejus circumvenit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this in the Case of an <hi>Oath</hi> was more abominated, and accordingly
<hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, that <hi>Fraus adstringit non dissolvit perjurium.</hi> And if the
<hi>Civil</hi> Law was afterward so provident for the honour of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as to determine in the Case of an <hi>unask'd</hi> free gift, that <hi>Cum in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio
cujuscunque sit hoc facere quod instituit, oportet eum vel minime ad hoc
prosilire, vel cum venire ad hoc properaverit, non quibusdam excogitatis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
suum propositum defraudare, tantamque indevotionem quibusdam quasi
legitimis velamentis prolegere,</hi> any one may judge how much it abhorred
any thing of <hi>fraud</hi> in the evading of the <hi>payment</hi> of a due subjection to
<hi>Sovereign</hi> Power acknowledged by what the thinking Heathens term'd
<hi>Sacramentum,</hi> as if the most eminent, or only thing <hi>emphatically</hi> Sacred,
and religiously to be observed.</p>
            <p>I should not since the Extermination of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Doctrine of
<hi>Equivocating</hi> have thought it worth while so much to dilate on this plain
<hi>Conclusion,</hi> before the <hi>publishing</hi> a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> in our <hi>Metropolis</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi>
1680, called <hi>An Account of the New Sheriffs holding their Office, made
publick upon reason of CONSCIENCE, respecting themselves and
others in regard to the Act for Corporations,</hi> and in which ACT, tho the
Lawgivers meaning of the <hi>Oath</hi> thereby imposed is most apparently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
out of the Words, yet the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Casuistical</hi> Pamphlet
makes it <hi>lawful</hi> to take the <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>subscribe</hi> the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and not in
the <hi>literal strict Construction,</hi> but in an imaginary <hi>sense topp'd</hi> upon the
<hi>Lawgivers,</hi> and that nothing but a vitiated <hi>fancy</hi> or <hi>injudicious</hi> mind could
imagine.</p>
            <p>I was sorry to hear that that <hi>Pamphlet</hi> was writ by a <hi>Non-Conformist</hi>
Divine: and that in a <hi>Conjuncture</hi> when the Magistrates of that <hi>City</hi> were
so hot against the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> any men should be so zealous for the
<hi>Thing</hi> called <hi>Iesuitism,</hi> and that any men by attempting to rivet <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
into their <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Protestancy,</hi> should at once endeavour to rob us
of the <hi>Energy</hi> of the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and of the <hi>Test</hi>
it self, and to make the <hi>sacredness</hi> of all <hi>Oaths</hi> whatsoever to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:103047:201"/>
Let any <hi>sober</hi> Person of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> Party but seriously read that
<hi>Pamphlet</hi> so scandalous to <hi>Protestancy,</hi> and it cannot but give him the
Alarm of <hi>coming out from among them,</hi> for that he must do that would
<hi>come out</hi> even from the <hi>Iesuitick Equivocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there were not a <hi>Church of</hi> England-<hi>Protestancy</hi> in that Loyal <hi>City,</hi>
I may without unjust reflection say it, that <hi>Magistrates</hi> who were Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory
to the erecting that <hi>Paper-Monument</hi> to <hi>Equivocation,</hi> and to the
trying to help it to a <hi>jus Divinum,</hi> and to be a part of <hi>pure Religion and
undefiled,</hi> could bring little honour to our <hi>Metropolis</hi> by calling it a
PROTESTANT CITY on its <hi>Monument</hi> of Stone.</p>
            <p>As we find in the Book of <hi>Iudges</hi> that all that saw that inhumane
Butchering and Quartering out into pieces of the <hi>Levites</hi> Wife by her
own Husband, cried out and said, <hi>There was no such thing done or seen
since the time that the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>came up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt
<hi>until that day,</hi> I believe it may be affirmed that never in any PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT
City in the World, since the time that it was free'd from the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Servitude of the <hi>Papal</hi> Impositions, was any such barbarous
butchering of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of an <hi>Oath</hi> by <hi>Equivocation</hi> in a printed
<hi>Case</hi> sent about the Kingdom by the pretended <hi>Espousers</hi> of <hi>Protestancy,</hi>
ever done or seen. And according to the saying, that <hi>Nisi serpens ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentem
comederit non fit draco,</hi> it may be said that the most superlative and
dreadful outraging of Oaths cannot be compassed but by the Consciences
of pretended Protestants digesting the old Equivocation of the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I consider this therefore that the <hi>false Protestant</hi> Discusser of that
CASE of CONSCIENCE of the SHERIFFS, doth determine
that, <hi>by taking up Arms against the King</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Oath,</hi> is to be
meant against HIS RIGHTFUL GOVERNMENT, and <hi>that
the Oath must be taken in the</hi> SENSE or MEANING <hi>of the Major
part of both Houses that passed it,</hi> and then makes their <hi>meaning</hi> so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to their <hi>words,</hi> and do recollect what is so clearly laid down in my
Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton</hi>'s Treatise <hi>concerning Statutes, and the Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Acts of Parliament,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Assembly of Parliament being
ended,</hi> functi sunt officii <hi>and that as to all of the lower House who are by
Election, their Authority is returned to the Electors so clearly that if they
were altogether assembled again for interpretation by a voluntary Meeting,</hi>
eorum non esset interpretari, <hi>and that then the interpretation of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
falls into the hands of the</hi> Sages <hi>of the Law,</hi> and when I consider
that great <hi>Caution</hi> of <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his said <hi>Book,</hi> that <hi>where we depart from
the words of an Oath to the intent, it must be well proved that there was such
a meaning,</hi> I have a great Compassion for men that are <hi>trick't</hi> into <hi>Perjury</hi>
by the artifice of any <hi>Casuists:</hi> and as I have mentioned a <hi>Crafty</hi> Counsel
<hi>at Law</hi> to be justly odious, and a <hi>Crafty</hi> Councellor of <hi>State</hi> to be more
so, do account a <hi>Crafty</hi> Casuist to be most abominable.</p>
            <p>What effect that <hi>Pamphlet</hi> hath had in debauching the Consciences of
the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> in thus distorting the natural sense of that <hi>Oath</hi> by a
<hi>calumnious</hi> and fraudulent interpretation, and whereby such mens tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Conscience may have become Armour of Proof against all <hi>Oaths,</hi>
I know not. The <hi>Paper</hi> mentions its being design'd for the <hi>edifying</hi> of
others: and that word of <hi>edifying</hi> minds me of the saying of, <hi>Qui judicat
contra conscientiam, aedificat ad gehennam:</hi> and the which too is justly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to a Protestant <hi>Casuist</hi> that giveth Judgment for equivocation.
And it may with a pious horror be thought of, that if Christianity and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103047:201"/>
its Morals should happen to be generally depraved by such <hi>Sophisms</hi> and
<hi>Chicanery</hi> as that Pamphlet is stuffed with, there may be cause of fear
that <hi>the Son of Man</hi> at his second <hi>coming</hi> will not <hi>find</hi> so much as the old
<hi>bona fides</hi> of the Heathens <hi>on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That any</hi> Non-Conformists <hi>of the present Age may see how much the</hi>
Casuistical <hi>Theology of that</hi> Pamphlet <hi>hath degenerated from the</hi> Rule
<hi>about the interpretation of</hi> Oaths <hi>that was in</hi> vogue <hi>among those of the
former, I shall refer them to the Learned</hi> Casuistical <hi>works of</hi> Ames <hi>a
Pious and Learned</hi> Independent <hi>Divine of that Age, printed at</hi> Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>in the</hi> Year 1631, <hi>and where in his 4th</hi> Book, Chap. 22. De Iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,
<hi>he very learnedly inveighs against the use of</hi> Equivocation <hi>and</hi>
Mental <hi>Reservation in</hi> Oaths, <hi>and maketh it to be Equivocation,</hi> Cùm ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba
ipsa quae usurpantur sunt ambigui sensus, &amp; illo sensu accipiuntur à jurante,
quem audientes cupit celare ut alio sensu ab ipsis accipiantur; <hi>and coming to
determine that</hi> Question, <hi>viz.</hi> In what sense ought the words of an Oath
to be taken? <hi>he answers, viz.</hi> In that sense that we judge they who hear us
will conceive: that is, regularly in that sense that the words have in the
common use of men: because the signification of words depends on mens use.
<hi>And he there afterward coming to this</hi> Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Are the Words of an
Oath always to be taken strictly as they sound? <hi>answers,</hi> That an Oath, by
reason of the danger of Perjury, is of <hi>strict right and interpretation,</hi> so that
it may not admit those larger Explications which in other Facts and Sayings
often take place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As a Humane Law forbidding a thing simply evil, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
a thing in its own nature good, doth induce a new Obligation
in Conscience, so doth the Addition of an Oath imposed by the Law
for the avoiding of that thing so simply evil, super-induce a farther Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to avoid it: and therefore the Persons who take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
invoking God as <hi>Witness</hi> and <hi>Revenger</hi> that they do plainly and
sincerely acknowledge and swear according to these express words by
them spoken, and according to the plain and common sense and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the same words, <hi>Without any Equivocation or mental Evasion
or secret Reservation whatsoever, and heartily, willingly, and truely upon
the TRUE FAITH of a CHRISTIAN,</hi> are under a more
especial and particular Obligation to abhor all <hi>subtle</hi> and <hi>cavilling</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of the <hi>sense</hi> of the said <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As the plain and common sense and understanding of the
words in the <hi>Clauses</hi> respecting the Future time of <hi>bearing Faith and true
Allegiance to his Majesty,</hi> &amp;c. do lay an actual Promissory Obligation on the
swearer to bear the same to him during his life, so <hi>reddendo singula singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
they lay an actual Promissory Obligation on the swearer to bear the
same to his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> afterward in the <hi>Due</hi> and <hi>Legal</hi> Course of
Descent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Promise</hi> in the <hi>Clause</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> runneth thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
and <hi>DO Promise</hi> that FROM HENCEFORTH I WILL <hi>bear
Faith,</hi> &amp;c. And words could not express an actual Obligation incurr'd
and to have some Operation in the next Moment of time, both in relation
to his Majesty and his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> more clearly than those have
expressed the same. And the <hi>Promise</hi> sworn in the <hi>Clause</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> of
<hi>Allegiance,</hi> viz. <hi>I will bear Faith,</hi> &amp;c. doth likewise after the Oath sworn
immediately operate in its Obligation to the King and his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors</hi>
in the next Interval of Time imaginable, however the word <hi>hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth</hi>
be not there used as in the former Oath: for the <hi>Clause</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:103047:202"/>
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> binding me not only to preserve the King, but the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Monarchy, I could not be effectually enough by the Oath obliged to
the same without being obliged in the shortest time afterward, not only
to forbear prejudicing any right that belongs to the King and his Heirs
and Successors, but to defend the same.</p>
            <p>The pointing of men to an ordinary <hi>Lease</hi> where the <hi>Lessee</hi> at the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi>
thereof enters into an <hi>actual</hi> Obligation both in <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi>
to pay his Rent to the <hi>Lessor, his Heirs and Assigns,</hi> that is, as it shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
due to each respectively, shews a present <hi>actual</hi> Obligation incurr'd
of discharging any Future <hi>Dues</hi> successively, and (as I said) <hi>reddendo
singula singulis,</hi> to be familiar enough to common thought and vulgar
apprehensions, and likewise the word <hi>Heirs</hi> to be so too.</p>
            <p>The many who take the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> have spent
enough time, and perhaps too much ventured eternity, in thinking of and
providing for their <hi>Heirs;</hi> and who commonly as <hi>landed</hi> men know that
by virtue of right either immediately or mediately derived from the
Crown, they are only enabled to say, <hi>They are seized of this or that Land
in their</hi> Demesne <hi>as of Fee,</hi> and which is as much as to say, <hi>It is their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesne
or proper Land after a sort, because it is to them and their Heirs,</hi> and
that such Fee doth <hi>vi termini</hi> imply <hi>Fealty,</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> sworn: and the
thought of which would on the turning of the Tables make them suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
apprehensive of their danger, if there could be any <hi>ambiguity</hi> in the
word <hi>Heir,</hi> or the <hi>Crown</hi> granting Land <hi>to them and their Heirs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall here take occasion by the way to reflect on an Antimonarchical
saying I met with printed, as spoke in <hi>Parliament</hi> by a great <hi>Demagogue</hi>
some years ago, viz. <hi>That the Cottager here holds his right by the same Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
that the Crown holds its.</hi> For it is false that our King or the Crown
oweth <hi>Fealty</hi> to any <hi>Superior,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> only. The King's Throne is <hi>the
Throne of God,</hi> and the <hi>Style</hi> of Crown'd Heads is <hi>Dei gratiâ,</hi> and <hi>by him
Kings Reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed. If there could be <hi>Ambiguity</hi> in the word <hi>Heirs,</hi> the
worth of our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> would soon be depretiated, and it would be but
<hi>Res unius aetatis;</hi> and particularly where it saith, <hi>Concessimus Deo &amp; hac
praesenti charta confirmavimus pro nobis &amp; HAEREDIBVS nostris in
perpetuum, quod Ecclesia Anglicana libera sit &amp; habeat omnia jura sua inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra
&amp; libertates suas illaesas,</hi> and whereby the <hi>British</hi> Churches are secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
under a Prince of any Religion from <hi>Foreign</hi> Arbitrary impositions
But indeed the Style current in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is, that our <hi>Kings</hi> for
<hi>themselves and their Heirs</hi> forever, did grant the Customs and Liberties
contained in that Charter to our <hi>Ancestors</hi> and their <hi>Heirs</hi> for ever.
Our Ancestors had no occasion to spend time in seeking <hi>Knots</hi> in a
<hi>Bull-rush</hi> or hidden Sense in the words HEIRS and the King's
HEIRS, when so anciently as by the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Fealty</hi> (which every Person
above <hi>fourteen</hi> years old, and every <hi>Tythingman</hi> was obliged to take pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
at the <hi>Court-Leet</hi> within which he lived) they were sworn to the
<hi>King</hi> and his <hi>HEIRS:</hi> and that Oath was taken a fresh every year by
all the Subjects under <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> and <hi>William</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> and is
thus set down by <hi>Pryn</hi> in his <hi>Concordia Discors,</hi> viz. <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>do swear that
FROM THIS DAY FORWARDS I will be Faithful and Loyal
to our Lord the King AND HIS HEIRS,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:103047:202"/>
               <hi>The instances are innumerable of Allegiance anciently Sworn to our</hi>
Kings <hi>and their</hi> Heirs; <hi>and this one for example occureth to me as
Sworn in the time of</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> 4th. <hi>viz.</hi> Sovereign Lord, I <hi>Henry
Percy</hi> become your Subject and Leige-man, and promit to God and you, that
hereafter, I Faith and Troth shall bear to you as to my Sovereign, Leige-Lord,
and to your Heirs, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> of Life and Limb, and of
Earthly Worship, to Live and Die against all Earthly People, and to you,
and to your Commandments, I shall be Obeysant as God me help, and his

               <hi>Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>likewise in that</hi> Book <hi>of his beforemention'd saith, that there
was an</hi> ancient Oath of <hi>Fealty and Allegiance, both by</hi> the Subjects of
<hi>England,</hi> and Kings, Bishops, Nobles and Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> made to
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and Their Heirs, as Supreme Lords of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
in these words, <hi>viz.</hi> Ero fidelis &amp; legalis, fidemque &amp; legalitatem servabo
<hi>Henrico</hi> Regi <hi>Angliae</hi> &amp; haeredibus suis, de vitâ &amp; membris &amp; terreno
honore, contra omnes qui possunt vivere &amp; mori: &amp; nunquam pro aliquo
portabo arma, nec ero in consilio vel auxilio contra eum vel Haeredes suos,
<hi>&amp;c. which Oath he saith,</hi> William, King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and all his Nobles Swore
to King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, &amp; haeredibus suis sicut ligio Domino suo, and
<hi>John Balliol, John Comyn,</hi> with all the Nobles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the first and his Heirs.</p>
            <p>He there likewise gives an account how the Nobles of <hi>England</hi> Swore
<hi>Fealty</hi> to <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and to his <hi>Heirs against all men,</hi> and
how the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> Swore the like <hi>Oath;</hi> and, <hi>That if King</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
<hi>should die without Issue, they would receive Earl</hi> John <hi>his Brother for
their King and Lord,</hi> &amp; juraverunt ei fidelitatem Contra omnes homines,

            </p>
            <p>And he moreover cites the <hi>Record</hi> of the <hi>Writ,</hi> issued to all the <hi>Sheriffs</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> soon after the Birth of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1<hi>st. Son</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> to
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d. To Summon all Persons above 12 years old to Swear</hi>
Fealty <hi>to him, as Heir to the King, and to submit themselves faithfully to
him, as their Liege Lord after his Death.</hi> This form of the <hi>Oath</hi> in the
<hi>Writ</hi> is there mention'd to that effect, <hi>viz. Quod ipsi salvo homagio &amp; fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate

And he there shews how they were <hi>Summon'd</hi> and <hi>Sworn</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
and further how in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>H. 4. The Lords Spiritual

<hi>to the King, to the Prince and his Issue, and to every one of his Sons, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

<hi>Oaths</hi> taken to our Kings and their <hi>Heirs</hi> of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>The Consideration hereof would make any one wonder at the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a late Learned <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and positive pretender to Omniscience
in our <hi>English</hi> Antiquities and <hi>Records,</hi> who in his Detestable <hi>Book</hi> called
<hi>The Rights of the Kingdom,</hi> (and which contains a <hi>farrago</hi> of Impious
Anti-monarchical <hi>Principles,</hi> and Printed in <hi>London,</hi> 1649. and there to
the Scandal of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Name, lately Re-printed by

tyed to the Kings Person, not unto his</hi> Heirs, <hi>and for the Kings</hi> Heirs
(saith he there) <hi>I find them not in our Allegiance.</hi> And he mentions the
<hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as enjoyn'd in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s and

            </p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Cause</hi> in hand; 'Tis sufficient for the <hi>Obligation</hi> I
press, that HEIRS <hi>and</hi> SUCCESORS are so clearly expressed in

And that I shall accept, repute, and take the Kings Majesty, his Heirs and

Supreme Head,</hi> &amp;c. and tho' the old <hi>Oath</hi> of the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and
other Cities and Towns throughout <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> or other
chief Officers, where there are no <hi>Mayors,</hi> runs in the <hi>style</hi> of Swearing,
<hi>That they shall well and Loyally Serve the King in the Office of Mayor, in
the City of</hi> L. <hi>and the same City, shall keep surely and safely to the use of
our Lord the King of</hi> England, <hi>and of his Heirs, Kings of</hi> England,
might give occasion for that great, empty, and big-sounding <hi>Sophism</hi> of
Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> in his famous Speech, wherein he said, <hi>That we are Sworn
to the King, his Heirs and Lawful Successors, but not Obliged to any, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings Life, but to himself; for it were Treason if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;</hi>
yet let any Man lay his hand upon his Heart and bend his Ear
to the <hi>still</hi> voice of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> and will he not find that both those
<hi>Clauses</hi> in the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> do necessarily imply the
<hi>bearing</hi> such <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> first entirely to the King during his
Life, and after his Demise, bearing the same to his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi>
when they shall become Kings or Queens of this Realm? and that thus,
<hi>Quod necessarò, subintelligitur, non deest,</hi> and that the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi>
begins with the <hi>Declaring,</hi> that the <hi>Kings Highness</hi> IS <hi>the only Supreme
Governor of this Realm,</hi> &amp;c. and that of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> with <hi>declaring</hi> in
like manner, <hi>that the King</hi> IS <hi>Lawful and Rightful King of this Realm,</hi> and
that the <hi>bearing Faith and Allegiance</hi> to the King, doth imply the <hi>Ius in
re,</hi> as to our <hi>Fealty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King, <hi>Contra omnem hominem,</hi>
during the Kings Life; and doth at present imply (as I may) <hi>jus ad rem,</hi>
to his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> after his Demise.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly it was not the design of the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi>
to oblige us to <hi>impossible</hi> things; for that no <hi>Oath</hi> can do. And
under the notion of things <hi>Impossible,</hi> the Civil Law hath well ranged all
<hi>Actions which wound Piety Reputation and our Modesty, and which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
good manners,</hi> by that known place, <hi>Quae facta laedunt pietatem, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istimationem,
verecundiam nostram, &amp;, ut generaliter dixerimquae contra bonos
mores fiunt, nec facere nos posse Credendum est.</hi> The <hi>Canon</hi> Law likewise
hath well told us, that <hi>juramentum contra bonos mores non est obligatorium.</hi>
And the Law of Nature and all Divine and Humane Laws have taught
us, that nothing doth more wound Piety and Reputation, and Common
Modesty to the Heart, or is more against good Manners, than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
our <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Allegiance</hi> to our <hi>Prince;</hi> and it may
well be Judged <hi>impossible</hi> for a Prince to require from his Subjects their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103047:203"/>
Swearing to pay the entire <hi>Allegiance</hi> to another, at that time while it
was due <hi>only</hi> to himself.</p>
            <p>For as all <hi>Oaths</hi> are <hi>stricti juris</hi> in their Interpretation, so the word
<hi>Allegiance</hi> or <hi>Ligeance</hi> doth <hi>vi te mini</hi> imply the strictest obligation to
the Prince imaginable; and accordingly as the <hi>expression</hi> of <hi>alligare fidem
juramento,</hi> is found in <hi>Seneca.</hi> And this Obligation is partly of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of what the <hi>Feudists</hi> call <hi>Homagium ligium,</hi> distinguishing <hi>homage</hi>
into <hi>ligium</hi> and <hi>non ligium,</hi> and making <hi>ligium</hi> to be that which is <hi>done</hi> to
Soveraign Princes only, no <hi>fidelity</hi> to <hi>any one else reserved:</hi> and only
to be <hi>fealty</hi> Sworn <hi>contra omnem hominem, nullo excepto;</hi> whereupon
their rule is, that none can be <hi>homo ligius duorum,</hi> i. e. <hi>at the same time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And any one who shall cast his Eye on our <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Terms of the
Law,</hi> will there find the <hi>homagium ligium</hi> got in from among the old
<hi>Feudists;</hi> and the Author making the Figure of <hi>Homage</hi> to be more
Solemn than the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Fealty,</hi> in which <hi>Oath</hi> the <hi>Tenant</hi> saith to his
<hi>Lord, I shall be to you Faithful and Loyal; and shall bear to you Faith
for the Lands and Tenements which I claim to hold of you, and truly shall
do you the Customs and Services that I ought to do you at the Terms Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
So help me God.</hi> But in <hi>Homage</hi> there is <hi>Kneeling</hi> requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed; and
the <hi>Tenant</hi> saith on his <hi>Knees, I become your Man from this day forward,
of Life and Member, and of earthly honour, and to you shall be Faithful and
Loyal, and shall bear to you Faith for the Lands that I claim to hold of
you, saving the</hi> Faith <hi>that I owe to our Lord the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> likewise entertains us with somewhat of the <hi>Homagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ligium,</hi> and he very well and usefully in his <hi>Calvins Case</hi> explains
the nature of the Subjects <hi>ligeance</hi> and makes it to be a <hi>true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Obedience</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> due to his <hi>Soveraign;</hi> and there saith, <hi>that
Ligiance is expressed by several terms which are Synonimous in our Books,</hi>
and is sometimes called <hi>obedientia Regi,</hi> and that <hi>Ligiance</hi> is sometimes
called <hi>Faith, fides, ad fidem Regis;</hi> and there mentioning the <hi>Homage</hi>
out of <hi>Litleton, Salve le foy quod Ieo doy a nostre sur le Roy,</hi> quotes <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
l. 9. c. 1. for the <hi>Salvo</hi> required in <hi>Homage,</hi> viz. <hi>Salvâ fide debitâ
Domine Regi &amp; Haeredibus suis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may therefore be here said, that our <hi>Ancestors</hi> in the contexture of
the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> intended no <hi>Idle</hi> words, but did
with exact care weigh every expression and word of them <hi>in aurificis
Staterâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to that <hi>trite</hi> wise <hi>saying, hominum malitiis obviandum est,</hi>
they prepared to encounter with the Clamour of some <hi>Romane Catholicks,</hi>
who might possibly think to run down the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> with the
cry of <hi>The New Oath;</hi> and as they afterwards tryed to do, suitably to their
<hi>old term</hi> of the <hi>New Evangel:</hi> And therefore when they framed the
words in the <hi>clause</hi> of these <hi>Oaths,</hi> which runs, much as I have shewn in
the <hi>old stile</hi> of the former <hi>Oaths</hi> used long before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> they
did <hi>stare super vias antiquas,</hi> as I may say; and in these <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>

and Supremacy, the Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> do not come in without <hi>deep</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
and not as Ceremonious attendants on the Kings Person (as I may

shall shew more by and by out of the words of the <hi>Oaths.</hi> The <hi>Lawgivers</hi>
ventured no <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>answering</hi> at <hi>the day of Iudgement</hi> for any <hi>idle</hi>
words, and much less for <hi>Captious</hi> ones in the <hi>Oaths:</hi> And 'tis a <hi>delirium</hi>
to think that they should make it Treason in some Cases, to refuse one
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:103047:204"/>
of those <hi>Oaths,</hi> and make it too Treason to practice it; and that the Oath
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> obliging men to <hi>endeavor to disclose to his Majesty, his
HEIRS</hi> and <hi>SVCCESSORS, all TREASONS which they shall know or
hear of, to be against him or EITHER of them,</hi> the Obligation to the
Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> in the words immediately foregoing, could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
any thing of <hi>Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know that as to any thing written, <hi>interpretatio facienda est ex

ex eo quod expressum est;</hi> and that if any one shall deliberately mind the
Contexture of those <hi>Oaths,</hi> and what is therein so liquidly expressed and
asserted, that those Oaths which were intended as all others to <hi>put an
end to all Strife,</hi> do make none between our <hi>Kings,</hi> their <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all men of sense and thought cannot but grant, that in the <hi>Clauses</hi>
as relating to the Kings HEIRS and SUCCESSORS, we are to judge
according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of Interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>verba non debent esse oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osa,

here is an ACT of the Swearer, done in relation to such HEIRS and

due according to the Legal Course of Descent.</p>
            <p>And if any one be frightned with Sir <hi>W. I</hi>'s. <hi>Day-Dream</hi> of <hi>Treason,
viz.</hi> in being immediately upon the taking of the <hi>Oaths</hi> under some Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

and he will there find as good <hi>Bail</hi> provided for him in the <hi>Case</hi>
as <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> can give: for in the <hi>Preamble</hi> of an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
the <hi>King</hi> and three <hi>Estates</hi> tell him of <hi>the Duty that every true and
well affected Subject, not only by BOND of Allegiance, but also by the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANDMENT
of Almighty God, OVGHT to perform to his Majesty,
his</hi> HEIRS <hi>and</hi> SUCCESSORS, 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In fine,</hi> I shall hereupon <hi>affirm,</hi> that should any <hi>English</hi> Subject, who
hath taken these <hi>Oaths</hi> live to the age of <hi>Nestor,</hi> and in the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee several of our Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> in the due and Legal
course of Descent, Succeeding one another; and should such Subject be
never call'd on to <hi>reiterate</hi> those <hi>Oaths</hi> in the Reign of any of them, he
would yet by these Oaths before once taken, continue obliged to bear
<hi>true Faith and Allegiance</hi> to them all Successively.</p>
            <p>And thus in the first <hi>faederal Oath</hi> we read of, the <hi>Father of the faithful,</hi>
obliged himself <hi>at once</hi> in relation to <hi>Abimelech and his SON,</hi> and his
SONS SON: and we know how afterward <hi>God</hi> was pleased to oblige
himself at <hi>once</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his SEED; and how after that <hi>God</hi>
was pleased to oblige himself by his <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> made to <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:103047:204"/>
and his SEED, as to their <hi>Succession</hi> in the <hi>Royal</hi> Throne of <hi>Iuda:</hi> And
'twas to this the <hi>words</hi> in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> ONCE <hi>have I Sworn,</hi> &amp;c.
refer.</p>
            <p>And therefore this <hi>Scriptural</hi> Representation of <hi>God, after the manner
of Men,</hi> condescending in the Government of the world, to bind himself
<hi>ex gratiâ,</hi> as aforesaid, may well inculcate to us the reasonableness of our
becoming <hi>ipso facto</hi> bound by our <hi>Oaths</hi> to pay the <hi>debitum Iustitiae</hi> to
his <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> and their HEIRS and SUCCESSORS.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore, I shall lay down this as a 6<hi>th Conclusion,</hi> and
genuinely deducible from the former one, <hi>viz.</hi> That by Virtue of those
two <hi>Clauses,</hi> the <hi>takers</hi> of those <hi>Oaths</hi> do particularly <hi>bind</hi> themselves not
only against the Aiding and Assisting or Abetting any <hi>Rebellion</hi> or any
<hi>Vsurpation</hi> of the rights of his Majesty's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> that can
happen; but to the aiding and assisting of the Crown, and preserving its
Inheritable Rights on all Emergent occasions.</p>
            <p>Sanderson <hi>in his</hi> 4th Lecture <hi>of the</hi> Obligation <hi>of</hi> Oaths, <hi>puts the</hi> Case
<hi>concerning the Person to whom an Oath was made,</hi> viz. Whether he who
hath Sworn the performance of a thing to another, the Party to whom he
Sware being deceased, be bound to make it good to the <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi>
of the said Party? <hi>And his words are:</hi> I answer, ordinarily he is. It is
certain that the Party Swearing is obliged if he express'd that he would
perform the Oath unto the Heirs of the other. It may also be taken for
granted, that he is bound tho he expressed it not, if the Oath taken relates
to <hi>DIGNITY,</hi> because <hi>DIGNITY</hi> varies not with the change of Persons.
Whence if any Subject or Souldier Swear Fidelity to his King or General,
the Oath is to be meant to be made unto them also who succeed to that
Dignity.</p>

               </gap>mentioned <hi>Clauses</hi> in the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi>

            <p>He had before charged those with apparent <hi>Perjury,</hi> who had <hi>taken</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The other Person of the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Communion I shall refer to for
this, is the</hi> Author <hi>of a learned</hi> Tract <hi>in</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> printed <hi>in the</hi> year 1650 <hi>called,</hi>
An EXERCITATION concerning VSVRP'D POWERS,
<hi>wherein the</hi> Author <hi>very substantially proves that by virtue of the</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<hi>to the</hi> King's <hi>HEIRS and SUCCESSORS resulting
from the</hi> Oaths <hi>of</hi> Allegiance <hi>and</hi> Supremacy, it is not lawful to give up
ones self to the ALLEGIANCE of an VSVRP'D Power: <hi>and
saith very well in</hi> p. 16. If I should do that, I should yield assistance to
the Vsurper in his wrong Doing and Vsurpation, and so become a partaker
of his Sin. Obedience to one as the Supreme Magistrate is a Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
thing, and includes many duties toward him, as a Power, <hi>viz.</hi> of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Commission from him for Offices, or Acts otherwise not competible to me:
maintaining and defending him in his Power by Pay, Counsel, and Intelligence,
Arms and Prayers: all which I am bound to yield the Usurper to my power,
if I resign my Allegiance up to him: and how shall I do these things, and not.
1. Support and have Communion with him in his wickedness. 2. Combine
against betray and resist the right of the injured, dethroned Magistrate.
3. And make my self uncapable of Obedience or being a Subject to the lawful
Power hereafter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Author <hi>doth in</hi> p. 19 <hi>and many other places in this</hi> Book, <hi>assert
the forementioned</hi> Clauses <hi>in the</hi> Oaths <hi>of</hi> Allegiance <hi>and</hi> Supremacy <hi>as
binding</hi> clearly, plainly, <hi>and</hi> in terminis <hi>to an</hi> Allegiance over-living his
Majesties Person and pitched upon his <hi>HEIRS</hi> and <hi>SUCCESSORS,</hi>
so that the Swearer is not free from the Oaths at his Majesties decease, <hi>&amp;c.
and</hi> that those Oaths intend by his Majesty's <hi>HEIRS</hi> and <hi>SUCCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SORS</hi>
the same Persons joyning them together with the <hi>Copulative
(AND</hi>) and not using the <hi>Discretive (OR</hi>) and the former <hi>Oath</hi> twice
comprising both in the following <hi>Clauses,</hi> under the said Term or Pronown
(<hi>viz. THEM, THEIRS</hi>) so that according to these Oaths his
<hi>HEIRS</hi> are of right his <hi>SUCCESSORS,</hi> and none can be <hi>HIS
SUCCESSOR,</hi> but <hi>HIS HEIR,</hi> while he hath an <hi>HEIR:</hi>
and that if any Conspiracy or <hi>ATTEMPT</hi> be made to prevent his
<hi>HEIR</hi> from being and continuing his SVCCESSOR, or to make any
one HIS SVCCESSOR that is not HIS HEIR (if he hath one)
the subject is sworn by this Oath to continue his Allegiance to HIS
HEIR as the right SVCCESSOR, and to DEFEND HIM
in that HIS right to the uttermost: and that the Term LAWFUL
annext to SVCCESSORS in the Oath of Supremacy, manifestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all CAVIL of a distinction between HEIRS and SVC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSORS:
the word LAWFVL whether you interpret it of
LEGITIMATION of BIRTH, or PROXIMITY of
SVCCESSION in regard of LINE according to the Law of the
Land entailing the Crown on his Majesty's Issue, or rather both the latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the former, restraining SVCCESSORS from meaning any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than HIS HEIRS: and that both these Oaths bind the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to assist and defend to his uttermost Power against all Attempts the Course
of SVCCESSION in the Race of his Majesty, expressed by many-Terms,
to wit, THEIR Crown and Dignity, all Iurisdictions, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103047:205"/>
Preheminences and Authorities granted to the King's Highness,
HIS HEIRS and SVCCESSOR and united to the Imperial
CROWN of this Realm. How then can he yield Obedience to them that
are not HIS HEIRS, nor LAWFUL SVCCESSORS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
how can he not oppose and withstand them in the assistance and defence of the
right of his Majesty's HEIRS and LAWFVL SVCCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SORS?</p>
            <p>That judicious <hi>Author</hi> did like a substantial <hi>Confessor</hi> of the <hi>Obligatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of those <hi>Oaths</hi> relating to the King's HEIRS and SUCCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SORS
during that <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> very satisfactorily shew, that the
SAME Persons were meant by <hi>both,</hi> and held himself obliged in Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
the rather so to do, because in that <hi>Conjuncture</hi> the <hi>plain</hi> Sence of
the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> were <hi>usurp'd</hi> upon, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by the <hi>Book</hi> called, THE LAWFULNESS OF OBEY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, then published;
and the <hi>Fallacies</hi> in which he Learnedly Confuted, and shewed how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously
that <hi>Book</hi> outraged the sense of the Law-givers in those <hi>Oaths,</hi>
whose <hi>end</hi> was to support the <hi>Crown</hi> in a just <hi>Lineal</hi> Succession, and could
therefore intend by <hi>Successors,</hi> only such as were <hi>de jure</hi> so: and that
therefore that <hi>Book's</hi> taking <hi>Successors</hi> for such who were so <hi>de facto</hi> (tho
very <hi>unjustly</hi>) was; 1. <hi>Inconsistent with the nature of an Oath, which
must be taken in Righteousness.</hi> Jer. 4. 2. <hi>That is to oblige only to that
which is just. 2. With the word</hi> HEIRS, <hi>which being placed first in the
Oath must first be served. 3. With the Oath of Supremacy which binds us
to the lawful Successor. 4. With the Law of the Land which appointeth
Succession to the Heir. 5. With a possibility of keeping the Oath: for if</hi>
Heirs <hi>and</hi> Successors <hi>mean divers Persons, how can the Oath of Allegiance</hi>
and defence of the Regal Dignity be observed?</p>
            <p>Thus it seems as the <hi>Fantome</hi> of <hi>haeres viventis</hi> hath frighted many
out of their Natural Senses, and the Natural <hi>sense</hi> of their <hi>Oaths</hi> in the
present <hi>Conjuncture,</hi> the word SUCCESSORS did formerly: and
when they who interpreted it of <hi>actual</hi> Succeders (as saith my <hi>Author</hi>)
that it might favour the USURPERS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>forgot what was the Object of
that Succession,</hi> viz. a CROWN and <hi>Regal Dignity, wherein by virtue
of that Oath those</hi> Successors <hi>are to be defended, whereas those or the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans
<hi>for whom the Book pleads, have not only put by the rightful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
but abolished the</hi> CROWN <hi>and Regal Dignity it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May this instance of Heavens <hi>uncrowning</hi> the understandings of those
<hi>Republicans</hi> of common reason and sense (and when in the Course of their
<hi>injudicious</hi> minds they were abandoned to the most despicable sort of
Counterfeit <hi>Witt</hi> called <hi>Quibbling,</hi> and to the vilest sort of <hi>Quibbling</hi> and
<hi>double entendre</hi> of <hi>words,</hi> I mean in that which concerns the tremendous
Obligation of an <hi>Oath,</hi> after they had <hi>Dethroned</hi> their <hi>Prince,</hi> and excluded
his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi>) serve in all Future times as a <hi>Monument</hi> of the
<hi>Divine</hi> Dereliction, and of Heavens <hi>scattering the Proud</hi> in their <hi>reasons</hi>
and <hi>imaginations of their hearts,</hi> and rendring them unfortunate beyond
the fate of the common <hi>saying</hi> of <hi>Eventus stultorum magister,</hi> I mean by
condemning them to a <hi>stated infatuation:</hi> and let none hereafter value
any <hi>Vsurpation</hi> on the Credit of the <hi>last,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> in his famous
<hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>Vsurpers</hi> did, and set <hi>Gods</hi> Seal to it on the account of

            <p>Any one who will cast an Eye on the <hi>Title de verborum significatione</hi> in

            <p>And the <hi>identity</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> in the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> doth

that the word <hi>&amp;</hi> sometimes <hi>stat declarative inter duo idem impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should account it somewhat like <hi>Pedantry</hi> to cite any <hi>Latine</hi> Authors
about <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> signifying as here in our <hi>Case</hi> the same thing,
but that other Seditious <hi>Books</hi> beside that impugned by the <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
have endeavoured to sow <hi>Contention</hi> between the words <hi>Heirs</hi> and

whereby he would have set the <hi>Assertory</hi> and the <hi>Promissory</hi> Clauses in the
Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> at <hi>variance,</hi> nay the <hi>Promissory</hi> Clause
at <hi>variance</hi> with it self.</p>
            <p>There was a Book writ by a late <hi>Lawyer</hi> called, <hi>Historical Discourses
of the Vniformity of the Government of</hi> England, first printed in the
<hi>Year</hi> 1647, and reprinted by some Factious <hi>Anti-Papists</hi> since the <hi>Epoche</hi>
of our <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and with that <hi>former</hi> year in the
<hi>Title</hi> (which was an ill <hi>ominous</hi> sign of the fatal time such Persons would
have driven us back upon if they could) where in <hi>p.</hi> 279 of the 2d <hi>part</hi>
ill reflections are made on the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which
Oaths (saith the Author) <hi>do make much Parly concerning Inheritance
and Heirs: but that they do not hold forth any such Obligation to Heirs
otherwise than as supposing them to be Successors, and in that Relation only.</hi>
His design is too plainly express'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to strike at the Rights of our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Monarchy, and to invite Parliaments to interlope in controuling
the <hi>Succession</hi> of the <hi>Crown:</hi> and he saith, That <hi>the Doctrine he there insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
doth not go down well with those that do pretend to Prerogative, aided by
the</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Recognition <hi>made to King</hi> James, <hi>and the Oaths of Supremacy and
Allegiance:</hi> and I shall say that I hope it never will: and 'tis pity but a
<hi>Book</hi> that in so many places of it impeacheth the old known <hi>Rights</hi> of the
<hi>Crown,</hi> should in this <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> find some Person at leisure <hi>ex
professo</hi> to make <hi>Animadversions</hi> on it, and the rather for that the <hi>Author</hi>
doth in the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of somewhat like <hi>Witt</hi> (and his affectation of which is
by People of <hi>middling</hi> Capacities, who generally make the greater part
of Mankind, judged to be <hi>Witt</hi>) dispense his Poysons.</p>
            <p>Yet as to the signification of HEIRS and SUCCESSORS, he
had before in his <hi>first part</hi> saved any one the labour of shewing their
<hi>Identity:</hi> for there in <hi>p.</hi> 109 and in his <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>the Laws of Property
of Lands and Goods under the</hi> Saxons, he quoted <hi>Tacitus</hi> about some of the
Customs of the <hi>Germans</hi> which he judged remain'd here with them, and
which shewed that HEIRS and SUCCESSORS passed then as
current <hi>Coyn</hi> for the <hi>same</hi> thing, according to the words of <hi>Tacitus, HAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REDES
&amp; SVCCESSORES cuique liberi &amp; nullum est testamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
and thus Englished by that Author, viz. <hi>the HEIRS and SVCCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SORS
to every one are his Children, and there is no Testamentary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to DISHERIT or ALTER the COVRSE of DESCENT
which by CVSTOM or Law is setled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:103047:206"/>
And as was shewed, the <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>LAWFVL</hi> annexed to SUCCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SORS,
hath nailed the Canon of that Sophism, and exposed the <hi>ridiculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of any <hi>Cavilling</hi> or <hi>Calumnious</hi> Interpretation about <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors:</hi>
tho yet without the interposal of the word <hi>LAWFVL,</hi> the
plain sense of the words Heirs and Successors in the <hi>Oaths</hi> would clearly
enough have obliged us to the <hi>same</hi> Persons. We say, that <hi>id possumus
quod jure possumus,</hi> and none are to be construed <hi>Heirs</hi> or <hi>Successors,</hi> but
such who are so in the Eye of the <hi>Law,</hi> and with reference to <hi>Proximity</hi>
of Blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> they who are meant for such by the Law in the Due
Course of their Descent.</p>
            <p>But I hope that <hi>England</hi>'s happy Future <hi>State</hi> will so far influence
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> as to incline all Conscientious <hi>Protestants</hi> to leave of all senseless
<hi>Cavilling</hi> about the sense of the plain words in those <hi>Oaths,</hi> and to agree
to employ their most serious and constant thoughts about the extent of
the Moral Offices that relate to their <hi>bearing True Faith and Allegiance to
the King, his Heirs and Successors,</hi> and other very <hi>important</hi> matters in
the <hi>Promissory</hi> Clauses most clearly expressed in order to the discharge
of their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and the duties of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> viz. <hi>DEFENDING
him and them to the uttermost of our Power against all Conspiracies that
shall be made against his or their Persons, their Crown and Dignity,</hi> as the
<hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> runs, and to our <hi>ASSISTING</hi> and <hi>DEFEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DING
to our Power all Iurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
granted or belonging to the King's Highness, his Heirs and Successors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are no <hi>unweigh'd</hi> and <hi>idle</hi> words in the <hi>Promissory</hi> Clauses,
and we are to make it our business with the <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>discretion</hi>
to consider the <hi>sense</hi> of the same, and to retain it in our Memories: and
mens not doing which, hath been the Cause of the <hi>Ebb</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> in some
<hi>Conjunctures.</hi> According to the Degrees of mens intellectual Talents,
and particularly the Talent of understanding beyond other men the
<hi>Laws natural</hi> and <hi>positive,</hi> and the <hi>Lex terrae,</hi> some are beyond others
morally bound to <hi>defend</hi> the particular momentous points relating to
<hi>all Iurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences granted or belonging to the King
and his Heirs and Successors:</hi> and therefore a disloyal <hi>Divine</hi> and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
<hi>Lawyer,</hi> are things that do particularly <hi>hear</hi> very <hi>ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as there is a great part of the <hi>Moral</hi> Offices expressed in these
Oaths sufficiently plain and obvious to vulgar Capacities, and which
with their Native Light do strike common understandings, so the <hi>extent</hi>
of these <hi>Offices</hi> ought to employ the Meditations of all the Takers of these
<hi>Oaths;</hi> and how low soever their <hi>Talents</hi> lie, they are to use all the <hi>means</hi>
they can, and particularly that of the <hi>Consilium peritorum,</hi> as any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
shall offer it self, for their <hi>defence</hi> of any of the <hi>Privileges</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminences
belonging</hi> to the Crown. Our duty in this kind is very well
expressed by <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his third <hi>Lecture,</hi> where speaking of the Subjects
Obligations by Oaths of this Nature, he saith, <hi>Doubtless the Subject to his
Power is obliged to defend all Rights which appear either by Law or Custom
Legitimate, whether defined by the written Law, or in force through the long
use of time or Prescription, that is, so far as they are known, or may Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
be known. But he is not equally obliged to the Observation of all those
which are controverted.</hi> Thus therefore as to any <hi>Iurisdiction, Privilege</hi> or
<hi>Preheminence</hi> of the Crown that might seem <hi>doubtful,</hi> the <hi>swearer</hi> is many
times bound to the use of means that it may be <hi>Morally</hi> known to him, as
<hi>Sanderson</hi>'s words are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:103047:207"/>
Yet what I have urged in this <hi>sixth Conclusion</hi> as <hi>Obligatory</hi> to us by
virtue of the <hi>Oaths,</hi> is sufficiently plain, and there is no occasion for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
a great <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>penetrating</hi> Understanding and <hi>Witt</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that it is one of the <hi>Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> to be <hi>Hereditary,</hi> and
that the Taker of the Oaths is indissolubly bound to defend that
Right.</p>
            <p>There are several explicatory Notions of the word DEFEND and
its <hi>extent,</hi> that often occur in the Authors that treat expressly of the <hi>Ius
Protectitium seu defensorium,</hi> among whom I account <hi>Magerus de Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ
armatâ</hi> or of the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Protection</hi> given by Sovereign Powers, to
be <hi>instar omnium,</hi> and who in the 12th <hi>Chapter</hi> there Critically descanting
on the nature of the <hi>Defence</hi> granted by <hi>Protectors,</hi> saith, That <hi>verbum
protegere necessitatem defendendi cum armis importat,</hi> and that <hi>protector, si
in defensionis promissione jaramentum appositum fuerit, etiam non requisitus,
clientibus succurrere tenetur:</hi> and that <hi>defendere non videtur, qui in totum
non defendit:</hi> and that <hi>éffectum defensionis non dicitur consummatè implere
qui non omni tempore, auxilio suo ac defensione praestò est.</hi> He there likewise
tells us, that <hi>subditi tenentur defendere honorem Regis:</hi> and that DEFENCE
is too performed by <hi>Words</hi> as well as <hi>Deeds:</hi> and mentions how <hi>in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenni
fidelitatis juramento vasallus se ad id obstringit quod vitam &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
famamque Domini non solum non violare, sed &amp; contra aliorum conatus
pro viribus defendere ac propugnare velit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But none need look <hi>abroad</hi> for the genuine importance of the word
DEFEND: for any man of common sense who hath taken the <hi>Oaths</hi>
knoweth by the <hi>Recollection</hi> of his ordinary thoughts what it is to DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FEND
<hi>himself,</hi> and how natural it is for the <hi>hand</hi> to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t up and expose
it self to <hi>defend</hi> the <hi>head</hi> from danger, and knoweth by the Call of the
Magistracy when and where and how by Arms to defend his Prince; and
natural <hi>Logick</hi> tells him that he who in these <hi>Oaths</hi> hath bound himself to
ASSIST, hath certainly bound himself not to RESIST, and that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendere
qui tenetur offendere non debet:</hi> and that therefore whoever hath
taken the <hi>Oaths,</hi> and alloweth the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Resistance,</hi> is a real <hi>Heretick,</hi>
and <hi>Self-Condemned:</hi> and that according as it is neither deniable nor deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those who talk of <hi>haeres viventis,</hi> the Taker of these <hi>Oaths</hi> hath
<hi>bonâ fide</hi> and in the good <hi>faith of a Christian</hi> promised the same vigorous
<hi>defence</hi> of the Rights of those <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> in the first moment of
the <hi>descent</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> to them, that is to say, immediately on the King's
Decease, that he is to perform as to the Rights of the present King, and
that here being a <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Defence</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Heirs, Promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
duobus vel pluribus, dicitur promittere separatim &amp; cuilibet pro vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rili:</hi>
and that the Rights of the <hi>Prince</hi> Regnant are not in the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
by this <hi>Promise,</hi> for that <hi>obligatus duobus in solidum, est obligatus
secundo, salvo jure primi,</hi> and that <hi>verba sunt intelligenda habito respectu
rei &amp; personae ad quam referentur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the word <hi>BELONGING</hi> i. e. <hi>All Iurisdictions, Privileges,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Granted or BELONGING to the King's Highness, his Heirs and
Successors,</hi> as it sufficiently ensures our Obligations of <hi>defending</hi> the same to
our <hi>Kings</hi> in Case of Usurpation made against them, how prosperous so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may be, so it ensures our Obligation of the <hi>defence</hi> to his <hi>Heirs</hi> in
the due Course of the Descent: and holds our hands from paying Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to any <hi>Vsurper.</hi> The Law of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Land</hi> sufficiently shew to
whom those <hi>Iurisdictions,</hi> &amp;c. BELONG, that we have sworn to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend:</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:103047:207"/>
and the Civil Law doth here appositely tell us, that <hi>Possessio etiam
animo retinetur,</hi> and doth account the very <hi>fraud</hi> that may exclude a
right Heir to be <hi>Tantamount</hi> to a <hi>Possession: Quia pro possessione dolus est.</hi>
And according to that Law, <hi>Qui actionem habet ad rem, ipsam rem habere
videtur:</hi> and <hi>habere quilibet dicitur quod jure petere potest, sive de quo
actionem habet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the whole matter, if the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi>
are Lawful Oaths (as all except <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks grant) it must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be granted, that the Takers of them are indissolubly bound <hi>to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
of their Power,</hi> against all <hi>Vsurpers</hi> and <hi>Vsurpations</hi> to <hi>defend all
Iurisdictions,</hi> &amp;c. BELONGING to the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>
as aforesaid: and the very same Arguments that were prevalent with
the Takers of those <hi>Oaths</hi> formerly not to <hi>take</hi> the <hi>Engagement,</hi> nor to
pay <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the then <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> do <hi>militate,</hi> and are very <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
and <hi>concludent</hi> for others who have took those Oaths not to pay it to
any but to the <hi>King,</hi> and to his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> in the Due and Legal
Course of Descent, and for the <hi>defence</hi> of all <hi>Iurisdictions,</hi> &amp;c. respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>belonging</hi> to them: for according to the words in the forecited <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
The manifest drift of the Oath of Allegiance being the continuance
and assurance of the Crown (upon concession of his then Majesty's just Title)
to his Heirs in Succession after</hi> Him <hi>and ONE ANOTHER lineally,
and the defence of them therein against all OTHER Corrivals and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi>
it is plain that the defeating the <hi>Succession</hi> in its Due and Legal Course
of Descent in any one Case, will be an <hi>Vsurpation</hi> not only of the Right
of the Lawful <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Successor</hi> according to the Proximity of Blood,
but of the Right of the Hereditary <hi>Monarchy</hi> it self sworn to be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as aforesaid. It is therefore no marvel that some of the Learned and
Loyal <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Succession</hi> have judged that any such defeating of the
Succession as aforesaid would be Criminal in the same <hi>kind</hi> as the late <hi>Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi>
was.</p>
            <p>It may be well supposed that many mens so seldom and so superficially
thinking of those Oaths occasioned their Miscarriages during the former
<hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Vsurpation.</hi> Unthinking men generally take those <hi>Oaths</hi> as
<hi>Pills</hi> only to be <hi>swallowed</hi> down, and <hi>pro formà</hi> only, and when <hi>gilded</hi> over
with an <hi>Office</hi> of Gain. But to a loyal and rectified mind the frequent
sense of the <hi>Moral</hi> Offices resulting from those <hi>Oaths</hi> is as pleasant as any
thing can be to the Taste: and according to that saying in <hi>Iob, For the
Ear tryeth words, as the Mouth tasteth meat,</hi> a man loyal to the degree
required by those <hi>Oaths,</hi> will not only <hi>nauseate</hi> all <hi>Principles</hi> of Sedition as
rank Poyson, but will be able so critically to <hi>try the words</hi> in any <hi>Sayings</hi>
that sound popularly and that are used by <hi>Demagogues,</hi> as to find out
what in them is wholsome and what poysonous: and accordingly as
for example the excellent <hi>Sanderson</hi> did in the <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>salus populi, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema
lex,</hi> and did make the <hi>salus populi</hi> to include that of <hi>Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this purpose if any will by the <hi>Touch-stone</hi> of this my 6th <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
try that <hi>Maxim</hi> that among all <hi>Demagogues</hi> so much passeth for
<hi>currant</hi> Coyn, he will find it not to be <hi>Sterling,</hi> viz. <hi>That People were not
made for their Kings, but their Kings for them:</hi> and this <hi>saying</hi> is partly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by what <hi>Tully</hi> saith in his <hi>Offices,</hi> viz. <hi>Vt tutela, sic procuratio
Reip. ad utilitatem eorum qui commissi sunt, non ad eorum quibus commissa
est, gerenda est.</hi> But after any one hath seriously weigh'd this <hi>Maxim,</hi>
he will find that <hi>Kings</hi> and their People were made for, and are under na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Obligations to one another, and accordingly as it may be said that
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:103047:208"/>
               <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> were made for one another and to defend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and to this purpose the <hi>Psalmists</hi> words are, <hi>Lo Children are an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage
of the Lord, and the Fruit of the Womb is his Reward; as Arrows
are in the hand of a mighty man, so are Children of the Youth; happy is the
man that hath his Quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they
shall speak with the Enemies in the Gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in my further enquiry into the Obligation relating to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
<hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> that results from those <hi>Oaths,</hi> my 7th
<hi>Conclusion</hi> shall be, that the <hi>Takers</hi> of these <hi>Oaths</hi> are bound thereby
against attempting or endeavouring by any new <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to <hi>interrupt</hi> the Succession of the Crown in its Due and Legal Course
of Descent.</p>
            <p>I do account that the foregoing <hi>Conclusion</hi> hath <hi>cut the Grass under the
Feet</hi> of any who have taken those <hi>Oaths,</hi> and yet would have thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the <hi>Succession,</hi> and makes such <hi>interruption</hi> of its <hi>Course</hi> not only
<hi>unlawful,</hi> but to be a nugatory, ridiculous and unaccountable thing.</p>
            <p>For since by the known Rights of the Crown, the next Heir to the
Crown is in the next Minute after my King's decease actually King, and
I am necessarily and indispensably bound to pay actual <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi>
to him then, and have already <hi>sworn</hi> that I will then expose my lise
in his <hi>defence,</hi> and the <hi>defence</hi> of his Crown and <hi>Dignity,</hi> it is manifest
folly in me to attempt the <hi>interrupting</hi> the <hi>Succession</hi> by <hi>excluding</hi> the
Right <hi>Heir,</hi> whom I have thus indispensably bound my self to <hi>defend,</hi> and
to <hi>obey,</hi> and who perhaps by the Course of <hi>Mortality,</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> who are
<hi>nominal</hi> Gods coming to <hi>die like men,</hi> may within a few Minutes after
my having taken the <hi>Oaths,</hi> be entituled to my born and sworn <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Dolo facit qui petit id quod mox redditurus est.</hi> But, a sorry and
pitiful trick it is and as remote from the <hi>subtility</hi> of the <hi>Serpent</hi> as the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the <hi>Dove,</hi> that any Swearer would put on himself, who attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to injure any <hi>Prince</hi> by going to <hi>exclude</hi> him from the <hi>Allegiance</hi>
that he is to pay him perhaps the next Moment.</p>
            <p>We are well <hi>minded</hi> by <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his <hi>second</hi> Lecture, That <hi>simplicity
becomes an Oath,</hi> and that the Swearer is to <hi>endeavour to perform what he
hath promised, without fraud, deceit, double dealing or simulation:</hi> and he
elsewhere questioning whether the words <hi>by my faith</hi> are an <hi>Oath,</hi> saith,
That <hi>tho by the Custom of some Countries, or the intention of him who speaks,
they may be an Oath, yet necessarily by virtue of those</hi> words <hi>an</hi> Oath <hi>ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not, but only an asseveration, or an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>btestation:</hi> and he had before
mentioned how <hi>Soto</hi> did judge the words <hi>by my faith</hi> to be an <hi>Oath:</hi> but
the words <hi>in faith</hi> to be none.</p>
            <p>But others have judged that when on the word <hi>fides</hi> (the which is
<hi>justitiae fundamentum</hi>) the word CHRISTIAN is built as an Addition,
the compleat Fabrick of an <hi>Oath</hi> is thereby raised: and with the weight
of those great words before referred to, the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> concludes,
viz. <hi>And I do make this Recognition and Acknowledgment heartily, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and truly upon the true FAITH</hi> of a <hi>CHRISTIAN. So help me
God:</hi> which sheweth that those <hi>words</hi> did not casually nor indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
profound deliberation there come in.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>true faith</hi> or the <hi>bona fides</hi> of a <hi>Roman,</hi> did so much scorn to
put a <hi>trick</hi> upon a <hi>Law,</hi> doth not the true <hi>faith</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
to put one upon an Oath?</p>
            <p>I have in my <hi>second</hi> Conclusion asserted it <hi>in general,</hi> that the Taker of
all Promissory Oaths is bound to endeavour for the Future, as much as in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103047:208"/>
him lieth, by his Deeds to fullfil what he hath sworn in words; and here
applying the same <hi>particularly</hi> to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> I will
ask if it be <hi>congruous</hi> to <hi>bona fides,</hi> i. e. <hi>Common honesty,</hi> if I am bound by
Law to pay a Debt and have promised and sworn to pay it, for me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
by any new <hi>Law</hi> to evade its payment? I have heard of a <hi>Will</hi>
made <hi>void</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> but after the <hi>Executor</hi> had <hi>sworn</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it well and truely, and to pay the Debts and Legacies of the deceased
as far as the Estate extended, could he <hi>bonâ fide</hi> and with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
endeavour to <hi>quash</hi> it by the Legislative Power?</p>
            <p>Nihil ita fidei congruit humanae, quàm ea quae placuerant custodii. <hi>i. e. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so sutable to</hi> common honesty, <hi>as that those things that have been
once assented to should be observed, is a known saying in the</hi> Civil <hi>Law;
and so is that of</hi> Vlpian <hi>in the</hi> Digest, Bonae fidei non congruit de apicibus
juris disputare: <hi>and it being a Rule of</hi> Law <hi>there, that</hi> Cum quid unâ viâ
prohibetur alicui, ad illud aliâ viâ non debet admitti. <hi>i. e. that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done one way, or</hi> directly, <hi>must not be done</hi> indirectly <hi>or by</hi>
another: <hi>and it being construed, that whoever acted contrary to this, did</hi>
fraudem facere legi, <hi>do I to the</hi> uttermost of my Power, <hi>and on the</hi> true faith
<hi>of a Christian,</hi> defend his Majesty, his HEIRS and SVCCESSORS against
all Attempts which shall be made against his or their Persons, their Crown
and Dignity, and assist and defend all Iurisdictions, Privileges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the King's Highness his HEIRS and SVCCESSORS, <hi>if afterward
to the uttermost of my Power I endeavour to</hi> dis-inherit <hi>the</hi> lawful <hi>Heir,
and to</hi> exclude <hi>him from the benefit of his inherent</hi> Birth-right <hi>by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
means? Is not the attempt or endeavour to effect this, to be
accounted</hi> fraud, <hi>according to that</hi> Rule <hi>of Law, viz.</hi> Fraudis interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
semper in jure Civili, non ex eventu duntaxat, sed ex consilio quoque desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratur:
<hi>and which follows after the</hi> Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> Generaliter cum de fraude
disputatur, non quid habeat Actor, sed quid per adversarium habere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerit,
considerandum est?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis a true old saying, that</hi> fallacia pactorum dolum semper habet adjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum:

<hi>whom I have promised in express words to</hi> defend?</p>
            <p>When the Morality of <hi>Cicero</hi> extended to the inclucating it in one of

hath ennobled the Moral <hi>Offices</hi> of Christians by enjoyning in his <hi>Epistle</hi>
to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the practice of <hi>whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:103047:209"/>
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report,</hi> &amp;c. it
may well be expected that <hi>the true faith of a Christian</hi> should prevail on
Christians not to attempt the compassing of any thing by a new Law
contrary to what they have by their <hi>Oaths</hi> promised to <hi>defend,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

            <p>And having thus far proceeded, my 8th <hi>Conclusion</hi> shall be, that our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
thus relating both to the King and his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> doth
clearly arise from those <hi>Oaths,</hi> without any <hi>Condition</hi> on his or their part
to be performed, and particularly without any respect had to what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
they shall profess. We know that <hi>Iuramentum limitatè praestitum,
limitatum producit consensum &amp; effectum:</hi> but 'tis likewise as notorious that
there is nothing of <hi>limitation,</hi> no IFS or ANDS in these <hi>Oaths:</hi>
and therefore that known <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Non est distinguendum, ubi lex non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguit</hi>
must here take place in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sanderson <hi>in his 4th</hi> Lecture <hi>saith,</hi> If two oblige themselves mutually in
promises of different kinds, or not at the same time, or otherwise without
mutual respect, Faith violated by the one, absolveth not the others Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but each is bound to stand to his Oath, tho the other hath not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his part. For example, A King simply and without respect to the Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Subjects, sweareth to administer his Government Righteously and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law. The Subjects at another time simply and without respect to
the Duty of the Prince, swear Allegiance and due Obedience to him. They
are both bound faithfully to perform their several Duties: nor would the
King be absolved from his Oath, if Subjects should not perform their due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
nor Subjects from theirs, tho the King should turn from the Path of
Iustice.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ny</hi> doth therefore in a printed <hi>Treatise</hi> of his very well for this
purpose cite Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> and saith, That <hi>Bishop</hi> Bilson, <hi>a great Searcher
into the Doctrine of the Supremacy of Kings, giveth this as the sense of the
Oath,</hi> viz. the Oath (as saith the Bishop) <hi>expresseth not Kings duty to
God, but ours to them: as they must be obeyed when they joyn with truth, so
must they be endured when they fall into Error. Which side soever
they take, either Obedience to their Wills, or Submission to their Swords is
their due by God's Law.</hi> And tho some ill <hi>Anti-Papists</hi> have ridiculed
Passive <hi>Obedience,</hi> after they had given the <hi>Cautio juratoria</hi> against their
owning the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Resistance,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ny,</hi> doth very particularly, in
<hi>p.</hi> 138 of that <hi>Book,</hi> inveigh against that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and saith, <hi>Nor if they
were able</hi> (i. e. to resist) <hi>is it lawful for a Church to compel by the Sword;
more than the Magistrate may by the Keys, or what is peculiar to the Sacred
Function.</hi> Uzza <hi>erred in the latter; and</hi> Peter <hi>in the former. The Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Rule and Practice was this; Being persecuted in one City to fly into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and pray that their flight may not be in the Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have read a <hi>Manuscript</hi> Book of Mr. <hi>Ny</hi> called, <hi>A Discourse of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Laws and Supremacy of the Kings of</hi> England <hi>in dispensing with the
Penalties thereof,</hi> where he asserts throughout the Legality of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
<hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> and the Book was writ professedly for
that purpose, and he there doth very rationally inculcate the <hi>unlawfulness</hi>
of <hi>Exclusion,</hi> as in his other Book he did the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of <hi>Resistance,</hi> and
saith, <hi>That Civil Rights and Claims, and Temporal Things, are the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and intrinsic Concern and Interest of all States.</hi> Dominium non funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
in gratiâ. <hi>The just Claim of a Prince may not be interrupted upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he is of this or that Religion or Perswasion. Nor may a Subject be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
banished, imprisoned, confiscated, or ruined on the mere account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:103047:209"/>
or because his Conscience is not cast into the same Mould with the
Prince, or present Establishment. It is POPERY to deny</hi> Allegiance <hi>to a</hi>
Prince, <hi>or Protection to a Subject upon the account of any such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore no wonder that our Ancestors framing the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
would have no Principle of <hi>Popery</hi> therein favoured by a <hi>side</hi>
Wind; which according to Mr. <hi>Ny</hi>'s Sense must have happen'd, had
there been any <hi>distinguishing</hi> reserves, or limitations or restrictions in
the <hi>Oath,</hi> respecting the <hi>Religion</hi> of our Princes.</p>
            <p>And because many men have been in this Conjuncture of time tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to strain their <hi>Oaths</hi> and their <hi>Consciences,</hi> by excessive Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
relating to Religion, (and as if God could not Govern the World
but by Princes and their Subjects being of the same Religion) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Mr. <hi>Ny</hi>'s judgment is of great Authority among many of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> I shall here insert somewhat more out of that
<hi>Manuscript</hi> of his, that falls under this Consideration, and which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
writ with great Weight and Authority of reason, and worthy the
Writers great Abilities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He having there put a Question relating to</hi> Religion <hi>and the</hi> Worship
<hi>of God being the great</hi> Concern <hi>of a</hi> Nation, <hi>and to the trust of</hi> dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>with the</hi> Penalties of Ecclesiastical <hi>Laws, saith,</hi> In answer to it, I
endeavour to unfold, 1. In what sense Religion is the Concern of the
State. 2. The nature of this Trust: <hi>and as to the first he saith,</hi> The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and weight of a matter in our deliberation hath its proportion as either
under an absolute, or resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctive Consideration. <hi>Wisdom is better than Riches</hi>
in it self <hi>absolutely:</hi> but not in <hi>respect</hi> to the support of this present life.
The knowledge of God and Divine Things is better than to know the Virtue
of Drugs and Plants; but not in respect to the Study of Physick; so Religion
and the Worship of God is the chiefest and <hi>better part</hi> in it self considered:
but in its respective Considerations as to the Family of a particular Person
or Community of men for the advancement of Civil Affairs, there are OTHER
qualifications and inducements of greater Consequence, and more directly
and immediately tending to the being or well-being thereof. That there be
no mistake in this great Concernment, I further distinguish: There comes
under the Notion of Religion, the Holyness and Righteousness that is
of the Moral Law, Principles whereof are in all mens natures, and
attended in their actings by a natural Conscience. 3. Gospel Duties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and ordered by a supernatural Light, no Principles or Footsteps
whereof are found in us. For the former, Religion in the first sense,
as the knowledge of God, Conscience of an Oath, Iustice, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in our dealings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are such things wherein the well-being of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Commonwealths is much concern'd. But Religion as it stands in
exerting supernatural Principles, and in Duties termed the Commands of
Christ (as the other the Commandments of God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.) Such as Faith,
Repentance, Sacraments, Discipline, and the like Gospel Ordinances; in
the Duties under this Head considered and as distinct from Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
there is little or nothing directly and immediately contributed by them
to Mens civil interests, further than where these supernatural Vertues are
planted in Mens minds, the Moral Duties of Piety and Honesty do more
plentifully abound and are in exercise. As these Moral Duties do more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concern the Common-wealth, so the Laws thereof are principally
drawn forth out of them, especially the second Table Duties, forming and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into Municipal Laws under Penalties and Encouragements greater
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103047:210"/>
or less, as in the Wisdom of a State is judged most conducing to the
Well-fare thereof. For these <hi>Gospel-mysteries</hi> it is otherwise. For as they
contribute to us in our Civil Government no otherwise than as before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so is there little contributed by the Wisdom or Authority of any State,
advantageous to the Gospel, but Protection, or being a <hi>defence upon the glory
of it.</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had stood all Common-wealths, had been prosperous and
flourishing, and yet no Faith, no Christ, no Repentance, nor any Gospel-Worship
known or professed. And since the fall, you have had well govern'd
Kingdoms among Heathens and Turks that never received Christ or Gospel-Worship.
It is with States as with particular Persons in <hi>Commerce:</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans Estate or Trade or Credit or any other Civil Concern with whom
I have to do, is not prejudiced or better'd by Omission or Practice of what is
a mere Gospel Duty. If a man I deal with be unjust, lye, steal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> my
worldly Interest is prejudiced hereby: but whether he repent, or exercise
faith in Christ for forgiveness of Sins, and humble himself, I am neither
gainer nor loser in my Civil Concerns. Now it is Gospel-Worship, Gospel-Religion
we profess in this Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Christian</hi> Religion having suffered so much by so many <hi>Pedantly</hi>
and <hi>Bigottish</hi> Writers having mis-represented it as an Invader both of the
quiet and business of Princes and Governors, and as if the necessary dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Sentiments in Religion according to mens several Capacities, were
still to give the Political Conduct of the World unnecessary trouble,
and as if <hi>God who was in Christ reconciling the World to himself,</hi> design'd
by any various Religionary Notions to render Christian Princes and
their People <hi>irreconcileable</hi> to one another, and (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I may say) to make
the <hi>World</hi> irreconcileable to it self, I am glad when I find the Subject of
Religion by falling into the hands of any man of large and noble thoughts,
to have right herein done it, as particularly hath thus been done it by
Mr. <hi>Ny,</hi> who had made Religion and Politicks very much his Study:
and I can refer the Curious to a Great Man of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> with some of whose Notions in this Point Mr. <hi>Ny</hi>'s
were partly Co-incident, as any may find who will consult the 2d <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume</hi>
of the <hi>Memoires</hi> of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> whose great Character is Recorded by
the Bishop of <hi>Rhodes</hi> in his <hi>History of</hi> Harry <hi>the 4th of</hi> France, and to
whom he was <hi>Secretary,</hi> and was so before to <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th and <hi>Harry</hi>
the 3d, and afterward to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th, and the greatest part of <hi>D'Ossat</hi>'s
memorable printed <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> was to him with high respect
Addressed. In the beginning of that <hi>Volume</hi> we have his <hi>Discours de la
vraye &amp; legitime constitution de l' estat, &amp; que l' ordre y est, encore que la
Religion n' y fust:</hi> and in <hi>p.</hi> 6, he discourseth of this Subject, viz. <hi>L'
estat, &amp; la Religion n' ont rien de Commun:</hi> and in <hi>p.</hi> 11. there his Subject is,
That <hi>l' estat n' est estably ny mainteny par la Religion, ains la Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servée
par l' estat:</hi> and in <hi>p.</hi> 16. his Theme is, That <hi>la difference de Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
n' empesche point la paix de l' estat:</hi> and in <hi>p.</hi> 19. he discourseth of
this Assertion, That <hi>Le Prince ne doit etre consideré pour sa Religion, mais
pour ce qu'il est chef du peuple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may moreover be supposed that God in his Government of the
World, and in his care for the Church in particular Countries, when he
thinks not fit to incline a Princes mind to receive the same Religionary
Sentiments that the generality of the People owns, doth yet often endow
him with those Moral Vertues and habitual inclinations whereby he is
much better qualified for the Protection of the People than any can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
him to be by Orthodoxy in the Speculative points of revealed Truth.</p>
            <p>

The <hi>Church</hi> we know is in <hi>Scripture</hi> represented as a helpless <hi>Minor,</hi>
and <hi>Kings</hi> are there mentioned to be its <hi>Nursing Fathers:</hi> and thus the
<hi>Canon</hi> Law tells us, that <hi>Ecclesia fungitur vice minoris,</hi> and the <hi>Canonists,</hi>
that <hi>à minoribus ad Ecclesiam valet argumentum.</hi> It is here therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to consideration that <hi>Power</hi> and moral Honesty and Diligence
and Courage and Discretion are the chief endowments requisite for the
protection of an <hi>Orphans</hi> Person and <hi>Estate.</hi> We find these sayings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

               </gap>th <hi>Chapter</hi> he refers to the settlement of the <hi>Confraternities</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>

               </gap>
               <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> and by whose <hi>Bosom</hi> Heaven is represented,
and who had the honour done him by Holy Writ, to be called <hi>the friend of
God,</hi> and by the <hi>Chronological</hi> Writers of Memorable Things to be called
<hi>Inventor foederum,</hi> (and most worthy of him, as being <hi>the friend of God,</hi>
it was, to be the <hi>Inventor</hi> of <hi>Alliances</hi> and federal friendship with <hi>men</hi>)
did make that <hi>first</hi> Alliance with an idolatrous Prince and with his whole
Race of Idolaters in Prospect.</p>
            <p>If then it is an allowed judged point by the consent of Parties, That
Religion is out of the Case when one Prince doth freely protect another,
and his Subjects of different Religions, it may be thence very well inferr'd,
That it is most reasonable and just, and ought not to any to seem strange
that Subjects, who <hi>owe</hi> a <hi>natural</hi> Allegiance to their Princes, are indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
bound to pay the same to them, and to defend all their Regal
Rights without any regard to the Religion their Princes may profess: and
on the other hand that Princes may oft protect their Subjects who differ
in Religion from them, in the enjoyment of their Rights.</p>
            <p>I grant that some Popish Princes abroad having rivetted the <hi>Inquisition</hi>
into their <hi>Politicks,</hi> and being perhaps of harsh or bigotted dispositions,
have out of a regret against <hi>Hereticks</hi> expelled <hi>Infidels</hi> from their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
and by which expulsion such Princes have been sufficient losers
in this World: and a <hi>Case</hi> of which nature is particularly referred to by
the Bishop of <hi>Rhodes</hi> in his <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th of <hi>France,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> to be about a <hi>Million,</hi> mentions the hard
usage they there found, and that before they were thence expulsed they
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103047:211"/>
applied to <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th for Protection, once when but King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
and afterward when King of <hi>France</hi> and a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and
who then did no more doubt of the lawfulness of protecting them, than
while he was a Protestant, however he forbore on Political grounds only
to protect and defend them. Nor when he forsook the Communion of
the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church were any of his <hi>Heretical</hi> Subjects used by him
with any hardship on the account of the hard word of <hi>Heresy:</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his Notion of the <hi>practicableness</hi> of an orderly Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without reference to Religionary differences, was the same with
his great Minister <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned how Cardinal <hi>D' Ossat</hi> told the <hi>Pope,</hi> that if his
Holyness were King of <hi>France</hi> at that time that <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th was, he
would shew the <hi>Huguenots</hi> the same favour that <hi>Harry</hi> the 4th did; and
shall observe it that in the famous printed <hi>Oration</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi>
made to the 3d <hi>Estate,</hi> or <hi>Commonalty</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> tho he speaks of the
<hi>LATERAN Council,</hi> and owns and asserts it to be a <hi>general</hi> one as stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
as the Learned Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> hath since done, and faith,
<hi>When that Council intended to provide for the extirpation and rooting out of
the Reliques of the</hi> Albigenses, <hi>it ordained that the Princes who should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Contemners of the Council that Condemned the</hi> Albigenses, <hi>should be
deprived of the Obligation of their Subjects fidelity to them:</hi> yet he then adds,
<hi>And this I remember not for an Example to disturb or trouble the publick
Peace or Tranquillity, seeing the Hereticks are here in so great a number as
that they make a notable part of the Body of the Estate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here then I have named two <hi>Cardinals</hi> of as great real <hi>Eminence</hi> as any
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could ever shew, who held it lawful for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Prince to protect his Protestant Subjects, notwithstanding the
<hi>Lateran</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>But what <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaks of the <hi>Duty</hi> of common Men, namely, that
they should not penetrate <hi>Abditos Principis sensus,</hi> nay, be particularly
applied to their Religion. And the <hi>Apostles</hi> Caution of <hi>Who art thou that
judgest another mans servant,</hi> may here be improved by saying, <hi>Who art
thou that judgest thy Natural Liege Lord,</hi> and particularly as to matters
of Religion, wherein the most Antimonarchical Writers will allow them
accountable only to God. And to any Protestant who having followed
his judgment of Discretion, hath separated from the Communion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church, and yet shall Censure his Prince for so doing, those other
words of the <hi>Apostle</hi> are justly applicable, <hi>Therefore thou art inexcusable
O man whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another thou
condemnest thy self: for thou that judgest doest the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Christian Religion that hath enjoyned us not only to defraud and
injure, and offend none, and to <hi>love our Neighbour as our self,</hi> and extended
that Neighbourhood to all Humane kind, hath likewise commanded us to
<hi>HONOVR all men,</hi> and especially to render <hi>honour</hi> to whom <hi>honour</hi> is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
due, and not <hi>rashly</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> another: and if men would imprint
on their minds a serious Sense of the <hi>Moral</hi> Offices to which they are
obliged by Virtue of those <hi>Expressions,</hi> they would soon be better guided
in the Measures of their Obligations relating to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Heirs</hi>
and <hi>Successors</hi> without being tempted as formerly to exclude any of them
from their Civil Rights on the account of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ames</hi> in his <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> doth well descant on those Moral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and in his <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Charity to our Neighbour,</hi> he assigns some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Cases,</hi> in which, <hi>as to the actual exercise and effect of Charity, one is to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:103047:211"/>
love, his Neighbour more than himself,</hi> and instanceth <hi>in our being in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Matters obliged to prefer publick Persons to our selves,</hi> and saith,
That <hi>all are to be reckoned among publick Persons concerning whom it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that they are useful to the Realm:</hi> and in the Case of whom he
determines it, <hi>That on their occasionally being in danger of their lives, we
are to venture ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are we not then, when we may without the peril of our lives defend
the Civil Rights of an Heir of the Crown, who by the venturing his
life hath supported the honour of the Realm, obliged to forbear excluding
him from the benefit of his Birth-right? The <hi>Privilege</hi> of his owning
the belief of Religionary Propositions, tho differing from any other
mens, was purchased for him by the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in <hi>using</hi> it, he
doth but <hi>use</hi> his own <hi>Right,</hi> and consequently injures no man: and if we
slight the offering his own blood to us, shall we too vilify, or (as I
may say) endeavour to nullify in his Case the effect of the Blood of his
<hi>Saviour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ames <hi>in his Chapter</hi> De honore proximi <hi>tells us, That</hi> Honour, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the common Notion of it, doth denote the Testification of the excellence
and worth of any one: and that such Testification thereof cannot appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men but by Words and Actions: and that it likewise includes a congruous
judgment and internal affection, in the which there is a kind of inward testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
before God: and therefore the solid Office of HONOVRING doth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depend on the inward acknowledgment of any ones worth or excellence.
<hi>And afterward referring to the express Command in St.</hi> Peter <hi>of</hi> honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all men, <hi>he saith,</hi> Vix quisquam reperitur in quo non possimus aliquid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servare
in quo nobis est superior, si ex humilitate judicium feramus. <hi>Phil. 2. 3.
and then speaking of impious men, saith,</hi> Quatenus boni aliquid habent,
justum ejus testimonium non est ipsis denegandum. <hi>He afterward in his</hi>
Chapter <hi>concerning</hi> rash judgment, <hi>shewing that it is a Sin and how, saith,</hi>
1. 'Tis a Sin of Levity against Prudence. 2. 'Tis contrary to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Nature, <hi>Quod tibi non vis fieri,</hi> &amp;c. for no man is willing that his
Neighbour should judge rashly of him and his Actions. 3. It diminisheth
the good of ones Neighbour, and opposeth his Right: for that every man
hath as much right to his good Fame, as to a <hi>depositum</hi> in any mens hands,
till he himself has by his actings took it away. 4. It begets contempt of
ones Neighbour, <hi>Rom. 14. 3. 10.</hi> by which means it happens that he is
held unworthy of beneficial employments. 5. 'Tis an Vsurpation of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Authority of God, who judgeth of hidden things: <hi>and in that</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>raising the Question,</hi> Whether and how doubtful matters are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
in the better part? <hi>he answers,</hi> 1. That what is doubtful as to
things, ought to be weighed according to reason, without inclining to either
part. 2. That what is doubtful as to Persons, wherein their good or ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is concerned, is absolutely to be interpreted in the better part. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 5. and that at least in such a Case we are not to judge ill of our Neighbour:
<hi>and further,</hi> That we are so in common Offices or Duties to demean our selves
to him, as if he were an upright man, since the contrary doth not appear to
us. This is the judgment of Charity. <hi>And in his Chapter</hi> De exemplo
bono &amp; scandalo, <hi>he saith, That</hi> there must of necessity be Sin in every Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
because the ruine or Spiritual detriment of ones Neighbour is therein
concerned. <hi>He there moreover doth inculcate one great point of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in order to the avoiding of Scandal, and saith,</hi> Damnanda &amp; horrenda
est illa perversitas judicii qua solent multi quorundam labentium Casu aut hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriseos
detectione, alios professionem similem facientes, hypocritas idcirco
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:103047:212"/>
pronunciare. Hoc est enim planè Diabolum imitari in piis accusandis &amp; ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quâ
suspicione gravandis, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>And having said all this, may I not ask if he <hi>honoureth</hi> his <hi>Prince</hi> who
doth not think him wise enough to choose his Religion? When the fate
of our Princes is usually to fix their Marriages with Relation to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the State, and when their Favourites are so seldom permitted by
the Populace to lie quiet in their Bosoms, and that 'tis a Princes Lot
thus not to be like others, able to choose his Wife or his Friend,
shall he not choose his God? since that <hi>Verse</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2d referred to,
saith, <hi>In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves;</hi>
doth he observe that Precept who esteems not his Prince as fit to be
trusted with the freedom of choosing his way to Heaven, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of discretion as himself? since there are many qualifications of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
for the discharge of the Regal Office, that claim preference of a
Princes Orthodoxy in the belief of the Mysteries of the Gospel, doth he
<hi>honour</hi> all men, and particularly, give <hi>honour to whom honour is due,</hi> who
when he sees the whole World agreed in the Fact of his Princes Heir
being most signally, perhaps beyond any one of the Age, blest with those
qualifications, shall instead of testifying <hi>by words and actions such his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
and intrinsic worth</hi> (and wherewith God hath <hi>honoured</hi> him) try to
exclude him from the Throne? A Great Philosopher of our Nation,
and one who hath writ Philosophically of the <hi>Passions,</hi> tells us, That
<hi>the value or worth of a man is, as of all other things, his price, that is to say,
so much as would be given for the use of his Power, and therefore is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
but a thing dependant on the need and judgment of another:</hi> and then
tells us, That <hi>an able Conductor of Souldie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s is of great price in time of
War present or imminent.</hi> And any one that will consider what the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
War-like State of the World abroad is, and that by necessity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the growing populous World we must expect the peremptory
noise of <hi>Wars and Rumours of Wars,</hi> to be more and more calling on our
attention, will probably be of opinion that the High-born Lawful
Princes of great Martial Talents will be the best Heirs and Successors
Heaven can send any Countries. That <hi>Author</hi> somewhat suitably to
<hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Honouring,</hi> saith, <hi>The manifestation of the value we
set on one another, is that which is commonly called honouring and dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
To value a man at a high rate is to honour him: at a low rate is to
dishonour him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I may add that an heroical Habit of Courage in any Prince is
the more valuable or intituled to <hi>honour,</hi> because it is by necessity of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
accompanied with the highest Clemency and gentleness, it being
the excessive fear of danger that puts Cowardice on Cruelty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> I refer to says likewise, <hi>That to be descended from Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Parents is honourable, because they more easily attain the Aids and
Friends of their Ancestors. On the contrary to be descended from obscure
Parentage is dishonourable.</hi> With how great an <hi>honour</hi> then and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
awe ought we to think of the great Claim of Birth-right, the next
Heir of the Crown hath, which may be lineally and successively deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>British, Scotish, Danish, Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Princes above
two thousand years, which is more ancient than any Prince in the World
can shew? and when God who finished his Work-man-ship of the World in
Six days, hath been two thousand years in making up the Hereditary
Glories of this <hi>Line,</hi> can we without horror think of any ones dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, by breaking in on its Succession under pretences of Religion
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:103047:212"/>
or honouring God? when so many Fountains of <hi>Royal</hi> Blood have
been filling this <hi>Sea</hi> of Honour two thousand years, will a few men by
their poor Sculls project to empty it, or with the Breath of <hi>Sophisms</hi>
to turn the Great Purple Tide that hath born down the World before it
so many years?</p>
            <p>But it is not only the thought of the <hi>Aides</hi> that the next <hi>Heir</hi> of the
Crown may have from the <hi>Friends of his Ancestors,</hi> that may make
his <hi>Descent from Conspicuous Parents so justly to be honoured,</hi> as was said,
but the sight of all the Lines of the Great and Honourable Actions of his
numerous Ancestors, being made by the hand of Heaven to point at him
as the Centre, and their being fixt so in his Memory that we cannot well
think of his thinking of any thing but <hi>Honour,</hi> that must make other
Subjects pay the greater Veneration of his High Birth.</p>
            <p>It is so hard a matter even for the flights of imagination with the
exquisiteness of Art to produce thoughts of Kings and Princes any way
proportionable to their real Figure, that I have observed that our old
famous <hi>Dramatists</hi> of the former Ages could hardly in any <hi>Scene</hi> give
us the Character of a King done up to the height of a Monarchs Glory:
and as the Characters of Kings in those days were expressed, it was but
necessary that the <hi>Rule</hi> in <hi>Theaters</hi> should be, that the Kings should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there with <hi>loud Musick</hi> that so their Quality might that way be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p>It is then no marvel if so many in the present Age who are not made
<hi>è meliore luto,</hi> and whose Education was low, and whose Souls are narrow,
cannot comprehend the honour of the great part that God calls Kings
to Act on the Stage of the World, and are especially Strangers to the
great thoughts that are to be supposed to Crown the Souls of Kings
when they espouse a Religion.</p>
            <p>But in that great particular Concern of Princes owning their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we are morally bound to think of them with all the honour we can:
nor to repine at that our Duty to them, since in the Concern of Religion,
and as it is a Principle of the Divine Life we are to <hi>honour</hi> our <hi>Inferiours,</hi>
and cannot without profanation and usurping on Gods Right <hi>judge</hi> them
rashly.</p>
            <p>We are not to think that our <hi>honouring all men,</hi> and the necessary parts
of that duty are recommended to us by way of <hi>Council</hi> in order to a more
<hi>perfect life,</hi> and as not <hi>sub peccato</hi> obliging any but those who have by <hi>Vow</hi>
bound themselves to the practice of the same: but we are to esteem them
<hi>Precepts,</hi> and properly so called, and universally binding, and as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
parts of that <hi>Holiness without which no man can see God.</hi> And therefore
when I see any man after much labouring of his thoughts to have chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Profession of his Belief of any <hi>Tenets</hi> controverted among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and particularly one who was in the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> to own the belief of <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory,</hi> and the
Doctrine of <hi>Iustification</hi> according to the Sense of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi>
or other such points, and shall find that most certainly that it neither was
nor could be for <hi>Gain</hi> or respect to Temporal advantages that his
judgment appeared thus altered, nor yet out of <hi>levity</hi> and natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy,
and that his habitual constancy and steadiness in all measures
relating to Persons and things long by me observed, have assured me that
no such change could thence proceed, and shall further observe in such
Person a greater tenderness in his regard to <hi>second Table</hi> Duties than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and that his inclinations of Beneficence to all Mankind, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:103047:213"/>
to his former friends now differing in judgment from him, have
not been tinctured and discoloured by any alteration of his Notions, I
shall think my self under various <hi>Moral</hi> Obligations to <hi>honour</hi> such a
Person, tho perhaps erroneously opining. I will honour him for his
discharge of his Duty in <hi>trying all things,</hi> and having spent time in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the truth of Religionary Speculations, and taking up a Religion
not by <hi>chance</hi> (as most Orthodox Religionaries do) but by choice. I
will <hi>honour</hi> him for following that which <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his Lectures of
<hi>Conscience</hi> calls the <hi>next</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> (tho not the <hi>adequate) Rule</hi> of
his <hi>Conscience,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> of his <hi>mind</hi> for the time <hi>present,</hi> a <hi>Light</hi> that I
see so many Orthodox Religionaries playing with or endeavouring to
extinguish. I will <hi>honour</hi> him for the great Sacrifice I think that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
intends to truth, (and to offer which to it I see so many Persons
who erred, so reluctantly brought to its Altars) I mean the Pride and
Glory of the Humane understanding by a Recantation of its former
Sentiments, a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that to him, who <hi>consults with Flesh and Blood,</hi>
may seem as unpleasant, as the offering up of <hi>Isaac</hi> did to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And
since to <hi>presage</hi> well of men is to <hi>honour</hi> them, I will thus in the Case of
such a Person, who hath thus <hi>honoured</hi> God by <hi>taking</hi> up his <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ross</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>shame</hi> to himself, believe that God will <hi>honour</hi> him, and judge, that
tho he may <hi>in statu viatoris</hi> have mistaken <hi>Error</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> in his <hi>way,</hi> he
will not mistake <hi>Hell</hi> for <hi>Heaven</hi> at his Journeys end. Moreover since
to speak <hi>rashly to</hi> or <hi>of</hi> any men is a <hi>dishonour</hi> to them, I will not only not
<hi>dishonour</hi> such a Person by determining that his Error is <hi>voluntary</hi> (which
whether it be so I can never know, and which if it be not, I do know it
can be no Sin) but will pay him the just <hi>honour</hi> of my judging it to be
<hi>involuntary;</hi> as knowing that neither he nor any one else can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his own understanding, and that the nature of the understanding
is such that it can no more apprehend things otherwise than they appear
to it, than the Eye see other Colours in the <hi>Rain-bow</hi> than it doth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those Colours be really there or no. Moreover altho I know that
no <hi>Law</hi> binds without a <hi>Promulgation,</hi> and that that <hi>Promulgation</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
positive Laws may by reason of mens diffent Abilities of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be sufficient for one man that is not for another, (and so that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
opinion of one man may be a Crime, and another mans holding
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me opinion may be innocent) yet I will not <hi>dishonour</hi> the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
of any man for his not believing the Controverted points of
Christian Religion, that I observe other men of great intellectuals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Belief of: and do consider, that as <hi>the Wind bloweth where it lists,</hi>
so the influx of the Divine Spirit on men is not confined to the excellence
of their <hi>understandings,</hi> and that God doth not always reveal his mind
to men according to the Proportion of their Gifts and Graces, and that
when the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was found and read before <hi>Iosiah, Hulda</hi> the
<hi>Prophetess</hi> was sent to and consulted, tho there were <hi>Prophets</hi> in the
Land at that time: and that that was Revealed sometime to <hi>Nathan,</hi>
that was not to <hi>David,</hi> who was in all points his Superior. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what was <hi>cited</hi> out of <hi>Ames, Interpret</hi> every thing of him in
the <hi>better</hi> part that is <hi>doubtful.</hi> And tho men do naturally think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>equally</hi> wise, I will, according to the Morality enjoyned by that
<hi>place</hi> in the <hi>Philippians, Esteem him better than my self:</hi> since a great
part of <hi>Wisdom</hi> consists in the <hi>proportioning</hi> of the <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>end,</hi> I
will out of the knowledge of my own frequent Omissions in that kind,
account that we both having designed the same end of Eternal Happiness,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:103047:213"/>
he tho differing from me in speculative points, yet hath by his Practical
Devotion proportioned his means to that end better than I have done.
Moreover because it is a <hi>dishonourable</hi> thing for any man to receive a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in gross, and <hi>servilely</hi> to own all the Religionary <hi>Sentiments</hi> that
the <hi>Major</hi> part of any Church seem to do, I will not so much as in my
secret thoughts charge such a Person with owning all the <hi>Religionary</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and much less with owning any one of the
Tenets that is <hi>Irreligionary,</hi> how justly soever chargeable either on the
<hi>Papacy</hi> or any of its <hi>Adherents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I who am a Son of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have considered how its
Constitution hath been prop'd up in various ways, and on different <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi>
by several of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and great <hi>Writers</hi> in that <hi>Church</hi> before
Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s time and since, and how some of them in some points
receded from its <hi>Articles,</hi> and that many of them did in several Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of importance variously interpret its Articles. My Conversation
with several <hi>Divines</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> who are equally Learned and Pious,
hath let me see that in many Theological speculative points they differ
much from one another, and yet retain perfect Charity for one another;
and their Notions as to which points they have in prudence not troubled
the <hi>Populace</hi> with. And yet even in our very Protestant Populace in this
<hi>Conjuncture</hi> of <hi>Zeal</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> I have observed so much <hi>Candour</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
to Protestant Writers who have asserted some speculative points
that seemed to agree with the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Church of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> that no
one man hath either called them <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Protestants in Masquerade</hi>
for so doing.</p>
            <p>I have not heard of any who hath censured Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as a <hi>Papist</hi> or
Popishly affected, since Dr. <hi>Tully</hi> in his printed <hi>Letter</hi> to him, <hi>p.</hi> 21.
desiring him <hi>to take his Balance and weigh more diligently, that he might
see the very small odds, between His Iustification and the Council of</hi> Trents,
addeth, <hi>for to me neither of them turns the Scale upon the other.</hi> There
was likewise after the beginning of the Popular Out-cryes of the <hi>Danger</hi>
of <hi>Popery</hi> a Learned <hi>Metrophysical</hi> Book of Dr. <hi>Glisson</hi> (who was <hi>Professor</hi>
of <hi>Physick</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Fellow</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society</hi>) Printed and
<hi>Dedicated</hi> to the <hi>EARL</hi> of <hi>SHAFTSBVRY,</hi> and in the 28th
<hi>Chapter</hi> there, viz. <hi>De substantiarum penetrabilitate mutatâ quantitate,</hi>
the <hi>Dr.</hi> saith, That <hi>'tis better to admit</hi> Penetration, <hi>than a</hi> Vacuum, <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have been taught from our Child-hood to believe that there is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
of Bodies and Dimensions,</hi> and doth Combat those old <hi>Notions</hi> of
<hi>Philosophy</hi> with which <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was opposed formerly; and yet
was never censured so much as <hi>Popishly affected</hi> for so writing; nor have I
observed any one to blame him for it, or to have animadverted on his
Book. I have likewise observed that several Protestant <hi>Divines</hi> have not
been in the least reproached or censured as maintainers of <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
when they have professed their Beliefs that the Souls of good Men after
Death go to a good <hi>Hades,</hi> and of bad Men to a bad one, and are to
stay in those common receptacles till the day of Judgment. It is
hence obvious that there are ingenious Protestants who do not take up
their Religion in <hi>gross,</hi> and that the fear of Popery or hatred of it is not
generally so much founded on the Speculative <hi>Religionary</hi> Propositions
maintained by Papists, as partly on the Arbitrary Power claimed by
the Pope to impose <hi>Creeds</hi> on men, and by which Power he may if he
pleaseth command them to believe that there are no <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
any who believe there are, as one Pope long since did, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:103047:214"/>
partly on his claiming a Power to disturb the measures of their <hi>Loyalty</hi>
to their Princes.</p>
            <p>In such a <hi>Conjuncture</hi> therefore as this, when 'tis so much out of <hi>fashion</hi>
to think any one the less a Christian, or the less a Protestant for differing
from others of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in such point as aforesaid, it would
be an aggravation of the immorality of our not acknowledging the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to any Person of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Communion, because
supposed to own Speculative Religionary <hi>Tenets</hi> of this Nature, and
which too have no influence no Mens Conversation with each other, or
on their Actions as they are Members of any Civil Society, and (as
one saith) <hi>would be still the same with all the Consequences of them, tho
there were no other Person besides one's self in the World.</hi> And therefore as
I will rashly charge no Protestant with the servile resignation of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to any true Church, nor look on him as one who doth, <hi>More balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
antecedentem Ducem sequi,</hi> so I will not without just ground and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
proof charge any Papist with the taking up his Religion <hi>in gross</hi>
from the <hi>Papal</hi> Chair, nor with the owning all the Religionary <hi>Tenets</hi>
that many <hi>Romanists</hi> do, and much less with any one of the Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary
Tenets imputable to any Order of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to the
Papacy. To think any <hi>Papist</hi> the less a <hi>Christian</hi> for owning such <hi>Tenets</hi>
which being held by some <hi>Protestants,</hi> we think them not the less Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
for, doth most notoriously come under the Sin of <hi>Acceptio persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and is contrary to that <hi>Precept</hi> of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> viz. <hi>My Brethren, have
not the faith of our Lord Iesus Christ the Lord of Glory with respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</hi>
and by which <hi>accepting</hi> of some mens <hi>Persons</hi> the duty of <hi>honouring
all men,</hi> and <hi>valuing</hi> their <hi>real</hi> worth is manifestly outraged.</p>
            <p>I will by no means therefore rashly charge any particular Papist with
owning the <hi>Tenet,</hi> that he is <hi>implicitly</hi> to obey the Commands of the
<hi>Pope</hi> without weighing the Justice of them: for I find the contrary <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
own'd in print by the <hi>seven Divines</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> as <hi>Ames</hi> mentions it

upon the being called <hi>Papists,</hi> give some indication thereby of their
being not obliged to pay an absolute blind Obedience to the <hi>Pope?</hi> And

World, yet all the <hi>Gibelline</hi> Papists of old made it <hi>HERESY</hi> to say that
the <hi>Emperor</hi> was not by <hi>Divine</hi> Right Lord of the World. Moreover
tho some Papists have writ opprobriously of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and called it as

Writers, viz. <hi>Laico verum dicenti cum Evangelio, magis credendum, quam
Concilio falsum dicenti contra Evangelium.</hi> It is so easie a thing for every
man of ordinary reading and observation to expatiate on the common
place of the <hi>disagreements</hi> of the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in various

'Tis a common Observation that in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> it is the common
opinion that <hi>Latreia</hi> is due to the <hi>Cross,</hi> which in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>
is not so: and that at <hi>Rome</hi> no man may say that the <hi>Council</hi> is above the
<hi>Pope,</hi> nor at <hi>Paris</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> is above the <hi>Council:</hi> and as to the

and of <hi>Stephen Gardners</hi> laying his dead grasp on <hi>Christ's</hi> Merits
as he was sinking: and as to some <hi>Papists</hi> not believing the <hi>School Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
in that <hi>Church,</hi> there is a famous instance cited by <hi>Crackanthorp</hi> in his
<hi>Logick,</hi> concerning a great <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick <hi>Writer,</hi> who said, <hi>Sic dicerem

            <p>And therefore (since as was said) <hi>every man hath a right to his good
name till he hath justly forfeited it,</hi> I will <hi>honour</hi> such a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick as
before described, with the reputation of his being a good <hi>Christian,</hi> and shall
think that I am Morally bound to esteem all Papists so qualified to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Christians</hi> than any <hi>Orthodox</hi> Protestants that want those Moral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments:
and according to my Obligation to <hi>honour all men and love the
Brotherhood,</hi> and consequently to be readier to do good <hi>Caeteris paribus</hi> to
Christians than to those who are strangers to Christianity, will thus <hi>love</hi>
such a Papist as a part of that <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> and by our <hi>Saviours</hi> measures in
those words of <hi>the same being his Brother, Sister and Mother whosever
shall do the will of God,</hi> will take notice of and honour, and love
such a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick as much as if the closest <hi>Iura sanguinis</hi> united

were made of,</hi> but the <hi>ONE Blood</hi> they were <hi>redeemed</hi> with, and by
virtue of those other words of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> viz. <hi>That if any man will do
his Will, he shall know of the Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. will account that in points
<hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> to such a mans salvation, our blessed Lord hath been
as ready to make his Doctrine known to him, as effectually as he could be
supposed to make it known to such near Relations.</p>
            <p>They are expressions worthy of a <hi>Divine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
in an excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> that goeth under the name of Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> viz.
<hi>I had rather perswade any one to be a good man, than to be of any party or
denomination of Christians whatsoever. For I doubt not but the belief of the
ancient Creed without the addition of any other Articles, together with a
good life will certainly save a man.</hi> And since <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> when <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi>

who observe none of those <hi>Rules,</hi> yet to exclude <hi>Papists</hi> out of the Christian

And therefore tho the reconciling of <hi>Churches</hi> is by some good men
hoped for, and by all good men wished, yet since it can by no rational
men be supposed possible without a previous reconciliation of <hi>Persons</hi>
first had, and that this latter is no <hi>Project</hi> but a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty and <hi>Vital</hi>
part of Christianity, and that 'tis an empty Project for any one to think
to deserve the name of a <hi>Christian</hi> without being reconciled to the whole
Creation of God, and being <hi>first reconciled to his Brother</hi> as the <hi>Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>

               <hi>Any one who will consider that</hi> Canon <hi>of our</hi> Church, <hi>viz.</hi> It was far
from the purpose of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to forsake and reject the Churches

<hi>in</hi> honouring all men, <hi>and</hi> loving <hi>the whole</hi> Brotherhood <hi>of</hi> Christianity:
<hi>and our</hi> Duty <hi>wherein as necessary to Salvation is very excellently incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by a great</hi> Father <hi>of that Church, I mean,</hi> My Lord Primate Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal
<hi>in his</hi> just Vindication of the Church of <hi>England</hi> p. 15. <hi>where having
said, That</hi> the Communion of the Christian Church Catholick is partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
partly external, <hi>and made it part of this</hi> Internal <hi>Communion,</hi> to

either Eastern or Western, Southern or Northern Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to rejoyce at their well-doing, to sorrow for their Sins, to condole with them
in their sufferings, to pray for their constant perseverance in the true Christian
Faith, for their reduction from all their respective Errors, and their re-union
to the Church in Case they be divided from it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and lastly to hold an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
external Communion with them <hi>in votis,</hi> in our desires, and to endeavour
it by all those means that are in our Power, <hi>he tells us in plain terms that</hi>
this internal Communion is of absolute necessity among all Catholicks. <hi>And in</hi>
p. 26<hi>th he declareth to the same purpose,</hi> That internal Communion is due
always from all Christians to all Christians, even to those with whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
communicate externally in many things, whether Opinions or Practices.
But external Communion may sometimes be suspended more or less, <hi>&amp;c. and
he doth afterward in</hi> p. 18 <hi>assert,</hi> That Christian Communion implies not an
Vnity in all Opinions: <hi>and shews,</hi> That the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Churches
held good Communion one with another, while they differ'd both in Iudgment
and Practice about Rebaptisation.</p>
            <p>As for any projected Universal <hi>Vnity</hi> of Opinions, I look on it to be
as impracticable as our <hi>levelling</hi> Republicans <hi>EQVAL</hi> Division of <hi>Lands</hi>
in the late times by their wild <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws: for the Birth of the next
Child would necessarily break that their <hi>Model,</hi> and the same fate might
be expected to happen the same way to this <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Vnity</hi> of Opinions,
or perhaps by the birth of the next hour. But this <hi>Internal</hi> Communion
is a thing most possible, and our Duty tho without hope of Unity in all
Religionary Opinions to ensue thereby, according to the Doctrine of this
<hi>Great</hi> Primate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:103047:215"/>
If then we are <hi>Morally</hi> bound to have this <hi>Internal</hi> Communion with
all Foreign <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Princes and their Subjects, as before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
how can we without horror think of the excluding any Heir to
the Crown (for fear of his believing the same Religionary Notions that
they do) from the Catholick Communion, and of excluding him from his
Birth-right on such an account whom we must always have this <hi>Internal</hi>
Communion with, <hi>and rejoyce in his good successes, and condole with him in
his ill, and to hold an external Communion with him and any Church he is of,</hi> in
votis, <hi>in our desires, and to endeavour it by all means that are in our Power?</hi>
Did any <hi>endeavour</hi> it, who would by depriving him of his <hi>Birth-right</hi> on
that account, and holding the same <hi>Tenet</hi> with <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>Dominium fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur
in gratiâ,</hi> gave him such a just Cause of <hi>Scandal,</hi> as without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit assisting him, might endanger his withdrawing from the
whole Christian Communion: And tho the honest <hi>Heathen</hi> could tell us,
That <hi>Cavendum est ne poena major sit quam culpa,</hi> and all <hi>Casuists</hi> agree, That
<hi>Poena non debet excedere delictum,</hi> and tho <hi>Magna Charta</hi> tell us, That
<hi>Ex quantitate poenae cognoscitur quantitas delicti, quia poena debet esse commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surabilis
delicto,</hi> yet attempted to punish him by the loss of his Birth-right
of the Crown, when it could not be certain to us that he had committed
any fault at all, and when by the judgment of Charity we were bound to
believe that he had committed none?</p>
            <p>To many of our Nominal <hi>Protestants,</hi> whose thoughts and <hi>Ideas</hi> of
<hi>Christian</hi> Communion are too narrow to extend not only to a <hi>National</hi>
Church, but to a <hi>Parochial</hi> one, this Notion of the incomparable <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
(for whose <hi>august</hi> Charity one Christian <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Religionary</hi>
differences was not enough to overcome) about <hi>internal</hi> Communion,
will I believe seem <hi>new</hi> Doctrine and <hi>Duras Sermo;</hi> but if they would
<hi>be</hi> true <hi>Christians</hi> instead of being <hi>called</hi> true <hi>Protestants,</hi> this <hi>Duty</hi> of
<hi>Internal</hi> Communion <hi>from all Christians to all Christians,</hi> must be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by them: and if this Duty hath a <hi>Divine</hi> Right for it as to the
Persons of <hi>Papists</hi> abroad, it must be operative as to those here at home.
<hi>He who loveth not his Brother whom he hath seen,</hi> I may ask, <hi>how can he
love</hi> either his <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>his Brother that he hath not seen?</hi> The <hi>sham-war</hi>
among any <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> must not only be lest <hi>off,</hi> but they
must <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>Persons</hi> of one another: and <hi>Protestants</hi> are not only to
forbear robbing <hi>Papists</hi> of their <hi>Goods,</hi> on pretence of carrying away
their <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> but are to <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> shining in
the lives of, or the Gifts of God dispensed to any <hi>Papists.</hi>

               <hi>Mr.</hi> Burroughs <hi>in his</hi> Irenicum, <hi>p. 38. saith,</hi> We accounted it Tyranny
and Persecution in the Bishops, when they would not suffer such as could not
conform to their Church Discipline and Ceremonies, to teach Grammar or
practise Physick: <hi>and saith,</hi> That there was no dependance between their
Errors (if you will call them so) and these things. To deny the Church
and Commonwealth the benefit of the Gifts and Graces of Men, on such a
pretence that they will abuse their Liberty, we thought it was hard dealing;
yea no less than a Persecution. Suppose a man differs from his Brethren in
point of Church Discipline, must not this man have a place in an Army there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Tho he sees not the reason of such a Discipline in the Church, yet God

Orthodoxy in some Mysteries of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as was shewn out of

by words, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Anti-Christ;</hi> but will not these latter Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
necessarily prevent the <hi>Pope's</hi> being <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> in Deeds, if he
were inclined to hurt us by shewing himself such? <hi>Ames</hi> in his <hi>Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nismus
Anglicanus</hi> giveth this as the chief <hi>Reason</hi> why the <hi>Puritans</hi> hold
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be THE <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>For that he being an
Ecclesiastical Ruler doth arrogate and exercise the chief Power over Kings
and Princes.</hi> And doth any one fear that he can exercise such <hi>Power</hi>
over a Prince of these Endowments? And I may add, have not many
Factious and <hi>Republican</hi> Nominal Protestants here compleated that <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
of <hi>Anti-Christ?</hi> How many Vertues must any indifferent man over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
in this <hi>Pope,</hi> who thinks he would outrage our Civil Government,
and how many Vices must he wink at in such Persons who thinks they
would not do it?</p>
            <p>And by Virtue of our blessed Lords having decided it that <hi>he was the
better Son who said he would not do the Will of his Father and did it,</hi> may
it not be said, That those Papists who say they will not take these
<hi>Oaths,</hi> and yet perform their Natural Allegiance, are more loyal than
such <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestants, who have took the <hi>Oaths</hi> and observe them
not? As much an Abhorrer as I am of the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by this <hi>Pope,</hi> I shall yet think my self bound by the <hi>Moral</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
beforementioned out of <hi>Ames,</hi> not to charge the belief or practice of
them on all Persons in that <hi>Order.</hi> For when I consider the <hi>Devotional</hi>
Books of some <hi>Iesuites,</hi> writ with such strong and lively expressions of
the <hi>Practick</hi> part of Religion, as any Person of <hi>Candor</hi> will think to be
founded on a real deep sense of all <hi>Moral</hi> Offices lying warm at their
hearts, I account it impossible for them to have believed some of
those <hi>Tenets:</hi> and as I once observing at the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of a poor <hi>Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>
that his <hi>Stomach</hi> appeared not able to contain above the <hi>Quantity</hi> of
a <hi>Quart,</hi> would easily have thence inferred, had I heard him accused of
being wont in his life-time to debauch by <hi>ingurgitating</hi> vast quantities of
<hi>Liquor,</hi> that there could be no such thing, so shall I think it not possible
that this <hi>sober</hi> Party of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> who are really devout, can swallow
such <hi>Irreligionary</hi> Principles, as too many others of them have
done,</p>
            <p>We know that not many eminent Popish Writers, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Azorius</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> hath writ against the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
and <hi>Mental</hi> Reservation: and <hi>Crackanthorp</hi> and <hi>Ames</hi> and other
Protestant Writers in their Writings, impeaching that <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> have quoted <hi>Azorius</hi> as on their side in that point.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but many Pious Persons of that <hi>Order</hi> are glad of this <hi>Pope's</hi>
having damned such <hi>Tenets,</hi> which they never did or could <hi>believe:</hi> and I
will now upon the <hi>Popes</hi> having condemned them, judge no particular
<hi>Papist</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> them till I find cause so to do.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding the hard usage our Learned Lord Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>'s
Book had from the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The Compendium</hi> saying, <hi>That the
Title of the Book confuted the whole,</hi> because it mentioned the <hi>Principles
approved by the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>pernicious when really believed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,</hi>
I shall still think the <hi>Pleonasm</hi> or exuberance of the Charity in
so qualifying the <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>Tenets</hi> he confutes, to be worthy a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and do think the like of the Charity of
the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> expressed in his printed <hi>Sermon</hi> of the 5th of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:103047:216"/>
               <hi>November,</hi> where having spoke of <hi>the Doctrines of Dissenters tending to
Sedition and Rebellion, that seem to be derived from the Church of</hi> Rome,
he saith, <hi>if those Doctrines are believed and practised, they must necessarily
produce Confusion among us:</hi> and do think that if the <hi>Papists</hi> could gain
the point, namely, to be looked on by Protestants as not to <hi>believe</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of the <hi>Tenets</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> that are <hi>Irreligionary,</hi> and particularly
that about the <hi>Exterminium</hi> of Hereticks enjoyned by the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to be not believed by them, it would be a point very well gain'd, and
any one who could gain it for them, would be a more useful friend to
them than ever <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was.</p>
            <p>To give a man the <hi>Lye</hi> is the greatest <hi>dishonour,</hi> and therefore when
any Papist shall tell me that he believes not the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
or other <hi>Tenets</hi> chargeable on the <hi>Papacy,</hi> I shall not tell him that
he <hi>doth,</hi> but shall pass my <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> that he doth not believe
the same, and shall account him still a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick tho perhaps
erroneously denying that to be a <hi>General</hi> Council, as I account <hi>Luther</hi> a
Christian and Owner of the Authority of the <hi>Bible,</hi> tho he erroneously
denied the Divine Authority of the <hi>Epistle</hi> of St. <hi>Iames.</hi> The Learned
Author of <hi>The Advocate of Conscience Liberty</hi> printed in the <hi>Year</hi> 1673.
and said to be Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> a <hi>Franciscan,</hi> in his 8th <hi>Chapter,</hi> viz. <hi>Of</hi> Roman
<hi>Catholicks being not guilty of Practices or Principles destructive to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and reproaching the <hi>ENGLISH</hi> and Foreign <hi>Protestants</hi> with such
<hi>Principles</hi> saith, <hi>Was it from any of their Books</hi> (meaning the Books of
the Papists) <hi>you have drawn those wild Maxims, That the Authority of the
Magistrate is of Humane Right? That the People are above the King?
That the People can give Power to the Prince and take it away? That if a
King fail in performing his Oath at Coronation, the People are loosened from
their Allegiance? That if Princes fall from the Grace of God, the People
are loosed from their Subjection? Do not these Doctrines proceed from</hi> Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff,

the 4th <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Institutions</hi> for that purpose, but very falsly:
for <hi>Calvin</hi> in all that <hi>Chapter</hi> hath not a word of such <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>

Vows that they had made, and out of Error and Ignorance held themselves
obliged by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I doubt not if <hi>Parsons</hi> aliàs <hi>Doleman,</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>The Prelate
and the Prince</hi> had been shewed to this <hi>Franciscan,</hi> he would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
to this effect, viz. <hi>These men and many</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Authors
by them cited, held those disloyal Trayterous Principles beforementioned, but I
fall will a Sacrifice rather than hold such.</hi> I honour the spirit of Zeal against
Disloyalty that runneth through his <hi>Book,</hi> and in <hi>p.</hi> 204, 205, 206,
207, 208. he very learnedly endeavours to answer the objection about
the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> and saith thereupon what the matter will bear:
and he and many other <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick <hi>Writers</hi> have disown'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of that <hi>Council</hi> as obligatory: and therefore the judgment of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:103047:217"/>
Charity will incline any one to think that such <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks
would not disorder the World by it.</p>
            <p>Moreover some Protestant <hi>Writers</hi> have judged that <hi>Council</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid,
and Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> who was very well studied in the Learning that
relates to the <hi>Canon</hi> Law and <hi>General</hi> Councils, doth particularly in his
<hi>Pseudo-Martyr</hi> p. 377, 378, 379, 380. take a great deal of pains to shew
the <hi>invalidity</hi> of that Council: and that it was never meant to oblige
<hi>Sovereign</hi> Princes.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The Prelate and the Prince</hi> doth in <hi>p.</hi> 228, 229,
230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236. with much Learning statuminate
the Authority of that <hi>Council:</hi> and asserts it to have been a <hi>General</hi> one,
as the Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> have done: yet what
I have mentioned of that Famous <hi>Cardinal's</hi> not <hi>believing</hi> the Principle of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> founded on that Council for Princes exterminating
their Heretical Subjects as always Obligatory, nor promoting the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
thereof in <hi>France,</hi> where the <hi>Huguenots</hi> were then about a 7th part
of the whole People, hath justified the reasonableness of the <hi>Charity</hi> of
our <hi>Bishops</hi> in qualifying the <hi>danger</hi> of some <hi>Papal</hi> Principles with the
restriction of their being <hi>really believed</hi> and <hi>practised:</hi> and the same Rule
in my <hi>Notion</hi> of their danger shall always guide me, that is to say, when
the <hi>Poyson</hi> of such <hi>Principles</hi> is really swallowed, it must then be pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
The poyson may lie in the <hi>Boxes</hi> of the <hi>Canon</hi> Law or a General
<hi>Council,</hi> and yet not poyson the minds of pious Catholicks, nor foul their
fingers. I having found just cause so far to <hi>honour</hi> all the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of my Acquaintance, as to judge them free from any Complication
of the belief and practice of any irreligious Principles with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of their Religion, and particularly from the owning any Principle of
<hi>Disloyalty</hi> or the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Calumny,</hi> or the Obligatoriness of
the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, will not rashly pronounce any other particular
Papist guilty of the belief or practice of such Principles.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any great honour that I have done to any men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Vertue in thus judging, that they cannot <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>practise</hi> such
Principles: for that it being true in the Course of <hi>Nature</hi> what <hi>Machiavel</hi>
said, that next to the being perfectly good, 'tis the most difficult thing
to be perfectly bad, the World hath had thereby some <hi>Garranty</hi> against
the belief and practice of such Principles, and by necessity of Nature must
still have.</p>
            <p>But since Mankind in general may expect to find in our esteem the
benefit of the <hi>presumption</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> viz. That every man is presumed to
be good, and that the high Births and Educations of Princes and the
great Examples of their Magnanimous Ancestors, may well pass as strong
presumptions of Nature against their doing any low ungenerous Acts of
Cruelty, and since in Gods great <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Magistracy</hi> an especial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

<hi>Who is with you in the Iudgment?</hi> and that therefore <hi>as Christ is said to
be present with those Officers he appointed in the Church, because there is a

likewise be expected a special presence Divine in the Administration of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy

               </hi> and presume ill of the future
Acting of any <hi>Heirs</hi> to Crowns: and particularly as to their believing
or practising any thing pernicious to their Realms.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Prince doth not deride <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3d (under
whom the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council was held) for telling it in the <hi>Canon Law</hi>
that <hi>the Papal Power is as much greater than the Imperial, as the Sun is
greater than the Moon,</hi> and at the Marginal <hi>Note</hi> there for saying <hi>That
the Papal Power exceeds the Imperial no less than</hi> 7744? There is a <hi>Prince</hi>
whose <hi>Emblem</hi> is the <hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and whose Power exceeds the Papal in every
ones account to more than that Proportion. And is it not therefore but
according to reason and common sense that we should believe that of all
men in any Realm, the Prince will be the latest brought to the belief of
that <hi>Papal</hi> Power so categorically asserted by that <hi>Council, That Kings may
be Excommunicated by their own Bishops for not obeying the Pope, and their
Subjects in such Case be absolved from their Oaths of Allegiance?</hi> Do not
all the <hi>French</hi> Kings, notwithstanding that <hi>Council,</hi> claim the liberty of so
much freedom from the <hi>Papal</hi> Power, that <hi>Popes</hi> can neither directly nor
indirectly command or ordain any thing concerning Temporal Matters
within their Dominions, and that neither the <hi>French</hi> King, nor his Realm,
nor his <hi>Officers</hi> can be <hi>Excommunicated</hi> or interdicted by the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor
his Subjects <hi>absolved</hi> from their Oath of Allegiance?</p>
            <p>As I have therefore in my Writing to a Noble <hi>Lord,</hi> one of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
<hi>Ministers,</hi> who was barbarously accused by one of the <hi>Plot-Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
for being a <hi>Papist,</hi> and designing to advance the <hi>Papal</hi> Power, said that I
would be the <hi>last</hi> man in <hi>England, who would believe he could be a Papist,</hi>
meaning it as impossible that he could believe or practise any irreligionary
<hi>Tenet</hi> of Popery, I will account it more impossible that any <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Prince now living in the World should favour the Usurpation of
the <hi>Papal</hi> Power, however any of the Popish Clergy or Layety in his
Realms might perhaps be addicted to favour the same.</p>
            <p>That great <hi>Affair</hi> of the <hi>Munster P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Catholick <hi>Crown'd</hi> Heads, agreeing perhaps in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
being a <hi>General</hi> one, did yet certainly agree together in the <hi>Year</hi>
1648 for <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calvinistick</hi> Princes and States and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
quietly possessing forever their Properties both in their <hi>Religions</hi>
and <hi>Estates,</hi> hath afforded the World an important <hi>Instance</hi> of Heavens so
far influencing the understandings of those Crown'd Heads, that they
thought not themselves obliged to put the <hi>Decree</hi> of that <hi>Council</hi> in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
by exterminating Hereticks, but to the contrary. And because
the Affair of that <hi>Peace</hi> and the great <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi> therein for the effect
aforesaid, have been scarce more taken Notice of here than the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
in <hi>China,</hi> and that the notification of the same may advance the
measures of our Duty by <hi>Internal</hi> Communion, and help to <hi>un-blunder</hi>
some of our <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestants in their fancying it so necessary for the
quiet of Christendom, that Christian Princes and their Subjects should
agree in the belief of the Speculative points of Religion, I intend to take
an opportunity to publish some Account of the same.</p>
            <p>I account my having thus largely dilated on the <hi>Moral Offices</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
hath tended to corroborate this my 8th <hi>Conclusion.</hi> I am here conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants

in the great <hi>Court of Conscience,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> whose <hi>Seat</hi> is in the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical</hi>
and not <hi>Speculative</hi> intellect, and the great things of which it holds
<hi>Plea</hi> are, as <hi>Sanderson</hi> tells us, <hi>Actus morales particulares proprii:</hi> and
therefore particular urging of <hi>Records,</hi> against which lies no averment,
is not more pertinent in <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> than of <hi>Moral</hi> Offices in this.
And moreover I observing in this <hi>Conjuncture</hi> when many mens zeal hath
been so hot against the <hi>Speculative</hi> points of <hi>Popery,</hi> which disturb not
<hi>Civil</hi> Society, that yet they have <hi>believed</hi> the more pernicious <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
of it, and would have practised the same, viz. <hi>The founding Dominion
in Grace,</hi> and that tho they have been altogether neglect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul of their
<hi>Actus morales particulares proprii,</hi> they have both presumed to judge
<hi>dishonourably</hi> and <hi>rashly</hi> of the <hi>Actings</hi> of others, and to trouble the
World not only with their Anxiety about the <hi>Acts</hi> of Kings and Princes,
but the <hi>Actus Dei,</hi> and his illuminating Princes understandings with the
Heavenly Mysteries, I have thought this discoursing of our <hi>Moral</hi> Offices
as aforesaid, the more <hi>a Propos</hi> and seasonable, as tending to fortify the
rationality of this 8th <hi>Conclusion,</hi> by exposing the <hi>absurdity</hi> of a <hi>respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>
or <hi>conditional</hi> Loyalty, a <hi>Loyalty</hi> that any Christian who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
these <hi>Oaths</hi> shall think sufficient, doth most certainly take the name
of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and Protestancy and of Christianity, and even of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>vain:</hi>
and as the <hi>Scripture</hi> implies that there is a <hi>Repentance</hi> to be <hi>repented of,</hi>
I shall say that such a mans <hi>Protestancy</hi> is to be <hi>protested</hi> against. And
when we consider that the Presbyterian <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>EXERCITATION</hi>
beforementioned, hath in <hi>p.</hi> 41. with so much Loyalty and Reason told
us in terms, <hi>That Obedience is owing to Princes without condition of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or Iustice on their part performed, and the</hi> Scripture <hi>is clear for an
irrespective and (in regard of the Rulers Demeanor) absolute subjection.</hi>
Exod. 20. 12. 21. 25. Rom. 13. 1, 2, &amp;c. Tit. 3. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 1 Sam.
24. 6, 7. 26. 9, 10, 11. Jer. 27. 12. 29. 7. Matth. 22. 21. and hath told

and irrespective, and run without</hi> ifs <hi>or</hi> ands <hi>in like manner as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Subjects Allegiance to their Sovereign is irrespective according to
Divine Institution,</hi> methinks it should make any <hi>Son</hi> of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> to <hi>start</hi> at the <hi>thought</hi> of his being out-done in <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and
sworn Allegiance by a Covenanting <hi>Presbyterian</hi> (for such that <hi>Author</hi>
was) and at the <hi>thought</hi> of any ones having taken those <hi>Oaths</hi> relating
to the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> and afterward <hi>interlining</hi> the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of them with <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands,</hi> and at the <hi>thought</hi> of such an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation</hi>
not appearing as ill in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> as any would do
in a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the truth is the Church of <hi>England</hi> appearing in this late Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary
<hi>Fermentation,</hi> to have so incorporated this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>absolute</hi>
and <hi>irrespective</hi> Loyalty into its Constitution beyond any other <hi>Church</hi>
in the World, and likewise the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Charity and Moderation toward
all Christians, whether Foreigners or Domesticks, whether whole Churches or
single Persons</hi> (as Primate <hi>Bramhal</hi>'s words are) that the same doth now
(as I may say) strike the Eyes of all indifferent men and enforce it self
on the thoughts of any who do but for Curiosity <hi>walk about this</hi> Sion <hi>and
go round about her and tell the Towers thereof,</hi> I mean do consider its
<hi>Prayers, Homilies, Articles, Canons and</hi> Ecclesiastical <hi>Constitutions,</hi> it
hath hereby been necessarily made like the <hi>Eagle</hi> to <hi>renew its youth,</hi> and
to be invigorated as with a new <hi>Soul</hi> after its Enemies thought it dead
or asleep, and after Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s shrewd <hi>guessing</hi> that after the <hi>Year</hi> 1677.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:103047:218"/>
               <hi>That what followed would be likely to be small joy to them who should behold
it.</hi> For the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>irrespective</hi> Loyalty being <hi>Essential</hi>
to the Peace of Kingdoms, and likely to be so more and more to the
Worlds end, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> appearing as by consent of
<hi>Parties</hi> to be <hi>THE Church</hi> that overtowers all others in the <hi>Principles</hi>
for <hi>THAT Sort</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as well as in the <hi>august</hi> Principles of <hi>Charity</hi>
for all Christians; according to the saying of <hi>Magnes amoris amor,</hi> it must

any Church or People love themselves and cannot be preserved but by
<hi>Loyalty,</hi> Nature will direct the World to a <hi>growing</hi> love for the Church
of <hi>England:</hi> and therefore I am no <hi>Visionaire</hi> in predicting from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Causes, <hi>That what shall follow to the Church of</hi> England <hi>will be great
joy to those who shall behold it,</hi> to the very end of time. And nothing
could possibly in my opinion have brought it to this firm State of its
Glory, but the disloyal <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of some of its Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
and particularly the just and dreadful apprehensions given to
considerate men upon some Nominal <hi>Protestants</hi> and Nominal <hi>Property<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
having founded <hi>Dominion in Grace,</hi> and yet having reproached the
Church of <hi>England</hi> and its <hi>Divines</hi> with <hi>Popery,</hi> and invited the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<hi>Mobile</hi> to make a <hi>Schism</hi> from it on such an account, and printed
many Seditious <hi>Pamphlets</hi> for the Establishing the <hi>IF, or AND-Loyalty,</hi> or
indeed which is all one, an absolute <hi>Disloyalty,</hi> and in such a Conjuncture,
when it would have been not more pernicious to the particular <hi>Souls</hi> of
the <hi>Disloyal</hi> than to the <hi>Body</hi> of the whole Nation, and to the State of
<hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus through the <hi>Divine</hi> Omnipotence, which can bring good out
of evil, hath our late <hi>Fermentation</hi> been made <hi>perfective</hi> to our <hi>Church,</hi>
as well as the Hereditary <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>God's</hi> governing
the World by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Lusts</hi> of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> been
here exemplified: and as the <hi>Air</hi> that is the <hi>Steem</hi> of the dull <hi>Earth,</hi>
or the <hi>Textura halituum terrae,</hi> as <hi>Gassendus</hi> calls it, is made by nature to
be the Vehicle of those Beams of the Sun that dazle our Eyes; thus have
the <hi>Fumes,</hi> exhaled by such mens <hi>Lusts</hi> of Disloyalty and Malice that
<hi>darken'd</hi> their own understandings (and would have obscured the glory
of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) been made instrumental in dispersing its
brightness through the World, and even in the opening of the Eyes of
many to behold it with amazement; and that service hath been done
our Church thereby, which by all the <hi>Pens</hi> of its <hi>Iewel</hi> and <hi>Hooker</hi> and
<hi>Sanderson</hi> could never be effected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> that had so much the <hi>Carriage</hi> and the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> till
the <hi>Munster Peace</hi> of 48, could bear the <hi>Civil</hi> War after 41, and breathe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it and flourish after it; but as the State of the World abroad and at
home now is and likely to be, our <hi>ALL</hi> must depend upon the Principles
and Practice of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and therefore this new Soul I spake of as now ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
the Church of <hi>England</hi> must be immortal, and it may well say
to it self under any Prince that can come, <hi>Soul take thy ease, thou hast
Loyalty and the Principles of it laid up for many years,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> did
not before 48 more excel other <hi>Realms</hi> in <hi>Trade,</hi> than its Church doth

and propping up his <hi>honourable</hi> thoughts of his Prince with a Quotation
out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> viz. That <hi>he was not to be reckon'd among Hereticks who
without pertinacy defended his opinion tho erroneous,</hi> &amp;c I think the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up so great a Picture in publick view, wherein that <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did
with such exquisite draught, design, and colour thus paint his <hi>Princes</hi>

useful: and the very sight of the great <hi>Colours</hi> in which cannot methinks

            <p>I have mentioned it that there is less danger of any Princes believing
or practising what may favour the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpation than of such Belief
or Practice in a Subject, and it were an easie matter to instance in many
erroneous Religionary <hi>Tenets,</hi> which as held by Parties among <hi>Subjects</hi>
may cause general apprehensions of danger, but from which as held by a

do dissipate all danger from any Errors within them. Tho in mens
beliefs who are <hi>Subjects, Religionary</hi> Errors are often complicated with
<hi>Irreligionary</hi> ones, yet we are to think of the <hi>Oyl</hi> of the Lords <hi>Annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

the <hi>Fumes</hi> of them in the minds of Princes, and are to fear no more harm

honour of our King, <hi>as an Angel of God to discern between good and bad,</hi>
Religion and Irreligion: and it is an <hi>absurd</hi> thing for any not to imitate
the Popish <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> aforesaid in clearing his <hi>Prince,</hi> tho of another
Communion, from <hi>Pertinacy,</hi> since such a <hi>Moral</hi> defect is a <hi>humour</hi> of <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiveness,</hi>
that of all men Kings are most naturally free from, and whose
becoming dissidence of their own understandings how great soever, is
Conspicuous by the wearing away so much of their lives in hearing the
<hi>advise</hi> of their <hi>Council.</hi> And when ever <hi>Passive</hi> Obedience is called for
by Princes and must be readily payed as a due Debt, we are even then to
<hi>strain</hi> our most improved thoughts to find an honourable Interpretation
of our Princes Actions, in like manner as some of the Loyal <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
to the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church have done, as appears by a <hi>Great</hi> Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>
               <hi>This, This</hi> is <hi>Loyalty</hi> worthy the name of <hi>Christian;</hi> and after all if yet
any men will make wanton <hi>Suppositions</hi> of the <hi>beliefs</hi> or <hi>practices</hi> of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns
being never so contrary to Religion, let those know that an <hi>absolute</hi>
and <hi>irrespective</hi> Loyalty is that which by these Oaths they have obliged
themselves to: and that therefore it is an absurd thing to attempt to
exclude any <hi>Heir</hi> of the Crown from his Birth-right on any pretence of
his Religion or other pretence whatsoever, since we must pay an absolute
Obedience and Allegiance to him immediately on the Descent of the
Crown to him, and accordingly as by these <hi>Oaths</hi> we have obliged our
selves to do.</p>

Having thus in these <hi>Conclusions</hi> asserted the <hi>Obligation</hi> relating to our
Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> as resulting from the plain and genuine <hi>Sense</hi>
of the words in the <hi>Oaths,</hi> altho it is a common, sure <hi>Rule,</hi> That <hi>Verba
ubi sunt expressa, voluntatis supervacanea est quaestio,</hi> yet I shall <hi>ex super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundanti</hi>
choose to corroborate such my Assertion by laying down this
as my 9th and last <hi>Conclusion,</hi> that it is manifest that it was the Law-givers
<hi>intention</hi> to bind the Takers of these <hi>Oaths,</hi> not only <hi>to bear true Faith
and Allegiance</hi> to his Majesty, but to his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> in the Due
and Legal Course of Descent, as I have before expressed.</p>
            <p>It need not be much dilated on, that <hi>Relations</hi> are <hi>Minimae entitatis,</hi>
but <hi>Maximae efficaciae:</hi> and that, <hi>Liberi sunt quasi partes &amp; appendices

                  </gap>ei veritate,</hi> and that
in the framing of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and the designing the Obligations
to arise thence, the King had a necessary regard to <hi>natural</hi> affection, and
to the preservation of the Hereditary Monarchy in the Line of his <hi>Heirs</hi>
and <hi>Successors:</hi> and suitably to what is expressed in the <hi>Preamble</hi> of the
<hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 22. viz. <hi>That since it is the natural inclination of
every man gladly and willingly to provide for the surety of both his Title and
Succession, altho it touch his only private Cause, we therefore reckon our
selves much more bound to beseech and instant your Highness to foresee and
provide for the PRESENT surety of both you and of your most lawful
Succession and Heirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor need it be much insisted on, that 'tis natural for every Government
to defend and preserve it self: and to this purpose the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation</hi>
cites <hi>Alsted</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine, and likewise <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Dudley
Fenner,</hi> for maintaining the lawfulness of what the old <hi>Athenian</hi> famous
<hi>Oath</hi> enjoyned for the preservation of its <hi>Polity,</hi> namely, of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Person killing any Usurper, or one who without a lawful Title for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
invaded the Government. The <hi>Athenians</hi> had several <hi>Oaths</hi> of a high
nature, by the Religion of which they tyed themselves to defend their
Government: and one was the <hi>Iusjurandum epheborum,</hi> which they took
when 20 years old, and which is set down in <hi>Petitus</hi> his Noble <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi>
on the <hi>Athenian</hi> Laws, and part of which as rendered by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Latin,</hi> is, <hi>Patriam liberis non relinquam in deteriore sed potius in meliore
statu. Navigabo ad terram eamque colam, quantulacunque illa sit quae ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda
mihi tradetur. Parebo legibus quae obtinent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>quod si quis leges

famous</hi> one I referred to: but 'tis the other of which the <hi>formula</hi> is set
down in <hi>Petitus</hi> there, p. 232, 233. and which beginneth with <hi>Occidam

aut eâ eversê Magistratum gerat, Atheniensium hostis esto, impunèque

            <p>To secure their Government forever from future Usurpation was the
intent of that terrible <hi>Oath:</hi> and to secure the Government of the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary</hi>
Monarchy here was the intent of our gentle ones, and sufficiently
favouring of the <hi>Mansuetudo Evangelii,</hi> and which Oaths, however bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> was made) take notice, that by many particular
matters then obvious to all mens thoughts, it appeared worthy of the
wisdom of the Government then to provide for the security both of his
Majesty and of the <hi>Succession</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any who shall read <hi>D' Ossat</hi>'s Letters will find the various deep designs
there opened, that related to several Foreign Princes and Potentates Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
of the Power that <hi>England</hi> would have in the balance of the
World, by the uniting of the strength of <hi>Scotland</hi> to it upon the rightful
Succession of King <hi>Iames</hi> to the Monarchy: and perhaps rather out of
a design to <hi>amuse</hi> them than out of an humour to put by the thoughts of
Mortality, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did shew so much unwillingness sometimes
to hear and speak of her <hi>Successor.</hi> And during the constrained <hi>Altum si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentium</hi>
of the <hi>Succession</hi> then here, a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>the Succession</hi> was writ by
Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> and which made noise enough in the World, as those
Letters mention, and by which <hi>Book</hi> the Author intended that our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Monarchy should be Thunder struck, especially with the help
of the Papal <hi>Breves</hi> that came here to obstruct the <hi>Succession.</hi> King
<hi>Iames</hi> at the end of his <hi>Premonition to all Christian Monarchs,</hi> printing
<hi>a Catalogue of the Lyes of</hi> Tortus (<hi>i. e.</hi> Bellarmin) <hi>with a brief Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them,</hi> refers to one <hi>Lye</hi> of <hi>Tortus,</hi> p. 47, viz. <hi>In which words [of
the</hi> Breves <hi>of</hi> Clement <hi>the 8th] not only King</hi> James <hi>of</hi> Scotland <hi>was not
EXCLVDED, but included rather:</hi> and the <hi>Confutation</hi> is thus, viz. <hi>If
the</hi> Breves <hi>of</hi> Clement <hi>did not exclude me from the Kingdom, but rather
did include me, why did</hi> Garnet <hi>burn them? Why would he not reserve
them that I might have seen them, that so he might have obtained more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at my hands for him and his Catholicks?</hi> And that <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for the Oath of Allegiance,</hi> p. 29. refers to <hi>the two</hi> Breves <hi>which</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Octavus <hi>sent to</hi> England <hi>immediately before Queen</hi> Elizabeth's <hi>Death,
debarring him from the Crown, or any other that either would profess or any

Vows and Protestations</hi> Simul &amp; eodem tempore <hi>and, as it were, delivered</hi>
uno &amp; eodem spiritu <hi>to divers of his Majesty's Ministers abroad, professing such
kindness and shewing such forwardness to advance his Majesty to the</hi> English
<hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any one who reads in <hi>D' Ossat</hi> the inclination of that Pope to Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Practices of this kind, will not wonder at his Majesty's thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
his <hi>Vn-holyness:</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Breves</hi> is sufficiently there

            <p>That Great King was sufficiently acquainted with the Principles and
Practices of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> that had been so injurious to <hi>Hereditary</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.
He knew that a Popish Parliament in <hi>England</hi> had shewed
their Abhorrence of the Pope's being somewhat like an <hi>Excluder-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
of Kings, and an Arbitrary one too, as appeared by the <hi>Words</hi> in the
<hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. viz. <hi>The Pope contrary to the inviolable Grants of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions
by God immediately to Emperors and Kings, hath presumed to
invest who should please him to inherit in other mens Kingdoms and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:103047:221"/>
which we your Loyal Subjects Spiritual and Temporal abhor and detest:</hi>
and the practices at <hi>Rome</hi> for King <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Exclusion</hi> had made deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in his thoughts. As he was a Prince of great <hi>Reading</hi> he could
not but know particularly the many Anti-Monarchical <hi>Tenets</hi> that were
published by many Popish <hi>Commentators,</hi> positive Writers, <hi>School-men,
Canonists,</hi> and never censured by any <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> tho yet several
Popish <hi>Authors</hi> who asserted the Power of Kings were so <hi>censured,</hi> and
particularly <hi>Bodin de Republicâ:</hi> and he could not be ignorant of Popes
having required several Crowned Heads to swear Fidelity to them and
their <hi>Successors,</hi> and that particularly the Pope sent <hi>Hubertus</hi> to require
<hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and who magnanimously refused so to do: and that the <hi>Papacy</hi>
endeavoured to root its Power in the World by obliging men in their
Oaths of Fidelity to any particular Pope, to swear the same likewise to
his <hi>Successors,</hi> according to the common Style in those <hi>Oaths,</hi> viz. <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
&amp; obediens ero Domino Papae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; suis successoribus:</hi> and that thus
too the <hi>Oath</hi> of all Popish <hi>Bishops</hi> at their Consecration runs; and that
the Great <hi>Austrian</hi> Family had not more carefully secured to it self the
Scepters of the <hi>Empire</hi> by the Constitution of a <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> than
the <hi>Papacy</hi> had made Provision of that King's being sworn that he would
from that time be a <hi>Protector</hi> and <hi>Defender</hi> of the Pope and Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> according to those <hi>words</hi> in the Oath as I find it set down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
viz. <hi>Ego N. Rex Romanorum FVTVRVS Imperator, promitto, spondeo,

desensorem fore summi Pontisicis &amp; sanctae Ecclesiae Romanae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He had moreover considered the great <hi>Fermentation</hi> in the minds of
so many Loyal People in <hi>England,</hi> by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s being so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
as She was in the business of the Succession, and which as Dr.
<hi>Matthew Hulton</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi> mentioned in a memorable <hi>Sermon</hi>
he preached before her at <hi>White-Hall, Gave hopes to Foreigners to attempt
fresh Invasions, and bred fears in many of her Subjects of a new Conquest,</hi>
and who thereupon very loyally said then, <hi>The only way in Policy left to
quell those hopes and asswage those fears were to Establish the Succession, and
at last intimating as far as he durst</hi> (saith my Author) <hi>the nearness of
Blood of our present Sovereign,</hi> he said plainly, <hi>That the expectations and
presages of all Writers went Northward, naming without any Circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
Scotland. There is an <hi>Abstract</hi> of this <hi>Loyal</hi> and Learned <hi>Sermon</hi>
(and which <hi>throughout</hi> pointed at the <hi>Succession</hi>) in the <hi>History of some
of the Bishops of</hi> England <hi>in the time of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, printed in the
<hi>Year</hi> 1653: and the fate of the Sermon was such that tho perhaps it
tickled not the Ears of that Queen, it so far touched her Conscience that
the <hi>Historian</hi> saith, <hi>She opened the Window of her Closet and gave the Arch-Bishop</hi>
thanks for it.</p>
            <p>No doubt but <hi>Parsons</hi> saying in his <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Succession,</hi> That <hi>he
thought the Affair about it could not be ended, without some War,</hi> did much
heighten the Popular Fears of War happening thereupon: and 'tis most
probable the long fear of War in that <hi>Fermentation</hi> did variously wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Kingdom. Nor is it a new thought for the long <hi>fears</hi> of War
to be held to bear some proportion to the mischief of War it self, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
Trade and Commerce; insomuch that several <hi>Writers</hi> of the
<hi>Regalia</hi> and <hi>fiscal</hi> matters among the <hi>Tractatus Illustrium,</hi> have told us,
That <hi>Quando timor belli idem operatur quod ipsum bellum, remissio sit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductoribus,</hi>
(i. e. of the <hi>Revenue</hi>) and hath Entituled them to <hi>defalca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

We may imagine by the just effects of our late <hi>Fermentation,</hi>
what the state of the <hi>Body</hi> Politick was in that, namely, like the state
of long tormenting <hi>anguish</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> natural upon the pricking of an
<hi>Artery,</hi> and importing often more trouble and danger than the cutting
of one. And by the great triumphant <hi>Flame</hi> of joy appearing in the <hi>Act</hi> of
<hi>Recognition</hi> in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time, (and which appears in our <hi>Statute-Book,</hi>

all the Loyal People of <hi>England</hi> were on his coming to the Crown:
and as <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> saith of <hi>Nerva</hi>'s adopting <hi>Trajan, It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it should have pleased all when it was done, except it had pleased all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the Hereditary Monarchy, viz. <hi>A Recognition, that the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is

that the Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>may not be joyned in the

            <p>And indeed that <hi>England</hi> is at this day preserved not only from the
danger of being overbalanced by <hi>France,</hi> but from the loss of its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
figure of <hi>balancing</hi> the World, must highly be attributed to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary</hi>
Monarchy being fixt in the Line of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and to <hi>Scotland</hi>
being thrown into the <hi>Scales</hi> as was said: and if any one shall tell me
by the way, that the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was prejudicial to <hi>Loyalty</hi> in
41, I shall answer him, that its <hi>weight</hi> hath in this <hi>present</hi> Conjuncture
of 81 afforded Loyalty so great a Compensation by that late <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
there acknowledging and asserting the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Succession,</hi> &amp;c.
and which begins thus, viz. <hi>The Estates of Parliament considering that

alone, do succeed lineally thereunto according to the known Degrees of Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> that had formerly, by reason of the uncertainty of the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi>
being like the <hi>Erratica Delos,</hi> a floating Island, and that too in Seas
of Blood, and did then appear like it afterward, fixed and blessed with a
Pacifick and <hi>Oracular</hi> King, and as strong a Foundation for the Hereditary
Monarchy as could be wished, was shortly after in danger of being again
unfixed by the Outrage of the <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> Treason, and the <hi>Principles</hi>
that legitimated that practice, being <hi>really believed and practised;</hi> and
an account of the practice of which Treason we have in the <hi>Statute</hi> of
3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Iacobi c.</hi> 2. as likewise of the fiery <hi>Principles</hi> that animated the <hi>Actors</hi>
to it in <hi>Thuanus;</hi> and in King <hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>Premonition to all Christian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,</hi>
p. 10. a general reference is made to <hi>the violent bloody Maxims
that the Powder-Traytors maintained:</hi> and by occasion whereof after the
designed outrage against the <hi>Lineal</hi> Succession of the <hi>Prince</hi> and the
Hereditary Monarchy being in danger while such bloody Principles and
<hi>Maxims</hi> were not exterminated, it was in ordinary prudence requisite to
apply the extraordinary Remedy of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> to rivet that
Fundamental <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> the stronger in Nature, viz. <hi>That the
King never dies.</hi> And the <hi>Addition</hi> of those words in the <hi>Promissory</hi> Clause
of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> viz. <hi>HIS or THEIR Persons, THEIR Crown
and Dignity,</hi> and which <hi>words</hi> were not in the <hi>Oath</hi> of Supremacy, was a
plain indication of the <hi>intention</hi> of the Law-givers to tye Mens Souls
to the Hereditary Monarchy in the Due and Legal Course of Descent.</p>
            <p>And moreover with a prospect to mens having a conscientious regard
to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> then
probably in the <hi>Preface</hi> of the <hi>Collect</hi> in the <hi>Common-prayer</hi> for the <hi>Prince</hi>
and the <hi>King's Children,</hi> as overjoyed with the sight of <hi>King</hi> James<hi>'s being
enriched with a most Royal Progeny</hi> (as the words in the Act of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition
are) did cause these words to be inserted, <hi>Who art the Father of
thine Elect and of their SEED.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Act</hi> requiring the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> hath in it
the expression of <hi>Loyalty and Allegiance unto the King's Majesty and the
CROWN of</hi> England, and mentions the design of the <hi>Gun-powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
as tending to <hi>the subversion of the whole State:</hi> and therefore if in the
ancient times of Popery (and when the <hi>Pope</hi> was generally revered here
as a 13th <hi>Apostle</hi>) upon any emergent Papal Usurpations which gave
just cause of apprehending future ones intended, and particularly in the
Case of the Pope's <hi>Mandates</hi> or <hi>Bulls,</hi> which were called <hi>Gratiae expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivae</hi>
or <hi>provisiones,</hi> and pretendedly issued out of the Pope's pious care to see
a Church provided of a <hi>Successor</hi> before it needed, our Kings did think
themselves obliged to provide Statutes against <hi>Provisors,</hi> whereby the <hi>Ius
patronatus</hi> was secured to them and their Subjects, and by <hi>Statutes</hi> of
<hi>Praemunire</hi> did as it were build <hi>Forts</hi> before the Enemies coming, the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniment</hi>
of the Hereditary Monarchy by the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> was
most necessary to prevent any <hi>Papal Gratiae expectativae</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi>
and the Popes impious care to provide a <hi>Successor</hi> to its Hereditary
Rights. The <hi>Premuniment</hi> of some <hi>Laws</hi> by others is no new thing nor

Succession of the Crown, was no less necessary: and King <hi>Iames</hi>'s set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>Premonition</hi> in the minds of his own Subjects, was but natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
previous to his <hi>Premonition</hi> sent abroad to Foreign <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how far <hi>Harry</hi> the 7th's <hi>Statute</hi> by which <hi>no Person who should
serve the King for the time being,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should therefore be attainted or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,</hi>
might induce the Government to secure the undoubted Rights
of Succession, by the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> being framed as it was, and
rooting our <hi>Loyalty</hi> thereby the deeper into our <hi>Consciences,</hi> and by the
fear of our being justly <hi>impeached</hi> in the Court of Conscience <hi>in omnem
eventum,</hi> if we defended not those Rights of Succession, is obvious to
Consideration.</p>
            <p>As I have thus in this <hi>Conclusion</hi> shewed that it was the Law-givers
<hi>intention,</hi> particularly in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to oblige us to pay our
<hi>Allegiance</hi> not only to the King, but to his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> in the
Legal Course of Descent, so I might here further <hi>Ex superabundanti</hi>
dilate on such <hi>intention</hi> being to secure the same without any respect to
the <hi>Religion</hi> of such <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors.</hi> A Prince of such profound
Learning and Observation as King <hi>Iames</hi> could not be ignorant of what
hath been since, by the Loyal <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Succession,</hi> so clearly and
strongly asserted, viz. That <hi>the Succession to the Crown is inseparably
annext to the Proximity of Blood by the Laws of GOD and NATVRE,
and That</hi> Statute-Laws <hi>contrariant to those are</hi> null and void, <hi>and
That the Hereditary Monarchy was indisputably founded on inherent Birth-right
according to the</hi> Style <hi>of the Act of Recognition,</hi> and not any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary
<hi>Regeneration, and That the accession of the Crown purgeth all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that that Prince did by the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> design only to
<hi>twist</hi> the <hi>Band</hi> of our <hi>natural</hi> Allegiance the stronger (an <hi>Allegiance</hi>
tyed not to Princes Faith of the <hi>Cross,</hi> but to their <hi>Crown</hi>) appears
throughout his <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> He likewise in his
<hi>Premonition to all Christian Monarchs,</hi> p. 9. doth with some warmth of
words reflect on <hi>the Malice of some who impudently affirm, That the Oath of
Allegiance was devised for deceiving and entrapping of Papists in point of
Conscience:</hi> and saith, That <hi>tho the House of Commons at the first framing
of the Oath made it to contain, That the Pope had no Power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
me, which I caused them to reform, only making it to conclude that no
Excommunication of the Popes can warrant my Subjects to practise against
my Person or State,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so careful was I that nothing should be contained in
this Oath except the profession of Natural Allegiance, and Civil and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Obedience, with a promise to resist to all contrary uncivil violence.</hi> From
thence it appears that what looked like the <hi>Religionary</hi> part of Popery,
namely, the <hi>Pope's</hi> exercising a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Power against him, or the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
as <hi>Aquinas</hi> delivers it, That there is <hi>Potestas in summo Pontifice puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi
omnes mortales ratione delicti,</hi> he intended not to whet the sharpness
of the <hi>Oath</hi> against, but only against the <hi>Irreligionary</hi> part of <hi>Popery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned,
and as to which he might rationally depend on the Zeal
of any <hi>Heir</hi> or <hi>Successor</hi> tho <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick concurring with his there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

He having in the foregoing <hi>Page</hi> mentioned how <hi>that Parliament that
was to have been blown up, made some new Laws against Papists,</hi> saith,
<hi>So far hath my Heart and Government been from any bitterness as almost
never one of those sharp Additions to the former Laws have ever yet been
put in Execution.</hi> The Execution of some Laws of <hi>pecuniary</hi> Mulcts on
<hi>Papists</hi> who in that Conjuncture <hi>believed</hi> the irreligionary part of the
<hi>Papal</hi> Power, might seem to carry such a Face of Justice with it, as
the practice of the <hi>Custom-house</hi> doth pursuant to the 13th and 14th of
<hi>Harry</hi> the 8th, <hi>c. 4. Whereby any</hi> English <hi>man or born Subject of</hi> England,
<hi>who shall swear Obeysance or live as Subjects to any Foreign Prince shall pay
Aliens Customs:</hi> but 'tis a <hi>madness</hi> to think of any <hi>Prince's</hi> abdicating his
Temporal Power, and swearing Temporal Obeysance to any one, and no
man but he who has <hi>Laesa principia,</hi> can suppose that King <hi>Iames,</hi> who
avowed in his <hi>Premonition, That no man in his time or the late Queens ever
died for his Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet any Priests after their taking Orders beyond
Sea, without some other guilt in them than their bare coming home,</hi> and who
<hi>p.</hi> 16. of his <hi>Apology</hi> avows and <hi>maintains to his own knowledge, that Queen</hi>
Elizabeth <hi>never punished any Papists for Religion, but that their punishment
was ever extorted out of her hands against her will by their own mis-beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
could ever intend that by the withdrawing of Allegiance from
any of his <hi>Heirs</hi> in the Course of their Lineal Succession, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of any of their <hi>Religionary</hi> Notions or other pretence or ground
whatsoever, there should be a <hi>solutio continui</hi> or political death inflicted
on the <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchy, by the preserving of which the lives of
all the People of <hi>England</hi> could only be preserved.</p>
            <p>He in his <hi>Premonition</hi> and <hi>Apology</hi> discharged the <hi>Moral</hi> Offices of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
all men,</hi> with relation to <hi>Papists</hi> his Subjects, and judgeth some
of them to be of <hi>quiet dispositions and good Subjects,</hi> and in p. 3, 4. 46, 47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
48. of his <hi>Apology,</hi> he makes a difference between <hi>many of his Popish
Subjects who retained in their hearts the print of their natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Powder-Traytors were,</hi> and useth the expression of <hi>quietly minded Papists,
and Papists, tho peradventure zealous in their Religion, yet otherwise civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honest and good Subjects:</hi> and acknowledgeth, That <hi>his Mother, altho
she continued in that Religion wherein she was nourished, yet was so far from
being superstitious or</hi> jesuited <hi>therein, that at his baptism (tho he was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by a Popish Arch-Bishop) she sent him word to forbear to use the spittle in
his Baptism, which was obeyed:</hi> and in his <hi>Premonition</hi> speaking to Roman
<hi>Catholick Princes and wishing them to search the Scriptures, and ground their
Faith upon their own certain knowledge, and not on the Report of others,</hi>
since every man must be safe by his own Faith: <hi>but leaving this to God
his Merciful Providence in his due time,</hi> he further wisheth them <hi>to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their Noble Predecessors, who in the days of greatest blindness, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times courageously oppose themselves to the encroaching Ambition of Popes:</hi>
and acknowledgeth, That <hi>some of their Kingdoms have in all Ages maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and without interruption enjoyed their liberty against the most ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Popes,</hi> &amp;c. and saith, That <hi>some of those Princes have constantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
and maintained their lawful freedom to their immortal honour:</hi> and
concludes his <hi>Premonition</hi> with <hi>earnest Prayers to the Almighty for their
prosperities, and that after their happy Temporal Reigns on Earth, they
may live and Reign in Heaven with him forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Learned <hi>King</hi> did sufficiently thereby Proclaim himself an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the Papal <hi>Tenet</hi> of <hi>founding Dominion in Grace,</hi> as to those <hi>Foreign</hi>

Popish Princes, and could not therefore but more abhor the effects of it
in the Case of his <hi>Hereditary</hi> Successors; and he having judged that
those Foreign Princes who owned the Religionary <hi>Tenets</hi> of Popery, did
yet <hi>constantly defend and maintain their lawful freedom from all Papal
Vsurpations to their immortal honour,</hi> and with so devout a Charity pray'd
for <hi>their happy Temporal Reigns on Earth, and that they may live and
reign in Heaven afterward,</hi> could not but suppose that any of his Heirs
who might be of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Communion would yet disown
any <hi>Tenet</hi> of Popery that was <hi>irreligionary,</hi> and would <hi>Exterminate</hi> all
Papal <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> and that they might here expect a <hi>happy Reign on
Earth,</hi> and a <hi>happier</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> hereafter, <hi>leaving it to God to open their
Eyes</hi> (as aforesaid) in matters Religionary, and <hi>to render them fafe by
their own Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> in his <hi>Apology for the Oath of Allegiance</hi> doth <hi>incidenter,</hi>
prop up the Justice of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and in <hi>p.</hi> 49, 50, 51.
doth insert 14 contrary <hi>Conclusions</hi> to all the <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of which
the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> consists, to denote the <hi>absurdity</hi> of the opposing
that <hi>Oath:</hi> and which <hi>Conclusions</hi> tho many <hi>Clerical</hi> and <hi>Lay-Papists</hi> among
his Subjects might maintain, yet he might well think it Morally impossible
for a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Prince here to do so: and he gives a very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the inducing any one so to judge of his measures, viz. <hi>That those
Conclusions were never concluded and defined by any compleat General Council to
belong to the Pope's Authority: and their own School Doctors are at irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
odds and jarrs about them.</hi> He had then his Eye on the <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council as appears by the other words there in the <hi>Margent,</hi> viz. <hi>Touching
the PRETENDED Council of LATERAN,</hi> See <hi>Plat. in vitâ Innocen.</hi> 3. and
by which <hi>Council</hi> the King knew that all except <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> of those <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions</hi>
were concluded and <hi>defined.</hi> If therefore many of the poor pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>School-Doctors</hi> were so searless of the <hi>Papal</hi> Thunder, as in Cases
when they were perhaps unconcerned to impeach the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpation,
there was no cause of apprehension in that our wise Monarch that any of
his High-born <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> would ever favour the Usurpations of
that Authority.</p>
            <p>When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was so firmly satisfied concerning the <hi>Loyalty</hi>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick <hi>Lords</hi> Temporal, and of their great <hi>Quota</hi> in
the <hi>balance</hi> of the Kingdom securing their abhorrence of all <hi>Papal</hi> Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,
as not to impose the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> on them, (tho yet She
took care to have it imposed on the Popish <hi>Bishops</hi>) can we imagine
that the great Interest of an <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> in the <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
did not give a <hi>Pleropho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y</hi> of satisfaction to that Great Monarch,
that such an <hi>Heir</hi> would never permit any Usurpation to prejudice his

            <p>Moreover if in the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>device</hi> of an Inheritance by <hi>Will</hi> on
the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Legatees</hi> not holding this or that Philosophical or
Religionary <hi>Tenet,</hi> the <hi>absurdity</hi> of such Condition would not frustrate
the device, but would be taken as <hi>Pro non adjectâ,</hi> and that thus in that
known <hi>Case</hi> in the <hi>Digest,</hi> viz. <hi>Of an Heir made on an absurd Condition,</hi>
namely, <hi>On Condition he should throw the Testators ashes into the Sea, the

God and by inherent Birth-right) any such supposed absurd <hi>Condition</hi> of a

or the <hi>New Testament</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>) should be intended to operate to his

            <p>But that I may in a word <hi>perimere litem</hi> about that Kings never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the least prejudice to the Succession, by any of his <hi>Successors</hi> being <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Catholicks, I shall observe that that K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng who was so great and skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an <hi>Agonist,</hi> for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
did yet in the <hi>Articles</hi> of the proposed <hi>Match</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards
with that of <hi>France,</hi> agree that <hi>the Children of such Marriage should no
way be compelled or constrained in point of Conscience or Religion, and that
their Title to the Crown should not be prejudiced, in Case it should please
God they should prove</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks: and that the Laws against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
should not in the least touch them.</hi> And that the sense of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
then was likewise to that effect avowedly declared, is manifest
from the <hi>Passages</hi> of those times: and the needless quarrel therefore that
our late <hi>Excluders</hi> would have exposed us to with <hi>France,</hi> was a thing
worthy their considering.</p>
            <p>But enough of this <hi>Conclusion,</hi> if not too much: for where the <hi>Tide</hi>
of the <hi>Words</hi> of any <hi>Oath</hi> runs strong and clear, we need not to regard the
<hi>Wind</hi> of any Law-givers intention: however yet I have made it appear
for the redundant satisfaction of the <hi>scrupulous,</hi> that while they have
embarqued their Consciences in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se <hi>Oaths</hi> they have had such
Wind and Tide both together on their side: and that therefore any
<hi>Storms</hi> which the Takers of these Oaths relating to the <hi>Lineal</hi> Succession
of the Crown may have raised either in their <hi>Consciences</hi> or the <hi>State,</hi>
must be supposed to be very <hi>unnatural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus in the foregoing <hi>Conclusions</hi> asserted and proved the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
relating to the Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> as resulting from the <hi>Oaths</hi>
of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> I shall briefly answer such objections thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
or rather <hi>Scruples,</hi> (for they deserve not the name of <hi>Objections</hi>) as some
noisy <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestants have troubled themselves and others with, and
so end this <hi>Casuistical</hi> Discussion.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Objection</hi> or <hi>Scruple</hi> then I shall take notice of that some
have raised against the Obligation of these Oaths as above asserted,
is that they were made in relation to <hi>Papists</hi> only, and were enjoyned
to be taken for the discovery of those that were suspected to be so.</p>
            <p>As to which it will be sufficient to say, that it is most plain that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who have taken these or any other lawful <hi>Oaths,</hi> are bound by <hi>Deeds</hi>
to fullfil what they have sworn in <hi>Words:</hi> and it is an absurd thing to
doubt whether the Law intended that those Persons should observe the
<hi>Oaths,</hi> whom it hath enjoyned to take them. And to this purpose we
are well taught by Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his 6th <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>Oaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That
<hi>tho Papal Vsurpation was the cause of the Oath of Supremacy, (the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
to himself the exercise of Supreme Iurisdiction</hi> in spiritualibus,
<hi>throughout this Kingdom) yet the</hi> Oath <hi>is Obligatory according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words in the utmost Latitude: the reàson is, that the intention of a
Law is general to provide against all Future inconveniences of the like kind
or nature,</hi> &amp;c. I <hi>refer</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> to him there at large.</p>
            <p>By the Measures of that <hi>Bishop</hi> as to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
may direct our selves in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> being Obligatory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>express words in the utmost Latitude,</hi> tho that <hi>Oath</hi> was
made by occasion of the <hi>Gun-powder</hi> Treason.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>intent</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> tells us in

            <p>The <hi>Sect</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s old Enemies in <hi>Scotland</hi> the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and
whom he said <hi>he found there more dishonest than the Highlanders and Border

being participants in the <hi>Gun-powder</hi> Treason, did with Justice as well as
perhaps with hopes of their emendation after the <hi>Tenets</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> that
had been then lately published by the <hi>English Non-Conformists,</hi> order
that <hi>Sect</hi> not to be in that Book marked <hi>Nigro carbone.</hi> But he could
not but know their former <hi>Principles</hi> as well as <hi>Practices</hi> here as exactly
as any one: and in his <hi>Canons</hi> here published a <hi>Year</hi> before the <hi>Gun-powder</hi>
Treason, <hi>The impugners of the Rites and Ceremonies in the Church of</hi>
England <hi>were variously censured; the Authors of Schism in the Church of</hi>
England <hi>were censured by the 9th Canon, and the maintainers of Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
by the 10th, and by the 27th Schismaticks were not to be admitted to
the Communion. The maintainers of Conventicles were censured by the 11th,
and the maintainers of Constitutions made in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

outraged the King's <hi>Supremacy and</hi> Regal <hi>Rights, and who did meet and
make Rules and Orders in Causes Ecclesiastical without the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi>
and therefore as the King knew that such Persons who had made
<hi>Schisms</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> had thereby made <hi>Factions</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> and
would make more (the <hi>Church</hi> being necessarily <hi>included</hi> in the <hi>State</hi>)
and would be as dry Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such Republican Tenets as were in <hi>Parson</hi>'s Book of the <hi>Succession,</hi> and
the Writings of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other <hi>Romanists,</hi> and being justly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
that such Antimonarchical <hi>Principles</hi> as had infected the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Puritans might in time infect the <hi>English</hi> ones, as well as that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the <hi>Powder-Traitors</hi> might infect other Loyal Papists, he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> as a general necessary Antidote to the <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of his Subjects to prevent such infection.</p>
            <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 109. of his <hi>Apology for the Oath of Allegiance,</hi> he cited <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
for the <hi>Tenets,</hi> That <hi>Kings have not their Authority nor Office immediately
from God, and that Kings may be deposed by their People for divers respects;</hi>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:103047:225"/>
and when such Writers did so spitefully with the <hi>Papal</hi> Power endeavour
likewise to bring in the <hi>Sea</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> to overwhelm Kings, it was
time to raise the Bank of that <hi>Oath</hi> the higher against the same, and for
the <hi>Takers</hi> of that <hi>Oath</hi> to be obliged <hi>to bear Faith and True Allegiance
to his Majesty, his Heirs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and him and them to defend,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>against all
Conspiracies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which shall be made against his or their Persons, their
Crown and Dignity, by reason or colour of any such Sentence or Declaration or
OTHERWISE, and to declare that neither the Pope, NOR ANY PERSON
WHATSOEVER hath Power to absolve them of this Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When therefore I see any serious man <hi>disloyal,</hi> who hath took the <hi>Oath</hi>
of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and whom <hi>Necessity</hi> (as we say) doth not draw to <hi>Turpitude,</hi>
I still attribute much of his <hi>disloyalty</hi> to his not with intense and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
thought dwelling on the view of his <hi>Moral</hi> Obligations in the
clear <hi>Mirror</hi> of that <hi>Oath,</hi> but to his cursory viewing them, and, as
St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s words are <hi>like a man beholding his natural face in a Glass, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
himself and goeth his way, and straitway forgetteth what manner of
man he was.</hi> How many outragious Acts of <hi>Disloyalty</hi> after 41 had been
avoided if the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> had been writ in the <hi>hearts</hi> of the Takers
of it as it ought to have been? As for <hi>Example,</hi> since to <hi>Prorogue</hi> or
<hi>Dissolve</hi> Parliaments was ever a known <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Privilege</hi> belonging
to the <hi>Crown,</hi> could any Person who had sworn to defend its <hi>Rights</hi> and
<hi>Privileges</hi> endeavour to retrench that particular one by the <hi>Act</hi> for the
perpetuating the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 40? How easie would Princes find their
Reigns, and Subjects their <hi>Consciences,</hi> if these would think of all the
Royal <hi>Rights</hi> they have sworn to <hi>defend,</hi> and how they are to defend
them?</p>
            <p>I have mentioned the great <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> against any ones <hi>bearing
Office</hi> under an Usurpt Power, and the terrible <hi>Oath</hi> for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that <hi>Law,</hi> and I have likewise mentioned the Author of the <hi>EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERCITATION,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> as asserting the unlawfulness of bearing
<hi>Office</hi> under our late usurp'd Powers by reason of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi>
having before obliged them to the <hi>King, his Heirs and Successors.</hi> The
<hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Exercitation</hi> doth very appositely to strengthen that his
Loyal Assertion cite an excellent <hi>passage</hi> out of <hi>Tully</hi>'s Epistles <hi>ad Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,

sharp precaution against the <hi>lusciousness</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> under an Usurper,

of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> detestable; but saith, That <hi>the greater number
of the Deputies of the 3d Chamber did frame the form of an</hi> Oath <hi>which
they wished might be ministred in that Kingdom, as that which bears the
name of ALLEGIANCE in ours, whereby the same principal Article is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
namely, That no</hi> French <hi>King can be deposed for any Cause whatsoever,
and that the contrary Opinion is Heretical, and repugnant to the Doctrine of
the Scriptures. But this difference is found between the two Oaths: that
whereas the</hi> English <hi>one in one of the Clauses, seems to exclude not only the
Authority of the CHVRCH over Kings, but even of the COMMON-WEALTH
also (yea tho it should be accompanied even with that of the

contrary to the Loyal <hi>Sentiments</hi> of the <hi>Majority</hi> of that 3d
<hi>Chamber,</hi> inserts very impiously and disloyally, <hi>That Kingly Authority
cannot come immediately from God to any man, but by Miracle: and that all
the Kings whom we know, do either rule by force of Conquest, and in that
Case the Authority of the Common-wealth, if it be Vsurped, may be resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or by Donation, Election, Marriage, or Succession of Blood, in which
Cases Kings forfeit by not performing the Conditions, under which either they

of killing Tyrants by the Law of Nature,</hi> and prophaneth the <hi>Book</hi> of
God by citing for a desperate use some <hi>extraordinary</hi> Acts of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

without horror; and especially when he shall consider what were the
effects of this detestable Book. It helped to provoke the fury of <hi>Philip</hi>

her death, for the declaring of any one a Rebel, and being without
delay executed by <hi>Martial</hi> Law, with whom that and other Books of
that Nature printed beyond Sea should here be found. And another ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the publication of that and those other Books was to irritate the
Government against those poor Innocents who were here martyr'd, and
who sufficiently abhorred such Treasonable Books: for this Book was
published beyond Sea, and probably imported here about two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her death. But for the honour of our <hi>English</hi> Exiles then, I judge
that none of them had a hand therein: I having observed many Words,

               <p>It is probable that King <hi>Iames</hi> and his <hi>Ministers</hi> had heard of this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
<hi>Book,</hi> wherein some <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestants trumpetted out their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of real Rebellion; and no wonder then if the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi>
was therefore framed with <hi>Clauses</hi> to secure the Government from all
irreligionary <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Protestants</hi> as well as <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been objected in the <hi>second</hi> place against our being <hi>become</hi> bound
to the Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> by Virtue of those <hi>Oaths,</hi> that it is
by all <hi>Casuists</hi> agreed that among the <hi>Tacit</hi> Conditions that are presumed
to be in all <hi>Oaths</hi> (and which are to be regarded as much as if they were
express'd) <hi>Rebus sic stantibus</hi> is one: and that that therefore as none of
the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> was then excluded from the Privilege or Right of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
<hi>Succession</hi> by the <hi>Legislative</hi> Power, so if things thus stood with him
at the time of the <hi>Descent</hi> of the Crown, that is, at the time of the Kings
decease, the Oath obliged to the payment of absolute and irrespective
Loyalty to him then: and that thus when the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>
were <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> of this <hi>Realm</hi> according to the Style of some
old Oaths, they would be Entitled to our <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Answer</hi> to this <hi>Objection,</hi> I shall say first, that if we should admit
that which is not true, that the <hi>Rebus sic stantibus</hi> were so to be applied in
this <hi>Case,</hi> yet it is most clear that the Takers of these <hi>Oaths</hi> who were any
<hi>Members</hi> of the Three <hi>Estates</hi> in Parliament were thereby <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:103047:226"/>
                  <hi>actually</hi> bound (as I have said in the 7t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Conclusion</hi>) not to do any <hi>Act</hi>
there to <hi>exclude</hi> the Succession according to proximity of Blood: and
moreover any of the <hi>People</hi> who took these Oaths were thereby <hi>Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
bound not to choose any to <hi>represent</hi> them in Parliament from whom
they might fear their endeavouring of such Exclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Premising</hi> that there was somewhat of irreverence in supposing
that the Legislative Power would ever afterward make a <hi>Solutio conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ui,</hi>
(as I called it) in the Hereditary Monarchy, yet it must be said that
any supposed <hi>Act</hi> of that kind would be <hi>Null</hi> and <hi>Void,</hi> as the Loyal and
Learned late <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Succession</hi> have shewed, and to whose
<hi>Writers</hi> of that Subject I <hi>refer:</hi> and therefore our Obligations to
the King's Heirs and lawful Successors by Virtue of these Oaths
must remain <hi>uncancelled</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience:</hi> and however any
<hi>Act</hi> of Parliament supposed to be made against the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> may a
while be <hi>de facto</hi> received in any <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> yet is it in the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Conscience</hi> to be looked on as a poor <hi>Escrole,</hi> and as not worthy the name
of a <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is most manifest that by these <hi>Oaths,</hi> there is <hi>jus alteri acquisitum,</hi> I
mean to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> as well as to the <hi>King;</hi> and that
therefore any supposed <hi>relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Oaths</hi> without the <hi>consent</hi> of all
<hi>Parties</hi> for whose behoof they were made, is a thing Nugatory and not
allowable in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I have speaking <hi>cum vulgo</hi> called some <hi>Anti-Papists,</hi> whose
Principles tend to <hi>Faction</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> Nominal
Protestants (tho yet I should be still as much content with any Law
that made it <hi>Penal</hi> to call them Protestants, as with one that should be so to
call <hi>Quacks Physicians</hi>) so I should in the Court of Conscience call any <hi>Acts</hi>
of Parliament that are contrary to the <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Natural Rules of indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The just allowance of the <hi>Rebus sic stantibus</hi> that can be
in this Case is this, there being nothing of pretence of relaxation from
all Parties supposeable, these <hi>Oaths</hi> bind us to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi>
as long as there is any <hi>ONE</hi> of them remaining in the World: and
without the insertion of the words in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> viz. <hi>I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and in Conscience am resolved that neither the Pope NOR ANY PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON
WHATSOEVER hath Power to absolve me of this Oath or any part
thereof,</hi> its <hi>indispensableness</hi> to those who know the Obligation of <hi>Oaths</hi> to
be <hi>jure Divino naturali,</hi> would have sufficiently appeared. <hi>In fine,</hi> there are
<hi>Rationes boni &amp; mali aeternae &amp; indispensabiles,</hi> and to <hi>stand to promises</hi>
is one of the things that are simply and in their own nature good, and
it is impossible (as the Scripture saith) <hi>That God should lye,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>man</hi> made after God's <hi>image,</hi> must therein answer the <hi>Archetype:</hi> and
hereby our Princes have the <hi>Garranty</hi> of our <hi>Allegiance</hi> sworn to <hi>them,
their Heirs and Successors</hi> being indispensable by <hi>Popes,</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
or by <hi>God</hi> himself: for he cannot dispense with the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Humanâ naturâ manente eadem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:103047:227"/>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> It is most manifest from what I have already said, that any
such <hi>Tacit</hi> Condition in these Oaths as before mentioned, was contrary
to the <hi>sense of the Imposer</hi> as well as to the <hi>Words,</hi> and was therefore not
allowable in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> in this Case: and I believe that the
<hi>Consciences</hi> of such who have made this <hi>Objection,</hi> must tell them, that
when they took these <hi>Oaths,</hi> their <hi>sense</hi> of them was then contrary to
any such condition being allowed. And therefore any such <hi>After-birth</hi>
of a strained <hi>Interpretation</hi> being so contrary to the Law of <hi>God</hi> and the
<hi>Land,</hi> and the sense of the <hi>Imposer,</hi> as well as the words of the Oaths,
and to the <hi>sense</hi> in which they actually took them, must be thrown
away.</p>
               <p>There hath been a third <hi>Objection,</hi> if it may be called one, or if yet
it may be called a <hi>Scruple,</hi> for I think it hardly deserves the name of that.
However it having got under some mens <hi>feet,</hi> or into their <hi>heads,</hi> it hath
made them so <hi>uneasie</hi> as frowardly to trample on the Rights of Crown'd
Heads, and it hath troubled us by the name of <hi>Haeres viventis,</hi> and as
if that were a <hi>Chymaera,</hi> when as indeed the Objection is altogether <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Sir <hi>L. I.</hi> had with so much clear reason shewed much to this
purpose, viz. <hi>That the Exclusion-Bill was against the Fundamental Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
as likewise the wisdom of the Nation, and that it would induce a
CHANGE in the Government: and that was likewise against the Religion
of the Nation which teacheth us, That</hi> Dominion is not founded in Grace,
<hi>and that we are to pay Obedience to</hi> Princes <hi>whether good or bad, as according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Primitive Christians did, and that it was against the Oaths of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
namely, of</hi> Allegiance and Supremacy: <hi>and that his</hi> R. H. <hi>is the
King's lawful Heir, if he hath no Child, and in the Eye of the Law we are
sworn to him,</hi> and when he had further signalized the weight of his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Remarks, and Learning in that <hi>Speech</hi> as well of as his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> so as
on the account of both to merit a place for it in the <hi>English</hi> Story, and
had instanced in some Princes and their Subjects of different Religions li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very happily together, it may perhaps be a <hi>blot</hi> in that Story, that
Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> in an answer to that <hi>Speech</hi> granting, That <hi>we are sworn to the
King, his Heirs and Successors,</hi> said further, <hi>That we are not obliged to any
during the King's life, but to himself: for it were Treason if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
The King hath no Heirs nor Successors during his life: for according
to his Law</hi> (meaning Sir <hi>L. I's) and ours,</hi> Nemo est haeres viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</p>
               <p>In <hi>answer</hi> to which, I shall say that that <hi>Proverbial</hi> Latin <hi>saying</hi> in the
Law Books doth amount to no more in nature, and hath no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on Humane Affairs, nor particularly on <hi>Moral</hi> Offices, than that
kind of Proverbial <hi>Sayings</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> viz. <hi>For where a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testator,</hi> or <hi>a
Testament is of no strength while the Testator liveth.</hi> Every one knoweth
that a <hi>Will</hi> is in its own nature revocable, and Legatees and Executors
may be altered by the Testator: and for any one to quote it as a Maxim,
<hi>Nemo est Executor viventis</hi> (and for a <hi>Legatee,</hi> or in effect an <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
in a <hi>Will,</hi> the word <hi>haeres</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> often used in the <hi>Civil</hi> Law and by the
Writers of it) will be no more significant, than the telling the Legatee
or Executor is, that they must not meddle in the Testators Goods till
he be dead: and it may usefully operate to divert People from the
slothful Omissions of making their Wills in due time, out of a fond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
that their Legatees or Executors would have a Title to any thing
before the Testators death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:103047:227"/>
But after what hath been said of the <hi>revocableness</hi> of <hi>Wills,</hi> if I
have lawfully <hi>sworn</hi> to continue such a man my Heir, or Executor of my
<hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Legatee</hi> therein, can I then at my pleasure with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
alter it therein? And if a <hi>Father</hi> hath <hi>sworn</hi> to give his Children
such a part of his <hi>Estate</hi> by his <hi>Will,</hi> as by the <hi>Civil</hi> Law is due to them
out of his Estate when he dies, shall he then be allowed in the Court
of <hi>Conscience</hi> to alter such bequest <hi>Ad libitum?</hi> This comes a little
home to our Case: for we have before hand sworn to pay the King's
<hi>Heirs</hi> at the Descent of the Crown the <hi>Allegiance</hi> that will be due to
them then by <hi>inherent</hi> Birthright.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> alludes to that Custom of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws, and which is yet retained in <hi>Germany</hi> and many other places, viz. <hi>And
if Children, then Heirs,</hi> and makes them certainly <hi>Haeredes viventis:</hi> and
when any by the <hi>Civil</hi> Law were <hi>Haeredes ab intestato,</hi> or <hi>Heirs</hi> at Law,
that Law as it made no difference between Land and Goods, so neither
did it between Eldest and Youngest, nor Male and Female, but divided the
whole Estate real and personal, equally among the Children; and the
Law tying Parents to leave a <hi>Quota</hi> in their <hi>Wills</hi> to their Children,
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Consequence was good, i. e. <hi>if Children, then Heirs.</hi> We know
that the <hi>Heirs</hi> of our <hi>Kings</hi> are not such as that Law called <hi>Haeredes
Testamentarii,</hi> but they succeeding by the right Divine and Inherent
Birthright, may be said to be <hi>Haeredes legitimi,</hi> and when in the King's
Life-time the Law hath enjoyned men by a Liquid Oath to defend all <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
Preheminences belonging to the King's Heirs and Successors,</hi> can it be
either <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Sense</hi> to say they are now no <hi>Heirs,</hi> and that any who have
taken that <hi>Oath</hi> may actually <hi>exclude</hi> such <hi>Heirs</hi> because they are not
actual <hi>Successors,</hi> and as if too none could be a <hi>Successor</hi> but an actual
one, according to that old <hi>Dicterium, That no Prince ever put to death his
Successor?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to shew further how grosly Sir <hi>W. I.</hi> was mistaken in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
and applying of the saying out of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, viz. <hi>Nemo
est haeres viventis,</hi> I shall refer to <hi>Paulus de Castro</hi> (as Eminent a <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi>
on the <hi>Civil</hi> Law as any one whatsoever) who doth on the <hi>Digest
De liberis &amp; Posthumis. l.</hi> Gallus §. etiam <hi>n.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> &amp; 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> discuss the point
of <hi>Haeres viventis,</hi> and where he saith, <hi>Nota quod filius vel alius descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
in potestate patris, qui tenet primum locum dicitur esse suus haeres etiam
vivente patre;</hi> and then objects the saying, That <hi>Vivens non habet haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,
ergo non suum haeredem:</hi> and he answers, That <hi>istud verbum HAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RES
idem significat quod DOMINVS,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; potest sumi duobus modis
1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> propriè prout est Successor in Vniversum jus quod defunctus habuit</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

patre dicitur DOMINVS bonorum paternorum licet impropriè,
it a potest dici HAERES prout istud verbum sumitur pro Domino.</hi> He had
before spoke of the General Rule, That <hi>Haeres suus dicitur quem nemo
praecedit,</hi> and he there mentions what likewise all the Books agree in,
That <hi>Haeredes sui &amp; necessarii dicuntur liberi qui in familiâ proximum à pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
gradem obtinent: sui, quia haereditatem tanquam suam, necessarii quia
jure antiquo retinere cogebantur.</hi> He intends there (I suppose) by the
<hi>jus antiquum</hi> that Law of the 12 <hi>Tables,</hi> viz. <hi>Intestatorum haeredes primò suo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
haeredum velint nolintve sunto.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:103047:228"/>
We find in the New Testament such <hi>Heir</hi> judged to be <hi>Lord of all,
Gal.</hi> 4. 1. And thus <hi>Grotius</hi> on that <hi>place</hi> in the <hi>Hebrews, whom he hath
appointed Heir of all things</hi> saith, That by <hi>Heir</hi> is meant <hi>Lord, Nam
&amp; Latinis</hi> Haeres <hi>idem quod</hi> herus. <hi>Christus in coelum evectus, rerum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium

likewise tell us §. <hi>ult. De haered. qualit.</hi> That <hi>pro haerede gerere, est pro
Domino gerere: veteres enim haeredes pro Dominis appellabant.</hi> And such
<hi>Lords of all</hi> then were the <hi>Heirs,</hi> that tho ordinarily they could not
have their <hi>Legitima pars</hi> in their Fathers life-time (and so we find it but
in the <hi>Parable</hi> in St. <hi>Luke</hi> that the Prodigal Son said, <hi>Father give me the
Portion of Goods that falleth to me, and he divided unto them his Living</hi>)
yet if the Father were <hi>re verâ</hi> a <hi>Prodigal,</hi> the Son might by imploring
the Office of the Judge obtain in the Fathers life-time somewhat like
the <hi>legitima</hi> to be allowed for his subsistance. And moreover <hi>Grotius</hi> on
the other place of Scripture, <hi>Si autem filii &amp; haeredes,</hi> saith, <hi>Sententia
est conveniens non tantum Israelitico Numerorum 28. sed etiam Gentium
juri. Nam lex quaedam tacita liberis haereditatem parentum addicit.</hi> L.

               <p>None need therefore wonder at <hi>De Castro's</hi> having pronounced the
<hi>Heir</hi> to be the same thing with <hi>Dominus,</hi> and at his leaving it out of
doubt that direct Descendants are a mans <hi>Heirs</hi> in his life-time, because
they are such as are called <hi>Heirs</hi> at <hi>Law.</hi> And there is little room for
doubting here in <hi>England</hi> who are <hi>Heirs</hi> at <hi>Law</hi> to private Persons, for
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> hath to this purpose said that throughout his time, viz.
<hi>Ne duas quidem quaestiones adverti de jure haereditatum:</hi> but God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there can be no room for any in the Case of the Crown.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> when he Erected the Monument for his <hi>Mother</hi> on the
Northside of her Grand-father <hi>Harry</hi> the 7th's Tomb, and put these
words in the Inscription, viz. <hi>Coronae Angliae dum vixit certae &amp; indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatae
haeredis,</hi> necessarily implied that there was another Sovereign li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
while She was thus Heir to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Let any one consider how many <hi>real</hi> Solecisms Sir. <hi>W. I</hi>'s. <hi>imagined</hi> one
must occasion. Is it not a <hi>Solecism</hi> to say, I cannot now <hi>promise</hi> a <hi>future</hi>
lawful thing, viz. <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> at the time of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
of the Crown, since nothing can be <hi>promised</hi> but what is <hi>Future?</hi>
In the Body of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law matters of right are sometimes founded
on trite Philosophical <hi>Axioms</hi> and such as <hi>Non entis, nulla sunt acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi>
but it were a Solecism to deny, that the Takers of these <hi>Oaths</hi> have
become bound at that time to the <hi>Haeredes viventis,</hi> who were then <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
vivi,</hi> or that a <hi>Lessee</hi> is bound at the perfecting of his <hi>Lease,</hi> to pay
his Rent to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Lessor</hi> tho then not in nature. If the <hi>Style</hi>
of the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> can in an <hi>Elective</hi> Government, and during
the Emperors life be, <hi>Ego N. Rex Romanorum futurus Imperator,</hi> is

               <p>I shall studiously avoid the <hi>embarassing</hi> the Question with needless

And here I must say it, that if in the <hi>interpretation</hi> of Princes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

qui soli veritati innititur,</hi> and according to the <hi>Style</hi> of the Judges <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi>
by <hi>Sovereign</hi> Princes, <hi>Solâ rei veritate inspectâ,</hi> and throwing off the
<hi>Formal</hi> Rules and Solemnities even of <hi>positive</hi> Laws themselves; it may
be well inferred that the Divine <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> obliging us to <hi>Gratitude,</hi>
we are Morally bound in the preservations of the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of
Princes (tho we had not been sworn to them, yet) to regard them as <hi>God,</hi>
and not to obscure their Rights with <hi>Formalities</hi> and subtilties of Law,
and much less with tricks of words, but especially in the interpretation
of our Oaths to them to use the greatest <hi>simplicity</hi> therein that is sutable
to the Law of Nations, Nature and Christianity, and to abhor what the
<hi>Lawyers</hi> call a <hi>Subdola juris interpretatio,</hi> and what may be called, as the
expression is in <hi>Iob,</hi> a <hi>darkening of Council by words without knowledge,</hi>
and a gloss that corrupts the <hi>Text,</hi> and is directly contrary to the Right
of Kings and Princes; for the securing of which and removing all <hi>doubts</hi>
or <hi>strife</hi> about the same these <hi>Oaths</hi> were made.</p>
               <p>And should any one tell me of the effect of that saying <hi>Nemo est haeres
viventis</hi> in our Common-Law, and that <hi>Land</hi> being given to <hi>A.</hi> for life
and the remainder to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> and that <hi>A.</hi> dying while <hi>B.</hi> lives
who hath at that time a <hi>Son,</hi> that <hi>Son</hi> shall never have the Land because
of <hi>Non est haeres viventis,</hi> but it shall go back to the <hi>Donor</hi> if alive, or if
dead to his <hi>Heirs,</hi> I will ask him if the <hi>Donor</hi> should be bound in Justice
and Equity by a certain future time to Lett the <hi>Heirs</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> have the Land,
and had voluntarily sworn that <hi>B</hi>'s Heirs should then have the same, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Donor</hi> then could with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to <hi>Conscience</hi> keep the Son or
other Heir from the same by Virtue of the <hi>Non est haeres viventis?</hi> But
we are to be tender how we compare the Inheritances of private Persons
with that of the Crown, which is of a higher Nature, and without a
<hi>Metaphor</hi> differs from them <hi>Toto Coelo,</hi> and is so much above them. And
how regardless were they then of the Birth-right of the oldest <hi>Monarchy</hi>
in the World, and particularly of the present Glorious Royal Line, that
would not allow it the <hi>Privilege</hi> of being plainly understood as they do
to private Inheritances, and as to which <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> in that
part of his <hi>Charter</hi> to <hi>London</hi> is allowed to speak intelligibly enough, viz.
<hi>And I wyll that ich Child be his Faders Eyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I am weary of this <hi>Wild-goose</hi> chace of the <hi>Haeres viventis</hi> among
old Books: and my pointing back any one to my 3d and 5th <hi>Conclusions</hi>
may save my labour of speaking here much more of it, It is sufficiently
set forth in the <hi>third, in what sense the words of Oaths</hi> are to be taken, and
where I mentioned <hi>Ames</hi> saying, That <hi>they are regularly to be taken in
that sense that the words have in the COMMON use of men.</hi> And to this
purpose we are well told by <hi>Vaughan</hi> in <hi>Shepbard</hi> and <hi>Gosnald</hi>'s Case, That
<hi>were the penning of a Statute is dubious, long usage is a just</hi> Medium <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:103047:229"/>
it by: for</hi> jus &amp; norma loquendi <hi>is governed by usage, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of things spoke or writ must be as it hath constantly been received to be
by common acceptation.</hi> But I have shewed the word <hi>Heir</hi> to be no <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
word: and as I have mentioned it to be a word that the Glory and
Power of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is expressed by, I may add that our Noble Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
as we are Christians being so often represented in Scripture by the
word <hi>Heirs,</hi> &amp;c. we are <hi>Morally</hi> bound to guard the word from the
Assault of any new interpretation that would outrage it with <hi>doubt</hi> and
ambiguity.</p>
               <p>I have shewed that as our <hi>Oath</hi> is part of a <hi>Statute-Law,</hi> if there
could be any <hi>doubt</hi> of it, the <hi>Iudges</hi> are to interpret it: and our Ancestors
were so far from trusting private men to interpret Statutes, that they
have not allowed the Court Christian judicially interpret the very <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
that concern the things there conusable. And as some Papists do
vainly sometime tell us, That <hi>we by our Religion damn all our Popish An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,</hi>
it may here with truth be said, that any by finding out a new <hi>sense</hi>
of the word <hi>Heirs</hi> do condemn the understandings of those and their
Morals in not observing the Oath by the measures of that interpretation;
and I may as truly say, that we venture on damning our selves by Perjury,
if while we venture on a new <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Oaths</hi> both contrary to the
common sense of the words and of the Imposer, we do not particularly
take the <hi>Oaths</hi> with our <hi>Protestation</hi> of that new <hi>sense,</hi> and much more
if <hi>reserving</hi> that new <hi>sense</hi> in our minds we shall further in one of these
<hi>Oaths,</hi> viz. That of <hi>Allegiance</hi> declare, <hi>That we have sworn every thing
therein according to the PLAIN and COMMON sense and VNDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANDING
of the same words without ANY Equivocation, or Mental Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or secret Reservation whatsoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a certain <hi>Rule</hi> about <hi>Oaths,</hi> That <hi>Iuramentum non extenditur ad ea
de quibus cogitatum non est:</hi> and so is this other, viz. <hi>Non licet nobis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatione
taci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

sunt, vel ex re ipsa, aut verbis quibusdam manifestè colliguntur:</hi> and I
may add another, That <hi>Minimè mutanda sunt quae interpretationem certam
semper habuerunt.</hi> But as it hath appeared to all a superfluous thing ever
to have the Judges consulted about any being <hi>Heirs</hi> to the King in his
life-time, and wherein there is no <hi>Dignus vindice nodus,</hi> so likewise tho
<hi>Contra captiones ex actu ambiguo nascentes, remedio est protestatio, quae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratione
intentionis actum madificatur, jus<expan>
                        <am>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> in posterum competens conservat,</hi>
yet no man was ever found so ridiculous as to make any <hi>Protestation</hi> at
the time of his taking these Oaths concerning this new <hi>sense</hi> of the
word <hi>Heirs:</hi> and what is a greater reflection on our <hi>Excluders</hi> as to their
Non-observance of the <hi>Promissory</hi> Clause relating to the King's Heirs,
is that the Excluders were embarqued in their <hi>Exclusion,</hi> and <hi>half-Sea</hi>
over in their prosecution of it, and had thrown away their <hi>Compass</hi> of
the common sense of the <hi>Oaths,</hi> before the new one of <hi>Haeres viventis</hi>
was found or heard of, an <hi>interpretation</hi> that I believe the very <hi>Author</hi>
of the <hi>Sheriffs Case</hi> would have held scandalous, and which indeed
amounts not to so much as a <hi>Scruple</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> or to more than a
<hi>Quirk</hi> of Law. It hath long been the Custom of <hi>Spain</hi> not to make any
men <hi>Iudges</hi> who have been Advocates, as supposing that their straining
the Law as Practitioners for their Clients, might make them the less
Candid in their Judgment of the Law on the <hi>Tribunal:</hi> but the truth is,
the giving Judgment in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> that this <hi>new-found</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the word <hi>Heirs</hi> would in that Court indemnify the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:103047:229"/>
of the <hi>Oaths,</hi> may well seem unworthy of the dignity of any
<hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Counsellor</hi> or conscientious <hi>Attorney,</hi> and any one of those
whom the old <hi>Comaedian</hi> calls the <hi>Leguleiorum faeces decemdrachmari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not wholly steer'd by <hi>Trick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As great a <hi>Iudge</hi> in that <hi>Court</hi> as ever our <hi>Nation,</hi> or perhaps <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
bred, I mean our Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> having in his 2d <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>Oaths</hi>
said, <hi>That we become guilty of the hainous Crime of Perjury, if a milder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of an Oath chance to deceive us,</hi> doth well mind us of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<hi>Rule</hi> which in <hi>doubtful</hi> matters commands the <hi>choice</hi> of the <hi>safer</hi>
part. And thus the <hi>Casuists</hi> generally giving us that <hi>Rule,</hi> that in all
doubtful matters we are to <hi>incline</hi> to the safer side, and that therein 'tis
safer to think a thing to be <hi>Sin</hi> than not, and in order to the great
<hi>EXCLVSION</hi> of <hi>Perjury</hi> telling us, That <hi>Cum de ancipiti perjurio in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum
quaeritur, illa est benignior sententia quae Conscientiae tutior, atque ita
quae crimen interpretatur ut excludat,</hi> and that when ever we recede from
the <hi>literal</hi> sense of an Oath to the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> we ought
to be very <hi>sure</hi> of that <hi>intention,</hi> if we will be sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e from the danger of
<hi>Perjury,</hi> I think that <hi>new</hi> interpretation so clearly contrary both to the
literal sense of the <hi>Oath</hi> and the intention of the Law-giver (as I have
shewn) was a very unsafe trick for men to put upon their <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the word <hi>Heir</hi> is a <hi>plain</hi> word, so it is likewise as <hi>plain,</hi> that
some men by the <hi>Haeres viventis</hi> would put a <hi>Trick</hi> on the <hi>State:</hi>
for let any one go to dissect all the meaning that can be in the <hi>Haeres
viventis</hi> in plain <hi>English,</hi> and it will be neither better nor worse than to
make the <hi>sense</hi> of the Imposer of the Oaths be, that men should observe
the Promissory Clauses relating to the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> only
on the <hi>terms</hi> of the Objection of <hi>Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> which I have before
mentioned and fully answered.</p>
               <p>Nor can any men evade their being by the <hi>Oaths</hi> obliged to <hi>defend</hi> the
Rights of the Hereditary Monarchy, and thus prop up such their <hi>new</hi>
interpretation of <hi>Heirs</hi> by Virtue of the <hi>expired</hi> Statute of the 13th of
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> (which some have raised such dust with) that made it <hi>Treason to
affirm, That the Laws and Statutes do not bind the Right of the Crown and
its Descent, Limitation, Inheritance, or Governance.</hi> It is not an <hi>expired</hi>
Statute, nor any one in <hi>being</hi> can make the Obligation of our <hi>Oaths</hi> to
the King's <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> to <hi>expire.</hi> We were in Conscience, and
by the <hi>Law</hi> (which is by some termed <hi>Communis sponsio Regni</hi>) obliged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>Oaths</hi> taken to defend the Rights of the King's Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
in all just ways: but if any men should be so vain as to think
that we were not before obliged to them on the account of the <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
Monarchy, yet it is most certain that an <hi>Oath</hi> doth often induce an
Obligation where there was none before: and we are not now consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what WAS Treason, but what IS Perjury. An <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament
may inflict the <hi>Vltimum supplicium,</hi> on that which perhaps is not <hi>Malum
in se,</hi> as for example, <hi>The Exportation of Wooll,</hi> tho when we have a
<hi>glut</hi> of it; nay, by the 28th of <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th, <hi>c.</hi> 7. touching the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>
of the Crown, the not taking of the contrary <hi>Oaths</hi> is made Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But I need not here say more than that if any in the 13th <hi>Year</hi> of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had took the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> enjoyned in the first
<hi>Year</hi> of her Reign, and did not observe the Promissory <hi>Clause</hi> therein,
they did offend God and their Consciences thereby. But I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it that Arch-Bishop <hi>Hutton</hi> notwithstanding that 13th of <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:103047:230"/>
made it a <hi>Praemunire</hi> to <hi>speak of any Person being her Heir and Successor,
except the same were the natural Issue of her Body,</hi> did publickly in his
<hi>Sermon</hi> before her, discharge that Promissory part of the <hi>Oath</hi> by assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
King <hi>Iames</hi> his Right to <hi>succeed</hi> her, and was publickly by her thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it.</p>
               <p>On the whole matter, we are not bound by these <hi>Oaths</hi> to look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
on other mens actings, but to look forward on our own. Enough
has been said of too much that was done to oppose King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and of the necessity of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>giance</hi> to secure <hi>England</hi> to
the Royal <hi>Line</hi> and by it: and the providing of the <hi>fortius vinculum</hi> on
the emergency of the Gun-powder Treason, was but sutable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
prudence of all States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the expression of Allegiance to be paid
to the King's <hi>Heirs and Successors,</hi> when <hi>Kings and Queens of this Realm,</hi>
which was in some former Oaths, was not in <hi>this</hi> necessary, nor yet in the
Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> because of the great Fundamental Clause in both before
mentioned, viz. <hi>The King IS the only Supreme Governor,</hi> &amp;c. he <hi>IS ONLY
Supreme,</hi> and so none co-ordinate, or equal to him; <hi>our Sov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the King, IS lawful and rightful King,</hi> &amp;c. and so the word <hi>IS</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
hinder any <hi>Heirs</hi> or <hi>Successors</hi> forestalling the Market if they
should presume before their time to come for our actual Allegiance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
sworn to them to be paid in future time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our</hi> Law-Book <hi>of</hi> Oaths <hi>mentions a long Promissory</hi> Oath <hi>made vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to</hi> Harry <hi>the 6th, by</hi> 2 Arch-Bishops, 16 Bishops, 3 Dukes, 5
Earls, 2 Viscounts, 14 Abbots, 2 Priors, <hi>and</hi> 7 Barons, <hi>and but part of
which I shall here set down, viz.</hi> I <hi>A. B.</hi> knowledge you most High and
Mighty and most Christian Prince King <hi>Henry</hi> 6. to be my most redoubted,
and rightwise by Succession born to Reign upon me, and all your Liege People,
whereupon I voluntarily without Coercion, promise and oblige me by the
faith and truth that I owe to God, and by the faith, truth and ligeance that
I owe to you my most redoubted Sovereign Lord, that I shall be without any
variance, true, faithful, humble, and obeysant Subject and Liege man, to you
my most redoubted Sovereign Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and swear to endeavour to do all
that may be to the weal and surety of your most Royal Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the weal,
surety, and preserving of the Person and benign Princess, <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen, my
Sovereign Lady, and of her High most Noble Estate, She being your Wife, and
also the weal, surety, and honour of the Person of the right High and Mighty
Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> my right redoubted Lord the Prince your first begotten Son,
and of the Right High and Noble Estate, and faithfully, truly, and obeysantly,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> First, my Allegiance to you my most redoubted Sovereign Lord, during your
life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if God of his infinite Power take you from this Transitory Life,
me bearing life in this World, that I shall then take and accept my said
redoubted Lord, the Prince <hi>Edward</hi> your said first born Son for my Sovereign
Lord, and bear my true Faith and Ligeance to him, as by nature born for
my Sovereign Lord, and after him to his Succession of his Body lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in default of his Succession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto any other Succession of
your Body lawfully coming.</p>
               <p>But the wisdom of any Nation making Laws (and especially about
<hi>Oaths</hi>) as short as may be, I account that those of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
have much better that <hi>Multi-loquious</hi> one (as I may call it) provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the security of our <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King <hi>Regnant,</hi> and afterward
to his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> by plain and liquid words as far as Humane
Prudence could provide for the same. And because what is made by
Humane Art is in danger of being by Humane Art eluded, and for that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:103047:230"/>
we see that <hi>Nature</hi> it self hath been made a <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> (a word that
St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought <hi>plain</hi> enough when he said <hi>doth not Nature teach us that,</hi>
&amp;c. yet of which word a late <hi>Lawyer</hi> and Kinsman of the Great <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
hath in his Book, <hi>De Principiis juris Naturalis</hi> told us of <hi>seven</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications)
and for that it is as easie for a captious versatil Wit to turn
the word Heir or most words into as many or more, the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi>
was further with deep precaution made to exterminate all <hi>cavilling</hi>
senses and <hi>calumnious</hi> interpretations, and such as that of the <hi>haeres viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
by that <hi>Final</hi> Clause which <hi>Crowns</hi> that <hi>Oath,</hi> and that which alone
as I partly hinted before amounts to an <hi>Oath,</hi> viz. <hi>And I do make this
Recognition and Acknowledgment heartily, willingly and truly upon THE
TRVE FAITH OF A CHRISTIAN,</hi> and after which it follows, <hi>So help
me God.</hi> That the <hi>Faith</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> alone amounts to an <hi>Oath,</hi> I shall
cite the opinion of <hi>Tuldenus</hi> the <hi>Regius Professor of Law</hi> at <hi>Lovain,</hi> when
writing <hi>De interpretatione Iuramenti,</hi> he saith, <hi>Affirmatio perfidem tunc demum
jusjurandum est, cum additum fuit Christianam. Alciat.</hi> in l. 41. c. <hi>De transact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conclude therefore that what <hi>Christian</hi> soever hath taken this <hi>Oath,</hi>
hath by Virtue of the words of <hi>The faith of a Christian</hi> obliged himself
thereby as much as if he had said, <hi>That Great Privilege of Birth-right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the King's Heirs, a Privilege so great that the despising of it,
as in the Case of</hi> Esau <hi>is applied in Scripture to mens prophaneness in despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Inheritance of Bliss by Christianity, I do as sincerely promise to
defend according to my Oath, and without any Fraud or Mental Reservation
or the least cavilling, capricious or calumnious interpretation, as I value
the great Privilege that Christianity hath ennobled Humane Nature with in
being</hi> Heirs of God and joynt Heirs with Christ <hi>as St.</hi> Pauls <hi>words are,
and of being</hi> Heirs according to the Promise; <hi>and may all the Divine</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
be <hi>so</hi> Yea and Amen <hi>to me, and interpreted with not only a plain but a
full and fair interpretation, and so likewise the very</hi> Oath of God, <hi>mentioned
in the</hi> Epistle <hi>to the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>As I do plainly, and fully, and fairly, and with

               </p>
               <p>I shall in the <hi>last</hi> place take notice of what I have not without horror
observed, namely, that some disloyal <hi>Authors</hi> have presumed in <hi>Print</hi> to
pretend the lawfulness of Exclusion of <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their <hi>Religion,</hi> by colour of the punishment of Idolaters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Iudicial</hi> Law: and as to which it will be sufficient here to
say, that that Law was given only to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and that it did
never bind any else or doth, and that the <hi>Divine</hi> Law <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
bind us to the Observation of our <hi>Oaths,</hi> and that <hi>Christianity</hi> doth
not found <hi>Dominion</hi> in <hi>Grace,</hi> and that the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the
Princes of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> made Leagues with <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and on
both sides there was mutual <hi>Faith</hi> confirmed with solemn <hi>Oaths,</hi> and
that an <hi>Oath</hi> Promissory to pay Allegiance to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Crown
at the time of its Descent is much more lawful.</p>
               <p>And I might urge that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Kings tho often idolatrous, yet as
the Lord's <hi>Annointed</hi> had <hi>De jure &amp; de facto</hi> Obedience payed them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to their <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Irreligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by Virtue of the <hi>Moral</hi> Offices of <hi>honouring all men,</hi> and of the

they are vexing us with their old <hi>Nominal</hi> Idolatry in the Church; I

call any Crime of that Nature by the name of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as our judicious

Quod ipsius Dei in terris vices gerant, idque Deo ipsis Conferente hanc pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem,

               <p>Let all such then who did <hi>AVDERE</hi> thus in the Affair of our <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary</hi>
Monarchy, and to have the <hi>Vice-Deus futurus</hi> moulded by their
fancies, consider how great a <hi>Casuist</hi> hath loaded them with <hi>Idolatry:</hi>
and moreover remember how the inspired <hi>Prophet</hi> did make <hi>Rebellion as
the Sin of Witchcraft,</hi> and contumacy or <hi>stubborness</hi> as <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was contented with finding one thing asked by the ingenious <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of the <hi>Compendium,</hi> because I supposed, and that then even by <hi>Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
I might <hi>resolve</hi> the <hi>doubt</hi> (and which I have held my self obliged
to do) viz. <hi>Can it be said that the Monarchy of</hi> England <hi>hath gotten by
the Reformation (and what desperate Enemies that hath created us may be
easily imagined) that nothing but</hi> Popery, <hi>or at least</hi> its Principles <hi>can
make it again emerge or lasting?</hi> but was sorry and ashamed to find that
<hi>Authors</hi> had cause to cite the disloyal <hi>Pamphlet</hi> of <hi>Pereat Papa,</hi> as asserting
<hi>the lawfulness of proceeding against Idolaters</hi> as is there mentioned, and
that he likewise had so much reason to make so great a <hi>Remark</hi> on the
<hi>Exclusion</hi> in the foregoing <hi>Page:</hi> viz. <hi>He who believes he can disinherit
a lawful Successor on the account of Religion, will hardly find Arguments
of force to keep the Prince in being on his Throne whenever this happens to
be imputed to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover I was ashamed after the effort of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi>
and of the <hi>Mobile's</hi> worshipping a <hi>Plot-Witness with the name of</hi>

                  </gap>, that the Non-Conformist <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> called <hi>The peaceable
Design,</hi> printed in the year 1675. speaking so tenderly of the <hi>Papists</hi>
then in the words of, <hi>The Papist in our account is but one sort of Recusants,
and the conscientious and peaceable among them must be held in the same
predicament with those among our selves that likewise refuse to come to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer,</hi>
yet reprinting his <hi>Book</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1680. doth thus alter
the former passage, and say, <hi>The Papist is one whose worship to us is</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<hi>and we cannot therefore allow them the liberty of publick assembling
themselves as others of the Separation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Non-Conformists had a while after the <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi>
idolized both it and the <hi>Papists</hi> for being supposed to have had
some hand in the procuring it, and were as soon weary of it as <hi>Children</hi>
of their <hi>Images,</hi> yet it seems that presently after the noise of the Popish
<hi>Plot,</hi> the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> Censure of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was <hi>transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,</hi>
and their Religion grew to be <hi>Idolatry:</hi> as if the ill actings or
<hi>shams</hi> of either a few or many indigent or dissolute Persons ought to be
turned on the whole <hi>Body</hi> of Papists, or especially on their <hi>Religion</hi> it
self and their Religionary <hi>Tenets.</hi> But many of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
then being abandoned to <hi>sham</hi> the very <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and its <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:103047:232"/>
with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and with a participating in the <hi>PLOT</hi> to bring in
<hi>POPERY,</hi> according to what Arch-Bishop <hi>Land</hi>'s Star-Chamber <hi>Speech</hi>
mentions as the <hi>Style</hi> of the <hi>Libels</hi> in those days, <hi>That there were then
great Plots in hand, and dangerous Plots to change the Religion established,
and to bring in</hi> Romish <hi>Superstition,</hi> the sagacious Loyal began to see
that they made but a <hi>Stalking-horse</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to
shoot at the <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchy, and by outcries against the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> to bring in a <hi>Roman</hi> Republick, and to make themselves the <hi>Idols</hi>
of the <hi>People</hi> in a popular <hi>State,</hi> while they complained of the <hi>Idolatries</hi>
of <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there remains somewhat else to be said as to this point of calling,
or thinking every particular <hi>Papist</hi> an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and that is what I shall
further urge out of the great <hi>Speech</hi> aforesaid of the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Bourges,</hi> who knew well enough that <hi>Papists</hi> had in their <hi>Writings</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
called Hereticks <hi>Idolaters</hi> (and as accordingly the <hi>Author</hi> of a
Popish <hi>Pamphlet</hi> printed in <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1663, Entituled <hi>Miracles
not ceased,</hi> hath done, and where his words are, <hi>The Protestant Religion is a
Cheat and Heathenism, the Protestant Bishops are Cheaters and Priests of</hi>
Baal, <hi>the Protestant Religion is ridiculous and idolatrous</hi>) yet this Arch-Bishop
in that <hi>Speech</hi> having (as I said) cleared his <hi>Prince</hi> tho a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
from the guilt of <hi>Heresy</hi> and <hi>Pertinacy,</hi> doth likewise there parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
say, <hi>he is no Idolater,</hi> and where he likewise hath with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and loyalty taught us, that as to those <hi>Constitutions</hi> in the <hi>Civil
Law</hi> whereby <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi> are <hi>excluded</hi> from <hi>Magistracy</hi> and
publick <hi>Office, It was to be understood to be only in the Case of Inferiour
Magistrates and not of</hi> Sovereign Princes, <hi>who cannot be disinherited of their
Rights without the destruction of the whole Government and People: and to
decree any thing of whom did only belong to the Iurisdiction of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another thing that inclines me to think my self <hi>Morally</hi> bound
not to call all Papists <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and to wipe off the stain of Idolatry from
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as much as any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> have
done, and that is the <hi>Conversion</hi> of <hi>England</hi> from Heathenish <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that
<hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> was God's Great Instrument in many hundred of years
ago.</p>
               <p>HAving thus <hi>Finished</hi> my <hi>Casuistical</hi> Discussion, I shall be glad if
the <hi>Result</hi> thereof may by the Blessing of God (<hi>whose both the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and the Deceiver are,</hi> according to the words of <hi>Iob</hi> 12. 16.) be in
all such Protestants who have been <hi>deceived</hi> into a belief and practice of
the Irreligionary <hi>Tenet</hi> of Popery, viz. <hi>Of Dominion being founded in

believed and practised that <hi>Tenet,</hi> and may have erred in <hi>Popish</hi> Tenets <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary.</hi>
'Tis both visible and palpable that such <hi>Excluders</hi> and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
<hi>Protestants</hi> while they accused Papists of being deluded into a
<hi>Plot</hi> to destroy the <hi>King,</hi> were themselves deluded into a <hi>Practice</hi> that
would <hi>ipso facto</hi> have destroyed the <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchy. 'Tis most

Popery, you obtain but to be the nearer to another part of it: You have
run from the belief of</hi> Purgatory <hi>to the</hi> Tenet <hi>of founding dominion in

The adherents likewise of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are often put to
it to use the distinction of <hi>Protestant Recusants,</hi> to speak Intelligibly.
But 'tis the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England-Protestant</hi> that the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi>
generally mean by that <hi>name,</hi> when they speak of <hi>Protestants</hi> alone here,
according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>analogum per se positum,</hi> &amp;c. It is for the honour
of these <hi>Protestants</hi> who <hi>have not so learn'd Christ and Christianity</hi> as to
be untaught their <hi>unnatural</hi> Allegiance and natural obligation of their
<hi>Oaths,</hi> that it may be observed of them, that tho many within the <hi>pale</hi>

actings in the point of <hi>Exclusion,</hi> yet they have through the Divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
on their understandings soon come to themselves again; and tho
the Loyalty of some of these like <hi>Steel</hi> hath been <hi>bent,</hi> yet it hath not

Transported a while with the Passion of Anger against <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Plots,</hi>
they <hi>said in their haste,</hi> that <hi>Dominion</hi> was founded in <hi>Grace,</hi> I observ'd
so many of them by their <hi>second</hi> thoughts so averse from the <hi>second-hand</hi>
Popery (as I call'd it) that they might merit an exemption from being
censured by <hi>Papists</hi> as aforesaid; and that by virtue of the <hi>Rule</hi> of Law,
viz. <hi>Quidquid calore iracundiae vel fit vel dicitur, non prius ratum est

members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because it was by <hi>Law Established,</hi>
and have for fashion-sake gone to our Common-Prayer with no more

heavy on them, and some Evidence of God's Anger against them for putting
God's Cause and the Churches under such a hand, whereas the trust might
have been managed in a Catholick hand under the Kings Authority,</hi> but to
which the <hi>Answer</hi> was thus with great Loyalty and Judgment, viz.
<hi>Now at length they are come plainly to shew the true ground of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to us, which they have endeavoured all the whole to disguise under
the Personal Scandals they have endeavoured to cast upon us. They are afraid
of Scandal at</hi> Rome <hi>for MAKING CHOICE</hi> as they call it (<hi>as if they
might CHOOSE their Governor) of one of a different Religion. If this
be allowed them, why they might not next pretend to the same fear of
Scandal for having a King of a different Religion, and so the Power
of CHOOSING one of their own Religion, we know not:</hi> and concludes with
an Observation of that Party's having infamously practised the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Calumny</hi> in relation to the then <hi>Queen.</hi>
               </p>

have thereby the <hi>Pudet haec opprobria,</hi> &amp;c. put on them. Nor can it be
by any Impartial Relaters of <hi>News</hi> either <hi>told</hi> at <hi>Gath</hi> or published in

in thinking they might <hi>choose</hi> their <hi>future</hi> King, but it must likewise
there be said, how the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> of that Church did in that
Conjuncture so universally, and with such an <hi>Impetus</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> and
<hi>Scripture</hi> propagate the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> and of the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
that the 13th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and our <hi>Oaths</hi> require, whereby the
<hi>Popery</hi> of <hi>founding Dominion in Grace</hi> hath been so much <hi>Exterminated</hi>
from that Church and the Realm, that the very <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>humor</hi>
of the People of <hi>England</hi> is bent against it, and is likely to be so more and
more.</p>
               <p>And it was natural for our <hi>Divines</hi> in this <hi>Conjuncture</hi> thus to do,
when so many factious counterfeit <hi>Protestants</hi> were by their outcries
making <hi>Papists</hi> of them, and publishing infamous <hi>Pamphlets</hi> that express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shook the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchy, and of the <hi>Church</hi> by
Law Established, and with an <hi>intent</hi> to shake the same in that time when
the <hi>Exclusion</hi> was designed; and as appeared particularly by the <hi>reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
for that purpose the Pamphlet of the <hi>Rights of the Kingdom,</hi> and in
which the <hi>Author</hi> did endeavour to prove the <hi>Peoples Right to choose their
Bishops.</hi> The <hi>Clergy</hi> therefore seeing such <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestants by that
<hi>real</hi> part of Popery <hi>of founding Dominion in Grace,</hi> thus bent on the ruine
of Church and State, were concerned to bend all their forces of reason
in permonishing People of their danger from that part of Popery.</p>
               <p>Thus as when a <hi>Light-house</hi> is set up to warn <hi>Navigators</hi> of a <hi>Bank</hi> of
<hi>Sand,</hi> if yet by the force of the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Wind</hi> such Bank happens to be
removed, the <hi>Light-house</hi> must be removed likewise, the same thing was
accordingly done by the Justice and Prudence of our Divines giving us
a <hi>notification</hi> of the <hi>Sands</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> having shifted their place.</p>

<hi>Names,</hi> as I have observed, so lately the Popish <hi>Plot</hi> was made the

               <p>It hath pleased God by the fierce Zeal of several <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> for
the <hi>Exclusion,</hi> to open the Eyes of many Conscientious and Loyal Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
among them, and to bring them thereby to the Bosom of the <hi>Holy</hi>
Church of <hi>England;</hi> for they seeing such <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> as some
had raised against the <hi>Obligations</hi> of our Oaths, to be but <hi>Scruples,</hi> and
that considerate, serious, and devout Persons of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
had soon thrown the <hi>Scruples</hi> away, were naturally thereby induced to

               <p>And that because some of our <hi>English</hi> Princes long ago, whose <hi>Titles</hi>

then must it appear to such to have been a vile <hi>Scruple</hi> to have fancied it

defended the <hi>Hereditary</hi> Monarchy according to their <hi>Oaths</hi> in that
<hi>HOT</hi> Conjuncture, wherein the <hi>Air</hi> of mens <hi>fancies</hi> was so generally

in the late <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>Populace</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> it was inconsistent with
the <hi>soundness</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> not some way to partake of the effects of that
heat, and as I have sometimes perhaps too much with many other Loyal
Persons done. I remember to have read it somewhere in a <hi>Print</hi> full of
Wit and Loyalty said with gayety of humour to this purpose, viz. <hi>That
while a whole Nation was drunk</hi> (meaning I suppose intoxicated with the
belief of <hi>Witnesses</hi> telling incredible things, and the Populace being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
drunk with Anger and Rage against the Persons of the Papists)
<hi>it was to little purpose for any one man to be sober.</hi> The <hi>Notions</hi> that men,
had of a <hi>Plot</hi> were very various. Some then were so far gone in Credulity
as, like the <hi>Fool</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>believeth every word,</hi> they were resolved
to believe every thing the <hi>Witnesses</hi> had said or would say. The <hi>Loyal</hi>
generally acquiesced in the Notification of it as published by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thereby discharged part of the <hi>Moral</hi> Obligations of the <hi>Oaths</hi> I
have discoursed of, whereby they were to <hi>defend</hi> all the <hi>RIGHTS</hi> and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:103047:235"/>
                  <hi>Privileges belonging to the King, his Heirs,</hi> &amp;c. and one of those <hi>Rights</hi>
and <hi>Privileges</hi> is what is allowed by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> to all <hi>Sovereign</hi>
Princes, namely, <hi>To have faith given to their publick attestation of any
Fact.</hi> Yet Religion allowing men the use of the <hi>judicium discretionis</hi> about
the sense and importance of the <hi>Writ</hi> divinely <hi>inspired,</hi> they modestly
employed their <hi>Discretion</hi> in considering what by the <hi>Dii nominales</hi> was
published, and if any thing therein seemed <hi>above</hi> their reason and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it, their faith rested therein. But the Loyal soon found that
the <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> began more and more to turn into <hi>fears</hi>
and <hi>jealousies</hi> relating to the Witnesses <hi>Veracity,</hi> and they could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a profound horror and astonishment reflect on the <hi>intoxication</hi> of a
gaeat Body of Men, believing some incarnate Devils in accusing one
that had appeared to <hi>Christendom,</hi> as great a <hi>Saint</hi> of her <hi>Sex</hi> as the stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
practice of all Moral Vertues glorifying a heavenly mind on Earth
could render her, and who with such a Character must shine as a <hi>Star</hi> in
the <hi>History</hi> of the Age.</p>
               <p>That many of the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy about that time vainly endeavoured
to have their Religion <hi>Paramount,</hi> and had hopes to get their <hi>Lands</hi>
again, none will think impossible who have since seen some of our Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<hi>Pastors</hi> so infatuated as to think it practicable for them again to
thrive by their old Religion-Trade. And that such particular Persons
as were by the late Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> against <hi>Cressy</hi> printed in

               <p>Many sagacious Protestants who knew the irreligious Principles that
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Writings swarmed with, were apt to fear that there were then
endeavours to have some of them practised by some ill men who were

peculiar to himself. And as then many had their various Conceptions
of the noised Plot, so many loyal and serious thinking Persons supposing
it to be very unreasonable and barbarous to involve the whole <hi>Body</hi> of a
Religion in the guilt of some particular Persons, and on any pretence to
bereave them of that freedom in the profession of their <hi>Religion,</hi> that

thoughts and <hi>fancies</hi> for the reclaiming the Age from the humour of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
then shewed to the <hi>Persons</hi> of Papists in general.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Anglesy</hi> one of his Majesties Great <hi>Ministers</hi> publickly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him in the <hi>hot</hi> Conjuncture <hi>to release all Papists and even</hi> Priests <hi>out
of Prison, who were not charged with any thing of a Plot.</hi> And the <hi>Disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
of many <hi>Nominal</hi> Protestants then appearing in their many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
<hi>Prints,</hi> it seemed very horrid to all ingenious men that the lives
and liberties of <hi>Loyal</hi> innocent <hi>Papists</hi> should be sacrificed to feed the
humours or appetites of any <hi>Beasts</hi> of <hi>Prey</hi> in the <hi>Ark</hi> of the Protestant
Church; I speak with <hi>Allusion</hi> to those thousands of harmless <hi>Sheep</hi>

I thank God, that while I was a sharer With many of the Loyal,
in the hatred of the Irreligionary <hi>Principles</hi> formerly maintained by the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and many of its Churchmen, and particularly of those of the
<hi>Iesuits</hi> (which that Court hath lately disclaimed,) I have likewise sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with them in the Disclaiming of hatred or enmity to any mens <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
whether <hi>Iesuits,</hi> or <hi>Iesuited</hi> Protestants; and I desire to live no
longer than I shall with the most <hi>perfect hatred</hi> abhor the <hi>Popery</hi> of
<hi>founding Dominion in Grace,</hi> and endeavour to perswade all <hi>pretended</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
(but real <hi>half-Papists</hi>) so to hate the same, but likewise with a
<hi>perfect Love</hi> to love the <hi>Persons</hi> of their <hi>Brethren-Papists.</hi> And it is
with Justice to be by all men to our Popish fellow-Subjects acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that whatever <hi>petulance</hi> some of them were formerly guilty of, or of
any ambitious design of making too great a Figure in the <hi>internal</hi>
Government of the Nation, yet that the deportment of the generality of
them hath of late appeared with such a face, not only of <hi>Loyalty</hi> but
<hi>Modesty,</hi> and Complaisance with his <hi>Majesties</hi> measures in employing
the hands and heads of <hi>Protestants</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the great matters of State, as is necessarily attractive of our
Christian Love and Compassion; and the rather for that we have seen at
the same time many Factious <hi>Anti-Papists</hi> to have made a greater <hi>Figure</hi>
in the <hi>internal</hi> Government of the Kingdom, than ever any Papists did
in the Reigns of King <hi>Iames</hi> and the <hi>Royal</hi> Martyr, and to have thereby
given disturbance both to the External Government and the Hereditary
Monarchy. I did observe for some Considerable time after the <hi>Plot-epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi>
somewhat of a becoming Humanity and Gentleness in many <hi>Anti-Papists</hi>
relating to the Persons of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and likewise of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
of our Church, but was afterwards sufficiently sensible of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
<hi>rancour</hi> and <hi>animosities</hi> against both, and of the infamous use
and application they made of the <hi>Iesuits Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Calumny,</hi> and of the
Weapons they borrowed from <hi>Parson</hi>'s of the <hi>Succession,</hi> to promote the
detestable <hi>Exclusion,</hi> and of their borrowing from <hi>Athens</hi> and old
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Thunderbolts of their old <hi>REPVBLICAN Curses,</hi> viz.
of <hi>ENEMY,</hi> &amp;c. and throwing them at the most <hi>Loyal</hi> of our <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,</hi>

the <hi>Exclusion.</hi> By that kind of <hi>Republican</hi> Curses they gave us the <hi>omen</hi>
of what they would have been at. And so <hi>extravagant</hi> was the use of
that <hi>anathema</hi> in the late <hi>Conjuncture,</hi> that when one in a great <hi>Assembly</hi>
moved against Sir <hi>G. I.</hi> (a Person that all the Loyal must own for his
steadiness to the Hereditary Monarchy, and for his having first kindled
that great Zeal for Loyalty which doth now like a <hi>wall</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> defend

that I desire if he findeth any thing here-said, that he may reasonably
think to be not according to the <hi>Theological</hi> measures of the <hi>Church</hi>

(tho I know of no such thing here said) it may by him be
taken as <hi>non dictum.</hi> There is no keeping of <hi>Passion</hi> in number, weight and
measure, and particularly of that of <hi>Anger.</hi> The Excellent <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Downe</hi> that was, <hi>Doctor Ieremy Taylor,</hi> hath often told me, <hi>That when he
was to return an answer to a Friends Letter that had Anger in it, he never

But against all the <hi>Irreligionary</hi> Principles of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and
particularly that of <hi>the Founding Dominion in Grace,</hi> I would crave aid
from <hi>Posterity</hi> for the continuance of my Indignation in the known

denyed it to be a <hi>General Council.</hi> Such denyal will not effectually do their
work, since <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> hath (as I said) shew'd it to be a <hi>general one:</hi>
and his reputation for his profound Judgment and Learning being so
great and such that the late Learned <hi>Lord Faulkland,</hi> the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi>

the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> But by my <hi>citing</hi> likewise that <hi>Cardinals</hi> not holding
himself <hi>obliged</hi> to proceed in <hi>France</hi> according to the measures of that
<hi>Council:</hi> I have shewed the vanity of mens Fears of any ill effect of it
annoying us here, and as (I hope) I shall be able further to do in my
remarks on the <hi>Munster Treaty;</hi> and that since <hi>all things with God are
possible,</hi> we may conclude that tho neither <hi>Iesuited Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants</hi>
should ever <hi>recant</hi> any of their former <hi>Irreligionary Principles,</hi> the <hi>voice</hi>
of <hi>Nature</hi> may in effect do it for them, and render such Principles <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete,</hi>
and as insignificant as the <hi>Stings</hi> of <hi>dead</hi> Animals.</p>
               <p>Several Learned <hi>Prints</hi> published by <hi>Protestant</hi> Authors in this <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
have urged the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> for Princes <hi>exterminating</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and every one knows that in the barbarous old times of <hi>Popery</hi>
that <hi>Council</hi> did operate barbarously to that purpose; and 'tis possible
that in a certain <hi>Country</hi> in the World I will not name, <hi>Hereticks</hi> (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
have been treated partly after the <hi>Mode</hi> of that <hi>Council</hi> by some, with
an intent to <hi>encrease</hi> our <hi>Divisions,</hi> and the <hi>ferment</hi> of the <hi>popular</hi> hatred
against <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> here. But the Great <hi>Perron</hi> having declared
himself not obliged by that <hi>Council</hi> to shew that severity to the <hi>Hereticks</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> hath sufficiently instructed the World that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
<hi>Princes</hi> are not by that Council bound always so to do; and the <hi>Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of the Great <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick <hi>Kings</hi> shining in the <hi>Munster Treaty</hi>
hath likewise given us light therein.</p>
               <p>To Conclude; we are not from the old former Omissions or Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Princes, and People, necessarily to infer <hi>future</hi> ones. The Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Rule is, <hi>De futuris semper meliora speranda sunt.</hi> It is likewise a
saying often applied by <hi>Magerus, De futuro statuere ex praeteritis, pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
non est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> having spoke of the continual <hi>Changes</hi> of things, and how that
<hi>Bis in idem flumen non descendimus,</hi> &amp;c. saith, <hi>Ego ipse dum haec loquor mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari,
mutatus sum.</hi> We have had instances in former times, and in the
late Conjucture, of the <hi>Sands</hi> of Popery <hi>often shifting</hi> as I called it. The
<hi>Lord-Keeper</hi> Puckering <hi>in his famous Speech,</hi> observed that in one <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
the Puritans did then joyn and concur with the Iesuits:</hi> and the

                  <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Measures of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and our Nominal <hi>Protestants</hi> about the
lawfulness of <hi>Exclusion</hi> have lately been the same. And I think that such
<hi>Protestants</hi> may reasonably conclude, That it was not for nothing, and
not without some end that Divine Providence permitted so many of
them to <hi>erre</hi> therein, and that probably it might be to the end to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in their minds so <hi>great</hi> a degree of <hi>Compassion</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> toward
