         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

REPLY
To the Reverend
DEAN of St. PAULS's
REFLECTIONS
ON THE
RECTOR OF SUTTON, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>NOw thanks (Sir) for your Token; I would have said <hi>New-Years-Gift,</hi>
had it come about a Fortnight sooner. Some told
me lately an Answer was coming forth to my Notes upon the
Doctor's Sermon; but I could not imagin how I should have
a fair and just Answer from him, without his putting forth <hi>another Edition</hi>
of his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> (and it must be <hi>Another</hi> indeed, quite different from the
former;) or else giving us an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> to the former, that we
may know what he would have expunged; or (which would have been
most satisfactory, and not unreasonable) his publishing a <hi>Book of Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
shewing in what Particulars, and upon what Grounds and Reasons
his Mind is since changed.</p>
            <p>Upon the perusal of this Voluminous Writing of his, which must pass
for a <hi>Confutation</hi> of his Five Answerers; I can find so little or nothing said
to me, that were it not for <hi>Three Conclusions</hi> he lays down in his <hi>Preface,</hi>
(p. 72, 73.) and <hi>Three Letters,</hi> which for my sake, upon account of what
I had said (as it seems Preface <hi>pag.</hi> 76.) he annexeth as an <hi>Appendix,</hi> at
the End of his Book, I should not have thought my self concerned to make
any Reply.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47910:3"/>I cannot find, that ever he vouchsafes to take notice of so much as one
of my <hi>Twelve Queries,</hi> which (though I remember they were written in
great haste, yet) some of them (I think) are pinching.</p>
            <p>My <hi>First Query</hi> (to name no more) wise, impartial Men think it
would have been an Act of <hi>Iustice</hi> and Honesty, as well as of <hi>Charity,</hi>
Ingenuity, Self-denial, for him to have well considered, and to have
given a serious and satisfactory Answer unto. How knoweth he, but
some, yea, many may have that to say to him, <hi>Si Error est quod credo, a te
deceptus sum,</hi> If I be in an Error, you have led me into it, or have helpt to
conhrm me in it.</p>
            <p>I thought I had demonstrated to the Doctor, that he was <hi>besides his
Text</hi> That the Word, the Scripture-Rule is that <hi>same Rule</hi> the Apostle
would have Christians walk by (<hi>Phil</hi> 3. 16.) And that the <hi>Establisht
Rule,</hi> the Doctor would have it applyed to, is such a Rule, as he himself
hath told the World the Apostles and <hi>Primo-Primitive</hi> Christians had not.
And if they had no such Rule, nor would ever have establisht such a Rule,
then it certainly follows, the Apostle should not be supposed there to press
Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ians to <hi>walk by such a Rule,</hi> (which was no Rule with him) [viz.
<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 10, 11, 17, f. 18.] Yet I observe, where he pretends
to lear the Text from all Objections, (<hi>pag. 163 to</hi> 176.) he says not
one word to this <hi>Material Objection.</hi> And so he waves what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
says, (Answer <hi>pag.</hi> 29.) What he replieth to others, I suppose they will
consider. Here (I conceive) he cannot well say, as <hi>pag.</hi> 333. <q>
                  <hi>I decline
nothing that looks like Argument.</hi> And <hi>pag. 393. I have not concealed the
Force and Strength I saw in any of them.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There I thought it sufficient to argue from the Doctor's former <hi>Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
or rather his plain <hi>Assertions,</hi> taking the Matter to be so clear and
evident, that no sober Man, and much less he, would deny. But if he
had put me to <hi>prove,</hi> that the Apostles did not, neither would ever establish
such a Rule, nor could have established it, (as Apostles as commissionated by
Christ, as infallible Guides and Governours of the Church) I should have
counted it an <hi>easie Task,</hi> especially when he hath done it so well to my
hand, from <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28, &amp;c. This one hint may suffice at present, the
Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le <hi>Peter was to be blamed</hi> for that by his Example, only he would have
drawn the Gentile-Believers at <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Jewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<hi>Gal. 2. 11, 14. Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Iews?</hi>
The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who thus reproved him, yet says himself, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 20. Vnto
the Iews, I became as a Iew.</hi>—And those Ceremonies he conformed to
among the Jewes, (as at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) were in themselves <hi>as lawful</hi> and
<hi>innocent,</hi> as the Ceremonies imposed among us. But he would not have
the Gentiles <hi>compell'd</hi> to more than was necessary. He that was so moved,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47910:3"/>
and offended, to see but an <hi>Example</hi> leading that way, how much more
would he have <hi>withstood</hi> any (one, or more) that were for <hi>establishing such
a Rule?</hi> Yet the Doctor tells us, he is certain, he did not mistake the
sence of his Text, Preface <hi>pag.</hi> 63.</p>
            <p>But let such things pass, as the Doctor hath pleased to do. And if he
had let all pass that hath been said, that the Controversies he hath raised,
might have been laid asleep, or had used other Methods and Measures
than he hath taken, I should have been better satisfied, than I can be with
his present Answer. I am sorry we did not all put him in mind of that,
<hi>Praestat motos componere fluctus.</hi> However (Sir) I must acknowledg your
Kindness, in sending me this [<hi>Impartial Account,</hi> &amp;c.] (as it is called)
and that you have since furnished me with his [<hi>Rational Account</hi>] also,
wherein you have greatly pleasured me. Many Years since I looked into
it, and doubted not, (when I was writing those former Papers) but I
could have made some use of it; but I could not then meet with the Book,
for want of which I looked on those Collections as incompleat.</p>
            <p>Truly (Sir) I was in hope the learned Doctor had retained that same
Spirit of Moderation towards his dissenting Brethren, which those sober
moderate Principles he hath published, and commended unto others here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
spake him to have. How strange is it, that the Reverend Doctor,
should ever forget the <hi>Rector of Sutton?</hi> And is it not as strange, that he
should be for silencing such a one (as of Scismatical Principles?) Or to
speak more plainly, should be ashamed to own him in that worthy Work,
so full of Learning and Judgment, meriting Praise, rather than Censure:
But it is too plain here, he hath deserted the <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> and that <hi>in
a Matter wherein</hi> he was in the right, and <hi>had the strongest Reason on his side,</hi>
and hath <hi>given up the Cause</hi> to such an imposing Party, as before e had
condemned. And what is the matter that the Reverend Doctor is so
highly offended at me, for desiring he would renew his old Acquaintance
with one so near him, and be friends again? None in the World being nearer
to him, if that be true, <hi>Proximus sum egomet mihi;</hi> unless he will say, and
make that good (in none of the best sence) <hi>Ego non sum ego.</hi> Now I am
heartily sorry, if we may <hi>see Reason to change our Opinion</hi> of him, as he says
we may, <hi>of some Persons, as well as Things, in twenty Years time,</hi> (Preface
<hi>pag.</hi> 76.)</p>
            <p>Sure I am, it either does, or ought to grieve me at heart, to see his
Hand at such dividing Work, who of all the dignified Persons in <hi>England,</hi>
I had thought, was specially engaged, and hoped also, was as well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
to promote Union what in him lay; but not to widen Differences,
by pressing and pleading so hard for Dividing-Terms. When certain
Bishops were met, that sought nothing more, than that poor <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47910:4"/>
might be oppressed, <hi>Doli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, rose up, and took <hi>Maximus</hi> (who, as I remember, had been a <hi>Confessor</hi>)
by the hand, saying, <hi>Neque te decet unà inter istos sedere.</hi> So I thought it
least became the Reverend Doctor to appear with the forwardest in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
his dissenting Brethren, whose Cause he had so well pleaded in
time past. He begins his Preface with a Story of the learned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> (which I leave to others to examine) But here I
call to mind the Story of Bishop <hi>Lindsey,</hi> a Scotish-Bishop, who before
he came to his Dignity, had given this Question at St. <hi>Andrew's, Whether
things indifferent once abused, and for their Abuse abolished?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Negatur.</hi>
Where he could bid Defiance to those that were for retaining such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.
Yet afterwards he was a zealous Contender for them, turning
<hi>Disce pati,</hi> into <hi>Dissipate.</hi> And the great complaint of him was, that in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Brethren, he remembred not what he was once himself, that
he pittied not his former Case (as some of them said) in their Persons,
as <hi>Augustine</hi> did the <hi>Manichees,</hi> greater Hereticks than he took them to be,
<hi>Let them be fierce</hi> (rigorous) <hi>against you, who never were deceived with the like
Error, as they see you. But as for me, I can use no such Rigor against you, with
whom I ought to bear now, as I did at that time with my self,</hi> &amp;c. Thus I
could wish the Doctor would be as favourable as it becometh him to be,
in his Censures of his Brethren, who are very much of the same mind, he
was of once</p>
            <p>And therefore I shall once again apply my self to him.</p>
            <p>Reverend Sir;</p>
            <p>I do not very well know, whether that Title [<hi>The Rector of Sutton
committed with the Dean of St. Paul's</hi>] makes you more angry, or merry.
This I know, those Papers of mine went out of my hands, without any
Title: who put that to it I know not.</p>
            <p>The Title, you say, (<hi>Preface</hi> p. 71.) <q>
                  <hi>Was enough to make the common
People imagine this was some busie Iustice of Peace, who had taken them
both at a Conventicle.</hi>
               </q> And I confess the word [<hi>Committed</hi>] might
puzzle those that could not English <hi>bonos inter sese committere</hi> (there <hi>p.</hi> 7.)
But sure you had no thought of my being a <hi>Iustice of Peace,</hi> any more than
I should suspect the <hi>Dean of St. Paul's</hi> (since I have heard of and seen
what he hath both preached, and written against them) would frequent
Conventicles. However you rub up my Memory here, that I have one
thing to put you in mind of, though perhaps you'l call me a <hi>busie Informer</hi>
for it, in your Next. And yet call me at your pleasure, so that it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
you to more favourable Thoughts of <hi>truly Religious Assemblies,</hi> such as
you have condemned, as <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and <hi>separate Meetings.</hi> In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times of <hi>England</hi>'s Distractions and Confusions, I being unsatisfied
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47910:4"/>
of the Lawfulness of keeping (in publick) either those days of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
for Victories, or of Fasting and Prayer for a Blessing on those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and Forces that then were, (as appointed) it happened that Mr.
<hi>S.</hi> preached in my place upon one of these Fast-days (I suppose at the
Request of some, but unknown to me) The Text in <hi>Deut. For this is your
Wisdom</hi> &amp;c. which some remember still, though it is about twenty Years
since, when I (at the same time) had a private Meeting at St. <hi>Lawrence</hi>'s,
as one called it. This I confess may look something like a personal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;
but my end here is, that you would be pleased to resolve me these
Queries, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether ever you accounted this Act Schismatical, preaching without
the Consent of the <hi>Rector</hi> of the Parish? Or the Assembly that joyned,
at that time, Schismaticks? Yet was here no breach of Order. Or were
there no Churches in <hi>England</hi> then, or till your establisht Rule came in?
And yet, Sir, I had never the less Esteem of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> at that time, or of
others, who were satisfied to go farther than I durst.</p>
            <p>Again, Whether was our private Meeting at that time a sinful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,
when the far greater part of the Parish was with him at Church?
I hope you will grant it was a lawful, because a Loyal Conventicle.</p>
            <p>But so much to your Reflection on the <hi>Title</hi> of my former Papers.
Now Sir, consider whether we have not more just Exceptions against this
of yours.</p>
            <p>(1.) The <hi>unreasonableness of Separation.</hi>] Here 1. Consider whether
you do not condemn that as <hi>Separation,</hi> which is not. And is that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable?
all Assemblies, distinct from yours, are not separate Meetings,
as the World is used in an evil sence; no, though they differ in some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Mode, or Circumstances of Worship, many that ordinarily joyn
with you in the substantial parts of Worship, and meet not in Opposition;
yet I cannot discern, but their Meetings fall under your Censure, as much
as others, because they keep not to your establish'd Rule, when (<hi>Preface
pag.</hi> 40.) you speak of an <hi>unaccountable Separation, without regard to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or smalness of Parishes,</hi> &amp;c. doth not that imply, that there may be some
Account given for assembling to worship God, where there is a regard to
this, to the Abilities and Piety of Ministers, and to the Peace and Order
of the Church? And therefore the thing is not so <hi>unreasonable</hi> as you would
make it. (2.) What if I prove (in examining your Three Conclusions)
from the Principles you lay down in your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> and <hi>Rational Account</hi>
too, that many are necessitated to separate from your Communion; Is
Separation unreasonable, when necessary? Or will you allow others to
say, that there you have pleaded for <hi>unreasonable Separation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47910:5"/>(2.) An <hi>Impartial Account,</hi> &amp;c. you call it. Here I might say, I was
glad to see you promising <hi>Impartiality</hi> in this Work, having found so little
of it in your Sermon: but upon search <hi>Quantâ de spe decidi?</hi> The Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
you have discovered is so great, and in so many Particulars, that if
I should <hi>ransack every Corner of your Book</hi> (as you speak) to collect all such
Passages, I fear I should be very tedious and irksome to you and other
Readers. But</p>
            <p>1. May not some of the common People, who have read either what
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> says of it, or Mr. <hi>Newcomen</hi> (in <hi>Serm.</hi> on <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1642.) take
you to be partial in setting down the Jesuit <hi>Contzens</hi> Directions for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Popery (<hi>Preface pag.</hi> 19, 20.) In that you take no notice of <hi>putting
out of Honours, Dignities, and publick Offices such as are most adverse to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
or of the <hi>outing of Ministers,</hi> as unpeaceable, proud, obstinate, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to Magistrates: And <hi>forbidding them privately, or publickly to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble?</hi>
And take no notice of that, <hi>How easie is it</hi> (as he says) <hi>in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>to bring the Puritans into Order, if they be forced to approve of</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?
&amp;c. Here I think of your Words, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <q>
                  <hi>I do not say, such Men
are set on by Iesuits, but I say, they do their work as effectually.</hi>
               </q>—So it would
be considered, whether such Methods do not effectually promote the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
design of reducing Popery. You may give us to understand (<hi>Preface
pag.</hi> 22.) that <hi>the Declaration of Indulgence</hi> 167½ <hi>was of the Papists procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi>
but we must not say, that the turning out of many zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Justices, and Ministers, was any way by their means.</p>
            <p>2. Are you impartial in the Account you give of the Reformation in
King <hi>Edward</hi> 6 and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Raign? Did the Reformation lie in
those things wherein Dissenters differ from you? Then you must say,
that those Churches which <hi>aimed at an exact Conformity with the Apostolick
Times,</hi> and (as <hi>Chillingworth</hi> says) <hi>took their Direction only from Scripture,</hi>
were yet so far unreformed, as they wanted our Ceremonies. Though
it soundeth very harshly, to say that those Churches who were more
conformed to the Scripture Rule, were less reformed. But you
spake more impartially, and more to the honour of our First Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<hi>Irenic. pag.</hi> 124. which you was minded of, (<hi>Rector of Sutton</hi> p. 6.)
<hi>Certainly those holy Men, who did seek by any means to draw in others,</hi> &amp;c.
And by that <hi>Rubrick,</hi> which left it at the discretion of the Minister, what,
and how much to read, when there was a Sermon, it is evident, others since
have sought to bear up their Authority by their Names, who have been
far from their Moderation.</p>
            <p>I cannot but wonder at your <hi>Harangue</hi> (Book <hi>pag.</hi> 6.) <hi>
                  <q>Is it credible,
that Men of so great Integrity, such indefatigable Industry, such profound
Iudgment,</q> as</hi> Cranmer <hi>and</hi> Ridley, <hi>who were the Heads of the Reform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47910:5"/>
should discern no Sinfulness in these things.—Could not</hi> Latimer, <hi>or</hi> Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
<hi>or such holy, mortified Men as they, discern so much as a Mote of Vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness?</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is granted, they were Learned, Pious, Excellent Men; yet it need
not seem strange, much less incredible, that such worthy Men should in
some things mistake. Does not <hi>A. B. Laud</hi> tell you, <hi>Reformation is so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
a Work, and subject to so many Pretentions, that 'tis almost impossible but
the Reformers should step too far, or fall too short in some smaller things or other?</hi>
I suppose you may have Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Manuscript still by you; and
are you of his Iudgment in all things? I do not find it so, comparing
what you published, as his Judgment in your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> and what you
have published in this Book, as your own. And <hi>Latimer,</hi> that Zealous
and Faithful Martyr, (as I remember) at the end of his Sermons, used
to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ite the Hearers to Prayer, and therein to <hi>remember such as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this Life.</hi> Now must we therefore conclude, there is not a Mote
of Unlawfulness in praying for the Dead, that otherwise such an holy
Man as <hi>Latimer,</hi> would not have been for it? Most true it is, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Times they lived in, and the Temper of the Persons they had to
deal with, it was the great Work of God to carry on Reformation so far
by them. But I cannot say, but their Hearts were to have carried it on
further, if the Times would have born it. (More Shame it is to others,
that have had fairer Opportunities since, and yet have not minded the
Work.) <hi>History of the Troubles at Franksford</hi> (printed 1575, reprinted
164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>p.</hi> 42.) telleth of one that said, Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> had drawn up a Book of
Prayer, an hundred times more perfect, but the Clergy and Convocation
with other Enemies would not let it pass. And there followeth something
further worth your noting (<hi>pag.</hi> 43.) that <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llinger</hi> told <hi>Whittingham,</hi> Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> asked his Judgment concerning certain Points of that
(our) Book, as <hi>Surplice, private Baptism, Churching Women,</hi> the <hi>Ring in
Marriage,</hi> with such like, which (as he said) he allowed not, and that
he neither could if he would, neitherwould if he might use the same in his
Church, whatsoever had been reported. Therefore (say I) such a Man
as <hi>Bullinger</hi> would not have been for imposing the same on others.</p>
            <p>As to the Reformation in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, it was not
brought in, nor brought on with a rigorous Imposition of those things in
Controversie; as <hi>Ball<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> against <hi>Can,</hi> Part 2. <hi>p.</hi> 13. In the first ten Years of
Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was sweet consent among Brethren.—I think there

               </gap> and Contentions following. <hi>Iosias Nichol's
(Plea of the Innocent,</hi> p. 210, 217, printed 1602,) thus: Some five Years
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47910:6"/>
together, before that unhappy time that Subscription was so generally
offered, (which is now some 18 Years past) there was such Unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Ministers, and they joyned in all places so lovingly, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
in Labour; that not only did the unpreaching Minister and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resident
quake, and prepare themselves in measure to take pains in the
Church; but also many thousands were converted from <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
&amp;c. But <hi>when Subscription came abroad,</hi> how did it shake the Heavens,
and darken the Skies? (O Lord my Heart trembleth to think upon it)
how many godly, and worthy learned Preachers were silenced, deprived,
and greatly disgraced! How were the holy Ministers divided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted!
How were the Christian Subjects grieved and offended, and the
Papists and wicked Men encouraged and emboldened! What a damp
brought it to all Godliness and Religion? and since that time what horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Wickedness, Whoredom, Drunkenness, and all shameless Filthiness,
and what grievous Plagues of God, one succeeding another, have followed,
evey good Christian Subject must needs see and lament? So he who was
no <hi>Separatist.</hi> And I hope Sir, you and I are agreed, that these things last
spoken of, were <hi>no part of</hi> England'<hi>s Reformation.</hi> And now Sir, give me
leave to tell you (in some of your own Words, <hi>Preface</hi> p. 47.) <hi>We were
in a lamentable case as to the Defence of the Reformation, if we had no more to
plead for it,</hi> (than we have indeed to plead for such mischievous Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.)
And this seems to have been the sence of the <hi>Queen's Council</hi> in
that Letter, which the <hi>modest Enquiry</hi> (p. 16, 17.) lays before you.</p>
            <p>Therefore Sir, I beseech you, as you would not <hi>blast the Credit, and
Honour of the Reformation,</hi> place it not in such things, as rather brought a
<hi>Deformation</hi> on us.</p>
            <p>Here I know not well how to reconcile you to your self. For, <hi>p.</hi> 365.
You say, <q>It was the great Wisdom of our Church not to make more
things necessary (as to Practice) than were made so at the Settlement
of our Reformation; but whether there be sufficient Reason to alter those
Terms of Communion which were then settled, for the sake of such
whose Scruples are groundless and endless, I do not take upon me here
to determine.</q> And <hi>Preface p.</hi> 53 <q>Although the Arguments are very
plausible one way, yet the Objections are very strong <hi>another.</hi> The Union
of Protestants, the Ease of scrupulous Consciences, the providing for so
many poor Families of ejected Ministers</q> (but not a word of providing
for so many poor Congregations, and dark corners of the Land, that have
need of them) <q>
                  <hi>Are great Motives on one side.</hi> But the <hi>weighty Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the other side,</hi> pag. 54.</q> And <hi>double in number</hi> too, as you reckon.
So here I see your Mind, as you hold the Scales, you might, and would
determine that there is <hi>no sufficient Reason to alter those Terms of Communion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47910:6"/>
which (in the great Wisdom of our Church) were setled, for the sake of such,
whose Scruples are groundless and endless.</hi> For certainly those Arguments
that are only <hi>plausible</hi> with you, would not weigh down such as are <hi>strong</hi>
and cogent, nor a few Motives weigh down more <hi>weighty Consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rations.</hi>
But then, what did you think of, when you put that Question, <hi>Preface,</hi>
p. 81. <q>Is there nothing to be done for Dissenting Protestants?—Do
we value a few indifferent Ceremonies, and some late Declarations, and
doubtful Expressions, beyond the satisfaction of Mens Consciences, and
the Peace and Stability of this Church?</q> And how happy had <hi>England</hi>
been, if such things had not been so over-valued! <hi>As to this material Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you deliver your Opinion</hi> (you say) <hi>freely and impartially.</hi> How Sir!
what? Are you for <hi>altering what was setled in so great Wisdom, by Men of so
great Integrity, such indefatigable Industry, such profound Iudgment? Is this
for the Honour of our Reformation? Is not this to blast the Credit of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not take upon me, to animadvert upon the whole of your Answer
to this <hi>material Question,</hi> presuming it will be scann'd by some of better
Judgment. Only one or two things I cannot but take notice of. So I
heartily thank you for that, <hi>P.</hi> 82. (3.) <q>Notwithstanding, because the
use of Sacraments in a Christian Church ought to be the most free from
all Exceptions, and they ought to be so administred, as rather to invite
than discourage scrupulous Persons from joyning in them; I do think, it
would be a part of Christian Wisdom and Condescension (<hi>only here I would
say,</hi> Duty) in the Governours of our Church, to remove those Bars from
a Freedom in joyning in a full Communion.</q> Now thanks for thus much:
and hold to it, Sir. Tho I have two great and learned Men of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> (worthy of Note with you) just at hand, that grant as much
of other parts of God's Worship, as you do of Sacraments; <hi>scil.</hi> that they
should be free from all Exceptions. See <hi>Hales</hi> of Schism, (in <hi>Miscel. p.</hi>
216, 217, 218.) And you were once of his Mind, <hi>Irenic. p.</hi> 120. And
<hi>Chillingworth, p. 180. If all Men would believe the Scripture, and freeing
themselves from Prejudice and Passion, would sincerely endeavour to find the true
Sence of it, and live according to it, and require no more of others, but to do so;
nor denying their Communion to any that do so, would so order their publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, that all which do so, may without Scruple, or Hypocrisy, or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
against any part of it, joyn with them in it: who does not see that,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, I cast my Eye on that, <hi>p.</hi> 87. where you would have indulged
Persons to pay Twelve pence a Sunday for their absence from the Parochial
Churches, which (you say) <hi>cannot be complained of as any heavy Burthen.</hi>
Which such will not thank you for. You would have them indulged, and
not indulged. And is Twelve Pence a Week no burden to those, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47910:7"/>
with hard Labour have much ado to maintain their Families, can scarce
clear Twelve Pence <hi>per</hi> Week? See what it is to be rich in this World, that

               </hi> may well be understood
of quitting their former <hi>publick Employments</hi> (with whose Testimony you
make so great a Flourish, <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22.) <q>What! is <hi>Beza</hi> for silencing, and
stopping the Mouths of such a number of faithful and able Ministers?—
Would <hi>Beza,</hi> even <hi>Beza,</hi> at such a time as that, be for silencing so many
Preachers?—It appears that <hi>Beza</hi> was not of the Mind of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries—
That he expresseth no such terrible apprehensions at their quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Places, as he doth at their Preaching in opposition to the Laws.</q>
To which I return, Were not the Non-conformists generally, both at that
time, and since, for <hi>quitting their Places,</hi> rather than holding on in publick,
to the defiance of the Laws? They have desired, as far as they could, to
avoid the exasperating of Rulers. They were not for <hi>opposing Sword to
Sword,</hi> as <hi>Bradshaw</hi> has it; they were not movers of Sedition, nor have
been to this day. And would Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> even Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> be for their
silencing, yet he says, (in his <hi>Search for the English Schismatick. p.</hi> 37.) <q>It
is not their Judgment (speaking of the meer Non-conformists) that they
are bound to Preach, when by opposing violence, or the offending of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
it is likely to do more hurt than good, and once preaching to deprive
them of all the usefulness of their Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But I doubt not, there are many Christians yet alive, who can remember
some of the old Non-conformists, and their <hi>preaching in private Houses,</hi>
when suspended from Preaching in Churches. One writes me word, that
Mr. <hi>Hildersam</hi> used to preach in his own House, when silenced; and two
or three Families came to hear him. Another special Friend, helping me
to a sight of some Papers of Mr. <hi>E. Reyner</hi> (formerly) of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> I meet
with this considerable Passage: <q>For me to preach in this Place, and at
this Time, is no way necessary, since others may do it, and I my self
(tho put by here) may do it as well and freely elsewhere, as in <hi>New-England,
Ireland, Scotland, Holland;</hi> yea, haply in some remote out-wing of
the Kingdom. And thus God (in his ordinary Providence) doth order it,
that his Church gains much by this course of removing Ministers, and
transplanting the Gospel to such Places, as never heard the sound thereof
before; and in the mean while they may have time to do much good in
private, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And I think this was the general Sence of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
that they did not look on the censure of Suspension, (if unjust) as
a sufficient discharge from the exercise of their Ministry. Had they thought
themselves bound to cease Preaching, whensoever they were prohibited by
Men, they were honester Men, than to act so contrary to their Judgment;
as they used frequently to preach, (tho more privately, or in Places where
they were not known) when suspended by the Bishops. But these things
were not to be publickly talkt of then, when the <hi>High Commission-Court</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47910:8"/>
was up, and there was such Inquisition after their Meetings.</p>
            <p>I have this Account of Mr. <hi>Simeon Ash,</hi> from one (whose Father's
House was as his home sometimes) that when he was sought after by
Pursevants, coming to them, they had Meetings in the Night-time.
Another, (a Minister) tells me he hath heard from Ancient Christians in
<hi>Ringly</hi> Congregation, that Mr. <hi>Iohn Angier,</hi> sometimes Minister there, being
silenced, and having his Chappel suspended by the <hi>Bishop of Chester,</hi> used to
preach to divers in his own House, till such times as he was removed to
<hi>Denton.</hi> I suppose, there are some in those Parts (yet alive) that can
testify so much; Mr. <hi>Westowbye</hi> I well knew. His <hi>Bible</hi> was his <hi>Licence.</hi>
The Courts could not take him off, but he would be at his Work, in one
place or other. Once after my preaching for him, (when he was scarce
able to get into the Pulpit for Age, and Weakness accompanying it) he
entertained me with a Discourse of much of his Life past, the Troubles
and Opposition he had met with in the World, and the great Experience
he had of the most <hi>encouraging Success</hi> of his Ministry under his greatest
Troubles, that in his Travels he could write to his Wife, (as he said)
that <hi>God bad given him many Children</hi> she knew not of.</p>
            <p>But to enquire after the Practice of particular Persons would be a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and endless Work. You have the <hi>Iudgment of the Assembly,</hi> under that
Head of <hi>Ordination,</hi> where they would have the Person to be ordained,
declare his <hi>sincere Intentions</hi> and Ends in entring into this Calling: And his
<hi>Resolution</hi> to continue <hi>against all Trouble and Persecution.</hi> If that Assembly
were <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> then you see there the <hi>Iudgment of the Non-conformists.</hi>
But if they were generally <hi>Conformists,</hi> then you see, wee have the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Learned Synod of <hi>Conformists</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>4. Are you not too <hi>partial</hi> in <hi>allowing Protestants to be occasionally present
at some parts of Worship in the Roman Church, and that frequently too, to hear
Sermons,</hi> &amp;c. (how far your <hi>et caetera</hi> may reach, others cannot tell, till you
better inform them) while you do not allow them to be present at the
Worship performed in the Assemblies of Dissenters? The former you are
for, <hi>pag.</hi> 108. To your Question there, <hi>doth this make a Man to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of Rome?</hi> I answer, yea, so far as he joyns in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
so far he has Communion with them. Sure you will not deny a
Man to have any Communion with you in hearing the Word preached, who
comes for that End, and that frequently too. So here you must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to grant <hi>Occasional Communion with the Roman Church</hi> in hearing of
Sermons, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and <hi>that frequently too,</hi> to be lawful. Now this is more than
you allow to Dissenters, <hi>pag.</hi> 98. <q>No Man denies, that more places for
Worship are desireable, and would be very useful, where they may be
had, and the same way of Worship, and Order observed in them, as in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47910:8"/>
our Parochial Churches; where they may be under the same Inspection,
and Ecclesiastical Government.—But, is it possible that Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
should think the Case alike, where the Orders of our Church are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
neglected, the Authority of the Bishops is slighted and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and such Meetings are kept up in Affront to them, and the Laws?</q>
Here you say in Effect, that let Parishes be never so large, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of Souls never so urgent, the Assemblies of Dissenters are not
desirable, nor to be encouraged, because not under you establish'd Rule.
But either you must grant, it may be lawful to <hi>joyn occasionally, and that
frequently too,</hi> with the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> or you must judg them worse than
<hi>Popish Teachers,</hi> and say that it was better for Men to hear these, than such
as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> &amp;c. I know not whether you might fear the least counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
of <hi>occasional Communion</hi> with <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> lest any should
thence argue from your own Words, that <hi>constant Communion with them is
a Duty.</hi> I am thinking however, that the Papists may thank you for so
much Kindness to them, that you grant it lawful for Protestants to be
<hi>occasionally present</hi> in some parts of their Worship. And let them alone to
make their best of what you say, <hi>you are sure will follow, p.</hi> 176. and <hi>p.</hi> 77.
<q>As far as Men judg Communion lawful, it becomes a Duty, and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
a Sin; under what Denomination soever the Persons pass.—
Because then Separation appears most unreasonable, when occasional
Communion is confessed to be lawful.</q> If they can get Protestants to
joyn with them ordinarily, though but <hi>in some parts of their Worship at first,</hi>
its possible, they would gain far more Proselites by it, than <hi>Non-conformists</hi>
have drawn or would draw into Separation.</p>
            <p>You seem to suppose great Force and Virtue in that <hi>Salvo,</hi> p. 156. <q>A
Man is not said to separate from every Church, where he forbears or
ceases to have Communion; but only from that Church, with which
he is obliged to hold Communion.</q> As if a Christian was only obliged
to Communion with some one particular Church. Yet you will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your self, not only as a <hi>Member of the Church of</hi> England, but as a
<hi>Member of the Catholick Church.</hi> And as you are a Member of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, it may possibly sometimes fall out, that you may be <hi>obliged</hi>
to have <hi>Communion occasionally</hi> with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Church, or a <hi>French</hi> Church.
And if <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> with their Assemblies may be proved as sound
parts of the Church Catholick, as others you can freely have Communion
with, and while they differ from you in nothing, but if the same was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
your Churches might be every jot as sound and pure, I can see
<hi>no sufficient Reason</hi> why you might not as <hi>lawfully</hi> have Occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them; and then for ought I know, you may be obliged
thereunto, it may be <hi>a Duty.</hi> Because you wholly overlook this, I thought
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47910:9"/>
fit to take notice of it. And further I would put you in mind of your own
Arguments, <hi>pag.</hi> 157. viz.</p>
            <p>1. <q>The general Obligation upon Christians to use all lawful Means for
preserving the Peace and Unity of the Church.</q> And here I ask, If there
be not <hi>as great an Obligation</hi> at least, upon Christians to <hi>preserve Peace,</hi> or
promote it <hi>with all Christians, as with all Men:</hi> And <hi>they are bound to that,
as far as possible, and as much as lies in them,</hi> Rom. 12. 18. And if you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the present Dissenters to be as bad as the <hi>Donati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

with the</hi> Donatists?—<hi>if occasion so require,</hi> And <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 209. <hi>In all publick
Meetings pretending Holiness, so there be nothing done but what true Devotion
and Piety break, why may not I be present in them, and use Communication with
them?</hi>

            <p>2 <q>The particular force of that Text, <hi>Phil. 3. 16. As far as you have

the provoking Sins of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> that they have been so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in doing what they were convinced they might have done, with

Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> (yet you tell us not what things those are, neither
the time when they were pressed thereunto, and refused the same. And I
never heard of any Motions or Overtures for Peace, that were reasonable,
made to them, which they refused.) But you never take notice of it, as
any <hi>provoking</hi> Sin, in those that would not hearken to their most just and
earnest <hi>Petition for Peace.</hi> Might not they with a good Conscience have
forborn those <hi>needless Impositions,</hi> which they very well knew would be
so grievous and burdensome to many? And might not so much have been
expected from them, as they would profess themselves to be for <hi>Vnity and
Peace?</hi> May I not here return your own Words; <hi>pag.</hi> 159. <q>Was ever

valued at so low a Rate; that for the Prevention of the one, and the
Preserevation of the other, a thing that is lawful may not be done?</q>
(Or as I would say, that the imposing of things <hi>indifferent,</hi> and <hi>not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi>
in their own Judgment, but things <hi>doubtful, or unlawful</hi> in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>Now, (Sir) are you for <hi>palliating so great Sin,</hi> as the causing of Schism
and Dissention in the Church, when you know, <q>The Obligation which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47910:9"/>
lieth upon all Christians, to preserve the Peace and Unity of the Church,
(which you give us again, <hi>p.</hi> 209.)</q> And I find you citing these words of

(as Christians?) concerning which, something is proposed there (from
<hi>Mr. B.</hi>) to others Consideration. This the Author of the <hi>Anti-Queries</hi>
took little notice of, which engaged me to mind him of it again, in my
<hi>Reply,</hi> p. 25, 26. And yet I have met with no other Answer from him,
but that he is loth at present to give an Answer to it, intreating all his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47910:10"/>
Friends to take it into Consideration, because it is a <hi>matter of Moment,</hi> and
<hi>common Concern. (T. G's Controversy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>epitomised,</hi> p. 64.) From whence
I conclude, if such Terms of Moderation were offered, they would be hard
put to it, scarce know what to say for a standing off, and denying to have
Communion with Christians of a different Perswasion; but they would
have enough to say against your Terms: and that from your self, and not
only in your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> but in your <hi>Rational Account, p.</hi> 209. <q>It is a very
necessary Enquiry, what the cause of (the distance) is, and where the
main Fault lies; and it being acknowledge that there is a possibility, that
Corruptions may get into a Christian Church, and it being impossible to
prove, that Christianity obligeth Men to communicate with a Church,
in all those (they will say, in any) Corruptions, its Communion may
be tainted with; it seems evident to Reason, that the cause of the Breach
must lie there, where the Corruptions are owned, and imposed, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I should have hoped, that at least you would have granted the conditions
put upon Ministers to be very hard; yet I find nothing, but <hi>a deep silence</hi>
here. Tho Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> says, <q>I am satisfied that it is in it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf a great and
`dreadful Sin to silence the Non-conformists. It seems here is a <hi>provoking
Sin,</hi> which you was willing to overlook, tho once in your Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 20.</q>
you were very near it.</p>
            <p>6. Do you speak <hi>Impartially, p.</hi> 378, 379. when you tell us, you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that <hi>none of us have taken any care to put any stop to Separation, or to let
you know, where you may fix and see an end of it; what Scruples are to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and what not?</hi> I will say nothing for those, who are better able to
speak for themselves: but for my self, I thought I had told you plainly,
and sufficiently out of your <hi>Irenicum</hi> (if you will not be offended that I call
it <hi>yours</hi>) where I would have you fix. <hi>Let Christians stand upon the same
terms now, as they did in the time of Christ and his Apostles. Do not add other
conditions of Church-Communion than Christ hath done.</hi> (As <hi>Rector of Sutton,
p.</hi> 6, 7. See also <hi>p.</hi> 59.) If you make no new Terms, and yet others will
separate from you still, the Sin is <hi>theirs:</hi> but if indeed you add other
Terms, then beware, that you be not found the <hi>Schismaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not turn me off here, as you do Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Way of Concord.</hi> You

               </gap>not justly say, we go on in <hi>impracticable Notions</hi> here, or dividing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
(When you have that Word, <hi>Preface p. 38. As tho he had been Christ's
Plenipotentiary upon Earth,</hi> You forgot that others might as well apply it
to the <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> for publishing his <hi>Irenicum.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And I hope you will not deny, but we are backt with great Authority,
when you consider, what King <hi>Iames</hi> tells Cardinal <hi>Du Perron,</hi> by the Pen
of <hi>Isaac Causabon,</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> takes notice of, <hi>Direct. p.</hi> 752.) <hi>His
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47910:10"/>
Majesty thinketh, that for Concord there is no nearer way, than diligently to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
things necessary from the unnecessary, and to bestow all our labour that we may
agree in the things necessary, and that in things unnecessary, there may be place gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for Christian Liberty.</hi> A Golden Sentence! And there is nothing that
can be proved <hi>necessary,</hi> but it must be either <hi>expresly taught,</hi> or <hi>commanded</hi>
in the Word of God, or deduced thence by <hi>necessary Consequence.</hi> And that
of the Lord <hi>Bacon (Essay</hi> 3.) is considerable, who for the <hi>true placing the
Bonds of Vnity, would have Points fundamental, and of Substance in Religion,</hi>
truly discerned and distinguished from Points not meerly of Faith, but of
<hi>Opinion, Order,</hi> or <hi>good Intention.</hi> And <hi>Chillingworth</hi> is full of such <hi>impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Notions,</hi> (if they deserve to be so called,) <hi>p.</hi> 197.—<hi>He that could
assert Christians to that Liberty, which Christ and his Apostles left them, must
needs to Truth a most Heroieal Service. And seeing the over-valuing of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
among Christians, is one of the greatest Maintainers of the Schisme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi>
&amp;c. p. 198. <hi>Certainly if Protestants be faulty in this matter (of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Pope) it is for doing it too much, and not too little.—Take away these
Walls of Separation, and all will quickly be one. Take away this Persecuting,
Burning, Cursing, Damning of Men, for not subscribing to the Words of Men,
as the Words of God: Require of Christians only to believe Christ, and to call no
Man Master but him only; Let those leave claiming Infallibility, that have no
Title to it; and let them that in their Words disclaim it, disclaim it likewise in
their Actions. In a Word, take away Tyranny, which is the Devils Instrument to
support Errors, and Superstitions, and Impieties.—I say, take away Tyranny,
and restore Christians to their just and full Liberty of captivating their Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to Scripture only; and as Rivers when they have a free Passage, run all
to the Ocean: so it may well be hoped, by God's Blessing, that universal Liberty
thus moderated may quickly reduce Christendom to Truth and Vnity.</hi> This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
being to long, I shall add but one more out of him, and that a
shorter, <hi>p. 209. This is most certain, and I believe you will easily grant it, that
to reduce Christians to Vnity of Communion, there are but two ways that may be
conceived probable. The one, by taking away diversity of Opinions, touching
Matters of Religion: The other, by shewing that the diversity of Opinions, which
is among the several Sects of Christians, ought to be no hinderance to their Vnity in
Communion.</hi> Last of all, I close with your <hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 291. <q>And
therefore those lesser Societies cannot in Justice, make the necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Communion narrower, than those which belong to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church: <hi>i. e.</hi> those things which declare Men Christians, ought to
capacitate them for Communion with Christians.</q> (Even an <hi>acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Scriptures as the indispensible Rule of Faith and Manners:</hi> Which
(be pleased to note) is something different from your <hi>late establish'd Rule.</hi>)
Now would you fix here, that those things which <hi>declare Men Christians,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47910:11"/>
shall suffice to capacitate them for Communion with you; how many Mens
Scruples would be removed? and what better way can you think of, to put
a stop to Separation?</p>
            <p>7. Are you <hi>Impartial</hi> in charging all Nonconformist's Meetings with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
tho very many of them ordinarily join with the Parochial Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and do not deny them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o be true Churches, as the old Separatists
did? <hi>p.</hi> 56. <q>It is true, (say you) in that Opinion they differ, but in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
they agree. As in your Sermon <hi>p.</hi> 33. For do they not do the
very same things, and in the same manner, that the others do? how
comes it then to be Separation in some, and not in others?</q> Which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
(<hi>Rector of Sutton, p.</hi> 49.) thus: What they do is not done upon
the Separatists Principles, and therefore not done in the same manner. Yet
you neither <hi>retract</hi> that Saying of yours, nor <hi>refute</hi> my Answer. And have
not others as much reason to object against you, that when you receive
the Sacrament <hi>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeling,</hi> you do the same thing that the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
do: (I do not think it <hi>manifestly appears from the Pope's manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
either sitting, or a little leaning upon his Throne,</hi> as you say, <hi>p.</hi> 15. that
the Papists are allowed to follow him herein.) How then comes that to be
an <hi>Act of Worship</hi> in them, when with you it is no Act of Worship, but a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eer indifferent Ceremony?</p>
            <p>8. Are you not very <hi>Partial,</hi> in loading those that do not absolutely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from you, but only <hi>secundum quid,</hi> as you do, <hi>p.</hi> 54, 55, 56. Making
their Practice, that own you to be true Churches, to be the <hi>more unjustifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
more inexcusable, more unreasonable</hi> Separation? Is it not a greater Schism,
to separate from you, as <hi>no true Church,</hi> than to do it, only because you are
<hi>faulty,</hi> in imposing such Conditions, as they cannot lawfully submit to?
Are they the greatest Separatists, who hold Communion with you, so far
as they can? I should think, they are the greatest Separatists, whose Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is the most <hi>unjustifiable, inexcusable,</hi> and <hi>unreasonable.</hi> As I had
thought, there was not so much reason to <hi>deny the Being of the Church of
England,</hi> while she retaineth the true Faith, and hath the true Worship of
God for substance; as there may be to <hi>doubt of the lawfulness of Ceremonies,</hi>
and Modes of Worship, invented and imposed, without any clear Scripture-Warrant.
And suppose one dares not receive the Communion with you,
because he holdeth <hi>kneeling</hi> in that Act a <hi>participating with Idolaters;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
is kept off, because he suspects there may be some <hi>Superstition</hi> in it?
will you say, the latter is the more unreasonable? And do you not own
those <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, that have <hi>Exorcism</hi> with Baptism, yet to be true
Churches? And if you was placed there, must you therefore own and use
Exorcism, (tho against your Judgment) or be guilty of a more <hi>inexcusable,
unreasonable Separation</hi> from them, than the Papists, who deny them to be
true Churches?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47910:11"/>9. Are you <hi>Impartial,</hi> in allowing a different way of Worship, to the
Members of <hi>Forreign Churches</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> (as <hi>p.</hi> 147, 148.) while you
are against allowing the like Liberty to Natives, which you deny not to
Strangers? Bishop <hi>Davenant (Ad pacem Eccl. Adhort. p. 116. Rat.</hi> 3.) argues,
<hi>That none ought to deal more hardly, with their Christian Brethren of other

You would have your own more hardly dealt with than those of forreign
Churches. Now what Equity is here? Either you have Communion with
those of <hi>Forreign</hi> Churches (not withstanding their different way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
or you have not. If you have no Communion with them, then
are you not <hi>Schismaticks</hi> from those Churches? If you have Communion
with them, why may you not as lawfully have Communion with Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists
in their way of Worship? Can you assign any just and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Cause <hi>ex Natura rei,</hi> why such a way of Worship should not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?</p>
            <p>10. Do you deal <hi>Impartially,</hi> while you complain, <hi>p.</hi> 112. that no <hi>bounds
are set to the Peoples Fancies of purer Administrations;</hi> (concerning which I am
quite mistaken, if I did not wish the <hi>Rector of Sutton</hi> had cautioned what he
said) and you on the other hand, <hi>set no Bounds,</hi> but (by your excepting
against what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath written of it) would have People own, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the care of their Souls to such Ministers, as are in place, be they never
so profane, insufficient, or unsound? Tho Mr. <hi>Cheyney (Full Answer,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Introduct. p.</hi> 7.) grants, <hi>That where God doth make a difference, Men may. Now
God doth make a difference</hi> (says he) <hi>between the Ministry of the best and the worst,
between the Ministry of a</hi> John Baptist <hi>and a Pharisee, a living Man and an

               </q> Where you suppose every Parochial
Church in <hi>England</hi> to be a true Church, and every Parochial Minister (by
consequence) to be a true Minister; unless you would argue fallaciously
there. Tho I had thought it possible to have found out some few at least,
whom you would have been ashamed to own. I cannot but wonder at
that you urge again and again. <hi>p.</hi> 111. <q>Were they not baptized in this

which was in the Church, wherein they were baptized? Or would
you have such Re-baptized? Or can you prove, that unless Men renounce
their Baptism, they must needs own <hi>Diocesan</hi> Churches, and the Parish-Minister

betwixt</hi> tying People to their Parish Minister (though notoriously unfit
for the Ministry,) and suffering them to run after <hi>Quakers,</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> p. 330.
I suppose you approve of that Saying of the Bishops you cite, <hi>pag.</hi> 320.
<q>If he (that was chosen) were worthy, they would consecrate him, but
not otherwise.</q> So you would not have Bishops obliged, or forced to

Institution and Induction to such: Yet I see not, but you would have
<hi>People obliged</hi> to accept of them, if instituted and inducted, though it be

grant a possibility of Salvation,—in case of invincible Ignorance; and dare

say I, their <hi>Non-communion</hi> with you (who yet acknowledg you to be true

(supposing it was never printed, that they may be new to you,
though written many Years since.)</p>
            <p>—<hi>The second Course you direct us to, of seeking Information [but
with all Humility, and Prayer in the use of means (but with all Indifferency)
lest halting with God, as</hi> Balaam <hi>did, we find his success) we readily accept
it, according to the measure of the Truth and Integrity of our Hearts; only we
have cause to be humbled, and fear our own Hearts (for we speak of our selves,
we judge not others) lest any of us yield without such serious search after the
Truth, as you advise, and that for fear of losing what</hi> Balaam <hi>gained. For
ought we see, there is small hopes of gaining</hi> Balaam<hi>'s ways by standing for the
Purity of Gods Ordinances, and therefore less Fear of halting as</hi> Balaam <hi>did,
in seeking and following after that way, which exposeth us to the loss of all the
chiefest Comforts of this Life, and which if it be not the way of Truth, we are of
all true-hearted English-men the most miserable.</hi> And further on, they say,—
<hi>Or suppose (which God forbid) that we were so void of Christianity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
together, as to undo our selves (inward and outward Man, without all
Reason or Conscience;) yet will you pass the same Iudgment upon all those
three hundred Ministers, which in our memories have been deprived for that very
Cause, for which we suffer? Were not some of them such, as the Christian
World never yielded more eminent Lights of Sincerity and true Holiness, since
the Apostles times? And did Misprision, or long Vse make such a fell adoe
in their Hearts also, as to blind their Consciences in this Cause? Was all
their Patience in this Cause for Conscience sake, not a Fruit of God's Spirit in
them, but a Bastard of their own Spirit?</hi> (And Sir, you may be informed,
how some of them suffered for <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>keeping Conventicles,</hi> as they
were called, as well as for <hi>In-conformity.</hi>) Afterwards towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
they have these words, <hi>Consider whether you rightly take such things
for indifferent, when they do not suffer you to carry an indifferent Mind towards
you poor Brethren, which in them only, and in no weightier Matters, do differ from
you.</hi> And let me beg of you to consider it; and once more to consider
your own words, <hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 614. <q>But we have not so learned
Christ, we dare not deal so inhumanly with them in this World, much
less judg so uncharitable as to another, of those who profess to fear
God, and work Righteousness, though they be not of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

               <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> I hope you will give me leave to speak, when I am thus
spoken to. I suppose you expect my Answer, when you put Questions
so close to me. First then, I thank you for your <hi>good pains</hi> taken in that
Book, and for your <hi>truly Christian Design</hi> in it, <hi>so agreeable to the Christian-temper;</hi>
though it hath been unsuccesful. I doubt not yet, but that Book
will <hi>stand as a Witness</hi> before God and the World against many, who can
never answer that Strength of Reason in it, an Evidence of Truth, against

and are still for continuing them upon us. But it is <hi>no ill Requital</hi> of the
Author, that I have an esteem of his Work. And if you can reconcile
the <hi>Scope of your Sermon</hi> with what I cite out of your former Writings, do
your self that Right. Or if you can, refute those <hi>Collections;</hi> otherwise
such as meet with them may be tempted to think you <hi>self-condemned</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you say, you <hi>wrote in Tenderness,</hi> &amp;c. I hope, you did not only
play the Orator, make a flourish meerly with Words; or plead our Cause
against your own Judgment; nor acted the part of Politician, as hoping
to engage a Party; but wrote your Judgment, as a sober (and indeed
<hi>well studied) Divine.</hi> Will you say, you <hi>wrote partially</hi> then, as <hi>swayed</hi>
with your <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Tenderness</hi> towards Dissenters? How then shall we be

            <p>You express your having been <hi>concerned to have brought us in,</hi>—But

<hi>new Terms,</hi> (which I shall have occasion again to take notice of.) But
were we not true Ministers before? had we not a <hi>valid Ordination? Deny
it if you can.</hi> And if we were true Ministers before, then it is a <hi>great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi>
whether we are not so still, (unless you can prove we were <hi>justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded.</hi>)
And consequently, whether we are not <hi>obliged to the exercise of our

                  </gap>ace, and to be thus upbraided with his former Kindness? Is this your
Ingenuity, your Gratitude, your Christian-temper?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now are not these pretty <hi>sharp Reflections?</hi> If you can justly charge me
with any <hi>Bitterness and Rancor,</hi> &amp;c. I shall acknowledg such things not
<hi>agreeable to the Christian-temper,</hi> and would be ashamed of them. If you
are ashamed to own your former Principles, many will judg, it is without
Cause. It may prove you <hi>fallen from those sober Principles,</hi> but it will not
<hi>prove those Principles false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you speak of <hi>my throwing them in your Face,</hi> my Design was not
to <hi>cast Dirt</hi> upon so worthy a Person. What I alledged, I took to be <hi>matter
of Argument,</hi> and with this Advantage, <hi>ad Hominem.</hi> I know no Reason you
have to be sorry for what you wrote formerly, <hi>tending to Peace and Vnion,</hi>
as you may have cause to be sorry for what looks another way. I should
have thought, the <hi>Method</hi> I took (minding you how much you had <hi>said
against such an establisht Rule,</hi> as you would now bring us under) might
have tended to <hi>moderate,</hi> rather than <hi>exasperate</hi> you. What if you have
since changed your Opinion? Yet me-thinks, you should not judge <hi>those
former Principles of yours</hi> so sinful and dangerous, that none are fit to be
<hi>tolerated in the Church</hi> who hold to them. How happy and <hi>glorious</hi> would
the <hi>Church of England</hi> be, had she <hi>no worse Teachers, than Dr. Stilling fleet</hi>
was, when he maintained those Principles? Or if you do account them
so sinful and dangerous, are you not the more <hi>obliged to disprove</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them? which you will find <hi>as hard a Task,</hi> as it would have been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47910:14"/>
to <hi>Grotius,</hi> had he gone about the <hi>Confutation</hi> of what he had written <hi>de
satisfactione Christi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You go on, <q>Are you afraid of having too many Friends, that you
thus use those, whom you once took to be such? Me-thinks herein you
appear very self-denying.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am not careful to answer in this matter. But is it so, that we have
quite lost you? Will you no more stand our Friend? <hi>Where is then the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
you spake of?</hi> I remember, Dr. <hi>Borrel</hi> silenced me, when I had been
silenced not two Months before: But I could not have thought 20 Years
ago, that when we were driven into Corners, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would be <hi>for driving
us out of our Corners</hi> too, even he that could plead so well for us, that we
might enjoy publick Liberty. Here I look back to that (<hi>Preface,</hi> p. 52.)
<q>They would have had me preached for Alterations and Abatements,
and taking away Ceremonies and Subscriptions,—and then I might
have been thought to have preached a very seasonable Sermon.</q> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
would have shewed, that you was still our Friend, and not our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> only,
but as good a Friend to this poor Church and Kingdom. To plead for
<hi>all Abatements</hi> that (<hi>with the Honour of God,</hi> and <hi>safety of true Religion</hi>)
might be granted to Dissenters, for the uniting and strengthening of the
Protestant Interest, in such danger to be trodden down by the common
Enemy, would certainly be <hi>more seasonable,</hi> than this work you are engaged
in.</p>
            <p>I would know, whether that Speech of the <hi>Bishop of St. David</hi>'s in the
Convocation-House, <hi>May</hi> 23, 1604, was not seasonable? Can it ever
be unseasonable, moving for the due Liberty of grave, honest, sound, and
conscientious Men, such as the Church hath need of at all times, and whose
Labours might be very profitable? And then, whether <hi>pleading for Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
at this day be not as seasonable? <hi>I put a great difference</hi> (said he)
<hi>between Quid liceat,</hi> and <hi>Quid expediat,</hi>—And then speaking of those who
were scrupulous only upon some Ceremonies, and other Circumstances,
being otherwise <hi>learned, studious, grave and honest Men, whose Labours have
been both painful in the Church, and profitable to their several Congregations,</hi>
(he says) <hi>though I do not justify their Doings, yet surely their Service would be
missed, at such time as need shall require them, and us to give the right hand of
Fellowship one to another, and to go arm in arm against the common Adversary,
that so there might be</hi> vis unita fortior.—<hi>If these our Breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore, If these Men, being divers hundreds (as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>)

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47910:15"/>
should succeed them.—Besides this, for so much as in the Life-time of the late
Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>these things were not so extreamly urged, but that
many learned Preachers enjoyed their Liberty herein, conditionally that they did
not by Word or Deed openly disgrace, or disturb the State established; I would
know a Reason, why it should now be so generally and exceeding strictly called upon,
especially seeing that those Men are now the more necessary, by so much as we see
greater Increase of Papists to be now of late, than were before. To conclude,
I wish, that if by Petition made to the King's Majesty, there cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a quite remove of the Premises, which seem so grievous to divers, not yet a
Toleration for them, which be of the more staid, and temperate Carriage; yet at
the least, there might be procured a Mitigation of the Penalty, if they cannot
be drawn by other Reasons to a Conformity with us.</hi> Thus the <hi>Bishop of St.
David's.</hi> And if all the Bishops in <hi>England</hi> were of his Mind, and would
move for their Ministerial Liberty, whose Service is needful, at such a
time as this especially, whether would it not be very seasonable? And if
you had a Kindness, and Pity for Dissenters, is there not the same Reason
for it still? And is not <hi>this very Iuncture of Time</hi> as good an Occasion, as
ever you may have to shew it?</p>
            <p>You say further to me, <hi>Preface</hi> p. 72. <q>But I cannot take you to be any
of the wisest Men upon Earth.]</q> And I should wonder if you did. But
you know what <hi>Diogenes</hi> said to one that told him, <hi>many mocked him. But</hi>
(said he) <hi>I am not mocked.</hi> I might well expect your Contempt, when
I see you contemning such, whose Books I am not worthy to carry after
them. Yet it may be questioned here, whether you take not your self
to be wiser, than <hi>the Wisdome of the whole Nation in Parliament,</hi> comparing
your <hi>Preface</hi> p. 81, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the declared Sense of that great and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Council? <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 93. you say, <q>These are all the things which appear to
me reasonable to be allowed in order to an Union.</q> So that if they were
inclined to have gone further, therein they appeared to you not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate,
or reasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When you think it reasonable, that upon longer time, and farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
those Divines of the Assembly, who then opposed Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should change their Opinions:</q> [But where find you this in what I
wrote] <q>Will you not allow one single Person (but <hi>stupendae eruditionis
Theologum,</hi> as the Latine Apologist then called you, <hi>pag.</hi> 118.</q>) <q>Who
happened to write about these matters when he was very young; (as
you may say, Mr. <hi>Ioseph Alleyn</hi> was very young, when he was very ripe)
in twenty Years time of the most busie and thoughtful part of his Life,
to see Reason to alter his Judgment?</q> And yet you was as close a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in that former part of your Life, and as free from other Business,
from Diversions, and Temptations, as can be supposed you have been since.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47910:15"/>
But you should be <hi>allowed to alter your Iudgment,</hi> and none can blame you,
if it be <hi>for the better.</hi> Only in this case, you should be so just, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
as to let us know your Reasons, that if they be sound, we may
<hi>see Cause to alter ours.</hi> I hope, you will not say, <q>Then was then, and
now is now.</q> And can you now assure us, that you shall not alter your
present Judgment once again within twenty Years? We read of Bishops
that have cried <hi>peccavimus</hi> again and again, and of Councils doing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
again, and sometimes in less than twenty Years.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But after all this, wherein is it that he hath thus contradicted himself?
Is it in the point of Separation, which is the present Business? No, so
far from it, that in that very Book, he speaks as fully concerning the
Unlawfulness of Separation, as in this Sermon, which will appear by
these Particulars in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If by <hi>Separation,</hi> you mean a Separation from any Church <hi>upon any slight,
trivial, unnecessary Cause,</hi> as you define Schism, <hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 113. I am not
for such a Separation. But perhaps some may tell you, that if you sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from such Assemblies as Mr. <hi>B. &amp;c.</hi> when you might have <hi>occasional
Communion</hi> with them, you do it <hi>upon far less Cause,</hi> than many separate
from those of yours, where they are required to joyn in Practices more to
be suspected.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>Separation</hi> you mean any assembling for the Worship of God,
<hi>otherwise than according to your establisht Rule;</hi> and so condemn the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of meer <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> that are not of Schismatical Principles; yea,
even their occasional Meetings, and those kept off from the times of

Lawfulness of such Assemblies is, and shall be evidently proved from that

(though mis-informed.) That Man sinneth without doubt, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth

            <p>Now to joyn in <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is an unlawful, or suspected Practice to
some. They take it to be polluted with Superstition. Perhaps they take
Communion herein to be a sinful Symbolizing with the Papists, for what

pag.</hi> 119. <q>Let Men turn and wind themselves which way they will, by
the very same Arguments that any will prove Separation from the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> lawful, because she required unlawful Things, as Conditions of

or unlawful Practice required by any Church-Governours upon
the same Terms,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Thing so required, be after serious and sober
Enquiry, judged unwarrantable by a Man's own Conscience.</q> Which
(with more you have in that Page, and the Page before it) cuts off your
third Particular, <hi>Preface</hi> p. 75. Here now I have gained so much Ground
of you. Such are necessitated to withdraw from your Communion, who
must otherwise <hi>joyn in some unlawful or suspected Practice.</hi> As <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
p. 269. <hi>To do ill that you may do well, is against the Will of God, which to every
good Man is a high Degree of Necessity.</hi> And say you, <hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 290.
<q>Can any one imagine it should be a Fault in any to keep off from
Communion, where they are so far from being obliged to it, that they
have an Obligation to the contrary, from the Principles of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Christianity.</q> Here I assume, they are bound by the <hi>Principles of
common Chrisianity</hi> to keep off from Communion with you, that know they
should certainly sin, if they held Communion with you, because they
should then joyn in suspected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ractices, and things, which after Enquiry,
their Consciences tell them are unlawful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47910:17"/>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> you must say, it cannot be <hi>a Fault</hi> in such to keep off from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with you. Though I would grant them <hi>faulty so far</hi> as any
keep off through Prejudice, Error, Ignorance; yet so far as these are <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi>
they are <hi>more excusable,</hi> than to go directly cross to their own
Consciences here. So therefore such <hi>are necessitated</hi> to withdraw Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
from you, who would certainly sin, if they held Communion with you,
judging such Communion to be sinful.</p>
            <p>2. If you say here, What is this to a <hi>positive Separation,</hi> which is the
present Business? You shall see, it is something towards it. You are
<hi>come a fair Step</hi> on the Way. Once grant that it is lawful for Men (or
that Men are necessitated) to deny Communion with you in <hi>unlawful, or</hi>
(but) <hi>suspected Practices,</hi> which are unlawful to them, and you come
presently to the Point. Allowing them to withdraw from yours, you
must allow them to joyn in some other Christian Assembly; unless you
would have them utterly deprived of the Worship of God, and to live
like Heathens: As you say well, <hi>Irenic. p.</hi> 109. <q>Every Christian is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an Obligation to joyn in Church society with others; because it is
his Duty to profess himself a Christian, and to own his Religion pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
and to partake of the Ordinances and Sacraments of the Gospel,
which cannot be without Society with some Church or other.</q> So then,
Christians that cannot enjoy Sacraments with you, must joyn with some
other Society, where they may enjoy them. And further, take notice of
that <hi>remarkable Assertion,</hi> in your <hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 335. and apply it
here, as far as there is Cause, <q>Our Assertion therefore is, that the Church
and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> are guilty of this Schism,—by forcing Men (<hi>N. B.</hi>)
if they would not damn their Souls by sinning against their Consciences,
in approving the Errors and Corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to joyn
together (<hi>N. B.</hi>) for the solemn Worship of God, according to the
Rule of Scripture, and Practice of the Primitive Church, and suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(I suppose it should have been, <hi>and to suspend</hi>) Communion with
that Church till those Abuses and Corruptions be redressed.</q> And I
observe further, <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 291. you would not have Men <hi>bound to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a particular Church,</hi> but in Subordination to <hi>God's Honour,</hi> and the
<hi>Salvation of their Souls.</hi> Yea, you say, Men are <hi>bound not to communicate
in those lesser Societies,</hi> where such things are imposed, as <hi>are directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
to these Ends. And where Men should be <hi>forced to damn their Souls
by sinning against their Consciences,</hi> would not this <hi>be directly repugnant?</hi>
And yet are not such bound to joyn together for the Solemn Worship of
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You see now <hi>how far I have brought you,</hi> even <hi>on your own Grounds:</hi>
how you will <hi>get off,</hi> I know not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:47910:17"/>Then might it not have been expected, that you would have been
more favourable, and charitable towards the Assemblies of those Ministers
and Christians, that are kept off from you by <hi>unlawful Terms,</hi> or at least
such <hi>unnecessary Terms</hi> as are <hi>to them unlawful?</hi> You speak more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
<hi>Rational Account,</hi> pag. 331. Here let me use some of your own
Words there, which something favour those Assemblies, you now engage
so zealously against, <hi>By their declaring the Grounds of their Separation to be
such Errors and Corruptions, which are crept into the Communion of your Church,
and imposed on them in order to it, they withal declare their readiness to joyn
with you again, if those Errors and Corruptions be left out.</hi> ☞ <q>And where
there is this readiness of Communion, there is no absolute Separation
from the Church as such, but only suspending Communion till such
Abuses be reformed.</q> This they'l say is very good. But now in your
new <hi>Impartial Account, Preface</hi> pag. 46. you speak in another Dialect,
<q>Would they have had me represented that as no Sin, which I think to
be so great a one; or those as not guilty, whom in my Conscience I
thought to be guilty of it? Would they have had me suffered this Sin
to have lain upon them without reproving it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> (What? that which
is <hi>as plain a Sin as Murder,</hi> pag. 209. which is <hi>really as great and as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Sin, as Murder; and in some respects aggravated beyond it,</hi> Preface <hi>p.</hi> 45.)
And yet on the other hand, would you have them conform to you, though
<hi>against their Consciences?</hi> Would that be <hi>no Sin?</hi> Would God be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with such Service, as was done but to please Men, while their
Consciences (in the mean while) condemned them for it? Can you
say <hi>bonâ Fide,</hi> that it is better, more pleasing to God, that Men <hi>conform
to your Modes and Ceremonies,</hi> though they have <hi>real Doubts</hi> of Conscience,
that they are unlawful; or better, they should <hi>live without God's publick
Worship</hi> and Ordinances, then to joyn with such as the <hi>Non-conformists?</hi>
That this is <hi>as the Sin of Murder!</hi> Dare you go, or send to all the
Dissenters in your Parish (supposing you take them to belong to your
Charge) and give 'm it under your hand, that though they are still unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
(after all you have said and written) though they believe, they
should offend God, if they joyned with you upon such Terms; yet I say,
durst you give it under your hand, that they would <hi>do better to joyn in your
way of Worship,</hi> than in that of the <hi>Non-conformists;</hi> though they have
no more doubt of joyning with the latter, than you had heretofore? If
you are clear in the Point, have you done this? Or why do you neglect
your Duty towards them? Why do you not endeavour to bring them in, or
<hi>lay the Sin at their Door?</hi> But I observe, you would have Care taken,
(<hi>Preface</hi> p. 86.) that there be <q>No Pretence left for idle, loose, and
profane Persons, never going to any Church at all;</q> whence I conclude,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47910:18"/>
that you cannot but allow it, that such as are not satisfied to joyn with
you, yet ought to joyn in God's Worship elsewhere: and that <hi>in your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Thoughts</hi> you judg it better for Persons to joyn with <hi>Congregations,
that hold Communion in your way of Worship unlawful</hi> (for <hi>of such</hi> you are
speaking in that place) than to be of no Christian Society, than not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
at all on God's Worship.</p>
            <p>Here, if you would not be offended, I shall tell you, what a plain
Christian, a Neighbour of mine, said of you; <hi>I can remember, I have
seen him at the Sacrament with some of you,</hi> (abov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 20 Years ago) <hi>and
would he now have poor, hungry Souls deprived of such Ordinancees and
Means of Grace, that cannot be satisfied to partake of them in his Way? If any
were a Cause of depriving so many thousands of their bodily Food, as he would
have deprived of Food for their Souls, what would the World say of such?</hi>
Whereby he seemed to think <hi>your Sin as great, as Murder, and in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
aggravated beyond it.</hi> (As he may likewise think, the Sin of those
that care not <hi>unnecessarily to offend</hi> others, or would cause them to offend,
to be <hi>a kind of Murder,</hi> in the Apostles Account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15.—<hi>Now
walkest thou not charitably? Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ
died.</hi>) Such was the honest Man's Zeal, he would have written to you,
to <hi>put it to your Conscience,</hi> (as he said) but I thought this Intimation from
him sufficient.</p>
            <p>3. I find you <hi>so kind, or just,</hi> you help such to <hi>Ministers,</hi> those that
cannot conform. <hi>Irenic. p.</hi> 42, you say, <hi>It belongs to the Magistrate,</hi> 
               <q>To
see that Ministers preach the true Doctrine, though he cannot lawfully
forbid the true Doctrine to be taught; and that they duly administer
the Sacraments, though he cannot command them to administer them
otherwise than Christ hath delivered them down to us.</q> (And that <hi>Christ
did not deliver the Sign of the Cross down to us with Baptism,</hi> I suppose the
highest Conformists will grant.) This gives some Hopes, such may <hi>lawfully
preach</hi> still, whom others cannot <hi>lawfully forbid Preaching.</hi> And you tell
us from another (<hi>Vnreasonableness of Separation,</hi> pag. 7.) that <q>
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi>
held himself for a Arch-Bishop still, and was by Q. <hi>Marry</hi> forcibly restrained
from it.—<hi>Latimer</hi> though he renounced his Bishoprick, yet he kept
his Ministry, and never repented him of it. And <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 132. you say,
The Question is not, whether all publick Worship be sinful, when forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?
(which you <hi>never said, or thought,</hi> as you tell us in the same Page)
—I abhor and detest such Principles, as to set up Man's Laws above God's.
This is good.</q> And you seem to allow, that <hi>such publick Worship, as hath
no Evil in it, antecedent to the Prohibition, may not be forbidden.</hi> Very good
still. All the Question here is, <hi>Whether there be not Schism in it?</hi> For I
hope, you shall never find <hi>Idolatry or Sedition</hi> in that Worship, I would
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47910:18"/>
plead for. Now as for the Charge of <hi>Schism,</hi> do but <hi>allow Ministers equal
Favour</hi> with others, and you have said enough to clear them, <hi>Iren. p.</hi> 113, 116,
119, 120. Charge not them with <hi>Schism</hi> upon account of their distinct
Meetings, who are <hi>driven into them</hi> by your over-rigorours Impositions. You
know well how <hi>great a matter</hi> this <hi>imposing unlawful Conditions</hi> is with <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi>
to warrant Separation. How oft he is upon it, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. where

               </gap>. 40. he hath the confidence to tell his Adversary, <q>You mistake
in thinking that Protestants hold themseves obliged not to communicate
with you only, or principally by reason of your Errors and Corruptions.
For the true Reason (according to my third Observation) is not so much
because you maintain Errors and Corruptions, as because you impose
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> (like your pleading for <hi>Non-conformists, Irenic.</hi> p. 118.) So
<hi>Ball</hi> of Separation, <hi>pag. 159. The Lord needeth not Mans lie, neither doth he
allow us to do Evil that Good may come thereof: And therefore I must not
subscribe to an Error against Conscience, though never so innocent, nor profess
Approbation of that which in Conscience I cannot allow, though never so small,</hi> &amp;c.
But thus are many Ministers driven from you, who neither <hi>dare lay down
their Ministry,</hi> nor <hi>take the charge of Parochial Congregations</hi> on them, upon
such hard, that is, <hi>sinful Terms.</hi> For (to borrow an Expression of Dr.
<hi>Potter's) Though in the issue the Errors be not damnable to them, which believe
as they profess, yet for us to profess,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what we believe not, were without question
damnable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now may I come in with <hi>my Conclusion:</hi> It is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclusion</hi> 1. It becomes <hi>unavoidable necessary</hi> for such Ministers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as <hi>cannot in Conscience submit to your Terms,</hi> and conform to your way
of Worship, neither may <hi>lawfully</hi> lay aside their Ministry, nor live without
God's Worship and Ordinances, to be for <hi>other Assemblies</hi> than yours,
where the one may exercise their Ministry, and the other (with such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters)
may partake of God's Ordinances, and joyn in his Worship,
which you call <hi>setting up of new Churches.</hi> After the drawing up of this,
looking into <hi>Corbet</hi> of Church-Unity and Schism, I find something to this
purpose, <hi>pag.</hi> 31, 32. Though indeed I <hi>took my Hints</hi> from you here.</p>
            <p>Now because I would not leave this Proposition so naked, as yours
stands, I shall here offer something, 1. On the behalf of Ministers. 2. On
the behalf of private Christians</p>
            <p>1. On the behalf of such Ministers.</p>
            <p>1. You cannot deny, but the Ministers, who are <hi>forced to stand off</hi> from
you, were (at least very many of them) <hi>duly qualified</hi> for, and had a
sufficient, <hi>valid call</hi> to the Office of the Ministry, that they were <hi>God's
Ministers, Christ's Ministers,</hi> before their Ejection. You cannot deny,
but the <hi>mediate Call</hi> is from God, and Christ, even as well as the <hi>immediate
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47910:19"/>
Call</hi> was. Those two Texts, <hi>Act. 20. 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 28. (to name no more)
fully prove it.</p>
            <p>2. Though it is not questioned by us, but the <hi>Clergy</hi> is <hi>under the Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Prince,</hi> Ministers (as well as others) under the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and that they may (<hi>where there is just Cause</hi>) by him be deprived
of their publick Liberty, and may be imprisoned, banished, put to death;
yet <hi>without just Cause</hi> (as <hi>Male-administration, or matter of Scandal, rendring
them unfit,</hi> to use your own Words) no Power on Earth (whether Civil
or Ecclesiastical) may turn those out of the Ministry, whom God hath
called to it. Rulers, Bishops may neither put in, nor put out of this
Office, as they list. Men may neither admit into, nor put from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
meerly at their their own Pleasure, but only <hi>according to Christ's Will</hi>
and <hi>Appointment.</hi> For his Officers and Servants they are. And Christ
hath, by his Apostles (whose Authority is certainly Superior to that of
the greatest Bishops and Councils that ever were) <hi>described the Office,</hi> and
how Persons are to be qualified for it. And when such have been called
to the Office, while they give <hi>no just Cause</hi> for Suspension and Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Christ looks on them as <hi>his Ministers</hi> still, and accordingly his Will
is that Men own them <hi>as such.</hi> And <hi>they that despise them,</hi> may therein
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in a Degree) be <hi>guilty of despising Christ. Chemnitius (Loc. com. par.</hi> 3.
p. 136. col. 1.) speaks fully to the purpose, thus; <hi>As God alone properly
claims to himself the Right of Calling, even when the Call is mediate; so also
properly it belongs to God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o remove one from the Ministry. Therefore so long as
God suffers in the Ministry his Servant teaching rightly, and living blamelesly,</hi>
Ecclesia non habet Potestatem alienum Servum amovendi, <hi>The Church
hath no Power (Authority) of putting away another's Servant. But when
be no further edifies either by his Doctrine, or Life, but destroys the Church,
then God himself removes him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If what you have said formerly (remark'd in <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 29.)
hold true, (and you have not hitherto disproved the same) then you
must yield, the present <hi>Non-conformist</hi> Ministers have not been <hi>suspended,</hi>
and cast out <hi>for any just Cause.</hi> And may I not also add, If <hi>Clement</hi> say
true, as you cite him here, (<hi>Vnreasonableness of Separation,</hi> p. 314, 315.)
<q>Those therefore who were appointed by them, or other eminent Men,
the whole Church being therewith wel-pleased, discharging their Office
with Humility, Quietness, Readiness, and Unblameableness, and being
Men of a long time of good Report, we think such Men cannot justly
be cast out of their Office.</q> Though in the heat of Disputation, your
<hi>Opinion seems</hi> to be <hi>changed of Persons,</hi> as well as <hi>Things;</hi> yet I hope
in cool Blood you would not deny, but such a Character agrees to many
<hi>Non-conformists;</hi> that you should think, they <hi>cannot justly be cast out of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47910:19"/>
Office.</hi> And I doubt not, but you are well acqainted with that <hi>old Canon,
That no Bishop or Priest should be taken into another's Place, if the former were
blameless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If still they are in Office, as <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> are they not <hi>obliged
to serve</hi> him in that Office, as they have a Call and Opportunity?
(See again <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> pag. 29, 34, 75.) They must not
<hi>neglect the Gift</hi> that is in them. Sad was the Doom of <hi>the vnprofitable
Servant,</hi> that buried his Talent! The <hi>Teacher</hi> must <hi>wait on Teaching.</hi> I
suppose, all Christ's Ministers are concerned in that solemn Charge,
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. And they are to <hi>take heed to the Ministry,</hi> which they have
received; even though Men forbid them. You <hi>abhor and detest such
Principles, as to set Man's Laws above God's Laws.</hi> And though they be
threatned with Persecution for it; when they are <hi>persecuted in one City,</hi>
they may <hi>flee to another,</hi> Mat. 10. 23. Yet must they not <hi>run away from their
Work,</hi> but be carrying that on in other Places, where they come, according
to their Ability and Opportunity. <hi>Prudence</hi> directed them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 19. to
meet <hi>privately</hi> there, <hi>at Evening,</hi> keeping the <hi>Door shut,</hi> for fear of the
Jews; yet meet they would. If Ministers be driven from their former
Flocks, yet are they <hi>Men in Office,</hi> and preach as such, not only <hi>as gifted
Men,</hi> in what other place soever God (by his Providence) calls them to
bestow their Pains. They are Teachers <hi>by Office,</hi> to more than their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Charges, even to as many as they have a Providential Call, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> to
preach unto.</p>
            <p>So it appears, Men cannot <hi>lawfully</hi> silence Christ's Ministers, <hi>without
just Cause;</hi> or if they do, that such Decree and Sentence does not oblige
Conscience. I have it from Mr. <hi>B. Church History,</hi> p. 446, 447. The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican
Inquisitor</hi> that reasoned the matter with the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> would have
silenced, excommunicated Priests bound to cease preaching: but <hi>had the
wit to add [if silenced for a reasonable Cause,</hi>] and to confess, <hi>Sententia
injuste lata à suo judice, si Errorem inducat, vel Peccatum mortale afferet, nec
timenda est, nec tenenda.</hi> The old <hi>Bohemian</hi> Reformers held, (as <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 446.)
<hi>Every Priest and Deacon is bound to preach God's Word freely, or he sinneth mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally;
and after Ordination he should not cease, no, not when excommunicated,
because he must obey God rather than Man.</hi> I see in <hi>Carranza (fol.</hi> 437.) It
was one of the Articles, for which the <hi>Council of Constance</hi> sentenced <hi>I.
Wickliffe's</hi> Bones to be digg'd up and burnt, (<hi>Art.</hi> 13.) <hi>They that leave off
to preach, or hear God's Word for Men's Excommunication, are excommunicate:</hi>
And you (that have greater store of Authors, and choice Books, then
such as I must ever hope to have the Advantage of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> you, I say) I doubt

Articles, for which <hi>I. Husse</hi> was condemned, <hi>Carranza,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

18. <hi>A Priest of Christ living according to his Law, and having the Knowledg
of the Scripture, and a working to edify the People, ought to preach notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any pretended Excommunication.</hi> And, <hi>every one that comes to the
Office of a Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

notwithstanding Excommunication.</hi> And these you know were before our
oldest <hi>Non-conformists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. But now (Sir) that I may <hi>come home</hi> to you: If Ministers were
bound to cease preaching, to lay aside their Ministry, when silenced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
then at <hi>what a miserable Loss</hi> might the Church be left? And if you
could scarce satisfy your selves to see her at such a loss, we may very well
hope, Christ would not have her left at such a Loss. His care of his
Church (no doubt) is greater than yours would be.</p>
            <p>Because you seem not to take any notice of what I said, (<hi>Rect. of Sutton,</hi>
p. 28.) give me leave here to mind you of it again. What <hi>a woful Case</hi>
the Church was in, if she might be <hi>deprived</hi> of all, or the greatest and
soundest part of her Ministers <hi>at Man's pleasure?</hi> And further, <hi>pag.</hi> 43.
I put a Case, shewing that if what you would have, be admitted, it
might <hi>fare a great deal the worse</hi> with the Church <hi>under Orthodox</hi> Bishops,
(and Governours) than if they were <hi>grand Hereticks.</hi> But to come to
the Point I aim at; You know when almost two thousand Ministers were
cut off from their publick Ministerial Work (as it were) in one day, by
a Law of Conformity. Now let us suppose the Minds of Rulers to change
(which is not naturally impossible) and put the case that your <hi>Conformity</hi>
should be made <hi>as great a Crime,</hi> as <hi>Non-conformity</hi> hath been, and yet,
<q>the true Religion acknowledged,</q> and the true Doctrine of Faith owned,
(as you say here, <hi>pag.</hi> 148. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 6.) Though I find Mr. <hi>Phil. Nye,</hi> (who is
<hi>a very considerable Person</hi> with you, <hi>Preface, p.</hi> 27.) <hi>In his Beams of Light,</hi>
pag. 192. saying, <hi>Let the same Impositions and Penalties be put into the other
Scale, against Epis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pacy and Ceremonies: If the Law had said, it shall be the loss
of a Man's living to practise or preach for Episcopacy, Common-Prayer-Book, or
Ceremonies; these things even in their own Opinions would have been light as
Vanity,</hi> (p. 193.) Yet for what you say, <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 89. I am to suppose,
he was under a mistake. For we must <hi>not think</hi> (as you tell us there)
<q>that the Friends of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be either afraid, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to own her Cause,—or that you will give up the Cause of the
Church,—so as to condemn its Constitution, or make the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
unlawful, which have been hitherto observed and practised in it.</q>
Now suppose ye were all <hi>outed of your Livings,</hi> because ye could not, or
would not <hi>declare</hi> your <hi>Assent and Consent to the utter abolishing</hi> of such things;
I besee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47910:20"/>
and would have others of your Brethren to do? Do you judg it the
<hi>Duty of Pastors</hi> to go on in <hi>passing a just Censure</hi> (though <hi>against the Will
of the Magistrate,</hi> as I urged you with it, <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 76.) and
yet would you <hi>wholly lay aside the Office of the Ministry,</hi> and preach the
Gospel no more, rather than c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oss his Will? Would ye think your selves
no more concerned to endeavour to <hi>keep up the Exercise of true Religion</hi>
(as you might) when it was <hi>against the Will of the Magistrate?</hi> If only
such as the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> were in place, you would be forced to confess,
that, <q>The true Religion was yet maintained and preached in publick
Assemblies, (as <hi>pag.</hi> 136.) And that there was <hi>an Agreement in all the
Substantials of Religion,</hi>
               </q> between you and them; and therefore (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your arguing, <hi>pag.</hi> 132.) you <hi>could not exercise</hi> (though more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately)
when <hi>turn'd out of your Livings,</hi> but <hi>such Faults as Sedition, or
Schism,</hi> &amp;c. would be found in your Meetings. <hi>Make the Case</hi> of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
<hi>your own,</hi> suppose your selves in the like Circumstances, and I
doubt not, you will see cause to judg more favourably of them. Do
but allow them to do, as you would do your selves in the like Case,
and I hope, this Dispute will soon be at an End.</p>
            <p>Here I shall take off all you say to that Question I proposed, <hi>Rector of
Sutton,</hi> p. 26. <q>And may it not be a Question, whether they can properly
be said to erect New Churches, or to proceed to the forming of separate
Congregations, who were true Ministers, and had their Congregations
before others came into their places? If they had done nothing (<hi>N. B.</hi>)
worthy of Ejection, or Exclusion from their Ministry, whether they have
not still a Right to exercise their Function? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> You migh have
done well to have joyned my <hi>Tenth Query</hi> (pag. 3.) with it, and to have
considered both together. But what say you to this? <hi>Vnreasonableness
of Separation,</hi> p. 137. <q>There is not one word in all this Plea, but might
have equally served the Papists in the beginning of the Reformation.</q>
How Sir! Are you in good earnest? <q>Not one word but might equally have
served the Papists?</q> Why, certainly you wrote in haste, and forgot
your self; or else it is your Judgment, that the <hi>Popish Bishops and Priests
had done nothing worthy of Ejection, or Exclusion from their Offices,</hi> that they
had still a Right to exercise their Functions. And yet you argue it, (<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Account,</hi> pag. 379.) that they <hi>were justly deprived.</hi> How can these
things stand together? <q>They had done nothing worthy of Ejection,
and yet were justly deprived.</q> You seem to have a great Conceit of this
<hi>poor Shift;</hi> we had it but a Page or two before, <hi>pag.</hi> 135. <q>The Papists
then had the very same Plea, that these Men have now.</q> So you must
say, and argue thus, <hi>The Ministers of Antichrist</hi> (and those such as were
<hi>State-Incendiaries</hi> too) might <hi>justly be cast out by Law; ergo,</hi> so may <hi>true
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47910:21"/>
Ministers of Christ,</hi> (though peaceable, and loyal.) I grant the Antecedent,
but do you prove the Consequent.</p>
            <p>But what have you further to say to me? For indeed what you have
yet said here, is <hi>worse than nothing.</hi> But in what follows, the Reader may
think, you had a good mind to <hi>pay me home.</hi> 
               <q>For the Law signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with them in any Case, where themselves are concerned. If
Ministers be ejected without or against Law, they who come into their
place are no Usurpers; and if they are cast out by Law, they that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them are Usurpers; so that the Law is always the least thing in their
Consideration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I thank you for this. But is there here <hi>no sharp Reflection?</hi> Do
you not here bewray <hi>some undecent Passion,</hi> which you so condemn others
for? Are not these things <hi>invidiously</hi> spoken? Would you not here be
<hi>raking into old Sores,</hi> &amp;c. contrary to what you say in your <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 44, 45?
But did you think to pinch me here, who never was in a <hi>sequestred Living,</hi>
nor my <hi>predecessor before me;</hi> but came in upon the choice of the People,
none opposing? You thought to give us <hi>a dry Blow</hi> here, never consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it would reach as many, if not more Conformists; though it
could not once touch him, you seem especially to direct it to.</p>

            <p>II. To say something on the behalf of the People that hear them.</p>
            <p>1. They are <hi>under an Obligation to worship God in Society</hi> with other
Christians, with respect to God's Glory, and their own Edification, and
Salvation. They are charged, <hi>not to forsake the assembling of themselves
together.</hi> And commanded to be <hi>swift to hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The way is blockt up so, as many cannot come to your Assemblies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
(to use your own Phrase) you would have them <hi>damn their Souls by sinning
against their Consciences.</hi> And if you judge it better for such to want the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means of Salvation, than to enjoy them, by joyning with <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
we must take you to be <hi>no more infallible</hi> herein, than that <hi>Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
that decreed it <hi>righter to remain without visible Communion, than to have it
with those</hi> they call <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Some (though they could dispense with the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
yet) cannot satisfie themselves to take up under some <hi>Parish-Ministers,</hi>
who are <hi>apparently</hi> no way <hi>qualified</hi> for the work they take upon them.
I take the 9th <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> to be for <hi>nulling the Ordination</hi>
of such as are <hi>scandalous,</hi> or <hi>insufficient.</hi> You are not for the <hi>People's choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Pastors;</hi> but it is evident and undeniable, that they are to <hi>refuse</hi>
some. <hi>Beware of false Prophets.</hi> Beware of them, <hi>i. e. fly from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and have nothing to do with them</hi> (as you say, <hi>p.</hi> 215.) They are to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47910:21"/>
flee from Corrupt Teachers, as from <hi>Wolves.</hi> As the People forsook <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi>
of whom <hi>Vincent Lyrinen</hi> (adv. haeres. <hi>c. 16. p.</hi> 42.) saith, <hi>Nam
quem antea quasi arietem Gregis sequebantur, eundem deinceps veluti Lupum fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere
caeperunt,</hi> (which you have also noted, <hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 115.) Some are <hi>blind
Guides.</hi> And may not People very well be startled with what Christ saith
concerning such? <hi>If the Blind lead the Blind, both shall fall into the Ditch.</hi>
And have you forgotten, or have you retracted that, in <hi>Answer to Several
Treatises,</hi> p. 265. (cited in <hi>Rector of Sutton</hi> p. 61.) <q>Men may have reason
to question, if not the Skill, yet the Sincerity of their Guides, and
though they must have some, may seek new ones.—The ignorant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their Guides only upon the opinion of their Skill and Integrity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
when they see reason to question these, they know of no Obligation to
follow their Conduct over Rocks and Precipices.</q> And yet is it now <hi>a loose
Principle?</hi> some the People are to <hi>mark and avoid,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. some they
must not <hi>bid God speed,</hi> 2 Joh. v. 10, 11. <q>There are three Cases,</q> (you say
<hi>Vnreas. of Sep.</hi> p. 213.) wherein the Scripture allows of Separation. The
second, is (<hi>p.</hi> 214.) In case of false Doctrine being imposed instead of true.—
<q>☞If any Teachers offer to bring another Gospel, or to corrupt the
true one, St. <hi>Paul</hi> denounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> against them: and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
that they should have no Communion with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now do
you not here make the People <hi>Iudges of such Heretical Teachers,</hi> whom
(I suppose) by an <hi>Ironie</hi> you call <hi>admirable Iudges?</hi> p. 123. Yet for them
to own and incourage such, is to <hi>partake of their Evil Deeds.</hi> If Mr. B.
saith, as you have it there, [<hi>Any one whose Ministry is such as tendeth to
Destruction more than to Edification, and to do more harm than good, is not to
be owned;</hi>] I wonder what you have to say for such, when better may
be had? <hi>Camero</hi> speaks to the same purpose, as Mr. B. (<hi>pag. 327. col.</hi> 1.)
<hi>Si non faciant quod spondet tanti Muneris professio deserendi sunt, nam paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Deo potius quàm Hominibus; ut siquis Medicinam professus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If any
one having professed Physick, should not cure, but exasperate the Disease, truly
he should be forsaken, and another is to be chosen in his room.</hi> And what <hi>Peter
Martyr</hi> says, (<hi>Loc. com.</hi> p. 909. §. 33.) may fitly be applied here, <hi>Vexant

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>, mandasse, ut propriam salutem curet.</hi> This you cannot
deny, but God has <hi>commanded every one to have a care of his Soul,</hi> and
that Men are <hi>not bound to lesser Societies</hi> (as to their own Parishes, or
Parish-Ministers,) but so far as may stand with promoting the Salvation
of their own Souls.</p>
            <p>Who could speak more fully than you have done, <hi>Rational Account,</hi>
p. 611. <hi>The main thing to be discussed, is, Whether the Communion of your
Church or ours, be rather to be chosen in order to Salvation?—The tendency to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47910:22"/>
that ought to be the Rule, by which we should embrace or continue in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any Church. Since the Regard Men ought to have of their eternal
Welfare doth oblige them to make choice of the best means;—the bare remote
possibility of Salvation,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ought to have no force in determining their Choice in a
matter of so great Importance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Many have not the least Doubt, or Scruple, but those Ministers
which you would not have them to hear, are such as God hath owned,
and still doth, blessing their Ministry to their own, and others Souls Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
Many are well assured, <hi>The Lord hath not yet forsaken that Ministry,
you would have them forsake.</hi> Yea, I have spoken with some <hi>on their Death-Bed,</hi>
who have sadly bewailed it as a great Sin of theirs, that lay as an
heavy Burthen on them, (and we use to say, <hi>Hora mortis est hora Veritatis</hi>)
That they had despised, and neglected the Ministry of such. But it seems,
had they made their Complaints to you, you could soon have satisfied
them, telling them, <hi>It was no Sin at all; but they had done well, in refusing
to hear such, as submitted not to the Orders of the Church.</hi> Though perhaps
they would have thought it very strange, that you could have <hi>allowed
them to hear Romish Priests,</hi> and yet should suppose it <hi>unlawful for them to
hear Non-conformists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. These would also wonder, if you your self should at all question such
Ministers being <hi>true Ministers</hi> of Christ, and that Worship (wherein they
joyn) being <hi>true Religious Worship;</hi> they are confident you could not but
acknowledg the truth of both these, <hi>did but the Law of Man allow them.</hi>
And then for ought they know, they are <hi>such in themselves,</hi> and in God's
Account. For no Law of Man could make that to be true, religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which is not so, abstracted from the Consideration of the Law's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.
No Law of Man could make those to be true Ministers of
Christ, who are not such, or would otherwise be none.</p>
            <p>6. Because I suppose, you will be ready to object here, <q>How is it
possible for Order to be kept up,</q> if People may run after what Teachers
they please? I desire you to do me right; I am only for their hearing
such as they have reason to believe are allow'd of God, whom therefore
Men should allow to preach the Word. And where the publickly
allowed Minister is not such a one, they are not bound (for order-sake)
to neglect other faithful and sound Teachers, and therein also to neglect
their own Souls. There is no Order Men can make in the Church, that
should be urged, or stood upon against the end of Order, against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, against Religion, and the true Service and Worship of God,
and against the Salvation of Men, and the ordinary means thereof. And
if the Sabbath <hi>was made for Man,</hi> (as <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 27.) and therefore was
not to be turned to his Destruction; much less should any human, external
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47910:22"/>
Order be strictly urged and pressed to Men's Destruction. <hi>Bishop Bilson
(Christian Subject,</hi> part 3 <hi>p.</hi> 299. An. 1586.) speaking to that, [<hi>We would
have things done in order</hi>] returns this smart- Answer, <hi>Call you that Order,
where Christ shall stand without doors, till your Clergy consent to bring him in?</hi>
Though according to the <hi>order of Nature,</hi> light Bodies move upwards, and
heavy Bodies tend downwards in their ordinary Course; yet (which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi>
applies to a like case, <hi>p. 581. col.</hi> 1. §. 2.) this <hi>very order of Nature is
inverted, Nè detur vacuum.</hi> Here I call to mind what you say, (<hi>pag.</hi> 198.)
<q>Is Schism indeed become such an inconsiderable and petty Inconvenience?</q>
And me-thinks, that <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> the Breach of external Order (which
with you is <hi>Schism</hi>) is a far less Evil, if it be Evil in this case, compared
with the <hi>Mischief</hi> of Men's destroying their own Souls, or neglecting the
means of their Salvation. There is an higher Law, which (to use the
words of <hi>Camero) Ordinem deserere jubet ut extremo malo &amp; irreparabili
jacturae occurratur,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>qui tam justâ &amp; urgente occasione ordniem deserit, reipsâ
non deserit, sed servat.</hi> And that Instance he gives there is convincing, <hi>If
a Souldier knew his Captain, his Leader, was for opening the Gates to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
and yet <hi>followed such a Leader,</hi> keeping Rank and Order so unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
he would <hi>shew himself a Traitor,</hi> rather than a faithful Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</p>
            <p>The Disciples would seem to have been for <hi>Order</hi> there (as you are)
when they were hindring Christ's Service, <hi>Mar. 9. 38. Luk. 9. 49. Master,
we saw one casting out Devils in thy name,—and we forbad him, because he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not us.</hi> Now I heartily wish, even for your own sake, from that
true and due Respect I owe to you, that you would more impartially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
what you have been doing, and reflect upon your self; consider seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
whether you are not forbidding, and condemning some, as faithful
Followers of Christ as your self, even in their serving Christ, and serving
their Generation? What are your Thoughts of such, as <hi>Iospeh</hi> and <hi>Richard
Alleyn,</hi> with divers others that might be named, who kept to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
Work, and (as you say of <hi>Father Latimer) never repented them of
it?</hi> If now they have that <hi>Well-come home, Well done good and faithful
Servants, enter into the Ioy of your Lord.</hi>] How far are they above all your
Censures? And me-thinks, it deserves Men's serious Consideration,
whether they pray as they ought [<hi>Thy Kingdom come</hi>] or whether indeed
they act not against their own Prayers, who indeavour to hinder the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel, (a means of enlarging and building up God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?)
And as you <hi>declare to the World,</hi> (p. 394.) you are <hi>one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
a day of Iudgment to come,</hi> (which I would not once question) I

And bethink your self whether of these two things he will be most likely to have
regard unto, the saving of Souls, which He bought with his Blood; or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
inviolate certain Humane Institutions and Rules, confessed by the Devisers
of them, not to be necessary,</hi> &amp;c. And so much of your first Conclusion, and
mine.</p>
            <p>Your second Conclusion follows, <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 73.</p>
            <p>2. <q>Those are new Churches, when Men erect distinct Societies for
Worship, under distinct and peculiar Officers, governing by Laws, and
Church-Rules different from that Form they separate from.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, 1. I cannot but look on you as very unfortunate, unhappy in
this Cause you have espoused. How oft do you greatly expose your
self, that what you urge agianst your Brethren may justly be retorted on
you? So here, how plain is it, that you <hi>look but on one side,</hi> (which as
I remember you suppose those that differ from you to be faulty in?) Had
you not one Thought, that if you owned such a Conclusion as this, I
should be likely to tell you, you had spoiled your Cause, <hi>Nihil quod nimis,
satis,</hi> that by <hi>proving too much,</hi> you would in effect <hi>prove nothing</hi> of that you
aim at? Should you not have considered, what an Argument you here
put into the Mouths of the Dissenters against the <hi>National</hi> Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
against <hi>Diocesan</hi> Churches, and against <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches too?</p>
            <p>1. Will not many be ready to tell you, that it follows undeniably
from this Conclusion of yours, that you have made the <hi>National</hi> Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Diocesan</hi> Churches therein, <hi>New</hi> (unlawful) Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
because <hi>under divers peculiar Officer, governing by Laws and Church-Rules
different from the Apostolical Primitive Church,</hi> (as from other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches.) If those are <hi>new,</hi> unlawful Schismatical Churches with
you, that are <hi>under distinct and peculiar Officers, governing by Laws, and
Church-Rules different from</hi> the Apostolical truly Primitive Churches, (as
I suppose it must come to that, <hi>Primum in unoquo<expan>
                     <am>

                  </expan> genere est Regula &amp; Mensura
reliquorum</hi>) what work have you made here? What an heavy Task, and
hard Province have you taken on you? Can you ever prove, that there
are no Officers, Laws, Rules and Orders in your Church, different from
what were in the true Primitive Church? Can you ever find all these
Officers, <hi>Arch-Bishops; Lord-Bishops, Deans, Chancellors,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> down to
<hi>Apparitors,</hi> in the Primitive Church? Will you undertake to find there
all our <hi>Ecclesiastical Canons,</hi> even <hi>Rules</hi> for <hi>kneeling in the Act of Receiving,
for signing with the Cross in Baptism,</hi> for excluding the Parents, and setting
<hi>God-Fathers and God-Mothers</hi> in their stead, with a Rule for <hi>peculiar, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
Vestments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47910:23"/>To say here, that though you have peculiar Officers, Laws, and Rules,
different from the Apostolical Primitive Church; yet you do not <hi>own your
selves to be a Church, separate</hi> from that Primitive Church, will not bring you
off. For, this many Dissenters likewise say, they separate not from you, but
<hi>hold Communion with you in all that is necessary;</hi> and further have more <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
Presential Communion</hi> with you, than you can pretend to have with
the Primitive Church. Yet you will have their Assemblies separate
Churches, while they worship God by any other Rule than yours, though
their Worship be as agreeable to the Scripture-Rule. And yet can you, or
any mortal Man prove, that others may not be <hi>allowed to differ from you in
such things, wherein you differ from the Apostolical,</hi> primitive Church?</p>
            <p>Again, it will as little help you to say, That you speak of particular
Congregations, or <hi>Societies for Worship.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>2. Do you not here make your <hi>Parochial</hi> Congregations also <hi>New
Churches?</hi> If the Primitive Church had not your <hi>Liturgy,</hi> were not bound
to the use of your <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> then you cannot deny, but you
are under a somwhat <hi>different Rule.</hi> And are there not some Parishes,
that have only <hi>Deacons</hi> to officiate? And may I not be bold to tell you,
that you can never prove your <hi>Deacons</hi> the same with those in the Churches
erected by the Apostles? According to <hi>P. Paul Sarpi (of matters Benefic.</hi>
N. 27.) <hi>Deacons</hi> were <hi>Ministers of temporal things.</hi> You your self say, <hi>p.</hi> 311.
<q>It was no properly Church-power which they had; but they were Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the common Stock.</q> Then are not <hi>Deacons,</hi> that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to <hi>preach,</hi> and <hi>baptize,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>different Officers?</hi> By this time I hope,
you will be sensible, what a Wound you have given to the Cause, you
take upon you to defend, by this Conclusion, which is my first Note upon
it.</p>
            <p>(2.) At the first view and reading of this your second Conclusion, I
was willing to hope, that then you would not condemn such Assemblies
as Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. who leave the <hi>ruling Work</hi> to you, and are glad if they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to preach and hear God's Word, and do not separate from you,
but joyn with you, even in Sacraments, as well as other parts of God's
Worship. But looking farther into your Book, I see my Mistake: For
you say, <hi>pag.</hi> 98. (as was cited before) <q>No Man denies, that more
places for Worship are desirable, and would be very useful, where <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
is it possible that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should think the Case alike, where the Orders of
our Church are constantly neglected, the Authority of the Bishops is
slighted and contemned?</q>

                  </gap>o caetera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I had thought, you might have granted more places for Worship,
not only <hi>desireable,</hi> and <hi>useful,</hi> but <hi>very necessary</hi> for such as cannot c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more necessary than <hi>unnecessary Modes of Worship,</hi> or such matters as you
count but <hi>indifferent things.</hi> But by what is here last cited, it is too plain
and manifest, that you <hi>condemn all Religious Assemblies</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that
follow not your <hi>Church-Rule,</hi> and <hi>own not the Authority of the Bishops.</hi> And
thus it seems, where you are zealous in words for <hi>Communion,</hi> yet <hi>Subjection</hi>
to the Bishops Authority, is the thing you drive at. And upon this Account,
though your Discourse was <hi>calcul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grief, we in the Country have found many of the conformable Clergy,
with others, improving your Authority and Arguments as far as they are
able, even against such Assemblies, as meet off from the times of the

others; because the <hi>Orders of the Church are neglected</hi> in them. But,</p>
            <p>(3.) What will you say of those Assemblies, where Christ taught, and
the Disciples likewise whom he sent forth? Did they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tyed up to the <hi>Church-Rules</hi> of the Jews in what they did? were they not
<hi>distinct and peculiar Officers?</hi> Certainly, you mince the matter, when
you say, <hi>pag.</hi> 163. <q>Our Saviour himself did only Teach his Disciples oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally,</q>

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> as they conform not to you, I would argue

            <p>Either <hi>Conformity in all things</hi> to your Church-Rules is necessary to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to cut off the charge of being

            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Conformity in all things</hi> be not necessary here, why may not sober
Dissenters, that own the Church of <hi>England</hi> for a true Church, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the same Faith, and worship God <hi>in no other manner,</hi> than <hi>according to
the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of</hi> England, (as you say, <hi>p.</hi> 160.
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> declared in writing, and as I told you a good Lawyer pleadeth,
<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 26, &amp; 50.) I say, why may not such be owned as
in Communion with the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Why do you charge them
with <hi>erecting new separate Churches,</hi> meerly because they differ from you in
some alterable Circumstances, and separable Accidents, not necessary to
Churches Concord and Communion? I see, you dare not say, that
those things wherein they differ from you are any <hi>parts of Worship;</hi> So
they are of the same Faith, and agree with you in <hi>all parts of Worship.</hi>
And is not all this (with their owning themselves to be be of the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> so far as it is <hi>Catholick</hi>) a bidding fair for your Reception of
them, and acknowledging them still in Communion with you? And
then why have you so many words of such being <hi>no good Christians,</hi> because
<hi>Members of no Church?</hi> (as <hi>pag. 104, 105, 110. f.</hi>) If <hi>Conformity in all

and what not: what things may be dispensed with, and what
not. <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 27. <hi>n.</hi> 9. You were put in mind of it to inquire,
whether there be not some in publick Place, (not very well satisfied
with what they have done) who come not up to your Church-Rules?
As, some read not all the <hi>Common-Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have it. Some use not the <hi>Surplice,</hi> some omit the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism;
some dare not put away from the Sacrament any, meerly for <hi>not kneeling.</hi>
And yet you charge not such with Schism, (<hi>pag. 148. n.</hi> 5.) yet have they
different Rules, or at least, they differ from your Rules, as well as <hi>Non-conformists.</hi>
And I know not whether you may not be understood to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Men to go from their Parish Church (<hi>pag. 145. n.</hi> 1.) provided they
elsewhere joyn with your Churches, as Members of them. What then
is the <hi>parting Point</hi> from the Communion of your Church, or the <hi>trying
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47910:26"/>
Point</hi> of Conformity, without which a <hi>New Church</hi> is erected? Here I
offer this Note upon what you say farther, <hi>pag. 148. n.</hi> 5. That many
whom you condemn, though not satisfied with such and such Orders of the
Church, yet <hi>continue in all Acts of Communion</hi> with your Church, (or in all
that you will call <hi>parts of Worship</hi>) and draw not others from it, <hi>upon
any meer Pretence,</hi> no, not at all; though they dare not but joyn at other
times with <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> in that which they are well assured is as truly
God's Worship, and if they say, in some Respects more pure, you have
not yet disproved it. And therefore you should <hi>make good your word</hi> there,
and not charge such with Schism.</p>
            <p>Or if you should say, <hi>Conformity in all things</hi> to your Church-Rules is
necessary, that if Men differ never so little from those Rules, it is to <hi>erect
new Churches,</hi> what woful rending work would this make? By a <hi>Parity
of Reason,</hi> may not other foreign Churches be denied to have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Church of <hi>England?</hi> How many that could not submit to
these Laws and Rules, without receding from their own <hi>publick Confessions?</hi>
Could the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches assent to the <hi>Ius divinum</hi> of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy?
could they own it, as <hi>evident to all Men diligently reading the
holy Scriptures,</hi> to be of Apostolical Institution? And would not any one that
reads the <hi>Declaration of the Faith and Ceremonies of the Psaltzgraves Churches,</hi>
printed at <hi>London</hi> A. D. 1637, take them to have been averse from such
Conformity, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> stands upon? You glory in the
<hi>good Opinion of the Reformed Churches, and Protestant Divines abroad, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Constitution and Orders of our Church:</hi> and their <hi>owning Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

been returned by way of Answer to Dr. <hi>D. Bonasus Vapulans</hi> is but a little
Creature (I confess, to look on) yet some that have read it, do not look
on it <hi>as nothing.</hi> But if an owning of the <hi>Divine, or Apostolical Right</hi> of
Episcopacy and <hi>Re-ordination,</hi> &amp;c. be made the Terms of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with our Church, how many Protestant Divines abroad, that would
renonuce Communion with us, rather than be pleased with it upon such
Terms?</p>
            <p>And further, if <hi>Conformity in all things</hi> to your Church-Rules be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> How many <hi>Parochial</hi> Ministers and Congregations (as was
noted before) must be denied to be in Communion with the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> whom for the same Reason you must call <hi>new erected Churches?</hi>
For as one says (alluding to that) <hi>They who themselves were circumcised,
kept not the Law.</hi> They who have <hi>assented</hi> and <hi>consented,</hi> observe not the
Orders and Rules to which they have given their <hi>Assent,</hi> &amp;c. And yet (as
you have it from another) <hi>The Priests in the Temple break the Law, and are

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:47910:27"/>You see how fain I would have Protestant Dissenters acknowledged still

Here let me press you a little further, Keep to your own Rule, <hi>Preface p.</hi> 46.
<q>As far as the Obligation to preserve the Church's Peace extends, so far
doth the Sin of Schism reach.</q> Then it follows, if the <hi>Obligation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Church's Peace</hi> extends so far as to the Rulers and Governours of the
Church, there may be as much Schism in their setting up unnecessary Rules,
which others cannot submit to, as in Mens varying from such Rules. <hi>P.</hi> 209.
You argue, <q>From the Obligation which lies upon all Christians, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Peace and Unity of the Church.</q> And now (say you) <q>I have
brought the matter home to the Consciences of Men.</q> Had you put the
Matter home indifferently and <hi>impartially</hi> to the Consciences of Men on both
sides; that is, both of <hi>Imposers, and Dissenters,</hi> many could not but have
thought in their Consciences, you was to be commended for it. But then,
had you not pleaded as much for Dissenters, as here you plead against them?
I must grant, they ought (<hi>for the Peace and Vnity of the Church</hi>) to yield as
far as they can, without sinning against God, and their own Souls: and
should not Imposers do the like? Were this one Rule agreed on, what
Peace and Unity would soon follow? What <hi>Chillingworth (p.</hi> 283. § 71.)
says of Protestants, That <hi>they grant their Communion to all who hold with them,
not all things, but things necessary, that is, such as are in Scripture plainly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:</hi>]
Make this good of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and by my consent, all
we (who have unwillingly appeared against you) will readily and joyfully
give you our publick Thanks.</p>
            <p>What you say further, <hi>p.</hi> 209. may thus be handed back again to you:
If there be <hi>no sufficient Reason to justify</hi> such Rules and Orders, if they are a
<hi>Violation of the Vnity of the Church,</hi> you there make it <hi>a Sin, as much as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is, and as plainly forbidden.</hi> And therefore <hi>I do earnestly desire</hi> (as you,
<hi>p.</hi> 213.) all Parties concerned, as <hi>they love their own Souls, and as they would
avoid the Guilt of so great a Sin, impartially and without prejudice to consider
that Passage of</hi> Irenaeus (with you, <hi>p.</hi> 212.) <hi>That Christ will come to judg those
who make Schisms in the Church, and rather regard their own Advantage, than
the Church's Vnity, &amp;c.</hi> And if any indifferent Men had the matter put to
them to decide, who were more likely to <hi>regard their own Advantage,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47910:27"/>
some of you, or such as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> one might soon guess, what their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or Verdict would be. If I seem here, and sometimes elsewhere to
<hi>digress</hi> a little; yet I think in reason you should overlook it. I would hope
that in time you may be convinced of a <hi>greater Digression</hi> in the scope of your
late Writings.</p>
            <p>(6.) If you, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will not be so favourable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those <hi>distinct Societies,</hi> that are not under your Church-Rules, as to
acknowledg them in Communion with you; yet by what you, and <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
say, I see not but they may be still in Communion with the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> and Members of it. <hi>Knot</hi> talketh thus to our Reproach, (<hi>Charity
maint. part 1. c.</hi> 5. § 38.) <hi>Protestants cannot avoid the note of Schism, at least by
reason of their mutual Separation from one another. For most certain it is, that

who appear not as zealous against Dissenters, as you have shewed your self,
and others offended as much at you, and them; some taking offence at
those that <hi>bow at the word Iesus,</hi> or <hi>bow towards the Altar,</hi> and others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the like offence at those who scruple, or forbear such Practice. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
now the contention was carried so high, that the disagreeing Parties
<hi>refused Communion</hi> with one another hereupon; and if it came to that, I
would know which of these should be the <hi>new Church?</hi> Or whether both
Parties might not yet be in Communion with the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And

of the Catholick Chuch, but that I only suspend Communion
with those particular Churches, till I may safely joyn with them.</q>
Which you illustrate there by a Comparison, where you have these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Words, <q>And if several other Persons, be of the same mind
with me, and we therefore joyn together; Do we therefore divide our
selves from the whole World by only taking care of our own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</q>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Chillingworth</hi> speaks as like you as, if one had <hi>taken his Hints</hi> from
the other, <hi>pag.</hi> 298. He is for distiguishing, not <hi>confounding</hi> these two,
<hi>departing</hi> from <hi>the Church,</hi> and <hi>departing from some general Opinions and
Practices, which did not constitute, but vitiate the Church.</hi> More he hath to that
purpose. But that which I would specially note out of him here (to shew
the Harmony and Consent betwixt you, which otherwise should have
come in before) <hi>pag. 269. A Man may possibly leave some Opinion, or
Practice of a Church</hi> (says he)—<hi>and continue still a Member of that Church:
provided that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t he forsakes be not one of those things wherein the Essence of
the Church consists. Whereas peradventure this Practice may be so involved with
the external Communion of this Church, that it may be simply impossible for him to
leave this Practice, and not to leave the Churches external Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cite such Passages as these, because I would have the World know,
and take notice, what Friends you are sometimes to poor <hi>Non-conformists.</hi>
That if any should now send an <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> after them, as after <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,</hi>
you are willing they should <hi>take Sanctuary</hi> either in your Church, or
in the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> the <hi>New Church,</hi> your second Conclusion speaks of,
being not so safe.</p>
            <p>Now my second Conclusion is this.</p>
            <p>2. That many of those <hi>Societies</hi> which you condemn, do not <hi>separate</hi>
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> many of them have ordinary external
Communion with you; and though in their Worship, they do not in all
things follow your <hi>Church-Rules</hi> and Orders, yet their Worship cannot be
proved contrary, but is agreeable to <hi>Scripture-Rule.</hi> And as for those,
who are not satisfied to go so far, as to hold external Communion with
you, yet having <hi>Communion</hi> with you <hi>in the same Faith,</hi> it were a very
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47910:28"/>
desirable thing, that the <hi>Bars to their full Communion</hi> with you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
(if they be such things as are not necessary.) And in the mean
time (possibly) those <hi>New Churches</hi> are better than <hi>no Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it is matter of wonder to me, if you have no more Charity
for such, have no better Thoughts of them, than of those <hi>idle, loose, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Persons,</hi> that wholly neglect and contemn the Worship of God, <hi>that
never go to any Church at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would say more to this, did I not think enough is said already.</p>
            <p>Now I come to your <hi>last Conclusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <q>As to things in the Judgment of the Primitive and Reformed
Churches left undetermined by the Law of God, and in matters of
meer Order and Decency, and wholly as to Form and Government, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one, notwithstanding what his private Judgment may be of them,
is bound for the Peace of the Church of God, to submit to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the lawful Governours of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But would you not lead us here into a Maze, a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> without any
Clew to guide us out? Let us now see how <hi>Pertinent and Material</hi> this is to
your purpose.</p>
            <p>Here first, I must suppose this <hi>Question,</hi> viz. How far, or <hi>in what things
is every Man bound (whatever his private Iudgment be) for the Churches
Peace, to submit to the Determination of the lawful Governours of the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And your <hi>Answer</hi> is, every one is bound to submit to the Determination
of such (what ever his private Judgment be.)</p>
            <p>1. <hi>As to things in the Iudgment of the Primitive and Reformed Churches
left undetermin'd by the Law of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And <hi>in matters of meer Order and Decency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>And wholly as to the Form of Government;</hi> This I think, you cannot
deny to be the true <hi>Analysis</hi> of your third Conclusion.</p>
            <p>How <hi>pertinent</hi> this your Resolution is to the case of Dissenters, and
how <hi>material</hi> to give them Satisfaction, will appear by examining the several
Parts.</p>
            <p>But first, it is worth nothing, that you speak only of the <hi>Determination
of the lawful Governours of the Church.</hi> Implying, that Men are <hi>not bound
to submit to the Determination</hi> of such as may be proved <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> such
as are not <hi>lawful Governours</hi> of the Church. Then so far you and they
may be agreed, that if the Pope should set up a <hi>Patriarch, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
Men were not bound to submit to their Determination, till such could be
proved <hi>lawful Governours</hi> of the Church. And then whether you have
fully answered your <hi>Gentleman</hi> (p. 305.) and others, and proved that
<hi>Christ hath invested with Power to make such Decrees and Determinations</hi> (as
lawful Governours of the Church) <hi>those who neverwere chosen,</hi> or approved
by the People, is another Question?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47910:29"/>But then where lawful Governours of the Church determine, you tell
us; (1.) Every one is bound to submit to their Determination, <hi>As to
things in the Iudgment of the Primitive and Reformed Churches left undetermin'd
by the Law of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here 1. You should have told us, whether by the <hi>Primitive</hi> Churches
you meant the <hi>primo-primitive</hi> Churches, or only such <hi>Ancient Churches,</hi> as
those of the fourth, or fifth Age. One would guess that these latter are
<hi>your Primitive Churches.</hi> Now in my Thoughts <hi>King Iames</hi> was quite
beyond the Cardinal, and got the upper Ground, (In <hi>Defence of the Right
of Kings,</hi> p. 398.) where the Cardinal arguing, that <hi>a Doctrine believed
and practised in the Church, in the continual Current of the last Eleven Hundred
Years, was not to be condemned.</hi>] His Majesty replied; <hi>In these VVords he
maketh a secret Confession, that in the first five hundred Years, the same Doctrine
was neither apprehended by Faith, nor approved by Practice. VVherein to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
the Lord Cardinal voluntarily giveth over the Suit; for the Church
in the time of the Apostles, their Disciples,—was no more ignorant what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
the Church is to challenge,—than at any time since in any succeeding
Age, in which as Pride hath still flowed to the heighth of a full Sea, so Purity
of Religion and Manners hath kept for the most part at a low Water-mark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You should have told us also what <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> you meant, whether
<hi>all,</hi> or only <hi>some</hi> of them? And if but some, whether those that only
took the Scripture, as their Rule in reforming; or those that took in the
Example and Practice of some of those Ancient Churches, together with
it?</p>
            <p>2. What are <hi>those things, that in the Iudgment of the Primitive and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches are left undetermin'd by the Law of God; besides mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of meer Order and Decency, and what relates to Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Can this be a <hi>safe and sure Rule?</hi> When you grant the <hi>Church may
err,</hi> and general Councils may err; may they not then judg some things
left undetermin'd by the Word, that are not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> left? <hi>Chillingworth</hi> grants,
<hi>there may be just and nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssary Cause to depart from some Opinions and Practices
of the Cath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lick Church</hi> (p. 298.) And you say partly the same in your
<hi>Rational Account</hi> (pag. 331, 332.) Those Errors in practice, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, may be such things as are left undetermined by the
Word, when yet others are not bound to submit to them. You tell us,
<hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 627. <hi>The matter to be enquired here is, what Liberty
of Prescription is allowed by vertue of the Law of Christ; for since he hath
made Laws to govern his Church by, it is most sensl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss pleading Prescription,
till you have particularly examined, how far such Prescription is allowed by him.</hi>
So then it is not enough to say, in the Judgment of the Primitive and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47910:29"/>
Reformed Churches such things are left undetermined by God's Law,
and the Church hath Power to determine them. But Men are to examine
whether such Liberty be allowed by Christ. And as you go on, <hi>p.</hi> 628.
<q>It may be you will tell me, that in this Case, Prescription interprets
Law, and that the Churches Possession argues it was the Will of Christ.
But still the Proof lies upon your side, since you run your self into new
Briars; for you must prove that there is no way to interpret this Law,
but by the Practice (here I must say by the <hi>Iudgment</hi>) of the Church,
and which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of all, that the Church cannot come
into the Possession of any thing, but what was originally given her by
the <hi>Legislator.</hi>—He that undertakes to prove it impossible that the
Church should claim by an undue Title; must prove it impossible, that
the Church should ever be deceived.</q>
            </p>
            <p>4. Is this a <hi>plain,</hi> or rather is it not an <hi>Impossible Rule?</hi> If every one
be bound to submit to the Determination of those things, that <hi>in the
Iudgment of the Primitive and Reformed Churches</hi> are <hi>left undetermined</hi> by
the Word; then every one should be bound to know the Judgment of
the <hi>Primitive,</hi> and <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> as to those things. We should
think it well, if Men would be perswaded to <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> and
to submit to what God hath revealed and made known there to be
their Duty; but (according to what you have here laid down) this should
not be sufficient: but every one is also bound to <hi>search the Monuments of
Antiquity,</hi> to turn over the <hi>Antient Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to get a View of the whole Body of latter <hi>Confessions,</hi> that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him of the Judgment of the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. And
is not this to <hi>bind heavy Burthens upon Men's Shoulders,</hi> and to make
more Sins than are found to be so in God's Law? Or will you say,
that Men are bound to an <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> here, that what you assert to have
been the Judgment of the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, they must
believe without more adoe? Or if you will not say they are bound to
such an <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> in your Word, will you allow them to <hi>suspend the
Act of Submission,</hi> to the Determination of Church-Governours, till
such time as they can be satisfied, that such Determination is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the <hi>Iudgment of the Primitive,</hi> and <hi>Reformed Churches?</hi> Will
you give them time, till they can find <hi>Re-ordination</hi> in the like Case,
reading of <hi>Apocrypha</hi> in the room of God's Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have been
approved and practised in the Primitive and Reformed Churches?</p>
            <p>5. Is this <hi>a golden,</hi> rather is it not a <hi>leaden Rule?</hi> May it not be turned
contrary ways? Was the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> for <hi>kneeling</hi> in the Act of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Were not the <hi>Psaltzgraves Churches</hi> to be reckoned among the <hi>reformed</hi>
Churches? And were they for our <hi>English Ceremonies?</hi> Do not the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:47910:30"/>
Churches hold some things lawful, and indifferent, which in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are unwarrantable? As things indifferent,
and lawful in the Judgment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are not so in the
Judgment of some other reformed Churches. <hi>I do profess plainly</hi> (says
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> p. 376.) <hi>that I cannot find any rest for the Sole of my Foot, but
upon this Rock only</hi> (the Bible.) <hi>I see plainly and with mine own Eyes, that there
are Popes against Popes, Councils against Councils, some Fathers against others,
the same Fathers against themselves, a consent of Fathers of one Age against a
consent of Fathers of another Age, the Church of one Age against the Church of
another Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Is <hi>this Rule,</hi> of the <hi>Iudgment of the Primitive and Reformed Churches</hi>
indeed <hi>applicable to your established Rule?</hi> Do you find the one agreeable to
the other? Were the Primitive Churches for <hi>imposing the same Liturgy,</hi> the
same <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which they yet held undetermined by God's
Word? Was it their Judgment, that each Nation, or Province should be
tied up to a strict <hi>Vniformity</hi> in such things? Do you find this within the
first five hundred years? Can you gainsay those Words of yours, (cited,
<hi>Rector of Sutton, p.</hi> 19. which I think are <hi>pertinent</hi> and <hi>material</hi> here) <q>We
see the Primitive Christians did not make so much of any Uniformity in
Rites and Ceremonies; nay I s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arce think any Churches in the Primitive
times can be produced, that did exactly in all things observe the same Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms:
which might be an Argument of Moderation in all, as to these
things, but especially in pretended admirers of the Primitive Church.</q>
And yet would you have every one bound to submit to the determination
of Church-Governors in such Matters, <hi>whatever his private Iudgment be</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them? As <hi>Eusebius</hi> notes from <hi>Irenaeus (l. 5. c. 26. English c.</hi> 23.)
the Primitive Christians could differ in such Matters, and yet live in Peace.
And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> So <hi>Anicetas</hi>
and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> could differ in such Matters, and yet <hi>communicate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
The Primitive Christians retained <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntrary Observations,</hi> and yet (as
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> said) <hi>held fast the bond of Love and Vnity.</hi> Can you ever prove that
the Primitive Church, or the best reformed Churches, have assumed a
Power of suspending Ministers from their Office, and of debarring Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
from Communion for such Matters?</p>
            <p>Here comes to my Mind that which you say, <hi>Vnreas. of Separat. p.</hi> 14.
that <hi>our Reformers preceeded more out of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>verence to the Ancient Church, than meer
opposition to Popery.</hi> (Yet with <hi>King Iames, Defence of the right of Kings,</hi>
p. 47c. <hi>the Christian Religion reformed,</hi> is as to say, <hi>purged and cleansed of all
Popish Dregs.</hi>) And p. 17. <q>Altho they made the Scripture the only Rule
of Faith, and rejected all things repugnant thereto; yet they designed
not to make a Transformation of a Church, but a Reformation of it; by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47910:30"/>
reducing it, as near as they could, to that state it was in under the first
Christian Emperors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> (Agreeable to <hi>Chillingworth, p.</hi> 287. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 82.)
But whether you took not the hint of distinguishing the <hi>Transformation</hi> of
a Church from the <hi>Reformation</hi> of it, from Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> I cannot
tell. However <hi>T. C.</hi> (latter part of his <hi>second Reply, p.</hi> 172.) could not
discern it to have any Solidity, but called it <hi>a single solid Argument:</hi> seeing
<hi>Transforming</hi> may be <hi>in part,</hi> as well as <hi>Reforming.</hi> And you have not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it at all. But what a strange <hi>Assertion</hi> is that of yours, <hi>p.</hi> 96. <q>That
there are in effect no new Terms of Communion with this Church, but
the same wich our first Reformers owned, and suffered Martyrdom for in
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days?</q> And will you stand to this, that they died <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtyrs
for Ceremonies,</hi> and for such Impositions, as have thrust out so many Ministers,
that are most ready to subscribe to the same Truth, for which indeed they
laid down their Lives? I had thought, that <hi>I. Rogers</hi> (the <hi>Proto-Martyr</hi>
in that Persecution) had been a <hi>Non-conformist.</hi> As there were other <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi>
also that suffered. And can you make the World believe, that
they <hi>suffered for Conformity?</hi> And did not the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days
suffer in one and the same Cause, whether Conformists, or Non-conformists?
Indeed they agreed well in <hi>Red</hi> (in Blood, and Flames) who before had
differed in <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White.</hi> But as you will have it, <hi>p.</hi> 2. <q>Our Church
stands on the same Grounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 4. I would only know, if
those Terms of Communion which were imposed by the Martyrs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reformers, and which are only continued by us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> I say, you
would persuade us, that you are <hi>upon the same Grounds</hi> with our first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
who were for Reforming according to the Scripture, rejecting all
things repugnant thereto, only they would have the Church reduced, as
near as they could, to that state it was in, under the first Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
(<hi>p.</hi> 17.) Now to make this good it lieth on you to prove from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
written Tradition, that the <hi>present established Rule</hi> was the Rule for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Ministers into their Function, and other Church-Members into
Communion, <hi>observed in those Antient Churches,</hi> or one <hi>as near as could be to
it;</hi> and further to make it good, that it is not at all <hi>repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Rule:</hi>
Or if you cannot do this, you must then grant, that you are
gone off from the <hi>Rule of our first Reformers,</hi> that is, the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
<hi>those Primitive Churches,</hi> and that the Terms of Communion are not indeed
the same. <hi>Propter externos ritus disciplinae homines pios ferire, neque Domini est
voluntas, neque purioris Ecclesiae m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Would not such a Rule be <hi>point-blank</hi> contrary to <hi>Scripture-Rule?</hi> If
never so many Councils, if all the Churches upon Earth determined, that
they had such Power, that they could cut off both Ministers and Members
of the Church for Matters <hi>left undetermined by God's Law,</hi> we could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47910:31"/>
to such Determination, while we believe the Scripture, which tells us
so plainly, that they have no <hi>Power for Destruction, but for Edification.</hi> I
subscribe to that of <hi>Panormitan, Magis Laico esse credendum, si ex scripturis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur,
quam Papae, si absque verbo Dei agat.</hi> Is not the Scripture-Rule plain
here, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. that the Governours of the Church must not <hi>Lord it over

and <hi>properly</hi> intended there; yet no doubt, by just and <hi>undeniable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
it will as well follow, that they are not to <hi>Lord it over the Clergy.</hi>
And when <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> sets down the just causes of <hi>separation from Rome,</hi>
he gives this for one good Reason; <hi>Because they usurp more Power than the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

P. 221. <q>
                  <hi>Not but that I think there may be a Separation without Sin, from a

Separation is, some heinous Error in</hi> Doctrine, or some idolatrous Practice in

               </q> This <hi>Tyranny

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47910:31"/>
from those Words, <hi>p. 208. A prudent and due submission in lawful things lies
between Tyranny over Mens Consciences,</hi> and <hi>endless Separation.</hi> With Bishop
<hi>Davenant</hi> it is <hi>credendi ac loquendi legem dicere.</hi> Now if this be the Case of
Non-conformist Ministers, that others would tyrannize over their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
will it not justify their Separation, which is but a <hi>Separation secundum
quid?</hi> And if you deny this to be their Case, be pleased to give a sound
and solid <hi>Answer</hi> to those few Pages of the <hi>second Plea for Peace,</hi> towards
the end, <hi>p. 116, &amp;c. Qui tyrannidem in Christianissimum vel usurpat, vel

            <p>8. Will you say, every Man is bound (for Peace-sake) to submit to the
Determination of Church-Governours, <hi>whatever his private Iudgment may be;</hi>
When his Judgment may be, that such a Determination is against the Word,
tho never so many Churches, and Councils judg otherwise? And when his
Judgment may be, that <hi>submission</hi> to such Determination of Men, would be
<hi>real Disobedience</hi> and acting contrary to the Will of God? If his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be rightly informed, then he <hi>opposeth the Authority of Scripture,</hi> and the
<hi>Iudgment of God to the Iudgment of Men</hi> (as <hi>Chillingworth</hi> says, <hi>p.</hi> 309.)
which is certainly allowable. If his Conscience and Judgment be erroneous,
yet he must <hi>suspend the act of Submission</hi> to such Determination, till he can
be better informed: or acting here <hi>against his Iudgment</hi> and Conscience
(tho erroneous) he would greatly sin. As suppose the Governours of the
Church to have determined, that we shall all <hi>declare our Assent</hi> unto that
in <hi>Preface</hi> before the <hi>Book of Ordination, [That it is evident unto all Men, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
reading Holy Scripture, and Ancient Authors, that from the Apostles time,
there have been these Orders of Ministers in Christ's Church, Bishops, Priests and
Deacons, as several Officers.</hi>] You could not have submitted to such Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
while your Judgment was the same, as when you wrote your
<hi>Irenicum.</hi> This is evident from what I noted thence, <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi>
p. 41, 66. <hi>
                  <q>Nothing can be more evident,</q>
               </hi> than that it rose not from any <hi>divine
Institution, &amp;c.</hi> Could you have dissembled with God and Man for Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake.
(But more of this afterwards.)</p>
            <p>But I am thinking, you may possibly object, That you speak of things
supposed to <hi>be left undetermin'd,</hi> whereas I Instance here, in a matter that
the Word determines. Yet I hope this may be more convincing. Let
us for this once suppose, that you could now prove from Scripture, that
the <hi>Bishops Office</hi> is distinct from that of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> yet I hope you will
grant me, that you could not have submitted to such Determination of
the Church, while you believed no such thing. And then I have what
I would have. Every Man cannot lawfully submit to the Churches De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
though it be <hi>according to the Scripture</hi> (that is, so long as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47910:32"/>
his Judgment, is the Determination is without, and against Scripture)
then must not the same be said, of such Determination, as is <hi>besides the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
I know you will not say, the <hi>Churches Word is above God</hi>'s. So you see
how this part of your Rule falls short of what you aim at.</p>
            <p>One thing you have under this Rule, <hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 124. I should take a
little notice of some-where, and let me do it here. <q>There must be a
Difference made (say you) between the Liberty and Freedom of a
Man's own Judgment, and the Authority of it.</q> So by being under
Governours a Man parts with the <hi>Authority of his Iudgment;</hi> but you
would not have him deprived of the <hi>Liberty</hi> and Freedom of his Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
otherwise to what purpose is this distinction brought? Now I would
not be so uncharitable, as to think, that by <hi>the Liberty of a Mans own Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
you could mean a Liberty of professing and declaring contrary to his
own Judgment, in Submission to the Determination of Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
for the Churches Peace. And therefore I say, your Rule here is short,
and reacheth not to our Case.</p>
            <p>2. You say, in this last Conclusion, that <hi>in M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tters of meer Order and

of the lawful Governours of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, 1. This is readily granted, if by <hi>Matters of meer Order and Decency,</hi>
you understand <hi>Matters of meer Order and Decency.</hi> As you seemed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
no more, when you wrote your <hi>Iren.</hi> For there you distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<q>Ceremonies and Matters of meer Decency and Order for Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake.
And you further say that Matters of Order and Decency are
allowable and fitting; but Ceremonies, properly taken for Actions sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative,
their Lawfulness may with better Ground be scrupled.</q> (Noted,
<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> pag. 16.) And thus far (if you please) you and I are
agreed, That <hi>Rules of Order</hi> (not contrary to the end of Order) should
be submitted unto; and that not only <hi>for the Churches Peace,</hi> but also <hi>in
Obedience</hi> to God's Command, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi>
And to such orderly Determinations, what <hi>Camero</hi> says (<hi>pag. 314. col.</hi> 1.)
may in some sort be applied,—<hi>Admonitiones quidem sunt respectu Ecclesiae,
at Leges respectu Dei; nempe hâc Ratione quod commendavit Ecclesia, Deus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ravit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But I observe, that in other Writings since your mind is changed,
and you have learned now to <hi>confound,</hi> what before you would have <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,</hi>
that is, your <hi>Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Matters of Order and
Decency</hi> (as was noted, <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 63.) So you say, in your <hi>New
Account,</hi> or <hi>Vnreasonableness of Separation,</hi> p. 393. <q>We declare, that they
are appointed only for Order and Decency.</q> And thus now these become
<hi>meer Matters of Order and Decency</hi> with you. Of which there hath been,
and is so great dispute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:47910:32"/>Here two or three Questions come in for your Solution.</p>
            <p>1. Whether such Rites and Ceremonies, are Matters of meer Order and
Decency?</p>
            <p>2. Whether the Governours of the Church have Power to appoint and
determine the use of such Matters?</p>
            <p>3. Whether every one is bound to submit to them, upon such Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</p>
            <p>I intend not to say much upon these Questions, supposing they may
fall in others Way. And but that you seem too resolved to <hi>hold your own
Conclusion,</hi> so much hath been written upon these Points, that might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
us from saying more, till what hath been published, be fairly answered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question</hi> 1. Whether such <hi>Rites and Ceremonies</hi> are Matters of <hi>meer Order
and Decency?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. You say, and <hi>declare, they are appointed only for Order and Decency.</hi>
But not as if the contrary implied a natural Indecency (as was noted,
<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 63.) whereupon it follows, that you must hold them
<hi>vainly appointed,</hi> or that the contrary might as well have been appointed;
and so teach, or tempt People to have hard Thoughts of the Governours
of the Church, for appointing and so rigorously imposing such Ceremonies,
whereby many are deprived of their Ministers, and of some of God's
Ordinances; which may seem very harsh, if they are only for Order and
Decency, and that in so low a Degree, that the Worship of God might
be <hi>as orderly and decently</hi> performed, without them. Would you have the
Governours of the Church deprive Ministers of their Liberty, and others of
the Sacraments for no other Cause, than their meer Wills?</p>
            <p>2. Do you well accord here, with Mr. <hi>R. Hooker,</hi> who says, <hi>Our Lord
himself did that which Custom and long-usage had made fit; we, that which
Fitness and great Decency hath made usual?</hi> You seemed, (<hi>Answer to several
Treatises,</hi> p. 268.) unwilling that any should urge you with that, <hi>Scil.</hi>
Then the Apostle's way of Worship, was not not in it self altogether so
decent and fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if the Ceremonies be in themselves of such an <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Nature,</hi> that the contrary implieth <hi>no Indecency,</hi> then you cannot say,
that their <hi>great Decency and Fitness</hi> was the Ground of appointing and
using them. Wherein you and Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> appear to be of different Minds.
And <hi>kneeling at Communions</hi> with him (<hi>l.</hi> 5. §. 68. <hi>p.</hi> 366.) is <hi>a Gesture of
Piety,</hi> which is something more than <hi>meer Decency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Do you well accord here with the Governours of the Church? You
<hi>declare, our Ceremonies are appointed only for Order and Decency.</hi> Whereas
they have <hi>declared</hi> them to be <hi>for the due Reverence of Christ's holy Mysteries
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47910:33"/>
and Sacraments.</hi> And that they are <hi>apt to stir up the dull mind of Man to the
Remembrance of his Duty to God, by some notable and special Signification,
whereby he might be edified.</hi> Will you say such things, <hi>are only for Order
and Decency,</hi> which are for the <hi>due Reverence</hi> of Christ's holy Mysteries, and
for stirring up the dull mind of Man to the Remembrance of his Duty to
God, and for his <hi>Edification?</hi> One would think, that such things should
be <hi>good in themselves,</hi> and not as you say, <hi>of an indifferent Nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
Can you imagine things that are <hi>only for Order and Decency</hi> (whose
contrary are as decent) to be the same, or <hi>as good as things for the due
Reverence</hi> of Christ's holy Mysteries? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if a Ceremony be <hi>apt to stir
up the dull mind of Man</hi> to the Remembrance of his Duty, whereby he
may be <hi>edified,</hi> then is it not made <hi>medium excitans,</hi> which you say (<hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
of Separation,</hi> p. 354.) <hi>our Church utterly denies?</hi> Is here no
<hi>spiritual Effect</hi> attributed to Ceremonies, which you can by no means
allow, <hi>pag.</hi> 347. But this you are commonly driven to in Disputation, to
say, they are <hi>only Matters of Order and Decency,</hi> and so would bring them
under that Rule or Precept, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in Order,</hi>] tho
they are things of a quite different Nature. Matters of Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
are there commanded <hi>in genere;</hi> but it would be no Transgression
of that Command, though not one of these Ceremonies were appointed,
or used in the Worship of God, nor any others like them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Whether the Governours of the Church have Power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
and determine the Use of such Ceremonies?</p>
            <p>Here 1. You say, <hi>pag.</hi> 347. <q>If Men do assert so great a Power in the
Church, as to appoint things for spiritual Effects,—it is all one as to
say, the Church may make new parts of Worship.</q> And then the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, whether these are no <hi>spiritual Effects,</hi> if they be <hi>for the due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
of Christ's holy Mysteries, and for Men'<hi>s Edification?</hi> And as Dr.
<hi>Field</hi> says, they are adhibited, <hi>to exercise great Fervour and Devotion.</hi> And
<hi>Hooker, Men are edified by Ceremonies when either their Vnderstandings are
taught somewhat whereof in such Actions it behooveth all Men to consider, or
when their minds are stirred up to that Reverence, Devotion, and due Regard
which in those Cases seemeth requisite.</hi> If you mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them unprofitable, <hi>idle
Indifferents,</hi> are not such things unworthy of the Churches Appointment?
and if others make them profitable, <hi>edifying Ceremonies,</hi> have you not
here denied that the Church hath so great Power of her self to appoint
such?</p>
            <p>2. If Church-Governours have Power, that is, <hi>lawful</hi> Power, or <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
from Christ, to appoint and command the Use of such Ceremonies,
then they can shew so much Power granted them in their <hi>Commission,</hi> or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47910:33"/>
prove it from the written Law of Christ. Here I remember what you say,
<hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 103. <q>Is it in that Place, where he bids the Apostles
to teach all that he commanded them, that he gives Power to the Church
to teach more than he commanded? And a little before it, what hath
he commanded her to do?</q> to add to his Doctrine by making things
necessary, which he never made to be so? Surely, you cannot think the
Church hath any such Power. <hi>In all kind of Grants,</hi> says <hi>Gurney</hi> (Vind.
of 2<hi>d</hi> Com. 45.) <hi>The want of an Affirmative is Negative sufficient.</hi> Then
may not Men question, whether the Governours of the Church have such
a Power from Christ, till they can prove it?</p>
            <p>If [<hi>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</hi>]
doth not imply, that the Governours of the Church may teach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
more, than they have his Word and Warrant for; I can think of
no other Text more likely for the purpose, than that, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 40. Let all
things be done decently and in Order</hi>] Upon which Mr. <hi>F. Maso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </hi> grounded
[<hi>The Authority of the Church in making Canons and Constitutions concerning
things indifferent,</hi> printed 1607.] But here you will fall short too. For
(I suppose) the Jews were as well bound to perform the Worship of
God <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>in order;</hi> yet that was no Warrant or Allowance for their
bringing in <hi>other Rites and Ceremonies</hi> into God's Worship, than what God
himself had appointed. And what if Church-Governours forbad the
Use of such Ceremonies? Would it be to sin against this Rule? Cannot
the Worship of God be performed <hi>decently,</hi> and <hi>in ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> without them?
<hi>Antecedently</hi> to any Determination of Christ's Governours Men are bound to
worship God decently and in Order; but none are so bound to use such Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
in God's Worship, as was hinted before. And that these differ
<hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to genere</hi> from <hi>Matters of Order and Decency,</hi> may appear, in that if we
suppose them approved of God, they are Matters of an higher Nature,
than things meerly <hi>decent,</hi> that is, they are <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>religious,</hi> not only
<hi>finally,</hi> but <hi>formally,</hi> that a Man would do amiss, that used them only as <hi>decent,</hi>
neglecting the <hi>spiritual Signification</hi> of them. And then will it not follow,
that if they be not approved and allowed of God, it is worse for Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to appoint and command them, than if they commanded some
simple <hi>indecent thing</hi> in God's Worship? As Superstition, or false Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
(<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) is worse than a meer Indecency.</p>
            <p>3. It would seem, by what we reade, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11, 14. that the Apostle
<hi>Peter</hi> had no Authority to appoint the Observation of such things. Yet
his Power was as great, as any Church-Governours now can pretend to,
with Reason.</p>
            <p>4. If Church-Governours have such a Power (as you say of Men's se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
upon account of their Scruples, <hi>Vnreason. of Separation,</hi> pag. 379.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47910:34"/>
which I answered before, <hi>pag.</hi> 29.) <hi>where can you stop them</hi> from appointing
new Ceremonies? And <hi>where will you fix,</hi> as to the use of them? And
what Assurance can you give us, that we shall <hi>see an End of them,</hi> that they
will never appoint more? Notwithstanding what you say, <hi>p. 388. by the
same Power</hi> that the Church hath decreed these, she may decree more Rites
and Ceremonies, as indifferent as these, and how many, who can tell?
And being once decreed, you must think you are bound to submit to such
Deter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ination, who are to be <hi>Iudges,</hi> whether such or such Ceremonies
be rightly determined and appointed? You well know what was said,
<hi>Commiss. Account,</hi> p. 71. <hi>Not Inferiours, but Superiours must judg what is
convenient and decent.</hi> So, if the Governours of the Church once <hi>judg all
those Ancient Rites</hi> of the Christian Church, we ever read of, with many
new ones of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as many as they could refine and purge
from Popish Superstition) to be all decent, and convenient, then must
you not submit to them all? Though it would be a Sign, that <hi>Religion</hi>
was <hi>far past the Meridian in the Church</hi> (as <hi>T. Fuller</hi> says) <hi>where she can
hardly be seen, for the length of her own Shadow.</hi> As you plainly declare,
from another <hi>p.</hi> 184. that <hi>Separation</hi> is not warranted upon the Account
of <hi>bare Ceremonies, although many more</hi> were enjoyned; so you must say,
that <hi>Submission</hi> to them is a thing not to be denied, <hi>though many more were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi>
And therefore I say, suppose and grant, that the Governours of the
Church have <hi>Power to appoint such Ceremonies,</hi> and you know not where
they and you shall stop. And this Power you grant in your subscribing to
<hi>the 39 Articles.</hi> For <hi>Art.</hi> 20. saith, <hi>The Church hath Power to decree Rites or

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:47910:34"/>
if more Ceremonies were retained, and the <hi>more Ancient,</hi> rather than such
as came up in latter times, (as <hi>Standing</hi> may be proved before the <hi>Ceremony

            <p>And whether there are not <hi>many Ceremonies</hi> in use among the Papists, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of having a good signification put upon them, and so <hi>as innocent</hi> and
indifferent as these; and therefore for the Reason you have given, to be
retained, or entertained amongst us, to <hi>shew our Iustice and Equity</hi> towards
them, that we <hi>proceed not in meer opposition to Popery,</hi> that we <hi>break not with
them about meer indifferent things?</hi> And will you be for <hi>that peaceable Design,</hi>
for <hi>going as near to Rome</hi> as you can, without Sin? But thus upon your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
the Church might be <hi>Reformed</hi> I will not call it, but <hi>Transformed,</hi>
(borrowing the Word from you) and become as <hi>Ceremonious</hi> as was the
<hi>Iewish Church under the Law.</hi> And they that highly applaud such Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
as mighty <hi>Helps to Devotion, &amp;c.</hi> may next tell the World that the
<hi>Iewish Church</hi> was <hi>priviledged</hi> above the <hi>Christian,</hi> as having more such
Helps; (unless they have a Face to say, that the <hi>Ceremonies of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
were <hi>no such Helps,</hi> as those <hi>of Man's Inventions.</hi>) And consequently
that latter Churches (which some take to have been less pure) had some
Helps, which Christ and his Apostles were not mindful to supply the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church with.</p>
            <p>5. It would seem, that if Christ had approved of the appointing of such
things, he would rather have appointed them himself, in his Word, (which
would have gained them more repute and esteem, and might have ended
the <hi>dispute</hi> about them.) There is the <hi>same Reason</hi> for all Churches to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and practise them, as for ours. 'Tis impossible for you to assign any
Reason for the Cross in Baptism, <hi>&amp;c. à natura rei,</hi> now, but what would
have been as <hi>pleadable</hi> even in the Apostles times, and at all times since.
Then is it not most probable, that Christ would have made <hi>an universal Law</hi>
for them, that should equally respect all Churches, had it been his Mind
to have such things in his Church? Indeed we find, Christ hath <hi>instituted</hi>
what <hi>religious Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> he would have observed, in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the New Testament. And where he hath determined the matter
himself, what have Men to do more, than to <hi>submit to his Determination?
What can Men do, that come after the King?</hi> None are like to do his work
better, or know his Mind better, than himself.</p>
            <p>6. If the exerting such a Power be found <hi>contrary to many express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>
in the Word, how can we imagine such a Power conveyed to Church-Governours
in any <hi>general Command</hi> there? The Scripture is no where
contrary to it self. Consult <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15, &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 17,
to the end of the Chapter. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 1, 2. Are there such plain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in Scripture for <hi>mutual Forbearance,</hi> and against <hi>judging,</hi> and <hi>despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:47910:35"/>
one another for such things as God hath not commanded, and against
<hi>offending the weak,</hi> or <hi>casting a stumbling-Block</hi> in others way, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Peace and Unity of the Church; and can we think it probable,
or a thing credible, that Christ would have all <hi>such Commands</hi> set aside,
meerly for the sake of things called <hi>indifferent Ceremonies?</hi> Or that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
or Determinations of Church-Governours about such Matters
should be of Force against the <hi>standing Rules,</hi> and Laws of Christ, who is
King of his Church? <hi>Matters of Order and Decency</hi> are things of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
necessary <hi>in genere,</hi> as I have said before; and yet Men cannot oblige
us to this or that particular Order, when it is <hi>repugnant</hi> to that, whereunto
it should be <hi>subservient.</hi> Then much less is it the Will of Christ, that meer
<hi>indifferent things</hi> (if no worse) should take place of great and <hi>necessary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
Such indifferent things must either be <hi>made necessary,</hi> or else you must
say, (it cannot be avoided) That the <hi>Churches Peace</hi> may be <hi>broken,</hi> sound
Ministers, and Christians (that scruple the lawfulness of them) may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,

And yet one that ever read his Bible might know so much, that
the Governours of the Church have other work to do. And as the <hi>second
Book of Homilies</hi> says (p. 3.) <hi>Better it were, that the Arts of Painting, Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering,
Carving, Graving, and Founding had never been found nor used, than
one of them whose Souls in the sight of God are so precious, should by occasion of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or Picture perish and be lost:</hi> So indeed better it were, that no such
Ceremonies had ever been appointed by Men, than one Soul should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared
by them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r one Minister or Member of Christ suffer.</p>
            <p>7. I query, If Christ had not appointed the Sacraments of the New-Testament,
whether it had been in the power of Church-Governours to
have appointed <hi>washing with Water in token,</hi> and to put us in mind of our
being washed and cleansed by the Blood of Christ, and by the sanctifying
influence and operation of his Spirit; and so likewise to have appointed
the <hi>eating and drinking of Bread and Wine,</hi> as <hi>signifying</hi> that our Souls are to
feed upon Christ, whose Body was broken, and whose Blood was shed
for us? Had not these been of the same Nature, and <hi>as lawful</hi> as the <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
Ceremonies,</hi> which the Church hath taken on her to appoint? Then
let the People understand the Power of the Church, that if Christ had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
instituted <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> she could yet have in part
supplied that want with those <hi>significant Ceremonies,</hi> that would have been
something like them.</p>
            <p>8. If Church-Governours have power to appoint such a Ceremony, as the
<hi>Cross in Baptism,</hi> (for Instance) then they have power to <hi>add to the thing
which God hath commanded,</hi> and to make <hi>new parts of Worship.</hi> But <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.
2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 32. forbids that. You grant <hi>p.</hi> 337. <q>That for Men to make new
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47910:35"/>
parts of Divine Worship is unlawful. For that is to suppose the Scripture
an imperfect Rule of Worship, and that Superstition is no Fault,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cross in Baptism</hi> is an <hi>Addition.</hi> Tho you seem to understand the
prohibition of adding to the Word, of things <hi>directly repugnant;</hi> yet that is
not so properly an <hi>Addition,</hi> as an <hi>Abolition.</hi> As one says, <hi>Prohibetur hîc
additio, non tantùm contrarii, (quae non tam additio est quàm abolitio) sed etiam
diversi. (v. M. Poli. Synops. Crit. in Deut.</hi> 4. 2.) Methinks, we may
know what it is to <hi>add,</hi> if we understand what it is to <hi>diminish;</hi> then as they
might not diminish, or take away from God's Worship <hi>one significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
which the Lord had instituted, by a <hi>Parity of Reason</hi> it would seem
to follow, that they might not introduce or add <hi>one significant Ceremony</hi> to
the Worship, God had instituted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cross in Baptism</hi> is made <hi>a new part of Worship.</hi> For that which is
used in God's Worship <hi>in such a manner,</hi> and <hi>to such an end,</hi> that there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing but <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> or God's appointing it to be used in that
manner, and to that end, to make it a <hi>part of the true Worship of God,</hi> that
is made a part of God's Worship, tho falsly, for want of Divine Institution.
Had Christ appointed the <hi>Cross in Baptism,</hi> as the Church hath appointed it
to be used, <hi>in token</hi> that we should not be ashamed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had Christ appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, by <hi>that Badg to dedicate us to the Service of him that died upon the Cross;</hi>
no doubt it had thus become a part of God's true Worship. Here you
speak short, <hi>p.</hi> 348. The <hi>Canon</hi> says, <hi>It is an honourable Badg, whereby the
Infant is dedicated to the Service of,</hi> &amp;c. And what is that, but <q>
                  <hi>a Sign from
Men to God, to testify their Subjection?</hi>
               </q> Which by your own Confession
there is <hi>an Act of Worship;</hi> and yet you will have it no such thing. P. 355.
you say, <q>If Christ had instituted it with such Promises—(then no doubt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
And I say, If Christ had instituted it <hi>only in token,</hi> that we <hi>ought not to be
ashamed</hi> to confess him (which is less, than that <hi>hereafter we shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed</hi>)
had he appointed it <hi>only to signify our Duty,</hi> it would yet <hi>no doubt,</hi>
have been made a part of Worship. And I hope upon second thoughts,
you will say the same.</p>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47910:36"/>
There is no doubt, but that Law forbiddeth <hi>other Inventions</hi> of Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>worshipping of Images,</hi> or of <hi>God by Images.</hi> And whether the

take notice of. And so you may have a fuller Answer to that, <hi>pag.</hi> 338.
<q>What is neither forbidden, Directly, nor by Consequence, is lawful, and
may be practised in the Worship of God.</q> And it may seem a little
strange, that such learned Men, as have written for the <hi>Cross,</hi> and <hi>kneeling

such Ceremonies there included, it would imply, that the <hi>Worship</hi> of
the Apostles, and <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> was not <hi>so decent,</hi> wanting these

being appointed and enjoyned by the Governours of the Church?</p>
            <p>And here, 1. I cannot yet find, that you have taken off what you had
said, <hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 64. (cited <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 14.) <q>When the Generality
of those who use them, do not use them as indifferent, but as necessary
things, it ought to be considered, whether in this Case such an Use be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable?</q>
Now will you allow such Ministers to forbear the use of the
Cross in baptizing, till they can find their People better informed, and
brought off from any such Superstitious Conceit of that Ceremony? For
certain it is, very many (such as are ignorant, and most backward to
be instructed) do conceit the <hi>crossing</hi> of their Children <hi>necessary,</hi> as if Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
could not be rightly administred without it. What if a Minister be
scrupulous, and in doubt, whether by the use of the Ceremony he be not
guilty of <hi>confirming</hi> them in their <hi>Superstition?</hi> Will you consider such,
to take off the Scruples you may have occasioned by this Passage?</p>
            <p>2. And what will you say to them, who cannot believe, but they are
<hi>made necessary?</hi> When they see them as <hi>strictly imposed</hi> and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but <hi>indifferent things.</hi> Would not that <hi>considerable Person,</hi> you once speak

says, <hi>Our Church-Governours questionless might have brought in one Rite, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47910:36"/>
Ceremony, with the same Liberty to Men's Consciences, that they have done ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
Scil. <hi>The Cross, and Surplice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the same Liberty, as bowing to
the East or Altar.</hi> As he also cites, <hi>A Petition of the House of
Commons to King</hi> James, An. 1610. Wherein is as follows, <hi>Ministers
being removed from their Ecclesiastical Livings for not conforming in some
Points, it is a great grief to your Majesties Subjects, seeing the whole People that
want Instruction are by this means punished.</hi> Here I remember what you
say of the <hi>Vow Corban,</hi> (p. 340.) and how they <hi>thought their Tradition
to over-rule the Law.</hi> Then you can clear your Ceremonies, as <hi>innocent,</hi>
and free from any such Crime. And yet it hath sometimes been known,
when <hi>no Surplice, no Service.</hi> And Conformity to the Ceremonies is
made so necessary, that People must have <hi>no Ministers without</hi> it. By which
means many Souls are at great wants. That you should hold <hi>it a thing
more pleasing to God,</hi> that the Ceremonies be used and kept up, than that
the Souls of Men in many places be relieved, and taken care for. And if
the Worship of God must rather be omitted, than the Ceremonies, is not
this, <hi>to set up Men's Traditions above God's Law,</hi> and Men's Inventions
above Divine Institutions? Many cannot be satisfied with that you tell
them, <hi>p.</hi> 346. That <hi>these Ceremonies are purged from Popish Superstition and Error.
And therefore all Opinion of Merit and spiritual Efficacy is taken from them;
which do make them to be Parts of Divine Worship.</hi> They know not that an
<hi>Opinion of Merit</hi> is necessary to any part of Divine Worship. And if you
would convince them, that you look on them as no more than <hi>naked,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> they could wish, that as you <hi>disclaim the Opinion of</hi>
their <hi>spiritual Efficacy</hi> and <hi>necessity in Word,</hi> so they might see that you do
<hi>it in deed,</hi> that none may be <hi>deprived of the Means,</hi> that God is wont to
make <hi>effectual,</hi> and are ordinarily <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> for the sake of such
Ceremonies, which you will not say are <hi>effectual,</hi> or <hi>necessary</hi> thereto.
And to go on one step further with you here, to (<hi>p.</hi> 347.) either you
must grant such Ceremonies are <hi>to be altered,</hi> dispensed with <hi>in this Case,</hi>
or you must take them to be <hi>unalterable,</hi> and then (by your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
there) you <hi>make them parts of Divine Worship.</hi> 
               <q>For (as you say)
this supposes an equal Necessity (of them) with that of Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</q>
And if Men must be without the Word, and without Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
rather than without your Ceremonies, as some have been, and
still ordinarily are) then do you not <hi>make them of equal Necessity with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

be such? And thus have you proved (for us) your Ceremonies to

            <p>For haste I have here thrown things on heaps. A few words now to
the third part of your last Conclusion.</p>
            <p>3. You say, <q>Wholly as to the Form of Government every one is
bound to submit to such Determination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here I offer to your Consideration what follows.</p>
            <p>1. Whether they that could <hi>submit</hi> to Episcopacy <hi>as to their Practice,</hi> that
is, live peaceably under it, and obey Governours <hi>in (Licitis &amp; Honestis,</hi>) so
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47910:37"/>
far as God's Law allows, should be urged further, to <hi>submit their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to the Divine, or <hi>Apostolical Right</hi> of Episcopacy, when determined
by Governours, <hi>whatever their private Iudgment may be?</hi> Could Bishop
<hi>Cranmer</hi> have declared his Assent to such Determination, whose Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was, <hi>That the Bishops and Priests were not two things, but both one Office
in the beginning of Christ's Religion,</hi> (as you cite his MS. <hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 392.)
could such a Man as Dr. <hi>Holland,</hi> (and I need not tell you what he was)
who called Dr <hi>Laud a Schismatick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for <hi>asserting the Divine Right of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
saying, <hi>It was to make a Division betwixt the English and other Reformed
Churches?</hi> Or could <hi>Lud. Capellus</hi> have submitted to such Determination,
<hi>That it is evident to every one diligently reading holy Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. who in effect
says the contrary, <hi>Thes. Salmur,</hi> p. 8. §. 33. <hi>Ne<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>, verò praescripto ullo divino
desinitum esse putamus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And if the like was determined of Arch-Bishops, as of Bishops, I am in
some doubt from what I meet with in your <hi>Rational Account,</hi> whether
you could submit to such Determination. For there <hi>pag.</hi> 298. You speak
of it, <hi>as a known and received Truth in the Ancient Church,</hi>—<q>That the
Catholick Church was a Whole consisting of Homogeneal Parts, without
any such Subordination or Dependance.</q>—Here I would be satisfied,
how you would expound Homogeneal Parts, and so you seem to expound
them, <hi>p.</hi> 300. <q>Since the Care and Government of the Church by these
Words of <hi>Cyprian (Episcopatus unus</hi>) appears to be equally committed to all
the Bishops of the Catholick Church.</q> (But then should not all, that have
the Care and Government of the Church committed to them, be supposed to
be <hi>Bishops;</hi> and no one Bishop above another; otherwise how is the <hi>Care and
Government of the Church equally committed</hi> to them; how is there <hi>Episcopatus
unus?</hi> And how doth the Church consist of <hi>Homogeneal Parts?</hi>) And thus
will it not follow, that <hi>no Constitution higher</hi> than that of such <hi>Bishops as have the
Care and Government of the Church</hi> committed to them, (which you here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to be with <hi>a Parity</hi>) should be <hi>made the Center of Ecelesiastical Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
And yet more fully, <hi>p.</hi> 302. <q>When S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>Episcopatus unus est,
cujus à singulis in solidum Pars tenetur, de Vnit. Eccles.</hi> p. 208. That every
Part belonging to each Bishop was held <hi>in solidum,</hi> he therein imports that
full Right and Power which every Bishop hath over his Charge; and in this
Speech he compares the Government of the Church to an Estate held
by several Free-holders, in which every one hath a full Right to that
Share which belongs to him. Whereas according to your Principles the
Government of the Church is like a Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or or Lordship, in which the
several Inhabitants hold at the best but by Copy from the Lord.</q> Now it
would be considered, whether in these Words you have not given <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi>
Churches a shake, if not <hi>Diocesan</hi> Churches too?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47910:38"/>2. Whether you could <hi>submit,</hi> and <hi>declare your Assent,</hi> if lawfull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
should determine that <hi>Bishops</hi> were <hi>no Superiour Order</hi> of Divine
or <hi>Apostolical Institution,</hi> and should require your Assent? Would you
then disown, and discard such, whom you here maintain to be the <hi>Apostles
Successours?</hi> For what you say, (<hi>Vnreasonableness of Separation,</hi> Preface,
<hi>p.</hi> 89.) we may not think you would <hi>ever be afraid or ashamed</hi> to own
them. For there you tell us, <hi>The Friends of the Church of</hi> England <hi>will
not be either afraid, or ashamed to own her Cause.</hi>—<q>They must not think,
that we will give up the Cause of the Church for it (that is, for Union,
or the Churches Peace) so as to condemn its Constitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Then
you cannot say, that <hi>wholly as to the Form of Government,</hi> every one is
bound, for the Churches Peace, to submit to the Determination of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
whatever his private Judgment be. Here I have put a Case,
wherein you could not submit.</p>
            <p>3. What if the whole Work of Government, belonging to the Pastor's
Office, was quite taken out of their hand, that they were made <hi>meer Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
of the Bishop,</hi> and such <hi>Copy-holders,</hi> as must hold nothing but <hi>at the
Will of their Lord?</hi> Would you have them bound to <hi>acquiesce</hi> in the <hi>publick
Decision,</hi> without doing any thing towards a Reformation? Should they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
the Churches Interest, <hi>for the Churches Peace?</hi> May they not <hi>endeavour
any Alteration,</hi> not so much as by complaining to Governours of
such Exorbitances of Power, and by humble Petition for Redress?</p>
            <p>4. Is every one bound to submit (wholly as to the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
to Governours Determination? Then what if our <hi>Civil Governours,</hi>
and the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> should differ in their <hi>Iudgments,</hi> and <hi>Determinations?</hi>
I make no question, but you have one time or other met with that of <hi>Sir
Francis Knolles</hi> to my Lord Treasurer <hi>Sir William Cecil; Moreover, whereas
your Lordship said unto me, that the Bishops have forsaken their claim of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
over their Inferiour Brethren (lately) to be by God's Ordinance, and that
now they do only claim Superiority from her Majesties Supream Government:
If this be true, then it is requisite and necessary, that my Lord of</hi> Canterbury
<hi>do recant and retract his Saying in his Book of the great Volumn against</hi> Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,
<hi>where he saith in plain Words (by the Name of Dr.</hi> Whitgift) <hi>that
the Superiority of Bishops is of God's own Institution; which Saying doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
her Majesties Supream Government directly, and therefore it is to be retracted
plainly and truly.</hi> And I find something like this, in that small Tract,
called (<hi>English Puritanism,</hi> c. 6. §. 6.) <hi>They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

humano: <hi>That all such deny a principal Part of the King's Supremacy,</hi> which
indeed you must hold, as to Bishops, if you can prove them an <hi>Apostolical
Institution.</hi> Though I know the time when you was of another mind,
<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 41. <q>Will not all these things make it seem very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
that it should be an Apostolical Institution?</q> And <hi>pag.</hi> 40. you
believed, that <hi>upon the strictest Enquiry</hi> it would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound <hi>true, that Ierome,

Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now suppose the Civil Governours should determine the <hi>Government by
Bishops,</hi> as superiour to the rest of the Clergy, to be only <hi>jure humano,</hi> that
they had Power to alter, if they pleased; and should <hi>require Assent</hi> to this
their Determination: and the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> on the other hand should be
of your mind, resolving not <hi>to give up the Cause of the Church,</hi> or <hi>disown
its Constitution,</hi> and should determine it to be <hi>Iure Divino, vel Apostolico,</hi>
and to be owned of Men, as such: In such a Case whether must the
former, for the Churches Peace, think themselves <hi>bound to submit</hi> to the
Determinations of the latter? Or to which of their Determinations must
others submit? For none, but such as the <hi>Vicar of Bray,</hi> could submit to both.</p>
            <p>Thus I have gone over your three Conclusions which you seem to make
great account of. What <hi>great Service</hi> they are like to do you, let the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Reader judg.</p>
            <p>Instead of my <hi>third Conclusion,</hi> I would offer to Consideration <hi>Chap.</hi>
26 of <hi>Corbet's Kingdom of God</hi> among Men. [<hi>of Submission to Things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by lawful Authority,</hi>] p. 171, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Particularly, <hi>pag. 173. Though the Ruler be Iudg of what Rules he is to
prescribe; yet the Conscience of every Subject is to judg with a Iudgment of
Discretion, whether those Rules be agreeable to the Word of God or not, and so
whether his Conformity thereto be lawful or unlawful. Otherwise he must act
upon blind Obedience,</hi> &amp;c. (with what follows in that Page) And <hi>pag.</hi> 174.
<hi>It is much easier for Rulers to relax the strictness of many Injunctions about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of supposed Convenience, than for Subjects to be inlarged from the strictness
of their Iudgment. And blessed are they that consider Conscience, and load it
not with needless Burdens, but seek to relieve it in its Distresses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You go on with me, <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 74 <q>
                  <hi>But he urges another Passage in the
same Place,</hi> viz. That if others cast them wholly out of Communion,
their Separation is necessary.—<hi>That is no more than hath been always
said by our Divines in respect to the Church of Rome.</hi> But will not this
equally hold against our Church, if it excommunicates those who cannot
conform?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:47910:39"/>Now may not it be said here (as <hi>Rational Account,</hi> p. 336. beginning)
<q>They did not voluntarily forsake the Communion of your Church,
and therefore are no <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> but your Carriage and Practices were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> them to joyn together in a distinct Communion from you?
And may not your own Words (<hi>ibid. p.</hi> 356) be returned, <hi>Scil.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>That by
your own Confession the present Division and Separation lies at your
door, if it be not made evident, that there were most just and sufficient
Reasons for your casting them out of your Communion.—And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
any Church (though pretending to be never so Catholick) doth
restrain her Communion within such narrow and unjust Bounds, that
she declares such excommunicate, who do not approve all such Errors in
Doctrine and Corruptions in practice, which the Communion of such a
Church may be liable to, the cause of that Division which follows, falls
upon that Church which exacts those Conditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is to be noted, that your own Words (<hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 123, 124.)
objected against you, (<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> pag. 30.) are as follow, <q>
                  <hi>This
(Scil.</hi> entring into a distinct Society for Worship) I do not assert to be
therefore lawful, because some things are required, which Men's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are unsatisfied in; <hi>unless</hi> others proceed to <hi>eject</hi> and cast them
wholly out of Communion on that account, in which Case their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is necessary.</q> Whence I inferred, that if Ministers be wrongfully
<hi>ejected,</hi> and wholly cast out of their publick Ministry, for <hi>such things as their
Consciences are not satisfied in</hi> (for <hi>not conforming</hi> in unlawful, or suspected
Practices) it becomes necessary for them to have distinct Assemblies in
this case (at least) if there be need of their Ministry. Yet I cannot
find that you have one word in Answer to this. That one would think,
either you knew not well what to say to the Case of the <hi>ejected Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
or that they were so very despicable in your Eye, you thought them
not worth taking notice of at all.</p>
            <p>Now to your Answers. (1.) <q>Our church doth not cast any wholly
out of Communion for meer Scrupulous Non-conformity in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Rites.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet whatever you say here, I doubt, a Man (though he hath his
Child lawfully baptized) is not secured from the Sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
if he bring it not to the Church to be <hi>crossed.</hi> And though a Man
would joyn in the Communion, yet if he be not satisfied to receive the
Sacrament <hi>kneeling,</hi> by the Rules of the Church he is to be debarred from
the Sacrament, and then liable to Excommunication for not receiving.
And being once <hi>excommunicated,</hi> I would know what parts of publick
Worship the Church allows him to <hi>communicate in.</hi> Thus there seems to
be little more than <hi>a Colour and Pretence</hi> in this first Answer, if the Rules
of the Church be followed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:47910:39"/>But you further say, <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 74, 75. (2.) <q>The Case is vastly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
as to the necessity of our Separation, upon being wholly cast out of
Communion by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the necessity of others separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from us, supposing a general Excommunication <hi>ipso facto,</hi> against
those who publickly defame the Orders of the Church,—In the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> we are cast out with an <hi>Anathema.</hi>
               </q>—</p>
            <p>Now 1. If there be a <hi>necessity of our Separation from the Church of Rome,</hi>
upon account of that highest Censure of Excommunication with an <hi>Anathema,</hi>
and her <hi>pronouncing us uncapable of Salvation, if we do not return to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
(as you here suppose): why then do you allow <hi>a Protestant to joyn
in some parts of Worship in the Roman Church, as in hearing Sermons?</hi> &amp;c. (as
is plain you do, <hi>pag.</hi> 108.)</p>
            <p>2. I shall not oppose you in this, that the general Excommunication
<hi>ipso facto</hi> in the <hi>Canons, lays no Obligation, till it be duly executed.</hi> As you
say, <hi>pag.</hi> 368, 369. <q>General Excommunications although they be <hi>latae
sententiae,</hi> as the Canonists speak, do not affect particular Persons, until
the Evidence be notorious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And the Question is, whether
any Person knowing himself to be under such Qualifications which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
a Sentence of Excommunication, be bound to execute this Sentence
upon himself?</q> Yet another Question may come in here, <hi>viz.</hi> supposing
such a Sentence unjust, though that alone would not <hi>justify</hi> Separation,
whether yet it may not something <hi>extenuate it?</hi> You are not for extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
at all, I can bear you witness.</p>
            <p>3. And may I not say, that this is answering but <hi>by Halves?</hi> It never
reacheth the Case of so many Ministers, who have been <hi>wholly cast out</hi> of
their publick Ministry. It reacheth not the Case of many private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who have been <hi>formally,</hi> and actually <hi>excommunicated</hi> for such Causes,
as can never be proved by Scripture to deserve such a Censure and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
You know that <hi>Canon</hi> of the Council held at <hi>Agatha</hi> (Can. 2.
<hi>Carranza,</hi> fol. 159.) that <hi>if Bishops excommunicated any unjustly, they were
to be admonished by other neighbouring Bishops.</hi> And might not the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishers
have received such into their Communion, whom the other had
unjustly cast out? As the Council at <hi>Wormes, (Carrenza,</hi> fol. 388. Can. 2.
cut short there, as I suppose.) <hi>Can.</hi> 14th is cited in Mr. <hi>B's Church Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi>
p. 275. §. 56. saying, <hi>That if Bishops shall excommunicate any wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
or for light Cause, and not restore them, the Neighbour-Bishops shall take such
to their Communion, till the next Synod.</hi> And to my weak understanding you
say nothing here to what you have <hi>Iren.</hi> p. 119, 120. where you fairly clear
<hi>Non-conformists,</hi> but <hi>lay the Imputation of Schism</hi> upon those who <hi>require
such Conditions of Communion,</hi> as they cannot conform unto for Conscience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake.
The very <hi>requiring of such Conditions,</hi> you would have there to be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47910:40"/>
no less than <hi>an ejecting Men out of Communion.</hi> And therefore I should
wonder, if by being <hi>wholly cast out of Communion,</hi> you then meant only
being <hi>excommunicated with an Anathema.</hi> As I doubt not, but Separation
is as necessary, where one cannot have Communion, with-out <hi>joyning in
unlawful or suspected Practices,</hi> as where one is formally <hi>excommunicated,</hi>
yea, and if an <hi>Anathema</hi> were annext to the Sentence too.</p>
            <p>You add, (3.) <q>That Author could not possibly mean, that there was
an equal Reason in these Cases, when he expresly determines, that in
the case of our Church, Men are bound in Conscience to submit to the
Orders of it; being only about Matters of Decency and Order, and such
things which in the Judgment of the Primitive and Reformed Churches
are left undetermined by the Law of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here 1. Be pleased to note, that as much as you seem taken with, and
hug this Conceit of yours, (as you have it once and again here, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in your <hi>Conferences,</hi> p. 171. as if you thought it would do you <hi>Knights
Service</hi>) yet it remains wholly unproved, that the things imposed are
only <hi>Matters of Decency and Order.</hi> (Still I conceive, that if Man only

something <hi>more</hi> than a <hi>meer matter of Decency and Order,</hi> or something <hi>worse.</hi>
And whether the same may not be said of the <hi>Sign of the Cross,</hi> I am in
doubt; for they seem to be parallel.) And so it neither is, nor ever can be
proved that <hi>such Imposition of such things, in the Iudgment both of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and of all Reformed Churches,</hi> is allowable by God's Law; and that
Men are bound to submit to them, whether they are satisfied about them,
or not.</p>
            <p>2. When you say, <hi>The Author of Irenicum could not possibly mean, that
there was an equal Reason in these Cases;</hi> I would fain know what those
Words mean, <hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 119. (cited <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 21.) <q>Let Men
turn and wind themselves which way they will, by the very same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that any will prove Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lawful,
because she required unlawful things, as Conditions of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
it will be proved lawful not to conform to any suspected or
unlawful Practice required by any Church-Governours upon the same
Terms, if the things so required be, after serious and sober Enquiry,
judged unwarrantable by a Man's own Conscience.</q> Did you not here
suppose some Equality in these Cases? And which way did you <hi>wind and
turn your self,</hi> to get off from those Arguments?</p>
            <p>3. And let me say this further, How could you then <hi>possibly mean,</hi> that
Men should be <hi>bound in Conscience to submit to significant Ceremonies, as meer
Matters of Order and Decency,</hi> when you so plainly distinguished them, <hi>Iren.</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:47910:40"/>
pag. 67. And say of such Ceremonies, that <hi>their Lawfulness may with better
ground be scrupled,</hi> p. 68. (cited <hi>Rect. of Sutton,</hi> p. 16.) Could you then <hi>possibly
mean,</hi> that such <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Matter of Order and Decency</hi> were all one?
certainly you could not, any further than you might <hi>possibly contradict</hi> your
self.</p>

you had said your self, <hi>Irenic.</hi> p. 65. though you there meet with it again.
Wherefore I wonder how you could overlook it. If that <hi>Council at Gangrae,</hi>
had enjoyned the religious use of a <hi>peculiar habit,</hi> appropriate to the Service
of God, and others had refused to submit to it, I question then, whether
the Council would not have been the <hi>Schismaticks!</hi> (As, whether any,
without being guilty of making a Schism, can exclude and silence Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
for <hi>wearing Beards,</hi> or for not obeying such a trifling command as that
was, Mr. B, <hi>Church-History,</hi> p. 360, 361. §. 55.) But upon that matter of
the Council's condemning the followers of <hi>Eust. Sebastenus,</hi> I still query,
whether you ought not to make a difference betwixt such as <hi>separated meerly
upon pretence of Purity,</hi> while they were indeed defiled with gross Errors both
in Opinion and Practice, (as I there shewed;) and such as are <hi>necessitated</hi>
to withdraw, and cannot otherwise <hi>keep their Consciences pure?</hi> This you
should consider. As <hi>Chillingworth</hi> says, p. 282. § 71. <hi>A Murderer can cry,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The seventh and last place, where you take notice of me is, <hi>p.</hi> 307.
And there I am brought in, as concluding with and for you, about your
<hi>National Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we are agreed herein, why then do you call that which I say of it,
(<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 20, 21.) <hi>A weak Assault,</hi> as you do implicitly, <hi>p.</hi> 303.
§ 23. <hi>Assaulting</hi> (tho never so weakly) is not <hi>agreeing,</hi> but quite different,
or rather contrary. But there I say, 1. That <hi>we will thank you, if you can prove
the National Church of</hi> England, <hi>as it is now established, to subsist by a Divine
Law, and positive Institution of Christ.</hi> 2. I put it to the question, whether
it be not <hi>Schismatical, for any National Church to make such Terms of Agreement
and Communoon,</hi> as are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot <hi>agreeable to that same Rule,</hi> by which all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ought to walk? (And that your Terms are such, is easy to prove from
<hi>your own Words</hi> there recited) And whether they that <hi>so far separate</hi> from
such a <hi>dividing</hi> National Church, tho they comply not with <hi>its established
Rule,</hi> may not yet be found <hi>walking by the same Rule,</hi> in the true sence of
your Text? Yet these things you thought fit to pass by, and would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
persuade your Readers (that had rather <hi>take your Word,</hi> than
be at any pains to compare things together) that <hi>we are agreed,</hi> and <hi>this point
is thought fit to be given up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet I do not deny, but Christians of whatsoever Society, (whether
a less or greater) should be for uniting so far as they can, to preserve and
strengthen the Society, and to promote true Religion and Christianity. So
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47910:41"/>
I agree with you in what you say, <hi>p.</hi> 292. <q>The best way of the Churches
Preservation is by an Union of the Members of it;</q> provided the Union
be such as doth not overthrow the ends of it. And doubtless this is a good
and necessary <hi>Proviso.</hi> for that which <hi>overthrows the ends of Vnion,</hi> is a
<hi>wicked Conspiracy</hi> against Christ and his Church, rather than true <hi>Christian
Vnity,</hi> or Concord. But then it should be considered, if a National Church
sets down such Terms of Union, as have no tendency to promote the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cause of Religion, and true <hi>Interest of Christianity,</hi> such terms as are sure
to <hi>cause Dissention,</hi> as evidently tend to <hi>divide,</hi> break and shatter the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whether the Churches Preservation be therein truly consulted, or any
way likely to be thereby secured? And whether (as Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> says, <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</hi> &amp;c. p. 155. <hi>The Constitution of the Church should not be set as
much as may be for the incomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssing of all true Christians, which indeed makes for
its most fixed and ample state?</hi> And whether the <hi>taking of a narrower compass,
be not a fundamental Error in its Policy, and will not always hinder its stability
and increase?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I think I have spoken to all the Passages in your Book, wherein I
am properly concerned.</p>
            <p>Yet am I not at an end of my Task. In your <hi>Preface</hi> you direct me to
<hi>three Letters</hi> you have <hi>subjoined</hi> to your <hi>Treatise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preface,</hi> p. 76. You say. <q>There is one thing more which this Author
takes notice of—(<hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> p. 6.</q> If we are condemned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
abroad, we may thank our Friends at home, who have misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
us to the World, while we have not been allowed to plead for our
selves. <q>Therefore, to give satisfaction, as to the Judgment of some of the
most eminent and learned Protestant Divines abroad, now living, I have
subjoyned to the following Treatise, some late Letters of theirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether you have put these Letters in print with the <hi>consent</hi> of those
that wrote them, or by some <hi>Law</hi> or Priviledg <hi>peculiar to your self,</hi> I know
not, nor shall I trouble my self to enquire.</p>
            <p>And whether they were procured on purpose, to grace and set off this
Book of yours, (as by their Date they appear to have come lately, as you
say, the first written in <hi>September</hi> 80.) The second in <hi>October.</hi> The third in
<hi>November.</hi>) this however is not very material. But it is likely some may
think your <hi>Five Answerers confronted</hi> and confounded, with the Authority of
these <hi>three Letters</hi> of some of the <hi>most eminent and learned Protestant Divines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
now living.</hi> Yet to tell you my Thoughts, I could not but think thus
with my self, That if we had no more cause to fear a <hi>French-Army</hi> confuting
us by <hi>Club-Law,</hi> than that any <hi>eminent French Protestant Divines</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
us (if they thorowly examined, and knew our Cause) we were so far
safe enough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:47910:42"/>Now as to these <hi>Letters,</hi> it concerns not me to descant on the whole:
but especially to enquire, and observe, <hi>whether it be not, as I said.</hi> Or as
<hi>Calvin</hi> wrote to Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> and his Brethren (<hi>Ep.</hi> 165. as you have it not far
from the beginning of your <hi>Book. p.</hi> 12.) <q>That the state of the Case at
<hi>Frankford,</hi> had not been truly represented to him, which made him write
with greater shar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ess than otherwise he would have done.</q> I think, we
shall see it plain, That either they had not <hi>the true state of our Case</hi> laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, or if they had, then they wrote very much besides it. I suppose
their Letters here faithfully translated.</p>
            <div n="1" type="notes_on_letter">
               <head>The First Letter is from Monsieur Le Moyne.</head>
               <p>THo I find a Letter of the same Persons formerly published, wherein it
is said, <hi>he thought himself abused, sundry Passages in his Letter,</hi> moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it.</p>
               <p>But from what is here published, <hi>P.</hi> 404. <q>I could not have persuaded my
self, that there had been so much as one, which had believed, that a Man
could not be of her Communion, without hazarding his own Salvation.
—It is a very strange thing to see them come to that Extream, as to
believe that a Man cannot be saved in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 408.
Is it not horrible Impudence, to excommunicate her without Mercy,—
for them to imagine that they are the only Men in <hi>England</hi>—that hold
the Truths necessary to Salvation, as they ought to be held?]</q> From
hence is it not plain now, that either he understood not the <hi>matter of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
betwixt the Conformists, and Non-conformists; or else did here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it? Had M. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> consulted and perused your Sermon (which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
was the Occasion of those Writings that M. <hi>de L' Angle</hi> seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
unseen, <hi>p.</hi> 420, 423.) had he only read what you say, <hi>p.</hi> 21. <q>
                     <hi>I will
not make the Difference wider than it is,</hi>—1. <hi>They unanimously confess</hi>
they find no Fault with the Doctrine of our Church, and can freely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to all the Doctrinal Articles.—Well then, <hi>the case is vastly different</hi>
as to their Separation from us, and our Separation from the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi>—2. <hi>They generally yield,</hi> That our Parochial Churches are true
Churches—<hi>They do not deny,</hi> That we have <hi>all the Essentials</hi> of true
Churches, <hi>true Doctrine, true Sacraments.</hi>—3. <hi>Many of them declare,</hi>
that they hold Communion with our Churches to be lawful.]</q> Or had he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47910:42"/>
seen what you write here, <hi>p.</hi> 95. how all your Answerers <hi>agree with you in the
Doctrine of</hi> the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> says, <hi>we are firmly united</hi>
with you <hi>in Confession of the same Faith;</hi> had these things been in his Eye,
surely, he could not have written at this Rate, as <hi>if we thought, we were the
only Men in</hi> England <hi>that held the Truths necessary to Salvation.</hi> So I leave
you your self to judg, whether M. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> goes not upon a great Mistake.
Sure I am, that either he, or you, have greatly misrepresented us, (as every
ordinary Capacity, by comparing what I have here set down, may readily
discern.) If what he says of us here be true, what you say must needs be
false. Now I do the more willingly <hi>appeal to your Iudgment here,</hi> touching
these things, whereof we are accused, because I know you are <hi>expert in the
Questions</hi> that are amongst us. Say then, Whether ever any such Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
arose betwixt the <hi>Conformists</hi> and <hi>Non-conformists?</hi> Let me hear of
one <hi>Non-conformist,</hi> that ever asserted, <hi>That a Man could not be saved in the
Communion of the Church of England,</hi> or, that no <hi>Conformist</hi> could be saved.
Yet this learned Professor would have them all to be such. As is too
plain from that very <hi>odious Parallel,</hi> which he says (<hi>p.</hi> 408.) <q>One might
make,—betwixt them and the <hi>Donatists.</hi>—Betwixt them and those
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, who have so good an Opinion of their own
Church, that out of her they do not imagine that any one can ever be
saved.</q> (As for his comparing them with <hi>Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, as more fitly agreeing to others that are for <hi>excomunicating</hi> Christians,
for meer Non-conformity in matters of Ceremonies. And no better will
the Comparison hold betwixt them and the <hi>Audeans</hi> (or <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites</hi>)
as whosoever reads what Antiquity says of them, may perceive.
If they were against <hi>rich Bishops,</hi> that is not to the Point. If our Bishops
would be content with their <hi>Riches,</hi> and quit their claim of <hi>Divine Right,</hi>
(till it can be proved) or not require our <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of it, before we
<hi>believe</hi> it, nor impose such things on us, as we are sure, and can prove
from what they wrote, the Apostles would never have imposed, whose
<hi>Successors</hi> they pretend to be; then I doubt not we could accord with them.
(So that here also he <hi>shoots wide.</hi>)</p>
               <p>And thus alas, by <hi>overdoing,</hi> he hath hitherto <hi>done just nothing</hi> for you. I
know, Sir, that you to whose <hi>Iudgment</hi> I here <hi>appeal,</hi> must needs acquit

Expression of <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s (p. 312. §. 111.) <hi>Though they did the same

the Truth, I do not see that their Meetings are of any great Use,—

must we suppose him to be, who heard <hi>one of the most famous Preachers</hi> of

nothing to the purpose?</hi> And yet some <hi>Conformists</hi> have been known to
transcribe, and preach some of their Sermons almost <hi>verbatim.</hi> I hope,
such thought them to be <hi>of some use.</hi> I say not this of all, or the most.
Not only such as the <hi>friendly Debator</hi> would <hi>scorn it,</hi> but many others
that could not satisfy themselves to <hi>serve God with that which cost them nothing.</hi>
But if there are but two such in a County, Two are some. And then will
it not follow, that People should not hear them? For it seems, the best
Sermons they are known to preach, are <hi>of no use.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a little before these blunt Passages, <hi>p.</hi> 409. he speaks very right, if
his Words be rightly expounded, and applied.—<q>They should do all
for a good Agreement; and in the present Conjuncture of Affairs, they
should understand that there is nothing but a good Re-union, that can
prevent the Evils with which <hi>England</hi> is threatned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus others at a distance can fore-see <hi>Ruine</hi> coming upon us by ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Divisions;</hi> and yet we that are so <hi>near to Ruine,</hi> cannot, or will not see it.
The good Lord make those sensible of these things, who might do most
to promote a <hi>good Agreement,</hi> and happy Union, and thereby prevent our
Ruine and Confusion.</p>
               <p>But alas! what <hi>can we do here in comparison of you? Id tantum possumus,
quod jure possumus.</hi> We must not sin against Consciences. Certainly, that
could not be a <hi>good Agreement,</hi> which is made up by Sin. Would others
condescend to our <hi>Weakness</hi> (if they will not have it called <hi>Tenderness</hi> of
Conscience) I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would they condescend, only so far as they might
certainly <hi>without Sin,</hi> where we could not submit without sinning; then
I doubt not, <hi>a good Agreement</hi> would soon follow. And as the <hi>Lord of
Faulkland,</hi> p. 235. <hi>I am confident, that all who receive the Scripture for the
only Rule, and believe what is there plain to be only necessary, would (if they
truly believed what they profess, and were not led aside either by Prejudice or
private Ends, or some Popish Relicks of holding what they have long been taught,
or following the Authority of some (by them much esteemed) Persons either alive
or dead) soon agree in as much as is necessary, and in concluding no Necessity
of agreeing in more; there being no doubt, but it would soon appear plainly what
is plain.</hi> To my understanding, there is more in these few Lines to shew
the way <hi>to a good Agreement,</hi> than in all your Sermon, and this Book, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
taken in too. We readily <hi>agree with you in all that is necessary;</hi> and if
you (for your parts) would but <hi>conclude there is no necessity of agreeing in
more,</hi> I cannot see what can hinder a <hi>mutual good Agreement.</hi>

               <head>Notes upon the Second Letter, from Monsieur de L' Angle.</head>
               <p>ADD <hi>P.</hi> 420. I have not met with such <hi>Writings,</hi> said to be <hi>lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
to make Men believe that Communion with the Church of</hi> England
<hi>is unlawful, and that the Ministers cannot permit it to private Persons without sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
Or if I have seen any such, they are quite out of my Mind.</p>
               <p>As to the former of these, do but allow them to distinguish, as you do
in your <hi>Rational Account,</hi> and they will say, They have communion with
the Church of <hi>England, so far as it is a Church,</hi> and very many of them have
ordinary Communion in the self-same Worship, so far as it is God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And what is <hi>redundant,</hi> it is not <hi>necessary</hi> that they should have
Communion in. It is one thing to say, Communion with the Church of
<hi>England is simply unlawful,</hi> unlawful <hi>in it self,</hi> and so unto all Men; and
another, to say that Communion in the <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> is <hi>unlawful
to them,</hi> who cannot yet be satisfied that they are lawful.</p>
               <p>But we are further supposed to believe, that Communion with the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>intolerable,</hi> in what follows, that the <hi>Ministers cannot
permit it to private Persons without sinning.</hi> Here let every one so far as they
are called to it, speak for themselves. For my part, I have never made it
any of my Work (God, and Men are Witnesses) to warn others to take
heed how they had Communion with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
told any living Soul, that I should sin, if I did not forbid their joyning
with Parochial Congregations. Rather it should be my <hi>Prayer,</hi> I am sure
it is my <hi>Hearts desire,</hi> that sober Conformists, and Non-conformists might
once come to joyn each with other, notwithstanding their lesser Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But it seems, it is not <hi>permitted</hi> to you to have Communion with such
at Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tho you may have Communion with others, from
whom you differ in greater Matters (both as to your Judgments, and
Practices too) while they do but conform. then is there not some strange
<hi>secret Virtue,</hi> or Inchantment in this <hi>Chain of Conformity?</hi> It can <hi>congregate</hi>
the <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> while it <hi>separates</hi> those who are more <hi>homogeneous.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:47910:45"/>But that this is not the Doctrine of the Non-conformists, that they <hi>cannot
permit private Persons to have Communion with you, without sinning,</hi> I am very

while he was at <hi>London,</hi> and could never hear any such thing from
any of them. Otherwise sure, he that could remember the <hi>citing of Pliny,</hi>

whether he should not have had the like <hi>Charity</hi> for very many Ministers, as
he hath for very many of their Hearers, may be a question? <q>I rank these
with those weak ones, who said they were not of the Body; and of whom
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> said they were of the Body for all that.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So why may not they, who are of the <hi>same Faith,</hi> and have the <hi>same Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
for substance, be acknowledged as <hi>Brethren,</hi> and still owned as in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

(I wish he could make us sure here) That if there were nothing wanting
to cure it, but the abstaining from some Expressions, the quitting some

not where we have stuck, what hath thus long hindred our <hi>full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Otherwise, for ought I can perceive
here, we might have had him pleading for us, that such matters of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
might be quite removed, or at least that they might not be urged,
and imposed. And by what immediately followeth there, <hi>p.</hi> 424. it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
he is a great Stranger to the <hi>Savoy-Conference,</hi> never truly understood
how Matters were carried, or who have been the Obstructors of Union.
Had the Non-conformists then, or at any time since, refused to hearken
and submit to fair and just Proposals, which would not have pinched at all
on that part, which should be kept tender in every one; Then had they
been extreamly to blame, and had stood very much in their own Light. But
God allows us not to break our Peace with him and our own Consciences,
for Peace with Men; neither can true <hi>Piety, Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> (three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Vertues which he commendeth in our Bishops, and prayeth they may
be <hi>increased more and more</hi>) require so much of us, which is not in our Power
to grant and yield unto. But seeing (as he says afterwards) he should be
<hi>past all comfort, if he should not see some new Attempt at least made for the success
of a work so holy, and of such Consequence, in a time that seems so proper for it;</hi>
and Thousands more may say the like, who truly <hi>prefer Ierusalem's Welfare</hi>

is <hi>very Antient;</hi> yet had he been required to own this Distinction,
as grounded on the Word of God, and to assert the Right of Episcopacy as

                  <hi>P.</hi> 441. He is expressly against <hi>Tyranny over the Soul, and Mens forcing the
Conscience, by imposing a necessity to believe that which they believe, and to practise
that which they practise</hi> (where we must suppose the things themselves are
not necessary.) And according to what follows, in this case, <q>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Communion ceases of right, and there is not any that is lawful to
be had any more with such.</q> Was there not need of an <hi>Index Expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
here? This makes something for Dissenters, and pinches some where
else. And what follows that, [<q>We do not believe that a single difference
of Government or Discipline, nor even a difference of Ceremonies inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in their own Nature, is a sufficient occasion to break the sacred bond
of Communion] is little to your purpose.</q> I think, a <hi>single difference</hi> of
Ceremonies should not break Communion, where there is an <hi>Vnion in the

               </p>
               <p>Then according to them, there may be <hi>true Churches, true Ministers,</hi>
without Bishops. And as they are ready to receive Ministers <hi>Episcopally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi>
(p. 440.) so they should think it an <hi>Extream,</hi> if we will not own
such for Ministers, as have been <hi>ordained by a Presbytery,</hi> (and that when

there were not Bishops at hand to ordain.) If we will force such to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained,</hi>
or will not admit of them as Ministers, this is an <hi>Extream</hi> with
them.</p>

Is not this a different Case? Would not this be contrary to <hi>true Faith and
Piety?</hi> And are not such so far cut off from the Communion of that
Church, by what he says in the beginning of that Page? That is not
<hi>allowable</hi> for such to do, which yet they look upon as <hi>tolerable</hi> in others,
who are otherwise perswaded in their Minds abut the same.</p>
               <p>Add <hi>P.</hi> 447. <q>I cannot believe that there is any one among them that
looks upon your Episcopacy, or your Discipline, or certain Ceremonies which
you observe, as Blots and capital Errors, which hinder a Man from obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Salvation.—Something was spoken to this,</q> in the Answer to the
<hi>first Letter.</hi> So I say still, they are not so well satisfied about these, as to
give a <hi>true Assent</hi> unto them, and then to <hi>declare their Assent,</hi> would be foul
<hi>Dissimulation.</hi> They know not <hi>how easily</hi> others get to Heaven by their
Conformity: But if they conformed against their Consciences, they
know not how they should ever come there <hi>without Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>pag.</hi> 448. he comes to put in a good Word for us. <q>I hope you
will not be wanting in the Duties of Charity, and the Spirit of Peace,
and that when the Dispute shall be only of some Temperaments, (as
if the Dispute had not been of these all this while) Or of some Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that are a Stumbling-block (and yet innocent things) and which
in themselves are nothing in comparison of an intire Re-union of your
Church under your holy Ministry, you will make it seen that you love
the Spouse of your Master <hi>more than your selves;</hi> and that it is not so
much from your Greatness and your Ecclesiastical Dignity that you desire
to receive your Glory and your Joy, as from your pastoral Vertues, and
the ardent care <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> take of your Flocks.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now I had thought, that <hi>all the Dispute</hi> or Difference betwixt you,
and the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> had been <hi>only about some Ceremonies,</hi> and the like
things; I mean, <hi>such as in themselves are nothing in comparison of an intire
and happy Vnion.</hi> Were but such things removed, or no such things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
I should hope, you would be soon united and agreed. He that
understands not, that it is the strict and rigorous <hi>imposing</hi> of such things,
(which the Imposers might lawfully take off, and we cannot lawfully
submit to) which <hi>keeps up the Difference</hi> amongst us; I say, he that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not this, and does not consider, and speak to it, he cannot be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47910:48"/>
supposed <hi>rightly</hi> to consider <hi>our Case.</hi> And yet how obvious is it, that
this is quite over-looked here, not once seriously debated in any of these
<hi>three Letters?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, as I before <hi>appealed</hi> to you, as <hi>Iudg,</hi> whether we were
not misrepresented here, and you have <hi>judged the matter</hi> already; so I
shall expect, that in the <hi>next Impression</hi> of this your <hi>Impartial Account,</hi>
you will take care, these <hi>Letters</hi> may be left out. You cannot but know,
that they were no <hi>competent Iudges</hi> betwixt us, who had only heard
<hi>one Part,</hi> and seem wholly ignorant what the <hi>other Part</hi> hath to plead for
themselves. Here I remember what you say, <hi>Preface,</hi> pag. 35. (of one
you speak of there) <q>But I must do the Author that Right, to declare,
that before his Death, he was very sensible of the Injury he had done
to some worthy Divines,—and begged God and them pardon for it.</q> So
would I have you to do these worthy <hi>eminent, learned Divines,</hi> and us also
<hi>that write,</hi> to smother their <hi>Letters,</hi> as soon as you can, if you do no more.
Otherwise though I may not live, or have liberty to call you <hi>partial,</hi> the
World may account you so.</p>
               <p>And yet observing every one of them to have some touch for <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Charity, some Temperament,</hi> and the like, <hi>if a Council of such</hi> as these
were called, and once thorowly understood our Cause, I should not doubt
of their <hi>determining</hi> for us. (I have respect to what you say, <hi>Pref.</hi> p 77.)
And to come nearer to you yet, <hi>If a Council could be called of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches in Christendom</hi> (and let any one of these be set in the Chair,)
that would <hi>indifferently hear</hi> what <hi>both Parts</hi> have to say, (I would only
exclude such as you, for what you say, <hi>Rat. Acc.</hi> p. 292. and 338. <q>What
Justice or Reason is there, that the Party accused, should sit Judg in their

               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47910:48"/>Yet for a Conclusion, I have a few Words more particularly to you.
Now,</p>
               <p>Reverend Sir,</p>
               <p>Be not offended at my plainness. I hope 'tis for the Interest of the
<hi>true Protestant Religion,</hi> that I appear in this Cause, (how weak, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
soever.) <hi>My Charity,</hi> (I speak my heart) is not <hi>confined to a
Party,</hi> no, not so set upon that, which you would call my own; but
where I have reason to believe others of a <hi>different Perswasion</hi> are more
holy, and live more like Christians, I would esteem, love, and honour
such more. I am not conscious to my self of wishing you the least harm,
or enjoying your Dignities, or Estate. Live or dye, sink or swim, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
things go with me and mine, I hope, it is my Hearts desire, it may
<hi>go well with the Church</hi> and People of God. I see the <hi>Protestant Interest</hi> in
a lamentable, <hi>tottering State.</hi> Methinks, all that are true Friends to it
should readily yield, it would <hi>stand firmer on ample Ground,</hi> (Terms of
Communion of a due latitude) than on such a <hi>narrow Bottom,</hi> that admits
not of a Multitude of sound Christians, who would be firm to it. Yet
the latter of these you plead zealously for, (though it is plain, your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
them from you, by unnecessary, <hi>uncatholick</hi> Terms, must needs
weaken both you, and them.) This I cannot but be sensible of, and think
it my Duty to lament.</p>
               <p>Unless the Lord shall incline you to a more moderate Course, than you
have lately taken, in reference to Dissenters, I know I may expect a <hi>fiercer
Assault</hi> from you. But I know as well what Ground I stand on, and
further am bold to say, you cannot hope for <hi>Success</hi> in this Cause, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>first destroying</hi> a considerable part of <hi>your own Works,</hi> (not only pulling
down your <hi>Ireni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um,</hi> a good <hi>Sconce,</hi> however now slighted; but also sadly
<hi>battering</hi> and <hi>shaking</hi> that goodly Fabrick, your <hi>main Fort,</hi> the <hi>Rational

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sly destroy,</hi> what you had so <hi>well built,</hi> and
what is <hi>fortified</hi> and strengthened with so much Reason, will you not <hi>make
your self a Transgressor?</hi> And may not this add something to the <hi>grief of
your Wound</hi> (as <hi>Aejop</hi> has it of the <hi>Eagle</hi>) to be <hi>shot with your own Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Reverend Sir</hi>) I would be more concerned far, on other Accounts
for you. <hi>Refrain now from these Men, and let them alone;</hi> for <hi>if the Work</hi>
wherein they are employed be <hi>God's Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> then you cannot <hi>seek to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it,</hi> but therein you will be <hi>found a Fighter against God.</hi> Oh! be well
advised what you do further this way. You may be under a sore Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
seeing your self so far <hi>engaged in this Cause,</hi> possibly you may think,
it would be a Dishhonour now to <hi>retract.</hi> But if by this Undertaking of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47910:49"/>
yours, you seek to deprive very many Souls of the ordinary means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(<hi>forbidding us to preach</hi> to Sinners <hi>that they might be saved</hi>); if thus you
set your self in some measure to obstruct the Course of the Gospel; if you
so far oppose the Interest of Christ, (your great Lord and Master) if you
are against what may be truly called <hi>God's Worship,</hi> and truly <hi>Religious
Exercises,</hi> be assured, this shall not be <hi>for your Honour</hi> in the End. For
the Lord has said, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that despise
me, shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And ought you not to think seriously of it, whether you may not be

            <p>WHether the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> hath not clearly and fully deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the case, against censuring or despising one another
for things Indifferent? <hi>Rom. 14, &amp;</hi> 15. And if Men wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

not understand, nor stand to that Decision, whether it
should be any wonder, if they will not understand, or be satisfied with our
most cogent Arguments? [<hi>Second Plea for Peace.</hi> p. 169. § 75.]</p>
            <p>Whether they that say, the Apostle doth not forbid such Impositions
there, can see Day for Light? 1. Doth he not forbid censuring, despising,
and not receiving one another; and command Dissenters to receive
one another? And then must he not forbid such Imposition as is
inconsistent herewith? 2. Doth he not direct this Command to all
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even to the authorized Pastors and Rulers of the
Church, as well as to the People? 3. Was he not a Pastor and Ruler of that
Church as fully authorized as any that should succeed? 4. Is not this
Scripture (as others) written for a standing Rule, and so obligatory to
Rulers still? [<hi>ib. p.</hi> 170. § 77.] Did not the Apostle speak here by Divine
Authority? Are not his Words recorded here, part of Christ's Law indited
by the Spirit? And may we think, that any that come after him, or to
whom he wrote, should have power to contradict or obliterate the same?
[<hi>Way of Concord, p.</hi> 152.] 5. Do not his Reasons touch the case of all
Churches in all Ages, and not only some particular Persons, and Case? As
he argueth from the difference betwixt well-meaning Christians as weak,
and strong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as doubting, and as assured, as mistaken, and as in the right,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
If such weak, mistaken Christians in such matters ever have been, and ever
will be in the Church upon Earth, doth not the reason from their case and
necessity still hold? 6. How many great and pressing moral Reasons (that
all Christians are bound by) are heaped up here? Does he not argue,
1. From Christian love to Brethren. 2. From human Compassion to the
Weak. 3. From God's own Example, who receiveth such, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47910:51"/>
we must not reject. 4. From God's Prerogative to judg, and our
having no such judging power in such cases. 5. From God's Propriety in
his own Servants. 6. From God's Love and Mercy that will uphold such.
7. Because what Men do as to please God, must not be condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
necessity, but an holy Intention cherished, so it be not in forbidden
things. 8. Because Men must not go against Conscience in indifferent
things. 9. From Christ's dreadful Judgment which is near, and which
we our selves must undergo. 10. From the Sin of laying Stumbling-blocks,
and occasions of Offence. 11. From the danger of crossing the
end of Christ's Death, destroying Souls for whom he died. 12. Because it
will make our Good to be ill spoken of. 13. Because the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi>
or Constitution of Christianity, and the Church, lieth in no such Matters,
but <hi>in Righteousness, and Peace, and Ioy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> 14. Because
<hi>Christ is pleased</hi> in this without the other, and <hi>God accepteth</hi> such. 15. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such are <hi>approved of Men, (i. e.)</hi> This Righteousness, Peace, and
holy Joy, without Agreement in such Ceremonies and By-matters, beareth
its own Testimony for Approbation to the Judgment of all impartial Men;
Humanity and Christianity teach us to love and honour such. 16. From
our common Obligation to <hi>live in Peace with all.</hi> 17. From our Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>do all</hi> to the <hi>edifying of one another.</hi> 18. Because <hi>God's Work</hi> else is
<hi>destroyed</hi> by us. 19. Because our own lawful Acts are turned into <hi>Sin</hi>
when they <hi>hurt another,</hi> and from the Obligation that lieth on us to deny
our own <hi>Liberty in Meat,</hi> &amp;c. to avoid the hurting of another that is weak.
20. From the <hi>Damnation</hi> of such as are driven or drawn to act doubtingly.
21. From the special Duty and Mercy of the Strong that should bear the
Infirmities of the Weak. 22. From the Example of Christ himself, that
<hi>pleased not himself,</hi> and our great Obligation to imitate Christ. 23. From
God's Patience to us. 24. Because indeed this is the true way to <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Vnity,</hi> that <hi>with one Mind and one Mouth we may glorify God,</hi> while we lay
not our Concord on impossible Terms. 25. Because <hi>Christ receiveth</hi> us,
and it is to <hi>God's Glory,</hi> &amp;c. Whether do all these moral Arguments sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
no more than this, <hi>receive and tolerate such only till you make Laws against
them?</hi> [ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 150, 151, 152.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query,</hi> 2. Whether Men have any Authority to make Laws about God's
Worship, but what Christ hath given them? [<hi>Second Plea for Peace,</hi> p.
28. §. 36.] And whether it be not against the Mind and Law of Christ
(declared Act. 15. 28.) that unnecessary Laws and Burthens in Religion
should be made for, and laid upon the Churches? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 29. §. 40.] So
whether that Determination and Decree of the holy Ghost by the Apostles
be not obligatory to all Rulers and Churches upon Earth, even to this
day? And whether all that think not themselves wiser, should not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47910:51"/>
confess that at least it is safe to follow it? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 169. §. 74.] If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pastors shall contrary to that Decree, impose unnecessary things
on the Church, not only under the Obligation of Duty, but as a necessary
Condition of Church-Communion, whether this be not a tyrannizing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God's Heritage, and usurping a Power never given them? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p.
155. §. 33.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether what God hath left to human Prudence to determine
concerning Churches and Church-affairs, be not thus limited by his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> That all things be done to Edification (the Circumstances
fitted to the end, the Glory of God and the publick Good, the promoting
of Truth and Godliness,) that all be done in Love, to the promoting of
Love and Unity; and that all be done in order and decently; and as
may avoid Offence or Scandal to all, both those without, and those within?
[<hi>First Plea for Peace,</hi> p. 19.] Then query,</p>
            <p>1. Whether they do well, that unnecessarily bring Subjects into such a
Strait, by needless Laws, for Additions in Religion, that the Consciences
of Men fearing God must unavoidably be perplexed between a Fear of
Treason and Disobedience against Christ, and of Disobedience to their
Prince or Pastors? [<hi>Second Plea,</hi> &amp;c. p. 28. §. 38.]</p>
            <p>2. Whether it be not more inexcusable to rack and divide the Church
by unnecessary Additions in Religion? [<hi>ibid.</hi> §. 39.]</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be not against the Will and Law of Christ, to use things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
indifferent, scandalously or temptingly, to the ensnaring and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
of Men's Souls, and the Dishonour of Religion? (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14, &amp; 15.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.) And whether Men may make Laws about Religion, enjoyning
such an evil use of such things? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 29. §. 41.]</p>
            <p>4. Whether to invent and command new publick-Worship-Ordinances
(either in God's Name or their own) co-ordinate, or of the same kind
with God's own Worship-Ordinances, which have no peculiar usefulness
to one Age or People more than to another, nor any new Reason for them,
but what was extant at the making of God's Laws, (whether this) seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to be an Accusation of Christ's Laws of Omission and Defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and an Usurpation of his Legislative Power? [<hi>ibid.</hi> §. 42.]</p>
            <p>5. Whether to forbid Baptism, or to alter it, or make a new Sacrament
of Admission, or a new consecrating, or dedicating Symbol for the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization
of our Covenant with God, and a new Symbol of the Christian
Church, or visible Badge of Christianity, seem not an Usurpation, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of God's Law, as insufficient? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 30. §. 46.]</p>
            <p>6. Whether to forbid Preaching, or Prayer or Praise, ordaining Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal
Means of our own, seem not an Usurpation, and unlawful?

            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:47910:52"/>7. Whether to add more Doctrines, or Articles of Faith, which God

and unjust Accusation of God's Word, as insufficient? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 29.
§. 43.]</p>
            <p>8. Whether to alter the Qualifications of Church-members, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
those that Christ requires us to receive, or receiving such as Christ
forbiddeth us to receive, be not to contradict his Laws by Usurpation,
whether Magistrates, or Pastors do it? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 30. §. 45.]</p>
            <p>9. Whether to alter the Qualifications of Christ's Ministers, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Office, and invent new co-ordinate Officers, seemeth not U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation?
[<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 31. §. 48.]</p>
            <p>10. Whether to overthrow, or prohibit Christ's Church-Discipline, or
to set up another (that is not meerly subordinate to it, modally to
promote it) seem not an Usurpation? [<hi>ibid.</hi> §. 51.]</p>
            <p>11. Whether to forbid Religious Assemblies, or alter their Ends and
principal Use, be not to usurp, and to contradict the Laws of Christ?
[<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 29. §. 44.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Whether Rulers ought not to prefer Christ's Interest before their
own, and account that their own lieth in preferring His; and should not
value conscionable upright Men, though Dissenters in tolerable Cases, and
not encourage their unconscionable Enemies? [<hi>Way of Concord, 3d part,</hi>
p. 26.] And whether the chief Work of Rulers be not to promote the
keeping of God's Laws, and the everlasting Good of Men, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Good in order thereunto? [<hi>Second Plea for Peace,</hi> p. 108. <hi>col.</hi> 1.
§. 11.] And whether Rulers may command any thing, which will nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
do more Harm than Good; or make an unnecessary thing a Means or
Occasion of excluding the necessary Worship of God, or preaching of his
Gospel [Judgment of <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> in <hi>second Plea,</hi> &amp;c. p. 76. §. 59.]
And whether is it more to common Good, and the Interest of Honesty
and Conscience, that all the Persons in a Nation be imprisoned, banished,
or killed, that dare not swear, say and practise all that is imposed on them,
than that <hi>unnecessary Impositions</hi> be altered, or forborn [<hi>Way of Concord, 3d</hi>

those Duties, which the Law of Nature or Gospel doth command; yet if
on such Pretence they violate, or contradict either the Law of Nature, or
the Gospel, and dedstroy the Duty it self, or its End, whether we are bound
in such Cases to obey them? Or whether it be not enough that we pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
suffer? [<hi>First Plea for P.</hi> p. 104.]</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 6. Whether the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> had Power to forbid the Priests

change or abrogate their Office? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 20.] Of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s puting out
<hi>Abiathar,</hi> see (<hi>p.</hi> 21.) Whether might they then have put out a lawful
Priest, that had not forfeited his Life, or Office? Or might they have
put any one in his Place, that had not Right from God, or that was unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
Or might they have forbidden the Priests the Work appointed
them by God? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 22.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 7. Whether such as Christ's Laws empower to ordain others to the

of such as Christ's Laws admit into the Ministry? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 25.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 8. Whether the Magistrate (besides the Power of the Temples and
Tithes, and publick Maintenance and Liberty also) hath the Power of
Ordination, or Degradation, that no Man may be a true Minister without,
or contrary to his Consent? [<hi>Sacrileg. Desert.</hi> p. 11.] Whether were not
many of the <hi>Non-conformist</hi>'s true Pastors of their several Flocks, before
they were silenced, and cast out? [<hi>ibid.</hi>] And whether did the ejecting
them from the Temples and Tithes degrade them, or make them no
Pastors to their Flocks? (Though Prudence may require Minister and
People to consent to a Dissolution of such a Relation, when they cannot
hold it without greater hurt than benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) [<hi>ibid.</hi>]</p>

and Consenters to be accepted, when there is just Cause for their
Interposition. 2. And may hinder both Ordainers and People from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing

may urge them to accept the best, and may possess such of the Temples,
and publick Maintenance, and make it consequently to become the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Duty to consent; Yet whether Christ and his Apostles have not settled
the Right of Ordination on the Senior Pastors or Bishops, and the Right
of consenting in the People? [<hi>First Plea for P.</hi> p. 33.] And whether any
Man can be the Pastor of a Church <hi>de jure,</hi> or truly <hi>de facto,</hi> against the
Church, or Peoples Will, or without their Consent? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 25.] As

which for 700, yea 1000 Years held that the calling of a Bishop was
null, that had not the Clergies Election, and the Peoples Election or
Consent? And if Usurpers should thrust out the Bishops and Conformists,
and make themselves our Pastors against our Wills, what would the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

such, agreeing with them in Doctrine and Worship. [<hi>Ans. to Dr. Stil.

not one <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour have undone all the Churches and Souls in the

for chusing Guides for their Souls, as a Daughter in her Fathers House is
under her Father for the choice of an Husband (which yet we have not

(though She culpably deny Consent, <hi>Query,</hi> Whether it be not so here, that
they can be no Pastors to People, till they consent? [<hi>Way of Concord.</hi> p.

90.] Whether should Men persuade the poor to famish, rather than against
Law to beg; because if thousands of them dye of Famine, yet other People
are supplied? [<hi>ib.</hi> p. 102.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 14. Whether the antient Christian Pastors preached not against the
Will of Princes for 300 years; and after that against the Will of Christian
Princes (as <hi>Constantius, Valens, Theodosius junior, Valentinian,</hi> &amp;c.) And
whether not only Apostles said, that God was to be obeyed rather than
Men; but such as <hi>Timothy</hi> (who was ordained by Man) were not strictly
charged before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judg the living
and dead at his appearing, and Kingdom, to preach the Gospel, and be
instant in season, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [<hi>ib.</hi> p. 226, 227.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 15. Whether any Man hath Authority to forbid a Faithful Minister of
Christ, who forfeiteth not his Office-Power, to perform the Office to which
he is ordained? And whether such remain not under a Divine Obligation,
which Man's Law cannot dissolve? Whether it be not right, as Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi>
saith, [If Princes forbid us, we must go on with our work?] What if an
Interdict silence all the Ministers in a Kingdom? Must all obey? What if
it silence more than can be spared without the Churches wrong? And
whose Laws be they, that would so bind? Is it Infidel Princes or only
Christians? Is it Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or only the Orthodox? Must God ask
leave of Rulers to be worshipped as God? Hath God made Men Judges
whether the Gospel shall be preached or not; or whether People shall be
Saved, or left to perish in their Ignorance and Sin? And how cometh the
Orthodox to be authorized to do Mischief, or to forbid the needful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel, any more than an Heretick? or a Christian more than
an Heathen? Is he not bound to do more good than they, rather than au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
to do more hurt? [<hi>Answ. to Dr.</hi> Stil. <hi>Serm.</hi> p. 84, 85. or 78, 79.]

               <hi>Q.</hi> 16. Where such Sins are made the condition of Ministration by Men
in Power, as that all the whole Ministry of a Kingdom are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to deny Consent and Conformity thereto, Whether is it not the
duty of all the Ministry <hi>in primo instanti</hi> to forbear their Ministerial Office,
or of none, (the Reason being the same to all?) Now if all these must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
or lay down their Office, because forbidden by Men to exercise it, then
is it not in the Power of a Prince to cast out Christianity when he pleaseth,
and to deny God all publick Worship? And must we not then ask leave of
Rulers, that Christ may be Christ, and Souls may be saved; (as if the Keys
of Heaven and Hell were theirs?) [<hi>First Plea for Peace,</hi> p. 114, 115.] But
whether must not all agree, that to silence all the Ministers of the Nation,
is a thing that God hath not given any Man authority to do; because of the
necessity of their Ministry: and consequently to silence any necessary
Ministry at all? [<hi>ib.</hi> p. 223.] And if all must not lay down their Ministry,
why must a 1000 or 2000 do it rather than all the rest? If it be said, the
rest are a competent supply to the Churches; how shall we be sure that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mens sinning will absolve the Innocent from their Duty? (As if I
were bound to be a Minister only till other Men will Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And where can
the Wit of Man ever set Bounds as to this Matter? Will it not be granted,
that if the most in <hi>France</hi> conform to Popery, this will not disoblige all
others from the exercise of their Ministry? And who then can say, what
those Untruths and Sins are, which a weak and erring Ministry may be
guilty of, which shall serve to disoblige the rest? And were not this an easy
way to introduce any Error, by forbidding any but the Defenders of it to
Preach? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 115, 116.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 17. Whether God hath authorized the Magistrate to chuse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in what Words only every Pastor shall publickly pray to God, and
what Books and Words of Men he shall profess Assent and Consent to, and
what dedicating Symbols of Christianity he shall use as engaging in the
Christian Covenant; and to command Ceremonies and Modes for Dissent
wherein he shall deny Baptism and Church-Communion to all Dissenters,
tho the things be taken to be indifferent by the Magistrate, and great Sins
by the Dissenters? [<hi>Answ. to Dr.</hi> Stil. <hi>Serm.</hi> p. 14.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 18. Whether Pastors usurp not Power over one another, when they

in no other Words, but what they (the Usurpers) shall write them down,
making Ministers but Cryers to read their Prescripts and Proclamations?

[<hi>Way of Concord, third Part,</hi> p. 27. §. 7.] And whether Pastors of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47910:54"/>
Churches should be constrained to administer Sacraments to any against
their Consciences? Whether it be not their Office to be Judges, who is to
be baptized, and to communicate? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 123.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 20. If any be urged to take a Re-ordination against their Judgments,
whether Morals must not be preferred before Rituals, and Rituals never set
against them? And whether they should not be of this Mind, that deny
the Scriptures to have unchangeably fixed all Rituals; and yet confess that
Morals are fixedly determined? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 214, 215.] It is not contrary to
the temper of the Gospel, which ever subjecteth Ceremonies, Rites and
External Orders, to Morals, and to Man's Good, and the great Ends? [<hi>Ib.
third Part,</hi> p. 81.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 21. When the most learned, sober, judicious Conformists, differ not
at all from us about the Matter it self, to which we deny Conformity; but
confess it to be unlawful (as to the hardest Points of the imposed Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Oaths, Declarations, and Covenants) and only take the Words in
such a Sence, in which we our selves could take them, were we persuaded
that it was indeed the true meaning of them; Query hereupon, How it
comes to pass that they, (who are as much as we against that Sence which
we disown, and agree with us in the Matter) should deserve Liberty, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Preferment, for otherwise interpreting the Words of the Law,
which the Lawgivers themselves will not interpret; when our Supposition,
that the Law-makers mean properly as they speak, is taken to deserve
Scorn, Silencing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from them that will not expound their Words to
us? [<hi>Iudgment of Non-conformists in Second Plea, &amp;c.</hi> p. 116, 117.] And
seeing (as those worthy Conformists must grant) that if the Words of the
Laws be properly to be understood, and not with their Limitations, then
the Conformists are in the wrong, and the Non-conformists in the right;
whether it be not Justice to tell the World, and write it on our Cross, that
we are silenced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because we dare not take Oaths and Covenants impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Terms excluding Limitations and Exceptions, in a limited, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
Sence, without the Explication of the Law-makers? [<hi>ib.</hi> p. 120, 121.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 22. Suppose the Sin were on the silenced Ministers part, yet
if their Errour be in a small and difficult Matter, not deserving silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
(as theirs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. about Meats and Days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whether it
may not be a far greater Sin, and Schism in the Silencers, than in them?
[<hi>First Plea for Peace,</hi> p. 116.] Tho the Magistrate ought to silence all
Preachers, that after due Admonition, so grosly misbehave themselves in
Doctrine, Worship, or Conversation, as to be the Plagues of the Churches,
and to do apparently more hurt than good; yet as to all worthy and able
Ministers, if they commit any Fault, whether they should not be punished
only as other Subjects, with such Penalties, as shall not by silencing or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47910:55"/>
restraint, be a Punishment to the Peoples Souls, nor hinder the preaching
of the Gospel of Salvation? Even as if the common Bakers, Brewers,
Butchers, Carpenters perform their Work perniciously (poysoning their
Bread, Beer, Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) they should be forbidden their Trade: but should
they for other Faults be so punished, that the People be left without Bread,
Beer, Meat, and Houses for their Faults? [<hi>Moral Prognostication,</hi> p. 55.

do they judg our not Subscribing, Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so great a Sin in us,
that the Punishment laid on Swearers, Drunkards, or Fornicators,
will not serve turn to avenge it on our selves, nor any other of

will never do it? Besides a multitude of Reasons, whether doth not
many hundred Years experience prove, that all Christians will never be
in all things of a mind about lawful and unlawful, Duty and Sin? And
whether it be not as certain, that Force will never do it? Will a sound

though weak in Faith, to receive one another, as Christ receiveth us, but
not to doubtful Disputations, and so far as they have attained, to walk by
the same Rule (of Love and Peace) and not to despise or judg each

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 36. Whether Christ, who made the Baptismal Covenant, the Test
and standing Terms of Entrance, did set up Pastors over his Churches, to
make new and stricter Terms and Laws; or to preserve Concord on the
Terms that he had founded it, and to see that Men lived in Unity and
Piety according to the Terms of the Covenant, which they had entered?

are without Exception to be taken into the Church, if any ignorant
Christian will but offer them, and say over a few Words; and the Adult
also, if they can but say over the Creed by rote, and a few Words more,
(that would fill the Church with Enemies of Christ;) and yet when Men are
in, deny them Communion, unless they will strictly come up to many
humane unnecessary Impositions; as if far stricter Obedience to Men
(perhaps in Usurpations) was necessary, than to Jesus Christ? (<hi>Way of

§. 3.) And whether this imply not an Accusation against him, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions?
(<hi>ibid.</hi> §. 4.) And whether the merciful Lord and Saviour of
the Church, that came to take off heavy Burthens and intolerable Yokes,
will take it well to have Men come after him, and as by his Authority, to
make his easy Yoke more strait, and his light Burthen heavy, and to cast

Christ, and excommunicate them? (and whether it be safe for them to do
so?) (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 144.) And seeing that spiritual Priviledges excell tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

               <hi>Q.</hi> 40. Whether Christ be not the Institutor of the Church, and hath
not himself made Laws which are sufficient to be at least the Bond of
their Unity; yea, for more than Essentials, even the Integrals, and many
Accidents? and hath not he given Laws to regulate all Men's Laws that
determine of needful undetermined Accidents? And whether any Man
should be cut off from the Church, or taken as separated, that breaketh no

Law of God, necessary to Church-Unity and Communion? And whether
the grand Schismaticks of the World are not the Engineers that fabricate
needless, impossible, dividing Terms and Conditions of Unity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?

those that differ from us, in more than Circumstances: and that we will
hold Concord with all in Faith, Love, and Communion; (if they will
admit us without our sinning) upon the Terms set down by the Holy
Ghost and the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28? And if no Men must be of the same
Church or Kingdom, that have any difference; yea, as great as can reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
be supposed in the meer Non-conformists, whether any two Men can
be of the same Church, or Kingdom, except you will compose it of such
as hold nothing unlawful, and consequently nothing morally good,
which is no Church? [<hi>Iudgment of Non-conformists in second Plea for Peace,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 42. Whether the long and sad Experience of all the Christian
Churches, which have been divided by unnecessary human Impositions, and
the Voice of all wise Peace-makers in all times, who have still called for
[<hi>Vnity in things necessary, Liberty in things unnecessary, and Charity in both</hi>]
do not leave those that yet will not be perswaded to these Terms, as inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
Persons as almost any in the World; worse than those Physicians,
that would use all those things as the only Remedies, which have killed all
that ever took them? [<hi>Second Plea for Peace,</hi> p. 155. § 34.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 43. Whether they that confess, that for the Communion of all the
Churches, there are no Terms like these now mentioned, should be more
cruel to their own at home, turning them out of their Father's House for
every Ceremonial Difference? Whether a Pastor should not love his own
Flock, as well as the People of a Forreign Land? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 155, 156. §. 35.]
And whether it be not a Schismatical Opinion, that tho Churches of many
Kingdoms may charitably differ in Ceremonies and indifferent things; yet
none in the same Kingdom should be suffered so to differ? Whether the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> gave not the Pastors and People of the same Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
those Precepts of forbearing and receiving Dissenters in things indifferent?

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 44. Whether Uniformity in Circumstantials, and in External Polity,
be any more than a Carkass or Image of Unity, without uniting Love
(which is its Soul?) Whether all Union in Evil, or in unnecessary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials,
which is managed to the diminution of Christian Love, are any
more to the Church, than as the Glory of adorned Cloathing, or Monuments,
or Pictures to a Carkass? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 66.]</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 45. Whether Love and Unity (which the most zealous for human
Impositions cannot but commend) would teach Men to tyrannize over In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors,
to contrive the treading down of others that they may rise, and to
keep them down to secure their own Domination; to oppress the Poor,

with an honest godly Christian, that differeth from their way of Worship
in no greater matter than a Ceremony, have not something more amiss
within than a Ceremony? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 162. §. 48.] And whether the Souls
of such, as some call humorous, peevish, or wilful, be not worth more

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 48. Whether as every Hypocrite would be very Religious, so far as
he can subject the true common Religion to his own Interest and Lusts;
so every Enemy of Peace will not seem zealous for Peace, so that his own
Peace be made the Rule of the common Peace, that all Men be brought to

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 49. Whether all the Arguments for Unity and Peace, which are made
use of against Toleration by Prelatists, and all the mischiefs of division which
they aggravate, do not principally fall on themselves, if it proves that they
are the greatest causes of Division, and hinderers of Church-Concord?
[<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 180. §. 88.] Whether they do not condemn themselves, who cry
down Schism, while they unavoidably cause it? And whether overdoing

Terms of Church-Union and Concord be not the certainest Engines of
Schism? [<hi>Way of Concord,</hi> p. 121. § 11.] Is it not a shameful thing to hear
and read Mens tragical out-crys against necessary Toleration (which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
and Humanity plead for) while they are the causes of that which
they exclaim against? If diversity in Religion be such an Evil, whether
should Men cause it by their unnecessary Laws and Canons, and making
Engines to tear the Church in pieces, which by the antient Simplicity, and
commanded mutual Forbearance, would live in such a measure of Love and
Peace, as may be here expected? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 272.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 50. Tho it be a Sin not to joyn with a less worthy Minister, and a
less orderly Mode of Worship, when we can have no better; yet whether
is it not also a Sin to tye our selves ordinarily to such, when we may have
better lawfully, that is, <hi>consideratis considerandis,</hi> upon terms whereon it will
not do more hurt than good? [<hi>Sacril. Desert.</hi> p. 76.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 51. Tho it be granted, that such are justly condemned by God, that
repent not, tho they had but a Reader: And that they should be thankful
for so much in such Churches where they can have no better; yet whether
is it in the power of any Man justly to forbid them better, when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth
it? And whether must they obey such a prohibition, as such? (Tho
Prudence may discern forbearance to be a Duty, when the hurt would be
greater than the good.) [<hi>First Plea for Peace,</hi> p. 85.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 52. Whether Parish-Bounds of Churches be of Divine Institution,
and unchangeable, or only of human prudential Constitution? [<hi>Sacril.
Desert.</hi> p. 10.] Can any Proof be produced, that ever God determined,
the Churches should necessarily be individuated by Parish-Bounds or Limits
of Ground; and that Men in the same Limits might not have divers Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and be of divers particular Churches? [<hi>First Plea, &amp;c.</hi> p. 13.]
Whether is such a distribution of Parishes, a thing of absolute necessity to a
Church, or only as the general Rules of Order and Edification do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in Christian Kingdoms require it? And whether can we be bound to
such humane distribution against any of Christ's own Laws and Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
or when any changes turn them against the good Ends for which
they are made? Whether can humane Church-Laws bind to Obedience,
when they are notoriously against the Laws of Christ, or against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good, or are made by Usurpation without Authority thereto? [<hi>ibid.</hi>

Members of the Parish-Church where they dwell? If not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dwelling in the Parish makes a Christian a Member of the Parish-Church?
If not, what makes a Member, and how are the Pastors special

the Canon that forbids Men to go from their own Parish-Churches, extend

they are needful for the safety of Mens Souls, must so many thousands ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
their Souls, for want of needful help? [<hi>Answ. to Dr.</hi> Stil. <hi>Serm.</hi> p.
52. or 54.] And whether is there not need of a far greater number of Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
than all the present Non-conformists? [<hi>Sacril. Desert.</hi> p. 10.] And
what harm is there in the Non-conformists preaching, where the tenth
Person cannot come to Church, if they would? [<hi>Sacril. Desert.</hi> p. 12.] And
what may we think of such, as had rather 10000 Persons stayed idly at
home, or went to Sports or Drinking, in <hi>Stepny</hi>-Parish, or <hi>Giles Cripple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
or <hi>Sepulchers,</hi> or <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi> &amp;c. than that any Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
should preach to them? (See 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 15, 16.) [<hi>ib.</hi> p. 13.] When
in <hi>London</hi> it is conjectured that not above the 7<hi>th</hi> or 8<hi>th</hi> part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
can come to hear in the outer Parishes, and if the other 6 or 7 parts
should seek for room in the emptier Churches within the Walls, it cannot
be supposed that above one part of those 6 or 7 would find room: and so
if all be set together, it may be supposed that there is place but for about
the 5<hi>th</hi> or 4<hi>th</hi> part at most of all the People in all the Parish-Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and without the Walls: and <hi>London</hi> is to be denominated rather from
three, four, or five parts than from one of these: and the great Parishes,
where one of twenty cannot hear, are far off from the Churches that have
room, and those that have most need, have least desire of the Means;

publick Worship of God? [<hi>First Plea, &amp;c.</hi> p. 230.] And whether most
great Parishes (especially in Cities and great Towns) have not more Souls
which call for ministerial help, than Conformists and Non-conformists, if
they lovingly joined, are well able to afford necessary help to? [<hi>ib.</hi>
p. 229.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 55. Whether many in place are not grosly defective in the necessary
Qualifications for their Office, (and consequently in the discharge of the
same?) [<hi>Sacriledg. Desert.</hi> p. 10.] And can any Man prove, that if the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Minister
cannot, or will not baptize his Children, he must not get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to do it, yea, a prohibited Minister, rather than they should be unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;
and yet that if the Parish-Church cannot receive him, or the Pastor

Preaching, Worshipping God, and Pastoral oversight? [<hi>First Plea, &amp;c.</hi>

that hath not their License; is there not as much to be said for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a wicked Priest, who (it is sure) hath not Christ's License, and is a

of the Popish Councils forbad all Men to hear Mass from a fornicating
Priest, Whether should not Protestants be as strict? And whether is it not

at Godliness, a Persecutor, an insufficient Guide of Souls, as for being a
Fornicator? And whether many Councils do not forbid hearing Hereticks?

               <hi>Q.</hi> 56. Whether this Argument be not good, our necessity requireth
Pastoral oversight, and Christ commandeth us to use it, when we may have
it: But from this publick Minister we cannot have it: Therefore
we must seek it where we can? [<hi>First Plea, &amp;c.</hi> p. 100.] And
whether People are not deprived of Pastoral oversight as from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Minister, 1. When publick Pastors are at so great a distance from
them, as that such Pastors cannot come to them, nor they and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
go so far, without such cost and pains and loss of time as will deprive
them of the Benefit. 2. When Parishes are so great that the allowed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors

the sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Where the allowed Pastors are so slothful or proud, that
they will not condescend to such Offices of personal Help as the People have
need of, especially to the poorer sort. 4. Where they are young, raw, or
ignorant, unable to counsel People, as their necessities require in order to
their Salvation. 5. Where they are so profane and malignant, that if
poor People come to them with Cases of Conscience, or for Counsel what
they must do to be Saved, they will but deride them, and would make them
believe that to be sollicitous about Salvation, and afraid of Sinning, and
seriously Godly, is but to be Hypocrites, Melancholly or Mad. 6. Where
they are Heretical, and not to be trusted in point of Faith? When in any
of these Cases the People, or part of them are deprived of that Pastoral
Help, which their necessity requireth, and God commandeth, whether
may they not seek it where they can best have it? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 100, 101, 102.]
Whether many Souls are not like to be fed, or famished, and consequently

pray in a sound and serious, holy manner, and encourage and promote
Piety in the People, and willingly accept of all the Help they could get
here; if they endeavoured to do God and his Church more Service than
those that went before them, whether they would not be more honoured,

            <p>

not? If yea, would they not have necessary help to do it? (If not,
are such fit to be Ministers of Christ?) And does that Man truly know
what it is to be a Minister, or a Christian, that perceives not a necessity
of Help, if he can have it? (<hi>ibid</hi> p. 129.) And if things in <hi>England</hi>
were once brought to that pass, that really our Labour would be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

the great Number, Ability, Zeal, and Diligence of the Conformists, that
makes the Labours of others needless? Or what are their Thoughts of
Souls, of Sin, of Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Holiness, and of their own Sufficiency
and Labours? [<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 57.] As of old every single Church had usually ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Presbyters and Deacons with the Bishop; so is it not undeniable, that
many of our Parishes have Work enough for many Ministers? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the only thing pretended for our present Paucity be not the want of

and desired the help of their Brethren, that long ere this they should
have petitioned Rulers for the Liberty of their Ministry (when all knew
that there was no Hope their own petitioning should have Success?)
Whether might they not have humbly acquainted our Rulers, That all
our Labours conjoyned are too little; that they needed our Help, and the
ignorant our Teaching; that their Judgment was, our Ministry is more
necessary than our personal Conformity? And whether should not Ministers
of all Men have been most sensible of the Churches Breaches, Loss and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47910:60"/>
Danger, and most compassionate over Peoples Souls? [<hi>Sacril. Desert.</hi> p.
135.] And whether had they not healed all our Breaches, if they had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and prevailed but for these two things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the door
of Entrance might not have been barred by any other Subscriptions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
or Oaths, than what were used in the Churches of Christ, till the
Exaltation of the Papacy (for 600 Years) besides the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Supremacy, and the subscribing the Doctrine of the Church of

2. That those (so subscribing) who dare not use the Liturgy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
might have leave to preach in the Churches which use them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Laws which shall restrain them from all unpeaceable Opposition to
what they dare not use, or to the Government of the Church? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p.
136, 137.] And what but a spirit of Envy, or a carnal Interest, cross to
the Interest of Christ and Mens Salvation, should grudge at their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
while they are responsible for all they say, or do amiss? [<hi>First Plea,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 63. Whether the Accusers of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> who feign strange
things of them relating to Doctrine and Government (which they do not
own) do not, 1. Hereby render them contemptible and odious, as
brain-sick Persons, who keep up a dividing Faction, in spight of the
Light and Obligation of the common Principles of Humanity and Society?
2. And do they not hereby imprint the Stamp of Satan, <hi>viz.</hi> the hatred of

and Will of Heathen, Mahometan, or Infidel Princes that forbid it; as
the Christians did for 300 Years? And if there be the same Cause and
Need, whether it be any more Schism to do it against the Laws and
Will of a Christian Prince? For, 1. Are not Christ's Laws equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory?
2. Are not Souls equally precious? 3. Is not the Gospel and
God's Worship equally necessary? 4. And doth his Christianity enable
him to do more Hurt than a Pagan may do, or more Good? [<hi>Ibid.</hi> p.

and the other half hath incompetent Men; or if nine Parts of a Kingdom were
competently supplied, and but the tenth Part had not such set over them, to
whom the People may lawfully commit the Pastoral Care of their Souls,
whether is it Schism, or whether is it not a Duty for those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
to get the best Supply they can? And whether is it Schism, or
whether is it not a Duty for faithful Ministers, though forbidden by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
to perform their Office to such People that desire it? [<hi>Ibid.</hi> p.
83.] If the Magistrate appoint 20000, or 10000, or one half of a Parish
to be excluded for want of Room, and Teachers, is it not ill supposed
that the Gospel is truly and sufficiently preached to them, to whom it is
not preached at all? Or doth it prove it not necessary to them, that it
is preached to others? [<hi>Ans. to Dr.</hi> Stil. <hi>Serm.</hi> p. 22.] And whether is not
the general Ordination of Ministers with the Peoples Necessity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
added to God's general Commands to all his Ministers, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and diligent, a sufficient obliging Call to such Ministration, without
the Will of (prohibiting) Superiours, yea, against it? And otherwise
doth it not follow, that it is at the Will of a Man, whether Souls shall
be saved or damned? (for how shall they believe, unless they hear?
And how shall they hear without a Preacher?) and at the Will of Man,
whether Christ shall have a Church, and God be publickly worshipped,
or not? [<hi>First Plea,</hi> &amp;c. p. 48.] And whether doth not the indispensible
Law of Nature oblige every Man according to his Place and Calling, his
Ability, and Opportunities, to do his best to propagate Christ's Gospel,
and to save Mens Souls, as much and more than to feed Mens Bodies and
save their Lives? And whether are not Ministers specially obliged to do

Decision of the Question, [From which of these, and when it is a Sin
to separate?] till it be first known, which of those is of Divine, and which
of Humane Institution? and which Humane Churches are necessary, which
Lawful, and which Sinful? (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 7.) How is it proved, and how

them in Scripture; or else that he gave some Men power to institute them
since Scripture-times? And till the same be proved, whether are any
bound to obey them, at least when they over-rule Christ's own Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
(<hi>Way of Concord, p.</hi> 111. §. 15.) And whether to devise new
Species of Churches without God's Authority, and impose them on the
World (in his Name) and call all Dissenters Schismaticks, be not a far
worse Usurpation, than to make and impose new Ceremonies, or Liturgies?
(<hi>ibid.</hi> §. 16.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 74. Whether a Society of Neighbour-Christians associated with a
Pastor, or Pastors, for personal Communion in holy Doctrine, Discipline,
and Worship, be not a Church Form of Divine Institution? (<hi>First Plea,</hi> &amp;c.
p. 8.) And whether any Proof hath ever been produced, that many
Churches of this first Rank, must (of Duty) make one fixed, greater,
compound Church by Association, as Diocesan, National, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that
God hath instituted any such Form? Whether the greatest Defenders of
Prelacy do not affirm such to be but humane Institutions? (<hi>ib.</hi> p. 12, 13.)
Whether ever any satisfactory Proof hath been brought, that ever Christ
or his Apostles did institute any particular Church (taken in a political Sense,
as organized, and not meerly for a Community) without a Bishop, or
Pastor, who had the Power of teaching them, ruling them by the Word,
and Power of the Church-keys, and leading them in publick Worship?
(<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 13.) And whether hath it yet been proved that any one Church
of this first Rank (which was not an Association of Churches) consisted in
Scripture-times of many (much less of many scores or hundreds) such
fixed Churches or Congregations? Or that any one Bishop of the first
Rank (that was not an Apostle, or Bishop of Bishops) had more than
one of such fixed Societies, or Churches under him; or might have more
stated Members of his Church than were capable of personal Communion,
and mutual Assistance at due Seasons, in holy Doctrine, Discipline, and
Worship? As now there are many Chappels in some Parishes, whose
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47910:62"/>
Proximity and Relation to the Parish-Churches make them capable of
personal Communion in due seasons with the whole Parish (at least <hi>per
vices</hi>) in those Churches, and in their Conversation; and as a single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
may prudently, in Persecution, or foul Weather, meet oft-times
in several Houses; so why might not the great Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
(which yet cannot be proved a quarter so big as some of our Parishes)
hold their publick Meetings oft at the same time in divers Houses,
when they had no Temples, and yet be capable of personal Communion,
as before described? [<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 13, 14.] And when the learned Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. saith, The Church of the Living God, was every such

<hi>Oeconomus</hi> set over them by Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth he not here suppose (as he

and Individuation? (Whence learned Mr. <hi>Ioseph Mede</hi> doth argue it, as

               <hi>Q.</hi> 75. And seeing it cannot be proved, that God hath instituted any other
than Congregational, or Parochial Churches (as for present Communion)
whether must it not follow, that none of the rest instituted by Man, have
Power to deprive such single Churches of any of the Priviledges granted
them by Christ? And whereas Christ hath made the Terms of Catholick
Communion himself, and hath commanded all such to worship him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in holy Communion under faithful Pastors, chosen, or at least consented
to by themselves (which was the Judgment of the Churches many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years) whether can any humane Order or Power deprive them
of any of this Benefit, or disoblige them from any of this Duty, by just
Authority? (<hi>Way of Concord,</hi> p. 111. §. 13.)</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 76. Then if any Prince would turn his Kingdom, or a whole Province

of Christ's Institution, which are associated for personal present Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
allowing them no Pastors that have the Power of the Keys, or all
essential to their Office; though he should allow Parochial Oratories,
or Chappels, which should be no true Churches, but parts of a Church;
Whether were it Schism to gather Churches within such a Church, against
the Laws of such a Prince? (<hi>First Plea,</hi> &amp;c. p. 52.) Or whether hath
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47910:63"/>
God made such proper Judges, whether Christ should have Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Laws, or whether God should be worshipped, and Souls
saved, or his own Institution of Churches be observed? (<hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 53.)</p>

the Churches, and Inferiour Pastors, as their Bishops, who are
obtruded on those Churches, without the Election, or Consent of the
People, or inferiour Pastors, and these Bishops shall by Laws, or Mandates
forbid such Assembling, Preaching, or Worship as otherwise would be
Lawful and a Duty; whether is it Schism to disobey such Laws, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,
as such? (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 80.) Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> (of <hi>Subject.</hi> p. 399.) grants,
[The Election of Bishops in those days belonged to the People, and not
to the Prince; and though <hi>Valens</hi> by plain force placed <hi>Lucius</hi> there;
yet might the People lawfully reject him, as no Bishop, and cleave to
<hi>Peter</hi> their right Pastor.] (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 79.) And however in some Cases the
Advantages of some imposed Persons may make it an Act of Prudence,
and so a Duty to consent; yet whether are such truly the Bishops of such
Churches, till they do consent? (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 80.) Hath not this been taken
for their Right given them by God? And doth not Dr. <hi>Blondel (de jure
Plebis in Reg. Eccl.</hi>) beyond Exception prove it, with more? (<hi>ib.</hi> p. 81.)
Therefore if Bishops that have no Foundation of such Relative Power,
shall impose inferiour Pastors on the Parish-Churches, and command the
Peoples Acceptance and Obedience; whether are the People bound to
accept and obey them by any Authority that is in that Command, as
such? Or whether is it Schism to disobey it? (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 82.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 78. Whether doth it not follow from the Principles of the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,

their Communion lawful; but preferreth another as fitter for him: or he
that denieth Communion with true worshipping Assemblies, as unlawful
to be communicated with, when it is not so? If the former, then will it
not follow, that condemning them as no Church, is a Diminution, or no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47910:63"/>
Aggravation of Separation, and the local presence of an Infidel, or Scorner,
would be a less separate state, than the absence of their Friends? If the
latter (which is certain) then will it not follow, that if we can prove the
Assemblies lawful which they condemn, they are the true Separatists that
condemn them, and deny Communion with them, declaring it unlawful?

And were there not true Churches in <hi>England</hi> in that long Interval of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
