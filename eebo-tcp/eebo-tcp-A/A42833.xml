            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:58119:3"/>
though the Pedant may be angry with me, for shaking his indear'd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet he cannot but approve of this appeal to one, whose very name would reduce a <hi>Sceptick.</hi> If you give your vote against <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing:</hi> 'tis time for the opinionative world, to lay down their proud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions: and if such known accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments acknowledge <hi>ignorance</hi>; confidence will be out of countenance; and the Sciolist will write on his most presumed certainty; <hi>This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vanity.</hi> Whatever in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is less consonant to your seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer apprehensions, I begge it may be the object of your charity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. I betake my self to the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your ingenuity, from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits of your judicious censure. And were there not a benign <hi>warmth,</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:58119:3"/>
well as <hi>light</hi> attended you, 'twere a bold venture to come within your <hi>Beams.</hi> Could I divine wherein you differ from me; I should be strongly induced to note <hi>that</hi> with a <hi>Deleatur</hi>; and revenge the presumption, by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my present self. If any thing seem to you to savour too much of the <hi>Pyrrhonian:</hi> I hope you'l consider, that <hi>Scepticism</hi> is less reprehensible in enquiring years, and no crime in a <hi>Juvenile exercitation.</hi> But I have no design against <hi>Science:</hi> my indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is to promote it. <hi>Confidence</hi> in uncertainties, is the greatest enemy to what is certain; and were I a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> I'de plead for <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing:</hi> For the way to bring men to stick to <hi>nothing,</hi> is confidently to perswade them to swallow <hi>all things.</hi>

            <p>The Treatise in your hands is a
<pb facs="tcp:58119:4"/>
fortuitous, undesigned abortive; and an aequivocal effect of a very diverse intention: For having writ a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which formerly I let you know of, of the <hi>Soul's Immortality:</hi> I design'd a preface to it, as a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> in a Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion:</hi> and my considerations on that <hi>Subject,</hi> which I thought a sheet would have comprised, grew so volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as to fill fourteen: which, being too much for a Preface; I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to print apart. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reassuming my Pen, to annex some Additional Inlargements to the beginning; where I had been most curt and sparing: my thoughts ran out into this Discourse, which now beggs your Patronage: while the two former were remanded into the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:58119:4"/>
of my private Papers: The latter being rendred less necessary by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> much desired, and seasonable arrival; and the former by the maturer undertakings of the accomplisht D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>H. More.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no Apologie to make for my lapses, but what would need a new one. To say they are the <hi>Errata's</hi> of one that hath not by some years reach't his fourth, <hi>Climacterical,</hi> would excuse indeed the poverty of my judgement, but criminate the boldness of this Address. Nor can I avoid this latter imputation, but by being more criminal: and to shun this respectful presumption, I must do violence to my gratitude. Since therefore your Obligations have made my fault, my duty; I hope the same goodness, that gave birth to my crime, will remit it. Hereby you'l further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear

your other favours: and make me as much an admirer of your vertues, as I am a debtor to your civilities: which since I cannot do them right in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement; I'le acknowledge, by signifying that the greatness of them hath disabled me from doing so: an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, which a little charity will render venial; since it speaks your self its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. These your indearments will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate me to a self-contradiction; and I must profess my self <hi>Dogmatical</hi> in this, that I am,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O complain in <hi>print</hi> of the multitude of <hi>Books,</hi> seems to me a self-accusing vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whilest the querulous Reprehenders add to the cause of complaint, and transgress them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that, which they seem to wish amended. 'Tis true, the births of the Press are numerous, nor is there less variety in the humors, and phancies of perusers, and while the number of the one, exceeds not the diversity of the other, some will not think that too much, which others judge superfluous. The genius of
<pb facs="tcp:58119:6"/>
one approves, what another disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth. And were nothing to pass the Press, but what were suited to the universal <hi>gusto</hi>; farewel <hi>Typogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> Were I to be Judge, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be gratified, I think I should silence whole <hi>Libraries</hi> of Authors and reduce the world of Books into a fardle: whereas were another to sit <hi>Censor,</hi> it may be all those I had spared, would be condemn'd to darkness, and obtain no exemption from those ruines, and were all to be supprest, which some think unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy light; no more would be left, then were before <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus.</hi> Therefore, I seek no applause from the disgrace of others, nor will I Huckster-like discredit any mans ware, to recommend mine own. I am not angry that there are so many
<pb facs="tcp:58119:6"/>
Books already, (bating only the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomalies</hi> of impiety and irreligion) nor will I plead the necessity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing mine from <hi>feigned</hi> importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Those that are taken up with others, are at their liberty to avoid the divertisement of its perusal: and those, to whom 'tis not importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate will not expect an <hi>apology</hi> for its publication. What quarter the world will give it, is above my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. If it be but indifferently dealt with, I am not disappointed. To <hi>print,</hi> is to run the gantlet, and to expose ones self to the tongue-<hi>strapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> If the more generous <hi>spirits</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me, let <hi>pedants</hi> do their worst: there's no smart in their censure, yea, their very <hi>approbation</hi> is a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>design</hi> of this Discourse,
<pb facs="tcp:58119:7"/>
the <hi>Title</hi> speaks it. It is levied against <hi>Dogmatizing,</hi> and attempts upon a daring Enemy, <hi>Confidence in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The <hi>knowledge</hi> I teach, is <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>: and methinks the Theory of our own natures, should be enough to learn it us. We came into the world, and we know not how; we live in't in a self-nescience, and go hence again and are as ignorant of our recess. We grow, we live, we move at first in a <hi>Microcosm,</hi> and can give no more Scientifical account, of the state of our three <hi>quarters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, then if we had never been extant in the greater world, but had expir'd in an <hi>abortion</hi>; we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd from the prison of the womb, we live, we grow, and give being to our like: we see, we hear, and outward objects affect our other
<pb facs="tcp:58119:7"/>
senses: we understand, we will, we imagine, and remember: and yet know no more of the immediate reasons of most of these common functions, then those little <hi>Embryo Anchorites</hi>: We breath, we talk, we move, while we are ignorant of the manner of these vital performances. The <hi>Dogmatist</hi> knows not how he moves his finger; nor by what art or method he turns his tongue in his vocal expressions. New parts are added to our substance, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our continual decayings, and as we <hi>dye</hi> we are <hi>born</hi> daily; nor can we give a certain account, how the aliment is so prepared for nutrition, or by what <hi>mechanism</hi> it is so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly distributed; the turning of it into chyle, by the stomachs heat, is a general, and unsatisfying solution.
<pb facs="tcp:58119:8"/>
We love, we hate, we joy, we grieve: passions annoy us, and our minds are disturb'd by those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral <hi>aestuations.</hi> Nor yet can we tell how these should reach our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodyed selves,</hi> or how the Soul should be affected by these hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous agitations. We lay us down, to sleep away our diurnal cares; night shuts up the Senses windows, the mind contracts into the Brains <hi>centre.</hi> We <hi>live</hi> in <hi>death,</hi> and lye as in the <hi>grave.</hi> Now we know nothing, nor can our waking thoughts inform us, who is <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> and what that leaden <hi>Key,</hi> that locks us up within our sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Cels: There's a difficulty that pincheth, nor will it easily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. The Soul is awake, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by external motions, for
<pb facs="tcp:58119:8"/>
some of them reach the perceptive region in the most silent repose, and obscurity of night. What is't then that prevents our Sensations; or if we do perceive, how is't, that we <hi>know it not?</hi> But we Dream, see Visions, converse with <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> the one half of our lives is a <hi>Romance,</hi> a fiction. We retain a catch of those pretty stories, and our awakened imagination smiles in the recollection. Nor yet can our most severe inquiries finde what did so abuse us, or shew the nature, and manner of these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal illusions: When we puzzle our selves in the disquisition, we do but <hi>dream,</hi> and every <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is a <hi>phancy.</hi> Our most industrious conceits are but like their object, and as uncertain as those of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.
<pb facs="tcp:58119:9"/>
Thus when some dayes, and nights have gone over us, the stroak of Fate concludes the number of our pulses; we take our leave of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and bid mortality adieu. The vital flame is extinct, the Soul retires into another world, and the body to dwell with dust. Nor doth the last Scene yield us any more satisfaction in our <hi>autogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>; for we are as ignorant how the soul leaves the light, as how it first came into it; we know as little how the union is dissolved, that is, the chain of the so differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subsistencies, that compound us, as how it first commenced. This then is the creature that so pretends to <hi>knowledge,</hi> and that makes such a noise, and bustle for
<pb facs="tcp:58119:9"/>

I doubt not but the opinionative resolver, thinks all these easie <hi>Knowables,</hi> and the Theories here accounted <hi>Mysteries,</hi> are to him <hi>Revelations.</hi> But let him suspend that conclusion till he hath weigh'd the considerations hereof, which the Discourse it self will present him with; and if he can untie those knots, he is able to teach all humanity, and will do well to oblige mankinde by his informations.</p>
            <p>I had thought here to have shut up my <hi>Preface,</hi> being sensible of the
<pb facs="tcp:58119:10"/>
               <hi>taedium</hi> of long praeliminaries. But lest the Ingenious stumble at my threshold, and take offence at the seemingly disproportionate excess, which I ascribe to <hi>Adam's senses</hi>: I'le subjoyn a word to prevent the scruple. First then, for those that go the way of the <hi>Allegorie,</hi> and assert <hi>pre-existence</hi>; I'm secure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from their dissatisfaction. For, that the <hi>aetherial Adam</hi> could easily sense the most tender touches upon his <hi>passive vehicle,</hi> and so had a clear and full perception of objects, which we since plung'd into the grosser <hi>Hyle</hi> are not at all, or but a little aware of; can be no doubt in their <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> Nor can there as great a difference be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between the senses of <hi>eighty,</hi> and those of <hi>twenty,</hi> between the
<pb facs="tcp:58119:10"/>
               <hi>Opticks</hi> of the blind <hi>Bat</hi> and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious <hi>Eagle,</hi> as there was between those pure un-eclipsed Sensations, and these of our now-embodyed, muddied <hi>Sensitive.</hi> Now that the <hi>prae-existent Adam</hi> could so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously form his vehicle, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive better information from the most distant objects, than we by the most helpful <hi>Telescopes</hi>; will be no difficult admission to the friends of the <hi>Allegory.</hi> So that what may seem a meer <hi>hyperbolical,</hi> and fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful display to the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>letter</hi>; to the <hi>Allegorists</hi> will be but a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive representation of literal reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And I cannot be obnoxious to their censure, but for my coming short in the <hi>description.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am like more dangerously to be beset by them that go the way
<pb facs="tcp:58119:11"/>
of the <hi>plain</hi>: and 'twill be thought somewhat hard, to verifie my <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> of the <hi>literal Adam.</hi> Indeed, there is difficulty in the <hi>Mechanical Defence</hi>; and <hi>Dioptrical</hi> impugnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are somewhat formidable. For unless the constitution of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Organs was diverse from ours, and from those of his <hi>fallen</hi> self; it will to some seem impossible, that he should command distant objects by natural, as we do by artificial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. Since those removed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> (in which I instance) could form but minute <hi>angles</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Retina,</hi> and such as were vastly different from those they form in ours assisted by a <hi>Telescope.</hi> So that granting <hi>Adam</hi>'s eye had no greater <hi>Diametrical</hi> wideness of the <hi>pupil,</hi> no greater distance from the
<pb facs="tcp:58119:11"/>
               <hi>Cornea</hi> to the <hi>Retiformis,</hi> and no more <hi>filaments</hi> of the <hi>Optick nerves</hi> of which the <hi>tunica Retina</hi> is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than we: the unmeasurable odds of <hi>Sensitive</hi> perfections which I assign him; will be conceiv'd <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically</hi> impossible. These difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may seem irresistibly pressing, and incapable of a satisfactory so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>But I propound it to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Ingenious Objectors, whether these supposed <hi>Organical</hi> defects might not have been supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our unfallen <hi>Protoplast</hi> by the vast perfections of his <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> and some other advantageous circumstances: So that though it be granted, that an object at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Stars</hi> could not form in the eye of <hi>Adam</hi> any <hi>angles,</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:58119:12"/>
wide as those it forms by the help of a <hi>Tube</hi>; yet I think my <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> may stand unshaken. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose two <hi>Eyes</hi> of an equal and like figure, in the same distance from an <hi>object</hi>; so that it forms equal <hi>angles</hi> in both: It may come to pass by other reasons, that one of these <hi>Eyes</hi> shall see this <hi>object</hi> bigger then the other: yea, if the difference of the reasons on both sides be so much greater, one Eye shall see <hi>it</hi> clearly, and the other not at all: For let one of these <hi>eyes</hi> be placed in an <hi>old</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or in a body deprived quite, or in a great measure of those <hi>spirits</hi> which are allowed the Instruments of sight, or of the due egress and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of them, in their natural cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and channels; and let the other have a body of a clean contrary
<pb facs="tcp:58119:12"/>
quality; or let the <hi>soul</hi> that actuates one of the said <hi>eyes,</hi> be indued with an higher faculty of <hi>Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (I mean with a greater degree of the <hi>Animadversive</hi> ability) than the <hi>soul</hi> hath, that actuates the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In either of these cases, the fore-mention'd difformity of <hi>vision,</hi> will fall out in the same uniform case of <hi>Dioptrical</hi> advantages. For a little <hi>angle</hi> made in the <hi>Eye,</hi> will make as discernible an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to a <hi>Soul</hi> of a greater <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversive</hi> power, and assisted by more and meeter instruments of sight; as a greater <hi>angle</hi> can make to a <hi>soul</hi> of a less <hi>power,</hi> and destitute of those other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are as necessary to sight as those <hi>Dioptrical</hi> conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. So that grant that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb facs="tcp:58119:13"/>
set at the same distance made <hi>angles</hi> in the eye of <hi>Adam,</hi> no wider than those it formes in ours; yet that which we discern not, might have been seen by him, having more and better <hi>spirits,</hi> and being endued with a stronger <hi>Animadversive,</hi> according to mine <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For there is the same proportion between a great <hi>power,</hi> and a little <hi>help,</hi> or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Angle</hi>; which is between a small <hi>power,</hi> and a great <hi>help,</hi> or a great <hi>Angle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all this satisfie not, I begg from the ingenious the favour of this consideration: That some grains must be allow'd to a <hi>rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical</hi> display, which will not bear the rigour of a <hi>critical seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> But whether this mine <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58119:13"/>
stand or fall, my Discourse is not at all concerned. And I am not so fond of my conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, but that I can lay them down at the feet of a <hi>convictive</hi> opposition.</p>

A condition which was envied by creatures that nature had plac't a sphaere above us, and such as differ'd not much from glory, and blessed immortality, but in perpetuity and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

upon its admired objects, as their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd beauties are really below them. The most refined glories of subcoelestial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies are but more faint resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of these. For all the powers and faculties of this copy of the Divinity, this meddal of God, were as perfect as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and harmony in Idea. The soul was not clogg'd by the inactivity of its masse, as ours; nor hindered in its actings, by the distemperature of indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed organs. Passions kept their place, as servants of the higher powers, and durst not arrogate the Throne, as now: no countermands came hence, to repeal the decretals of the Regal faculties; that <hi>Batrachomyomachia</hi> of one passion against an other, and both against reason, was yet unborn. Man was never at odds with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, till he was at odds with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Maker. There was no jarring or disharmony in the faculties, till sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd them. He could no sooner say to one power <hi>go,</hi> but it <hi>went,</hi> nor to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>do this,</hi> but it <hi>did it.</hi> Even the senses, the Souls windows, were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58119:19"/>
any spot or opacity; to liken them to the purest Crystal, were to debase them by the comparison; for their acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and strength depending on the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and apt disposure of the organs and spirits, by which outward motions are conveyed to the judgement-seat of the Soul: those of Innocence must needs infinitely more transcend ours, then the senses of sprightful youth doth them of frozen decrepit age. <hi>Adam</hi> needed no Spectacles. The acuteness of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opticks (if conjecture may have credit) shew'd him much of the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial magnificence and bravery without a <hi>Galilaeo</hi>'s tube: And 'tis most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that his naked eyes could reach near as much of the upper World, as we with all the advantages of art. It may be 'twas as absurd even in the judgement of his senses, that the Sun and Stars should be so very much, less then this Globe, as the contrary seems in ours; and 'tis not unlikely that he had as clear a perception of the earths motion, as we think we have of its quiescence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58119:20"/>Thus the accuracy of his knowledge of natural effects, might probably arise from his sensible perception of their causes. What the experiences of many ages will scarce afford us at this distance from perfection, his quicker senses could teach in a moment. And whereas we patch up a piece of Philosophy from a few industriously gather'd, and yet scarce well observ'd or digested expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, his knowledge was compleatly built, upon the certain, extemporary notice of his comprehensive, unerring faculties. His sight could inform him whether the Loadstone doth attract by Atomical <hi>Effluviums</hi>; which may gain the more credit by the consideration of what some affirm; that by the help of <hi>Microscopes</hi> they have beheld the subtile streams issuing from the beloved <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> It may be he saw the motion of the bloud and spirits through the transparent skin, as we do the workings of those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle industrious <hi>Animals</hi> through a hive of glasse. The Mysterious influence of the Moon, and its causality on the seas
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58119:20"/>
motion, was no question in his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, no more then a Clocks motion is in ours, where our senses may inform us of its cause. Sympathies and Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies were to him no occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Causes are hid in night and obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from us, which were all <hi>Sun</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>Now to shew the reasonableness of this Hypothesis, I'le suppose what I think few will deny; That God adorn'd that creature which was a transcript of himself, with all the perfections its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity could bear. And that this great extent of the senses <hi>Horizon</hi> was a perfection easily competible to sinless humanity, will appear by the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the two following principles.</p>
            <p>First, as far as the operation of nature reacheth, it works by corporeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. If the Coelestial lights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our Earth, and advance the Production of Minerals in their hidden beds, it is done by material communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. And if there be any virtue proceeding from the Pole, to direct the motion of the enamour'd steel (however
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58119:21"/>
unobserv'd those secret influences may be) they work not but by corporal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sense is made by motion, caus'd by bodily impression on the organ, and continued to the brain, and centre of perception. Hence it is manifest that all bodies are in themselves sensible, in as much as they can impress this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the immediate cause of sensation: And therefore, as in the former Principle, the most distant effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients working by a corporeal causali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it be not perceiv'd, the non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception must arise from the dulness and imperfection of the faculty, and not any defect in the object. So then, is it probable that the tenuous matter the instrument of remoter agents, should be able to move, and change the particles of the indisposed <hi>clay or steel,</hi> and yet not move the ductile easie senses of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected man? Indeed we perceive not such subtile insinuations, because their action is overcome by the strokes of stronger impressors, and we are so limited in our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58119:21"/>
perceptions, that we can only attend to the more vigorous impulse: but this is an imperfection incident to our degraded natures, which infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom easily prevented in his innocent Master-piece: Upon such considerations, to me it appears to be most reasonable, that the circumference of our <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plast</hi>'s senses, should be the same with that of natures activity: unless we will derogate from his perfections, and so reflect a disparagement on him that made us. And I am the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the concinnity of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when I consider the uncouth harshness either of the way of actuall concreated knowledge, or of infant growing faculties; neither of which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks seem to be much favour'd by our severer reasons.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a brief account of what might have been spun into Volumes; a full description of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections cannot be given but by him that hath them; an attainment which we shall never reach, till mortality be swallowed up of life.</p>

               <p>Our Decay and Ruins by the fall, descanted on. Of the now Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Knowledge: with a censure of the Schoolmen, and Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick Dogmatists.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUt 'tis a miserable thing to have been happy: and a self-contracted wretchedness, is a double one. Had felicity alwayes been a stranger to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, our now misery had been none; and had not our selves been the Authors of our ruines, less. We might have been made unhappy, but since we are miserable, we chose it. He that gave them, might have taken from us our extern injoyments, but none could have robb'd us of innocence but our selves. That we are below the Angels of God,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58119:22"/>
is no misery, 'tis the lot of our natures; but that we have made our selves like the beasts that perish, is so with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because the fruit of our sin. While man knew no sin, he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of nothing else, that it imported humanity to know: but when he had sinned, the same trangression that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his eyes to see his own shame, shut them against most things else, but it, and his newly purchased misery. With the nakedness of his body, he saw that of his soul; and the blindness, and disaray of his faculties, which his former innocence was a stranger to: and that that shew'd them him, made them. Whether our purer intellectuals, or only our impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous affections, were the prime authors of the <hi>anomie,</hi> I dispute not: sin is as latent in its first cause, as visible in its effects; and 'tis the mercy of heaven that hath made it easier to know the cure, then the rise of our distempers. This is certain, that our <hi>masculine powers</hi> are deeply sharers of the consequential mischiefs, and though <hi>Eve</hi> were the first
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58119:23"/>
in the disobedience, yet was <hi>Adam</hi> a joint partaker of the curse. We are not now like the creatures we were made, and have not only lost our <hi>Makers</hi> image, but <hi>our own</hi>: And do not much more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the creatures, which God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have plac't at our feet, then we come short of our antient selves; a proud af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to be like <hi>Gods,</hi> hath made us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For whereas our ennobled understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings could once take the wings of the morning, to visit the world above us, and had a glorious display of the highest form of created excellencies, it now lies groveling in this lower region, muffled up in mists, and darkness: the curse of the Serpent is fallen upon <hi>degenerated humanity,</hi> that it should go on its belly, and lick the dust. And as in the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian hypothesis,</hi> the Planets sometimes lose their light, by the fixing of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purer <hi>scum</hi>; so our impaired intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which were once as pure <hi>light and flame</hi> in regard of their vigour and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are now darkned by those grosser
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58119:23"/>
               <hi>spots,</hi> which our disobedience hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. And our now overshadow'd souls (to whose beauties stars were foils) may be exactly emblem'd, by those <hi>crusted globes,</hi> whose influential emissions are intercepted, by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of the benighting element, while the purer essence is imprison'd within the narrow compasse of a centre. For these once glorious lights, which did freely shed abroad their harmeless beams, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd in a larger circumference, are now pent up in a few first principles (the naked essentials of our faculties) within the straight confines of a Prison. And whereas knowledge dwelt in our unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved natures, as light in the Sun, in as great plenty, as purity; it is now hidden in us like sparks in a flint, both in scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and obscurity.</p>
            <p>For considering the shortness of our intellectual sight, the deceptibility and impositions of our senses, the tumultuary disorders of our passions, the prejudices of our infant educations, and infinite such like (of which an after oecasion will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58119:24"/>
us, with a more full and particular recital) I say, by reason of these, we may conclude of the science of the most of men, truly so called, that it may be truss'd up in the same room with the <hi>Iliads,</hi> yea it may be all the certainty of those high pretenders to it, the voluminous School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Peripatetical Dictators, (bating what they have of first Principles and the Word of God) may be circumscrib'd by as small a circle, as the Creed, when <hi>Brachygraphy</hi> had confin'd it within the compass of a penny. And methinks the disputes of those assuming confidents, are like the controversie of those in <hi>Plato</hi>'s den, who having never seen but the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of an horse trajected against a wall, eagerly contended, whether its <hi>neighing</hi> proceeded from the appearing Mane, or Tail, which they saw moving through the agitation of the substance, playing in the winde: so these in the darker cels of their imagin'd principles, violently differ about the shadowes and <hi>exuviae</hi> of beings, words, and notions, while for the most part they ignore the substantial
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58119:24"/>
realities; and like children make <hi>babies,</hi> for their phancies to play with, while their useless subtilties afford but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain to the nobler faculties.</p>
            <p>But many of the most accomplish't wits of all ages, whose modesty would not allow them to boast of more then they were owners of, have resolv'd their knowledge into <hi>Socrates</hi> his summe total, and after all their pains in quest of Science, have sat down in a profest <hi>nesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> It is the shallow unimprov'd intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects that are the confident pretenders to certainty; as if contrary to the <hi>Adage, Science had no friend but Ignorance.</hi> And though when they speak in the general of the weakness of our understandings, and the scantness of our knowledge, their discourse may even justifie <hi>Scepticism</hi> it self; yet in their particular opinions are as assertive and dogmatical, as if they were <hi>omniscient.</hi> To such, as a curbe to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and an evidence of humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities even in the noblest parts of Man, I shall give the following instances of our intellectual blindness: not that I intend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58119:25"/>
to poze them with those common <hi>Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> of Magnetism, Fluxes, Refluxes and the like, these are resolv'd into a confest ignorance, and I shall not persue them to their old <hi>Asylum</hi>: and yet it may be there is more knowable in these, then in lesse acknowledg'd mysteries: But I'le not move beyond our selves, and the most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and trivial <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in nature, in which we shall finde enough to shame confidence, and unplume <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</hi>

And unlesse their phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may have a sight and sensible pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of that more clarified subsistence, they will prefer infidelity, it self to an unimaginable <hi>Idea.</hi> I'le onely mind such, that the soul is seen, as other things, in the Mirrour of its effects, and attributes: But, if like children they'll run behind the glass to see its <hi>naked face,</hi> their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation will meet with nothing but vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; emptiness. And though a pure Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual eye may have a sight of it in reflex discoveries; yet, if we affect a grosser touch, like <hi>Ixio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> we shal embrace a cloud.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. And it hath been no less a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the world to determine whence it came, then what it is. Whether it were made by an immediate creation, or seminall traduction, hath been a Ball of contention to the most learned ages:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58119:26"/>
And yet after all the bandying attempts of resolution it is as much a question as ever, and it may be will be so till it be concluded by immortality. Some ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones think the difficulties, which are urged by each side against the other, to be pregnant proofs of the falshood of both; and substitute an hypothesis, which for probability is supposed to have the advantage of either. But I shall not stir in the waters, which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mudded by so many contentious enquiries. The great <hi>St. Austin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the gray heads of reverend An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity have been content to sit down here in a profest neutrality: And I'le not industiously endeavour to urge men to a confession of what they freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; but shall note difficulties which are not so usually observ'd, but as insoluble as these.</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. It is the saying of divine <hi>Plato,</hi> that Man is natures <hi>Horizon</hi>; dividing betwixt the upper <hi>Hemisphere</hi> of imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall intellects, and this lower of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity: And that we are a Compound
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58119:27"/>
of beings distant in extreams, is as clear as Noon. But how the purer Spirit is united to this clod, is a knot too hard for fallen Humanity to unty. What ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should unite heaven and earth, light and darkness, natures of so divers a make, of such disagreeing attributes, which have almost nothing, but <hi>Being,</hi> in common; This is a riddle, which must be left to the coming of <hi>Elias.</hi> How should a thought be united to a marble-statue, or a sun-beam to a lump of clay! The freezing of the words in the air in the northern climes, is as conceivable, as this strange union. That this active spark, this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> [as the Stoicks call it] should be confined to a Prison it can so easily pervade, is of less facill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, then that the light should be pent up in a box of Crystall, and kept from accompanying its source to the lower world: And to hang weights on the wings of the winde seems far more intelligible.</p>
            <p>In the unions, which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, the extreams are reconciled by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58119:27"/>
interceding participations of natures, which have somewhat of either. But Body and Spirit stand at such a distance in their essentiall compositions, that to suppose an uniter of a middle constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that should partake of some of the qualities of both, is unwarranted by any of our faculties, yea most absonous to our reasons; since there is not any the least affinity betwixt length, breadth and thickness, and apprehension, judgement and discourse: The former of which are the most immediate results [if not essentials] of Matter, the latter of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. Secondly, We can as little give an account, how the <hi>Soul moves</hi> the <hi>Body.</hi> That, that should give motion to an unwieldy bulk, which it self hath neither bulk nor motion; is of as difficil an apprehension, as any mystery in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For though conceiving it under some phancied appearance, and pinning on it materiall affections, the doubt doth not so sensibly touch us; since under such conceptions we have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58119:28"/>
of our senses to befriend us with parallels, and gross appre<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>henders may not think it any more strange, then that a Bullet should be moved by the rarified fire, or the clouds carryed before the invisible winds: yet if we defaecate the notion from materiality, and abstract <hi>quantity, locality</hi> and all kind of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity</hi> from it, and represent it to our thoughts either under the notion of the ingenious Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi> as a pure <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or as the admir'd <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> expresses it, <hi>une chose qui pense,</hi> as a <hi>thinking substance</hi>; it will be as hard to apprehend, as that an empty wish should remove Mountains: a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which if realized, would relieve <hi>Sisyphus.</hi> Nor yet doth the ingenious hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis of the most excellent <hi>Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brigian</hi> Philosopher, of the souls being an <hi>extended penetrable</hi> substance, relieve us; since, how that which penetrates all bodies without the least jog or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, should impress a motion on any, is by his own confession alike incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. Neither will its moving the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58119:28"/>
Body by a vehicle of Spirits, avail us; since they are Bodies too, though of a purer mould. And to credit the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibility both of this union and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we need no more then to consider, that when we would conceiue any thing which is not obvious to our senses, we have recourse to our memories the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of past observations: and turning over the treasure that is there, seek for something of like kind, which hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly come within the notice of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or inward senses. So that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive any thing, which comes not within the verge of our senses; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by like experiments which we have made, or at least by some remoter hints which we receive from them. And where such are wanting, I cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how the thing can be conceived. If any think otherwise, let them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine their thoughts: and, if they finde a determinate intellection of any Modes of Being, which were never in the least hinted to them by their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or internall senses; I'le beleeve that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58119:29"/>
such can realize <hi>Chimaera's.</hi> But now in the cases before us there are not the least footsteps, either of such an Union, or Motion, in the whole circumference of sensible nature: And we cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any thing beyond the evidence of our faculties.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. Thirdly, How the soul <hi>directs</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> for the motion of the Body accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the several animal exigents; is as perplex in the theory, as either of the former. For the <hi>meatus,</hi> or passages, through which those subtill emissaries are conveyed to the respective members, being so almost infinite, and each of them drawn through so many meanders, cross turnings, and divers roades, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in other spirits are continually a journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is wonderfull, that they should exactly perform their regular destinations without losing their way in such a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: neither can the wit of man tell how they are directed. For that they are carried by the manuduction of a Rule, is evident from the constant steddyness and regularity of their motion into the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58119:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
parts, where their supplies are expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But, what that regulating efficiency should be, and how managed; is not easily determin'd. That it is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by meer <hi>Mechanisme,</hi> constant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience confutes; which assureth us, that our sponta<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eous motions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Imperium of our will. At least the first determination of the Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such or such passages, is from the soul, what ever we hold of the after conveyances; of which likewise I think, that all the philosophy in the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it out to be purely Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. But yet though we gain this, that the soule is the principle of direction, the difficulty is as formidable as ever. For unless we allow it a kinde of inward sight of the Anatomicall frame of its owne body of every vein, muscle, and artery; of the exact site, and position of them, with their severall windings, and secret chanels: it is as unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how it should be the Directrix of such intricate motions, as that a blind man should manage a game at Chess.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58119:30"/>
But this is a kinde of knowledge, that we are not in the least aware of: yea many times we are so far from an attention to the inward direction of the spirits, that our employ'd mindes observe not any method in the outward performance; even when 'tis manag'd by variety of interchangeable motions, in which a stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy direction is difficult, and a miscariage easy. Thus an Artist will play a Lesson on an instrument without minding a stroke; and our tongues will run divisions in a tune not missing a note, even when our thoughts are totally engaged else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: which effects are to be attributed to some secret Art of the Soul, which to us is utterly occult, and without the ken of our Intellects.</p>

                  <hi>(4)</hi> We can give no account of the manner of Sensation: nor <hi>(5)</hi> of the nature of the Memory.

            <p n="6">§ 6. BUt besides those abstrusities, that lie more deep, and are of a more mysterious alloy; we are at a loss for a scientificall account even of our Senses, the most knowable of our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes. Our eyes, that see other things, see not themselves: And those princip<gap reason="illegible: crossed out" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> foundations of knowledge are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs unknown. That the soul is the sole Percipient, which alone hath animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version

and sense properly so called, and that the Body is only the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and conveyer of corporeall impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, is as certain, as Philosophy can make it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself teacheth so much in that Maxime of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And <hi>Plato</hi> credits this position with his suffrage; affirming, that 'tis the soul that hath life and sense, but the body neither. But this is so largly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by that wonder of men, the Great <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> and is a Truth that shines so clear in the Eyes of all consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; that to goe about industrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove it, were to light a candle to seek the Sun: we'll therefore suppose it, as that which needs not amuse us; but yet, what are the instruments of sensible perceptions and particular conveyers of outward motions to the seat of sense, is difficult: and how the pure mind can receive information from that, which is not in the least like it self, and but little resembling what it represents; I think inexplicable. Whether Sensation be made by corporall emissions and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58119:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Aethereall matter, and carryed by the continuity thereof to the Common sense; I'le not revive into a Dispute: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the latter hath already given it almost an absolute victory over its Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall. But suppose which we will, there are doubts not to be solv'd by either. For how the soule by mutation made in matter a substance of another kind, should be excited to action; and how bodily alterations and motions should concern it, which is subject to neither; is a difficulty which confidence may triumph over sooner, then conquer. For body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act on any thing but by motion; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be received but by quantative dimension; the soul is astranger to such gross substantiality, and hath nothing of quantity, but what it is cloathed with by our deceived phancies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how can we conceive under a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssive subjection to material impressions? and yet the importunity of pain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydableness of sensations strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that we are so. Some say, that the soul indeed is not passive under the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall phantasms; but doth only intuitively
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58119:32"/>
view them by the necessity of her Nature, and so observes other things in these there representatives. But how is it, and by what Art doth the soul read that such an image or stroke in matter [whether that of her vehicle, or of the Brain, the case is the same] signifies such an object? Did we learn such an Alphabet in our Embryo-state? And how comes it to pass, that we are not aware of any such congenite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions? We know what we know; but do we know any more? That by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of motions we should spell out figures, distances, magnitudes, colours, things not resembled by them; we must attribute to some secret deduction. But what this deduction should be, or by what mediums this Knowledge is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd; is as dark, as Ignorance it self. One, that hath not the knowledge of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may see the Figures; but compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends not the meaning included in them: An infant may hear the sounds, and see the motion of the lips; but hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception conveyed by them, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they are intended to signify. So our souls, though they might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58119:32"/>
the motions and images themselves by simple sense; yet without some implicit inference it seems inconceivable, how by that means they should appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their <hi>Archetypes.</hi> Moreover images and motions are in the Brain in a very inconsiderable latitude of space; and yet they represent the greatest magnitudes. The image of an Hemisphere of the upper Globe cannot be of a wider circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then a Wall-nut: And how can such petty impressions notifie such vastly expanded objects, but through some kind of Scientifical method, and Geometry in the Principle? without this it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how distances should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, but all objects would appear in a cluster, and lie in as narrow a room as their images take up in our scanter <hi>Craniums.</hi> Nor will the Philosophy of the most ingenious <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> help us out: For that striking upon divers fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the brain cannot well be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to represent their respective di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, except some such kind of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be allotted us in our faculties; the concession of which will only steed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58119:33"/>
us as a Refuge for Ignorance, where we shall meet, what we would seem to shun.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. The <hi>Memory</hi> is a faculty whose nature is as obscure, and hath as much of Riddle in it as any of the former; It seems to be an Organical Power, because bodily distempers often marr its <hi>Idea's,</hi> and cause a total oblivion: But what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments the Soul useth in her review of past impressions, is a question which may drive Enquiry to despair. There are four principal <hi>Hypotheses</hi> by which a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been attempted. The first that I'le mention, is that of the incomparable <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> who gives this account: The <hi>Glandula pinealis,</hi> by him made the seat of Common Sense, doth by its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impel the Spirits into divers parts of the Brain; till it find those wherein are some tracks of the object we would remember; which consists in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pores of the Brain, through the which the Spirits before took their course, are more easily opened to the Spirits which demand re-entrance; so that finding those pores, they make their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58119:33"/>
way through them sooner then through others: whence there ariseth a special motion in the <hi>Glandula,</hi> which signifies this to be the object we would <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> A second is, that of the ingenious Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> a summary of which is, That things are reserved in the memory by some corporeal <hi>exuviae</hi> and material Images; which having impinged on the Common sense, rebound thence into some vacant cells of the Brain, where they keep their ranks and postures in the same order that they entred, till they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain stirr'd up; and then they slide through the <hi>Fancy,</hi> as when they were first presented. These are the endeavours of those two <hi>Grand Sages,</hi> then whom it may be the Sun never saw a more learned pair. And yet as a sad evidence of the infirmities of laps'd humanity: these great <hi>Sophi</hi> fail here of their wonted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in unridling Nature. And I think Favour it self can say no more of either <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> then that they are ingenious attempts. Nor do I speak this to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Grandeur of their Wits us'd to Victory: I should rather confer
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58119:34"/>
what I could to the erecting of such Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies to them, as might eternize their Memories. And their coming short here, I think not to be from defect of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal abilities, but specifick constitution; and the doubt they leave us in, proceeds from hence, that they were no more then <hi>men.</hi> I shall consider what is mentioned from them apart, before I come to the other two: And what I am here about to produce, is not to argue either of these Positions of Falseness; but of Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveableness. In the general, what hath been urg'd under the former head, stands in full force against both these, and them that follow. But to the first; If <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> be made by the <hi>easie motion</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> through the opened <hi>passages,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what hath been noted from <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>; whence have we a distinct Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of such diversity of Objects, whose Images without doubt pass through the same <hi>apertures?</hi> And how should we recall the distances of Bodies which lye in a line? Or, is it not likely, that the impell'd Spirits might light upon other Pores accommodated to their purpose
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58119:34"/>
through the <hi>Motion</hi> of other Bodies through them? Yea, in such a <hi>pervious</hi> substance as the <hi>Brain,</hi> they might finde an easie either entrance, or <hi>exit,</hi> almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; and therefore to shake every grain of corn through the same holes of a Sieve in repeated winnowings, is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be performed as this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckived. Besides, it's difficult to apprehend, but that these <hi>avennues</hi> should in a very short time be stopped up by the pressure of other parts of the matter, through its natural <hi>gravity,</hi> or other alterations made in the <hi>Brain</hi>: And the opening of other <hi>vicine passages</hi> might quickly obliterate any tracks of these: as the making of one hole in the yeelding <hi>mud,</hi> defaces the print of another near it; at least the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of enlargement, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from such transitions, would be as soon lost, as made. But for the <hi>second,</hi> How is it imaginable, that those active <hi>particles,</hi> which have no <hi>cement</hi> to unite them, nothing to keep them in the order they were set, yea, which are ever and anon justled by the occursion of other bodies, whereof there is an infinite store
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58119:35"/>
in this Repository, should so orderly keep their Cells without any alteration of their site or posture, which at first was allotted them? And how is it conceivable, but that carelesly turning over the Idea's of our mind to recover something we would remember, we should put all the other Images into a disorderly floating, and so raise a little <hi>Chaos</hi> of confusion, where Nature requires the exactest or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. According to this account, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, but that our <hi>Memories</hi> would be more confused then our Mid-night compositions: For is it likely, that the divided <hi>Atomes</hi> which presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together, should keep the same ranks in such a variety of tumultuary agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as happen in that liquid <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>? An heap of Ants on an Hillock will more easily be kept to an uniformity in motion; and the little bodies which are incessantly playing up and down the Air in their careless postures, are as capable of Regularity as these. Much more m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght be added, but I intend only a touch.</p>
            <p>But a Third way, that hath been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58119:35"/>
is that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which says, that Objects are conserved in the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> by certain <hi>intentional</hi> Species, Beings, which have nothing of Matter in their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Constitution, but yet have a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary subjective dependence on it, whence they are called <hi>Material.</hi> To this briefly.</p>
            <p>Besides that these Species are made a <hi>Medium</hi> between Body and Spirit, and therefore partake of no more of Being, then what the charity of our Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons affords them; and that the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infers a creative <hi>energie</hi> in the object their producent, which Philosophy allows not to Creature-Efficients: I say, beside these, it is quite against their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to subsist, but in the presence and under the actual influence of their cause; as being produc'd by an Emanative Causality, the Effects whereof dye in the removal of their Origine. But this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated conceit deserves no more of our remembrance, then it contributes to the apprehension of it. And therefore I pass on to the last.</p>
            <p>Which is that of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> that <hi>Memory</hi> is nothing else but the knowledge
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58119:36"/>
of <hi>decaying Sense,</hi> which is made by the <hi>reaction</hi> of one <hi>body</hi> against another; or, as he expresses it in his <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> a <hi>Missing of Parts in an Object.</hi> The foundation of this <hi>Principle</hi> [as of many of its fellows] is totally evers't by the most ingenious <hi>Commentator</hi> upon <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Beings,</hi> Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> in his book <hi>Of Immortality.</hi> I shall therefore leave that cause in the hands of that most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed undertaker, and only observe two things to my present purpose. (1). Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Brain,</hi> nor <hi>Spirits,</hi> nor any other material substance within the <hi>Head</hi> can for any considerable space of time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>motion.</hi> The former is of such a clammy consistence, that it can no more retain it then a <hi>Quagmire:</hi> And the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> for their liquidity are more unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable then the fluid <hi>Medium,</hi> which is the conveyer of <hi>Sounds,</hi> to persevere in the continued repetition of <hi>vocal Airs.</hi> And if there were any other substance within us, as fitly temper'd to preserve <hi>motion,</hi> as the Author of the opinion could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: Yet (2.) which will equally press against either of the former, this motion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58119:36"/>
would be quickly deadned even to an utter cessation, by <hi>counter-motions</hi>; and we should not remember any thing, but till the next impression. Much less can this <hi>Principle</hi> give an account, how such an abundance of <hi>motions</hi> should orderly succeed one another, as things do in our <hi>memories:</hi> And to remember a <hi>soug</hi> or <hi>tune,</hi> it will be required, that our Souls be an <hi>Harmony</hi> more then in a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58119:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continually converse with; yet its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and inward frame is an <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> a yet undiscovered <hi>Region.</hi> The saying of the Kingly Prophet, <hi>I am won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made,</hi> may well be understood of that <hi>admiration,</hi> which is the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ignorance.</hi> And with reverence it may be applyed, that in <hi>seeing we see, and understand not.</hi> Three things I'le subjoyn concerning this <hi>Sensible matter,</hi> the other part of our compositoin.</p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. That our <hi>bodies</hi> are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the most curious <hi>Artifice,</hi> and orderly contrivance, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed even by them, who are least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to <hi>Nature.</hi> The elegance of this composure, sav'd the great <hi>Aesculapius, Galen,</hi> from a profest <hi>Atheism.</hi> And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that the branded <hi>Epicurus, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius,</hi> and their fellows were in earnest, when they resolv'd this composition into a <hi>fortuitous range</hi> of <hi>Atoms.</hi> To suppose a <hi>Watch,</hi> or any other the most curious <hi>Automaton</hi> by the blind hits of <hi>Chance,</hi> to perform diversity of orderly <hi>motions,</hi> to indicate the <hi>hour, day</hi> of the <hi>Moneth, Tides, age</hi> of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58119:38"/>
               <hi>Moon,</hi> and the like, with an unparallel'd exactness, and all without the regulation of Art, this were the more pardonable absurdity. And that this admirable <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> of our Bodies, whose functions are carryed on by such a multitude of <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>motions,</hi> which neither interfere, nor impede one another in their operations; but by an <hi>harmonious Sympathy</hi> promote the perfection and good of the whole: That this should be an undesign'd effect, is an assertion, that is more then <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholies Hyperbole.</hi> I say therefore, that if we do but consider this <hi>Fabrick</hi> with minds unpossest of an affected madness; we will easily grant, that it was some skilful <hi>Archeus</hi> who delineated those comely <hi>proportions,</hi> and hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest such exactly <hi>Geometrical elegancies</hi> in its compositions. But what this hidden <hi>Architect</hi> should be, and by what <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and art this frame is erected; is as <hi>unknown</hi> to us, as our <hi>Embryo</hi>-thoughts. The <hi>Plastick</hi> faculty is a fine word: But what it is, how it works, and whose it is, we cannot learn; no, not by a return into the <hi>Womb</hi>; neither will the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:58119:39"/>
Principles unriddle the doubt: For though the Soul be supposed to be the Bodies <hi>Maker,</hi> and the builder of its own house; yet by what kind of Knowledge, Method, or Means, is as unknown: and that we should have a <hi>knowledge</hi> which we know not of, is an assertion, which some say, hath no commission from our Faculties. The Great <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> will allow it to be no better, then a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right absurdity. But yet should we suppose it, it would be evidence enough of what we aim at.</p>
            <p>Nor is the composition of our Bodies the only wonder: we are as much non-plust by the most contemptible <hi>Worm,</hi> and <hi>Plant,</hi> we tread on. How is a drop of Dew organiz'd into an Insect, or a lump of Clay into animal Perfections? How are the Glories of the Field spun, and by what Pencil are they limn'd in their unaffected bravery? By whose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the nutriment so regularly distributed unto the respective parts, and how are they kept to their specifick uniformities? If we attempt Mechanical solutions, we shall never give an account,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58119:39"/>
why the Wood-cock doth not sometimes borrow colours of the Mag-pye, why the Lilly doth not exchange with the Daysie, or why it is not sometime painted with a blush of the Rose? Can <hi>unguided matter</hi> keep it self to such exact conformities, as not in the least spot to vary from the <hi>species?</hi> That divers Limners at a distance without either copy, or designe, should draw the same <hi>Picture</hi> to an undistinguishable exactness, both in form, colour, and features; this is more conceivable, then that <hi>matter,</hi> which is so diversified both in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, quality, motion, site, and infinite other circumstances, should frame it self so absolutely according to the Idea of its kind. And though the fury of that <hi>Apelles,</hi> who threw his Pencil in a desperate rage upon the Picture he had essayed to draw, once casually effected those lively representations, which his Art could not describe; yet 'tis not likely, that one of a thousand such praecipitancies should be crowned with so an unexpected an issue. For though <hi>blind matter</hi> might reach some elegancies in individual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58119:40"/>
yet specifick conformities can be no <hi>unadvised</hi> productions, but in greatest likelyhood, are regulated by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate efficiency of some <hi>knowing</hi> agent: which whether it be <hi>seminal Forms,</hi> according to the <hi>Platonical</hi> Principles, or what ever else we please to suppose; the manner of its working is to us <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if these effects are meerly <hi>Mechanical</hi>; yet to learn the method of such operations may be, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been ingeniously attempted; but I think cannot be performed to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of severer examination.</p>
            <p>That all bodies both <hi>Animal, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and <hi>Inanimate,</hi> are form'd out of such particles of matter, which by reason of their figures, will not cohaere or lie together, but in such an order as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to such a specifical formation, and that therein they naturally of themselves concurre, and reside, is a pretty conceit, and there are <hi>experiments</hi> that credit it. If after a decoction of <hi>hearbs</hi> in a Winter-night, we expose the liquor to the frigid air; we may observe in the morning under a crust of Ice, the perfect
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58119:40"/>
appearance both in <hi>figure,</hi> and <hi>colour,</hi> of the <hi>Plants</hi> that were taken from it. But if we break the <hi>aqueous Crystal,</hi> those pretty <hi>images</hi> dis-appear and are presently dissolved.</p>
            <p>Now these <hi>airy Vegetables</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to have been made, by the reliques of these <hi>plantal emissions</hi> whose avola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was prevented by the <hi>condensed inclosure.</hi> And therefore playing up and down for a while within their liquid prison, they at last settle together in their natural order, and the <hi>Atomes</hi> of each part finding out their proper place, at length rest in their methodical Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till by breaking the <hi>Ice</hi> they are disturbed, and those counterfeit <hi>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> are scatter'd into their first <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibles.</hi> This <hi>Hypothesis</hi> may yet seem to receive further confirmation, from the artificial <hi>resurrection</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> from their <hi>ashes,</hi> which <hi>Chymists</hi> are so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: And besides, that <hi>Salt</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon fixation returns to its affected <hi>cubes,</hi> the regular figures of <hi>Minerals,</hi> as the <hi>Hexagonal</hi> of <hi>Crystal,</hi> the <hi>Hemi-sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> of the <hi>Fairy-stone,</hi> the <hi>stellar figure</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58119:41"/>
of the stone <hi>Asteria,</hi> and such like, seem to look with probability upon this way of formation. And I must needs say 'tis handsomly conjectur'd. But yet what those figures are, that should be thus mechanically adapted, to fall so unerring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into regular compositions, is beyond our faculties to conceive, or determine. And how those <hi>heterogeneous atomes</hi> (for such their figures are supposed) should by themselves hit so exactly into their proper residence in the midst of such tumultuary motions, cross thwartings, and <hi>arietations</hi> of other particles, especially when for one way of hitting right, there are thousands of missing; there's no <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> yet extant can resolve us. And yet had heaven afforded that miracle of men, the Illustrious <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> a longer day on earth, we might have expected the utmost of what ingenuity could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form herein: but his immature Fate hath unhappily disappointed us; and prevented the most desirable Complement of his not to be equall'd <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. (2.) It's no less difficult to give an account, how the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Matter</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58119:41"/>
of our Bodies are <hi>united</hi>: For though superficial Enquirers may easily satisfie themselves by answering, that it is done by <hi>muscles, nerves,</hi> and other like <hi>strings</hi> and <hi>ligaments,</hi> which Nature hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin'd to that office; yet, if we seek for an account how the parts of these do cohere, we shall find the cause to be as latent, as the effect of easie discovery. Nothing with any shew of success hath yet appeared on the Philosophick Stage, but the opinion of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>; that the Parts of <hi>Matter</hi> are <hi>united</hi> by Rest. Neither can I conceive, how any thing can be substituted in its room, more congruous to reason; since <hi>Rest</hi> is most opposite to <hi>Motion,</hi> the immediate cause of <hi>disunion.</hi> But yet I cannot see, how this can satisfie, touching the almost <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolvible coherence</hi> of some bodies, and the <hi>fragility</hi> and <hi>solubility</hi> of others: For if the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Parts</hi> consist only in <hi>Rest</hi>; it would seem that a bagg of <hi>dust</hi> would be of as firm a consistence as that of <hi>Marble</hi> or <hi>Adamant:</hi> a Bar of <hi>Iron</hi> will be as easily broken as a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipe</hi>; and <hi>Bajazets</hi> Cage had been
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58119:42"/>
but a sorry <hi>Prison.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptian Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi> would have been sooner lost, then the Names of them that built them; and as easily blown away, as those <hi>inverst ones</hi> of <hi>smoke.</hi> If it be pretended for a difference, that the parts of solid bodies are held together by <hi>hooks,</hi> and <hi>angulous</hi> involutions; I say, this comes not home: For the <hi>coherence</hi> of the parts of these <hi>hooks</hi> [as hath been noted] will be of as difficult a conception, as the former: And we must either suppose an infinite of them holding together on one another; or at last come to <hi>parts,</hi> that are <hi>united</hi> by a meer <hi>juxta-position:</hi> Yea, could we suppose the former, yet the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of these, would be like the hanging together of an infinite such of <hi>Dust:</hi> which <hi>Hypothesis</hi> would spoil the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,</hi> and <hi>a rope of sand,</hi> should be no more a phrase for <hi>Labour in vain</hi>: For unless there be something, upon which all the rest may depend for their <hi>cohesion</hi>; the hanging of one by another, will signifie no more then the mutual dependence of <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> in an <hi>infinite Series,</hi> without a <hi>First:</hi> the admission of which,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58119:42"/>
               <hi>Atheism</hi> would applaud. But yet to do the <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Mechanicks</hi> right; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of more validity in the behalf of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> may be assign'd: Which is, that the closeness and compactness of the <hi>Parts resting</hi> together, doth much confer to the strength of the <hi>union</hi>: For every thing continues in the condition, wherein it <hi>is,</hi> except something more powerful <hi>alter it:</hi> And therefore the <hi>parts,</hi> that <hi>rest</hi> close together, must continue in the same relation to each other, till some other <hi>body</hi> by <hi>motion</hi> disjoyn them. Now then, the more <hi>parts</hi> there are pen't together, the more able they will be for <hi>resistence</hi>; and what hath less <hi>compactness,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence fewer <hi>parts,</hi> according to the <hi>laws</hi> of <hi>motion</hi> will not be able to effect any <hi>alteration</hi> in it. According to what is here presented, what is most <hi>dense,</hi> and least <hi>porous,</hi> will be most <hi>coherent,</hi> and least <hi>discerpible.</hi> And if this help not, I cannot apprehend what can give an account of the former instances. And yet even this is confuted by experience; since the most <hi>porous, spongy bodies</hi> are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58119:43"/>
oft-times the most <hi>tough</hi> in consistence. 'Tis easier to break a tube of <hi>Glass</hi> or <hi>Crystal,</hi> then of <hi>Elm</hi> or <hi>Ash:</hi> And yet as the <hi>parts</hi> of the former are more, so they are more at <hi>rest</hi>; since the <hi>liquid juyce,</hi> which is diffused through the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Wood,</hi> is in a continual agitation, which in <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his <hi>Philosophy</hi> is the cause of <hi>fluidity</hi>; and a proportion'd <hi>humidity</hi> conferr's much to <hi>union</hi> [Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi> makes it the <hi>Cement</hi> it self]; a <hi>dry stick</hi> will be easily broken, when <hi>a green one</hi> will maintain a strong resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and yet in the <hi>moist</hi> substance there is less <hi>rest,</hi> then in what is, <hi>dryer</hi> and more <hi>fragill.</hi> Much more might be added: But I'le content my self with what's mentioned; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what hath been said, I judge this account of that most <hi>miraculous wit</hi> to be the most <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> that <hi>hath</hi> or [it may be] <hi>can</hi> be given. I shall not therefore conclude it false; though I think the emergent <hi>difficulties,</hi> which are its attendants, <hi>unanswerable</hi>: which is proof enough of the weakness of our <hi>now Reasons,</hi> which are driven

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58119:44"/>
I'le add three rhings touching the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>wheel,</hi> and conclude this.</p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. And first, if we abstractly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it, it seems impossible that a <hi>wheel</hi> should <hi>move:</hi> I mean not the <hi>progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> but that Motion which is meerly on its own <hi>Centre.</hi> And were it not for the information of Experience, it's most likely that <hi>Philosophy</hi> had long ago concluded it <hi>impossible:</hi> For let's suppose the wheel to be divided according to the <hi>Alphabet.</hi> Now in motion there is a change of place, and in the motion of a <hi>wheel</hi> there is a succession of one part to another in the same place; so that it seems unconceivable that <hi>A.</hi> should move until <hi>B.</hi> hath left its place: For <hi>A.</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move, but it must acquire some place or other. It can acquire none but what was <hi>B</hi>'s, which we suppose to be most immediate to it. The same space can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain them both. And therefore <hi>B.</hi> must leave its place, before <hi>A.</hi> can have it; Yea, and the nature of succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion requires it. But now <hi>B.</hi> cannot move, but into the place of <hi>C</hi>; and <hi>C.</hi> must be out, before <hi>B.</hi> can come in: so
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58119:45"/>
that the motion of <hi>C.</hi> will be pre-required likewise to the motion of <hi>A</hi>; &amp; so onward till it comes to <hi>Z.</hi> Upon the same accounts <hi>Z.</hi> will not be able to move, till <hi>A.</hi> moves, being the part next to it: neither will <hi>A.</hi> be able to move [as hath been shown] till <hi>Z.</hi> hath. And so the motion of every part will be pre-requir'd to it self. Neither can one evade, by saying, that all the parts move at once. For (1.) we cannot conceive in a <hi>succession</hi> but that something should be first, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should begin somewhere. (2.) If the parts may all change places with one another at the same time without any respect of <hi>priority,</hi> and <hi>posteriority</hi> to each others <hi>motion</hi>: why then may not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Bullets</hi> closely crowded together in a <hi>Box,</hi> as well move together by a like mutual and simultaneous exchange? Doubtless the reason of this ineptitude to motion in this position is, that they cannot give way one to another, and motion can no where begin because of the <hi>plenitude.</hi> The case is just the same in the instance before us; and therefore we need go no further for an evidence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58119:45"/>
of its <hi>inconceivableness.</hi> But yet to give it one touch more according to the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> niceness, which says, that one part enters in the same <hi>instant</hi> that the other goes out: I'le add this in brief: In the <hi>instant</hi> that <hi>B.</hi> leaves its place, it's in it, or not: If so; then <hi>A.</hi> cannot be in it in the same <hi>instant</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>quantative penetration.</hi> If not; then it cannot be said to leave it in that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> but to have left it before. These difficulties, which pinch so in this obvious experiment, stand in their full force against all Motion on the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>absolute plenitude.</hi> Nor yet have the Defenders hereof need to take notice of them, because they equally press a most sensible Truth. Neither is it fair, that the opposite opinion of <hi>interspers'd vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> should be rejected as absurd upon the account of some <hi>inextricable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities</hi> which attend it. Therefore let them both have fair play; and which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth with most ease and congruity solve the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that shall have my vote for the most <hi>Philosophick Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</hi>

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58119:46"/>§. 2. It's a difficulty no less despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then the former, that the <hi>parts vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine</hi> to the <hi>centre,</hi> which it may be pass not over the hundredth part of <hi>space</hi> which those do of the extreme <hi>circumference,</hi> should describe their <hi>narrower circle</hi> but in equal time with those other, that trace so great a <hi>round.</hi> If they move but in the same degree of <hi>Velocity</hi>; here is then an <hi>equality in time</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> and yet a vast <hi>inequality</hi> in the <hi>acquired space.</hi> A thing which seems flatly impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: For is it conceivable, that of two bodies setting forth together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their motion in the same swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the one should so far out-go its fellow, as to move ten mile an hour, while the other moves but a furlong? If so, 'twill be no wonder, that <hi>the race is not to the swift,</hi> and the <hi>furthest way about</hi> may well be the <hi>nearest way home.</hi> There is but one way that can be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to untie this knot; which is, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the <hi>remoter</hi> and more out-side parts move more swiftly then the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral</hi> ones. But this likewise is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable as what it would avoid:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58119:46"/>
For suppose a right <hi>line</hi> drawn from the <hi>centre</hi> to the <hi>circumference,</hi> and it cannot be apprehended, but that the <hi>line</hi> should be inflected, if some parts of it move faster then others. I say if we do abstractedly from experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template it in the <hi>theory,</hi> it is hard to conceive, but that one part moving, while the other rests, or at least moves slower (which is as rest to a swifter motion) should change its distance from it, and the respect, which it had to it; which one would think should cause an incurvation in the <hi>line.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. I'le add only this one, which is an experiment that may for ever silence the most daring confidence. Let there be two <hi>wheels</hi> fixt on the same Axel in <hi>Diameter</hi> ten inches a piece. Between them let there be a <hi>little wheel,</hi> of two inches Diameter, fixed on the same Axel. Let them be moved together on a plane, the great ones on the ground suppose, and the little one on a Table [for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its parvitude it cannot reach to the same floor with them] And you'l find that the little wheel will move over
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58119:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the same space in equal time with equal <hi>circulations,</hi> with the great ones, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe as long a line. Now this seems bigg of repugnancies, though Sense it self suffragate to its truth: For since every part of the greater wheels makes a proportionable part of the line, as do the parts of the little one, and the parts of those so much exceeding in multitude the parts of this: It will seem neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the line made by the greater wheels should have as many parts more then the line made by the less, as the wheels themselves have in <hi>circumference,</hi> and so the line would be as much longer as the wheels are bigger: so that one of these absurdities is unavoidable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that more parts of the greater wheels go to the making one part of their lines, which will inferr a quantitative penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or that the little wheel hath as many parts as the great ones, though five times in <hi>Diameter</hi> exceeded by them, since the lines they describe are of equal length; or the less wheel's line will have fewer parts then the others, though of equal extent with them, since it can
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58119:47"/>
have no more parts then the <hi>less circle,</hi> nor <hi>they</hi> fewer then the <hi>greater.</hi> But these are all such repugnancies, as that <hi>Melancholy</hi> it self would scarse own them. And therefore we may well enter this among the <hi>unconceivables.</hi> Should I have enlarged on this Subject to the taking in of all things that claim a share in't, it may be few things would have been left unspoken to, but the <hi>Creed.</hi> Philosophy would not have engross'd our Pen, but we must have been forced to anger the <hi>Intelligences</hi> of higher Orbs. But intending only a glance at this rugged Theam, I shall forbear to insist more on it, though the consideration of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of <hi>Motion, Gravity, Light, Colours, Vision, Sound,</hi> and infinite such like [things obvious, yet unknown] might have been plentiful subject.

of humane understanding, all will confess: yet the confidence of most in their own reasonings, practically dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owns it: And 'tis easier to perswade them it from others lapses then their own; so that while all complain of our <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> every one exempts himself. It is acknowledged by all, while every one denies it. If the foregoing part of this Discourse, have not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally concluded our weakness: I have one Item more of my own. If Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can be found in the Particulars mention'd; I must lose that, which I thought I had, <hi>That there is none.</hi> But however, though some should pick a quarrel with the instances I alleadged; yet the conclusion must be owned in others. And therefore beside the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason I gave of our intellectual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities, The <hi>Fall</hi>; it will be worth our labour to descend to a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account: since it is a good degree of <hi>Knowledge</hi> to be acquainted with the <hi>causes</hi> of our <hi>Ignorance.</hi> And what we have to say under this head, will be comprehensive both of the causes of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58119:49"/>
that, and (which are the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) of our <hi>misapprehensions</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. And first, one cause of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle we <hi>know</hi> may be, that Knowledge lies <hi>deep,</hi> and is therefore difficult; and so not the acquist of every careless <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer. Democritus</hi> his Well hath a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and Truth floats not. The useless froth swims on the surface; but the Pearl lies cover'd with a mass of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Verisimilitude</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> are an easie purchase; and these counterfeits are all the Vulgars treasure: But true Knowledge is as dear in acquisition, as rare in possession. Truth, like a <hi>point</hi> or <hi>line,</hi> requires an acuteness and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its discovery; while verisimility, like the expanded <hi>superficies,</hi> is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious sensible on either hand, and affords a large and easie field for loose enquiry. And 'tis the more difficult to find out Verity, because it is in such inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable proportions scattered in a mass of <hi>opinionative uncertainty</hi>; like the Silver in <hi>Hiero's</hi> Crown of Gold: And it is no easie piece of <hi>Chymistry</hi> to reduce
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58119:49"/>
them to their <hi>unmixed selves.</hi> The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are no where pure in these lower <hi>Regions</hi>; and if there is any free from the admixtion of another, sure 'tis above the <hi>concave</hi> of the <hi>Moon:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any boast of a knowledge, which is depurate from the defilement of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, within this <hi>Atmosphear</hi> of flesh; it dwels no where in unblended proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on this side the <hi>Empyreum.</hi> All Opinions have their Truth, and all have what is not so; and to say all are <hi>true</hi> and none, is no absurdity. So that to crown our selfs with sparks, which are almost lost in such a world of <hi>hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous</hi> natures, is as difficult as desirable. Besides, <hi>Truth</hi> is never <hi>alone</hi>; to know one will require the knowledge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. They hang together in a chain of mutual dependence; you cannot draw one link without many others. Such an Harmony cannot commence from a single string; diversity of strokes makes it. The beauty of a Face is not known by the Eye, or Nose; it consists in a <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi> and 'tis the comparative faculty which votes it: Thus is Truth <hi>relative,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58119:50"/>
and little considerable can be attain'd by <hi>catches.</hi> The Painter cannot transcribe a face upon a Transient view; it requires the information of a fixt and observant Eye: And before we can reach an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act sight of Truth's uniform perfections, this <hi>fleeting Transitory</hi> our <hi>Life,</hi> is gone. Thus we see the face of Truth, but as we do one anothers, when we walk the streets, in a careless <hi>Pass-by:</hi> And the most diligent observers, view but the back-side o'th' <hi>Hangings</hi>; the right one is o'th' other side the <hi>Grave:</hi> so that our Knowledge is but like those <hi>broken ends,</hi> at best a most confused <hi>adumbration.</hi> Nature, that was veil'd to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> hath not yet uncover'd, in almost two thousand years. What he sought on the other side of <hi>Euripus,</hi> we must not look for on this side <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi> In easie disquisitions we are often left to the uncertainty of a guess: yea after we have triumph'd in a supposed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; a new-sprung difficulty marrs our <hi>Ovations,</hi> and exposeth us to the Torment of a disappointment: so that even the great <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Dogmatists</hi>

himself concludes the Scene with an <hi>Anxius vixi, Dubius morior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Another reason of our <hi>ignorance</hi> and the <hi>narrowness</hi> of our <hi>apprehensions</hi> may arise hence; That we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the manner of any of Natures ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but by proportion to our <hi>senses,</hi> and a return to <hi>material phantasms.</hi> A blind man cannot conceive colours, but either as some <hi>audible, gustable, odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous,</hi> or <hi>tactile</hi> qualities; and when he would imagine them, he hath que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless recourse to some of <hi>these,</hi> in an account of which his other senses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend him. Thus more perfect appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henders misconceive <hi>Immaterials:</hi> Our imaginations paint Souls and Angels in as dissimilar a resemblance. Thus had there not been any <hi>night, shadow,</hi> or <hi>opacity</hi>; we should never have had any determinate conceit of <hi>Darkness</hi>; That would have been as inconceiveable to us, as its contrary is to him that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw it.

They are only Natures grosser wayes of working, which are sensible; Her finer threads are out of the reach of our feeble <hi>Percipient,</hi> yea questionless she hath many hidden <hi>Energies,</hi> no wayes imitated in her obvious peices: and therefore it is no wonder that we are so often at a loss; an infirmity beyond prevention, except we could step by step follow the tracks and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of <hi>Infinite Wisdom,</hi> which cannot be done but by him that owns it.</p>

            </argument>

ANother reason is the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> and <hi>fallacy of our Senses,</hi> which impose not only on common Heads, who scarce at all live to the <hi>higher Principle</hi>; But even more refined <hi>Mercuries,</hi> who have the advantages of an improved reason to disabuse them, are yet frequently captivated to these deceiving Prepossessions: appealing to a Judicature both uncommissioned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just; and when the clearest Truth is to be tryed by such Judges, its innocence will not secure it from the condemning award
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58119:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of that <hi>unintelligent Tribunal:</hi> For since we live the life of <hi>Brutes,</hi> before we grow into <hi>Man</hi>; and our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this their <hi>Non-age,</hi> being almost meerly Passive to sensible Impressions, receiving all things in an uncontroverted and promiscuous admission: It cannot be, that our Knowledge should be other, then an heap of <hi>Mis-conception</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> and conceits as impertinent as the <hi>toys</hi> we delight <hi>in.</hi> All this while, we have no more <gap reason="illegible: crossed out" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> [as <hi>Plotinus</hi> cals it] amounts to. And besides this our easie submission to the sophistications of <hi>sense,</hi> and inability to prevent the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of our <hi>Iunior</hi> Reasons; that which strikes the great stroke toward our after-deceptions, is the pertinacious adherence of many of these first Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to our <hi>Graduate</hi> Understandings. That which is early received, if in any considerable strength of <hi>Impress,</hi> as it were grows into our tender natures, and is therefore of difficult remove. Thus a fright in <hi>Minority,</hi> or an <hi>Antipathy</hi> then contracted, is not worn out but with its subject. And it may be more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58119:52"/>
then a <hi>Story,</hi> that <hi>Nero</hi> derived much of his cruelty from the Nurse that suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. Now though our coming Judgments do in part undeceive us, and rectifie the grosser Errors which our unwary Sensitive hath engaged us in; yet others are so flesht in us, that they maintain their interest upon the decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our decayed Natures, and are cherish't there, as the legitimate issues of our reasonable faculties.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Sense</hi> it self detects its more palpable deceits, by a counter-evidence; and the more ordinary Impostures sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom out-live the first <hi>Experiments.</hi> If our sight represent a Staff as crooked in the <hi>water</hi>; the same faculty rectifies both it, and us, in the <hi>thinner Element.</hi> And if a square Tower seem round at a distance; the eye, which mistook in the circumstance of its figure, at that remove, corrects the mistake in a due approach: Yea, and befriends those who have learn'd to make the advantage of its informations, in more remote and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil discoveries. And though his <hi>Sense</hi> occasion the careless <hi>Rustick</hi> to judge
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58119:53"/>
the <hi>Sun</hi> no bigger then a <hi>Cheese-fat</hi>; yet <hi>sense</hi> too by a frugal improvement of its evidence, grounds the <hi>Astronomers</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it's bigger then this <hi>Globe</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> Which it doth not only by the advantageous assistance of a <hi>Tube,</hi> but by less industrious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, shewing in what degrees Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance minorates the Object. But yet in inifinite other cases, wherein <hi>sense</hi> can afford none, or but very little help to dis-intangle us; our first deceptions lose no ground, but rather improve in our riper years: so that we are not weaned from our <hi>child-hood,</hi> till we return to our second <hi>Infancy</hi>; and even our <hi>Gray</hi> heads out-grow not those Errors, which we have learn't before the <hi>Alphabet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Reasons being inoculated on Sense, will retain a rellish of the stock they grow upon: And if we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after an unmixed Knowledge; we must unlive our former lives, and (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the practise of <hi>Penelope</hi>) undo in the <hi>day</hi> of our more advanc'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, what we had spun in the <hi>night</hi> of our <hi>Infant-ignorance.</hi> He that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58119:53"/>
would rebuild a decayed <hi>structure,</hi> must first pluck down the former <hi>ruines.</hi> A <hi>fabrick,</hi> though high and beautiful, if founded on <hi>rubbish,</hi> is easily made the triumph of the winds: And the most pompous seeming Knowledge, that's built on the unexamin'd prejudices of <hi>Sense,</hi> stands not, but till the <hi>storm arise</hi>; the next strong encounter discovers its weakness, in a shameful overthrow. And now since a great part of our sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entifical <hi>Treasure</hi> is most likely to be <hi>adulterate,</hi> though all bears the image and superscription of <hi>Verity</hi>; the only way to know what is sophisticate, and what is not so, is to bring all to the <hi>Examen</hi> of the Touchstone: For the preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>sense</hi> having (as is shewen) so mingled themselves with our Genuine Truths, and being as plausible to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as they; we cannot gain a true assurance of any, but by suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our assent from all, till the deserts of each, discover'd by a strict enquiry, claim it. Upon this account I think the <hi>method</hi> of the most excellent <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> not unworthy its Author; and (since

               <p>Two Instances of Sensitive deception. <hi>(1)</hi> Of the Quiescence of the Earth. Sense is the great inducement to its belief; its testimony deserves no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in this case, though it do move, Sense would present it as immoveable.

The unweildiness of its bulk is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of its immobility.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOw before I leave this, I shall take the opportunity, which this head offers, to endeavour the detection of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58119:55"/>
some grand <hi>prejudices</hi> of <hi>sense,</hi> in two instances; the free debate of which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be of great importance, though hitherto for the most part obstructed, by the peremptory conclusion of <hi>sense,</hi> which yet I shall declare to have no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage in the case of either: And the pleasantness and concernment of the <hi>Theories,</hi> if it be one, I hope will attone the <hi>Digression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>First,</hi> it is generally opinion'd, that the <hi>Earth rests</hi> as the Worlds <hi>centre,</hi> while the <hi>Heavens</hi> are the subject of the <hi>Universal Motions</hi>; And, <hi>as immoveable as the Earth,</hi> is grown into the credit of being <hi>Proverbial.</hi> So that for a man to go about to counter-argue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belief, is as fruitless as to whistle against the windes. I shall not undertake to maintain the <hi>Paradox,</hi> that stands <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter</hi> to this almost <hi>Catholick</hi> Opinion. Its assertion would be entertained with the hoot of the Rabble: the very menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it as possible, is among the most ridiculous; and they are likely most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to judge it, who least understand the Cause. But yet the Patronage of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58119:55"/>
as great <hi>Wits,</hi> as it may be e're saw the Sun, such as <hi>Pythagoras, Des-Cartes, Copernicus, Galilaeo, More, Kepler,</hi> &amp;c. hath gain'd it a more favourable censure with the learned World; and advanc'd it far above either vain, or contemptible. And if it be a mistake, it's only so: There's no <hi>Heresie</hi> in such an harmless aberration; at the worst, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous; the probability of it will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a lapse of easie Pardon. Now whether the <hi>Earth</hi> move or rest, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake not to determine. My work is to prove, that the common inducement to the belief of its <hi>quiescence,</hi> the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>sense,</hi> is weak and frivolous: to the end, that if upon an unprejudiced tryal, it be found more consonant to the <hi>Astronomical Phaenomena</hi>; its <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may be admitted, notwithstanding the seeming contrary evidence of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Senses.</hi> And I think what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows will evince, that this is no so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> as Vulgar Philosophers account it; but that, though it <hi>move,</hi> its <hi>motion</hi> must needs be as <hi>insensible,</hi> as if it were <hi>quiescent:</hi> and the assertion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58119:56"/>

            <p>That there is a <hi>motion,</hi> which makes the vicissitudes of day and night, and constitutes the successive Seasons of the <hi>Annual Circle; Sense</hi> may assure us, or at least the comparative Judgement of an higher faculty, made upon its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate evidence: But whether the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> be the common <hi>Movent,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be determin'd but by a farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. If we will take the literal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Eyes; the <hi>Aethereal Coal</hi> moves no more then this <hi>Inferior clod doth:</hi> For where ever in the Firmament we see it, it's represented to us, as fixt in that part of the enlightened <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphear.</hi> And though an after-account discover, that it hath changed its <hi>Site</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> to this our <hi>Globe</hi>; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were caused by its translation from us, or ours from it, Sense leaves us in an <hi>Ignoramus</hi>: So that if we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to stand to its Verdict, it must be by as great a <hi>Miracle</hi> if the <hi>Sun</hi> ever <hi>move,</hi> as it was that it once <hi>rested,</hi> or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58119:56"/>
what ever else was the subject of that supernal change. And if upon a meer sensible account we will deny Motion to the <hi>Earth</hi>; upon the same inducement we must deny it the <hi>Sun</hi>; and the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> will lose their <hi>First Moveable.</hi> But to draw up closer to our main design, We may the better conceive that, though the <hi>Earth move,</hi> yet its <hi>Motion</hi> must needs be insensible; if we consider that in four cases <hi>Motion</hi> strikes not the <hi>Sense.</hi>

            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Velocity</hi> of <hi>Motion</hi> prevents the <hi>sense</hi> of't. Thus a Bullet passeth by us, and out-runs the nimblest <hi>Opticks</hi>; and the Fly of a Jack in its swiftest rounds, gives the Eye no notice of its <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.</hi> The reason is, for that there is no sense without some stay of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on the faculty: For in Sense there are two <hi>considerables</hi>: The <hi>Motion</hi> made on the <hi>Brain</hi>; and the <hi>Souls</hi> act conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereupon, which we call <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion:</hi> and in this latter consists the formality of <hi>Sensitive Perception.</hi> Now though possibly the <hi>Aethereal</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might convey the stroke and motion

made on it quite to the Brain, before the pass of the Object; yet the soul being taken up with other attendances, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not, till engaged to it by iterated impressions, except the first impulse be very strong and violent. Thus in the clearest night we cannot see some of the smaller <hi>Stars,</hi> upon the first cast of the Eye to their <hi>Celestial Residence</hi>: yet a more intent view discovers them; though very likely their <hi>Motion</hi> reach't the <hi>Brain,</hi> assoon as the more noted impress of their <hi>Fellows.</hi> Thus upon a slight turn of our sight, we omit many particularities in nearer objects, which a more fixed look presents us with. And thus the swiftest motions, though they knock at the dore; yet they are gone before the soul can come, to take an account of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.</item>

in its repeated <hi>Gyrations,</hi> while the sense discovers not the least foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of that praecipitate <hi>Rotation.</hi> The reason is much what the same with the former: For that meeting no joggs, or counter-motions to interrupt it, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the parts is so quick, that the mind cannot take notice of their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to each other: For before it can fix to the observation of any one, its object is gone: whereas, were there any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable thwart in the Motion; it would be a kind of stop or arrest, by the benefit of which the Soul might have a glance of the fugitive <hi>Transient.</hi> But I pass these; they concern not our present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</item>
               <item>3. If the Motion be very <hi>slow,</hi> we perceive it not. Thus <hi>Vegetables</hi> spring up from their Mother Earth; and we can no more discern their <hi>accretive</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then we can their most hidden cause. Thus the sly shadow steals away on Times Account-Book the <hi>Dyal</hi>; and the quickest Eye can tell no more, but that it's <hi>gone.</hi> If a reason of this be demanded; I conceive it may be to some

satisfaction return'd, That 'tis because <hi>Motion</hi> cannot be perceived without the perception of its <hi>Terms, viz.</hi> The parts of space which it immediately left, and those which it next acquires. Now the space left and acquir'd in every sensible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in such slow progressions, is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, that it cannot possibly move the <hi>sense</hi>; (which by reason either of its constitutional dulness, or the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of stronger impressions, cannot take notice of such parvitudes) and therefore neither can the Motion depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <item>4.

Thus, while in a Ship, we perceive it not to move: but our sense transfers its motion to the neighbouring shores, as the Poet, <hi>Littus campi<expan>

To express the reason according to the Philosophy of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> I suppose it thus: <hi>Motion</hi> is not perceived, but by the <hi>successive stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings</hi> of the object upon divers <hi>filaments</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi>; which diversifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of its <hi>site</hi> and <hi>distance.</hi> But now when the motion of the object is common with it, to our selves; it retains the same relation to our <hi>sense,</hi> as if we both <hi>rested:</hi> For striking still on the same <hi>strings</hi> of the Brain, it varies not its <hi>site</hi> or <hi>distance</hi> from us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot possibly <hi>sense</hi> its motion: nor yet upon the same account our own; least of all, when we are carryed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>conamen</hi> and endeavour of ours, which in our particular progressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betrayes them to our notice.</item>

            <p>Now then the <hi>Earths motion</hi> (if we suppose it to have any) having the joynt concurrence of the two last, to render it <hi>insensible</hi>; I think we shall need no more proof to conclude the necessity of its being so.</p>

               <p>Another instance of the deceptions of our Senses: which is of translating the Idea of our Passions to things without us. Properly and formally heat is not in the fire, but is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of our sentiment.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>SEcondly the <hi>best Philosophy</hi> [the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Title of the <hi>Cartesian</hi>] derives all sensitive perception from <hi>Motion,</hi> and corporal impress; some account of which we have above given. Not that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of it consists in <hi>material Reaction,</hi> as Master <hi>Hobbs</hi> affirms, totally excluding
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58119:61"/>
any immaterial concurrence: But that the representations of Objects to the Soul, the only <hi>animadversive principle,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by motions made upon the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Instruments of Sense. So that the diversity of our Sensations ariseth from the diversity of the <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> of the object; which in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner affect the Brain, whence the Soul hath its immediate intelligence of the quality of what is presented. Thus the different effects, which <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water</hi> have on us, which we call <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> result from the so differing <hi>configurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>agitation</hi> of their <hi>Particles:</hi> and not from, I know not what <hi>Chimerical beings,</hi> supposed to inhere in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, their cause, and thence to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by many petty <hi>imaginary produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> to the seat of <hi>Sense.</hi> So that what we term <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> and other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are not properly according to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical</hi> rigour in the Bodies, their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients: but are rather <hi>Names</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our <hi>passions</hi>; and therefore not strictly attributable to any thing without us, but by <hi>extrinsick denomination,</hi> as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58119:61"/>
               <hi>Vision</hi> to the Wall. This I conceive to be an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> well worthy a rational belief: and yet is it so abhorrent from the Vulgar, that they would assoon believe <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that <hi>snow is black,</hi> as him that should affirm, it is not <hi>white</hi>; and if any should in earnest assert, that the <hi>fire</hi> is not formally <hi>hot,</hi> it would be thought that the heat of his brain had fitted him for <hi>Anticyra,</hi> and that his head were <hi>so</hi> to madness: For it is conceiv'd to be as certain, as our faculties can make it, that the same qualities, which we resent within us, are in the object, their Source. And yet this confidence is grounded on no better foundation, then a delusory prejudice, and the vote of <hi>misapplyed sensations,</hi> which have no warrant to determine either one or other. I may indeed conclude, that I am form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>hot</hi> or <hi>cold</hi>; I feel it. But whether these qualities are <hi>formally,</hi> or only <hi>eminently</hi> in their producent; is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the knowledge of the <hi>sensitive.</hi> Even the <hi>Peripatetick Philosophy</hi> will teach us, that <hi>heat</hi> is not in the Body of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but only vertually, and as in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58119:62"/>
its cause; though it be the Fountain and great Distributour of warmth to the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creation: and yet none urge the evidence of <hi>sense</hi> to disprove it: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it with any more Justice be alledged against this <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For if it be so as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> would have it; yet <hi>sense</hi> would constantly present it to us, as <hi>Now.</hi> We should finde <hi>heat</hi> as infallible an attendant upon <hi>fire,</hi> and the increase thereof by the same degrees in our approach to the Fountain <hi>calefaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> and the same excess within the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> substance, as <hi>Now</hi>; which yet I think to be the chief inducements to the adverse belief: For <hi>Fire</hi> (I retain the instance, which yet may be applyed to other cases) being constant in its spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical motions in those smaller derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, which are its instruments of action, and therefore in the same manner striking the sentient, though gradually varying according to the proportions of more or less quantity or agitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not fail to produce the same effect in us, which we call <hi>heat,</hi> when ever we are within the Orb of its activity. And
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58119:62"/>
the <hi>heat</hi> must needs be augmented by proximity, and most of all within the <hi>Flame,</hi> because of the more <hi>violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the particles there, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begets in us a stronger sense. Now if this <hi>motive Energie,</hi> the Instrument of this active <hi>Element,</hi> must be called <hi>Heat</hi>; let it be <hi>so,</hi> I contend not. I know not how otherwise to call it: To impose names is part of the <hi>Peoples</hi> Charter, and I fight not with <hi>Words.</hi> Only I would not that the <hi>Idea</hi> of our <hi>Passions</hi> should be apply'd to any thing without us, when it hath its subject no where but in our selves. This is the grand deceit, which my design is to detect, and if possible, to rectifie. Thus we have seen two notorious instances of <hi>sensitive deception,</hi> which justifie the charge of <hi>Petron. Arbiter.</hi>

And yet to speak properly, and to do our <hi>senses</hi> right, simply they are not deceived, but only administer an occasion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58119:63"/>
to our forward <hi>understandings</hi> to deceive themselves: and so though they are some way accessory to our delusion; yet the more principal faculties are the <hi>Capital offenders.</hi> Thus if the <hi>Senses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the <hi>Earth</hi> as <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>immoveable</hi>; they give us the truth of their <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> To <hi>sense</hi> it is <hi>so,</hi> and it would be deceit to present it otherwise. For [as we have shewn] though it do <hi>move</hi> in it self; it <hi>rests</hi> to us, who are carry'd with it. And it must needs be to <hi>sense</hi> unalterably <hi>quiescent,</hi> in that our Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it, prevents the variety of <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Impress</hi>; which only renders mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>sensible.</hi> And so if we erroneously attribute our particular incommunicable sensations to things, which do no more resemble them then the <hi>effect</hi> doth its <hi>aequivocal cause</hi>; our <hi>senses</hi> are not in fault, but our <hi>precipitate judgements.</hi> We <hi>feel</hi> such, or such a <hi>sentiment</hi> within us, and herein is no cheat or misprison: 'tis truly so, and our <hi>sense</hi> concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its Rise or Origine. But if hence our Understandings falsly deduct, that there is the same quality in the <hi>external
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58119:63"/>
Impressor</hi>; 'tis, it is <hi>criminal,</hi> our <hi>sense</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi> When the <hi>Ear</hi> tingles, we really hear a <hi>sound:</hi> If we judge it without us, it's the fallacy of our <hi>Iudgments.</hi> The <hi>apparitions</hi> of our frighted <hi>Phancies</hi> are real <hi>sensibles:</hi> But if we translate them without the compass of our Brains, and apprehend them as external objects; it's the unwary rashness of our <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> deludes us. And if our disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Palates resent nought but bitterness from our choicest viands, we truly tast the unpleasing quality, though falsly conceive it in that, which is no more then the occasion of its production. If any find fault with the novelty of the notion; the learned St. <hi>Austin</hi> stands ready to confute the charge: and they, who revere <hi>Antiquity,</hi> will derive satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from so venerable a suffrage. He tells us, <hi>Si quis remum frangi in aquâ opinatur, &amp;, cùm aufertur, integrari; non malum habet internuncium, sed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus est Iudex.</hi> And onward to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, The sense could not otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in the <hi>water,</hi> neither ought it: For since the <hi>Water</hi> is one thing, and the

               <hi>Air</hi> another; 'tis requisite and necessary, that the <hi>sense</hi> should be as different as the <hi>medium:</hi> Wherefore the Eye sees aright; if there be a mistake, 'tis the Judgement's the Deceiver. Elsewhere he saith, that our Eyes mis-inform us not, but faithfully transmit their resentment to the mind. And against the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> That it's a piece of injustice to complain of our <hi>senses,</hi> and to exact from them an account, which is beyond the sphear of their notice: and resolutely determines, <hi>Quicquid possuut videre oculi, verum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi> So that what we have said of the <hi>senses deceptions,</hi> is rigidly to be charg'd only on our careless Understandings, misleading us through the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sensible informations.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58119:65"/>
if present, we call <hi>Sense</hi>; if absent, we properly name it <hi>Imagination.</hi> Thus when we would conceive a <hi>Triangle, Man, Horse,</hi> or any other sensible; we figure it in our Phancies, and stir up there its sensible <hi>Idea.</hi> But in our notion of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals,</hi> we, as much as we can, denudate them of all material Phantasmes; and thus they become the object of our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects,</hi> properly so called. Now all this while the <hi>soul</hi> is, as it were, silent; and in a more passive way of reception. But the <hi>second act</hi> advanceth propositions from <hi>simple intellections:</hi> and hereby we have the knowledge of the <hi>distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>identities</hi> of objective represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Now here, as in the former, where the objects are purely <hi>material</hi>; the Judgment is made by the <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> if otherwise, we refer it to the <hi>Understanding.</hi> There is yet <hi>a third Act,</hi> which is a connecting of <hi>Propositions</hi> and deducing of <hi>Conclusions</hi> from them: and this the Schools call <hi>Discourse</hi>; and we shall not miscall it, if we name it, <hi>Reason.</hi> Now this, as it supposeth the two former, so is it grounded on certain
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58119:66"/>
               <hi>congenite propositions</hi>; which I conceive to be the very <hi>Essentials</hi> of Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Such are, <hi>Quodlibet est, vel non est; Impossibile est idem esse, &amp; non esse; Non entis nulla sunt praedicata,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Not that every one hath naturally a <hi>formal</hi> and <hi>explicit</hi> notion of these <hi>Principles:</hi> For the Vulgar use them, without knowledge of them, under any such <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> consideration; But yet there was never any born to <hi>Reason</hi> without them. If any ask, how the Soul came by those foundation-<hi>Propositions:</hi> I return, as Quantity did by <hi>longum, latum, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundum</hi>; they being the <hi>Essential annexes,</hi> or rather <hi>constitutives</hi> of it, as <hi>Reasonable.</hi> Now then, when the conclusion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd from the unerring dictates of our faculties; we say the Inference is <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi>: But when from mis-apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ill-compounded phantasmes; we ascribe it to the <hi>Imagination.</hi> So we see, there is a triple operation of the <hi>Phancy</hi> as well as <hi>Intellect</hi>; and these powers are only <hi>circumstantially</hi> different. In this method we intend a distinct, though short account, how the <hi>Imagination</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58119:66"/>
us. First then, the <hi>Imagination,</hi> which is of <hi>simple</hi> perception, doth never of it self and directly mislead us; as is at large declared in our former discourse of <hi>Sense.</hi> Yet is it the almost fatal means of our deception, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable <hi>compositions, divisions,</hi> and <hi>applications,</hi> which it occasions the <hi>second Act</hi> to make of the <hi>simple Images.</hi> Hence we may derive the Visions, Voyces, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of the <hi>Enthusiast:</hi> the strong Idea's of which, being conjur'd up into the <hi>Imagination</hi> by the heat of the <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholized</hi> brain, are judged exterior <hi>Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; when as they are but motions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Hence Story is full of the wonders, it works upon <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal Imaginants</hi>; to whom the grossest absurdities are infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and free reason an Impostour. That <hi>Groom,</hi> that conceited himself an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> thought all as irrational as disloyal, that did not acknowledge him: And he, that supposed himself made of Glass; thought them all <hi>mad,</hi> that dis-believed him. But we pity, or laugh at those fatuous <hi>extravagants</hi>; while yet our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58119:67"/>
selves have a considerable dose of what makes them <hi>so</hi>: and more sober heads have a set of misconceits, which are as absurd to an unpassionated <hi>reason,</hi> as those to our unabused <hi>senses.</hi> And, as the greatest counter-evidence to those distemper'd phancies is none: so in the more ordinary deceits, in which our Imaginations insensibly engage us, we give but little credit to the uncorrupted suggestions of the faculty, that should disabuse us. That the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are devoid of <hi>quantitative dimensions,</hi> hath the suffrage of the most; and that they have nothing to do with grosser <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality,</hi> is as generally opinion'd: But who is it, that retains not a great part of the imposture, by allowing them a <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Ubi,</hi> which is still but <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> He that said, a <hi>thousand</hi> might dance on the <hi>point of a Needle,</hi> spake but gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and we may as well suppose them to have <hi>wings,</hi> as a proper <hi>Ubi.</hi> We say, <hi>Spirits</hi> are where they operate: But strictly to be in a <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>ubi,</hi> is a <hi>material</hi> Attribute, and incompatible with so depurate a Nature. We ask not,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58119:67"/>
in what place a <hi>thought</hi> is, nor are we solicitous for the <hi>Ubi</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> or any other <hi>Immaterial</hi> accident. <hi>Relations, Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Duration,</hi> the <hi>vulgar</hi> Philosophy admits into the list of something; and yet to enquire in what <hi>place</hi> they are, were a soloecism. So that, if <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>to be in a place</hi> be not reciprocal; I know not why spirits may not be exempted, having as much to plead from the purity of their nature, as any thing <hi>but one,</hi> within the circle of being. And yet <hi>Imagination</hi> stands so strongly against the notion, that it cannot look for the favour of a very diffusive entertainment. But we are more dangerously deceiv'd, when judging the <hi>Infinite Essence</hi> by our narrow selves; we ascribe <hi>Intellections, Volitions, Decrees, Purposes,</hi> and such like <hi>Immanent actions</hi> to that nature, which hath nothing in common with us, as being infinitely above us. Now to use these as <hi>Hypotheseis,</hi> as himself in his Word, is pleas'd to <hi>low</hi> himself to our capacities, is allowable: But a strict and rigorous imputation is derogatory to him, and arrogant in us. To say, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58119:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>eminently</hi> contain all those effects in his glorious <hi>simple Essence,</hi> that the creature can produce or act by such a faculty, power, or affection; is to affirm him to be <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what he is, <hi>Infinite.</hi> Thus, to conceive that he can do all those things in the most perfect manner, which we do upon <hi>understanding, willing,</hi> and <hi>decreeing</hi>; is an apprehension suteable to his <hi>Idea</hi>: But to fix on him the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of <hi>faculties,</hi> or <hi>affections</hi>; is the Imposture of our <hi>Phancies,</hi> and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to his <hi>Divinity.</hi> 'Tis this decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion misleads the contending world; and is the Author of most of that darkness and confusion, that is upon the face of the <hi>Quinquarticular</hi> debates. Now then, we being thus obnoxious to fallacy in our <hi>apprehensions</hi> and <hi>judgements,</hi> and so often imposed upon by these deceptions; our <hi>Inferences</hi> and <hi>Deductions</hi> must needs be as unwarrantable, as our <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>compound</hi> thoughts are deceitful. Thus the <hi>reason</hi> of the far greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is but an aggregate of mistaken phantasms; and in things <hi>not sensible</hi> a constant delusion. Yea the highest and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58119:68"/>
most improved parts of Rationality, are frequently caught in the entanglements of a tenacious <hi>Imagination</hi>; and submit to its obstinate, but delusory <hi>Dictamens.</hi> Thus we are involv'd in inextricable perplexities about the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi>; and in our reasonings about those sublimities are puzled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, which are but the toyings of our <hi>Phancies,</hi> no absurdities to our more <hi>defaecate</hi> faculties. What work do our <hi>Imaginations</hi> make with <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Immensity?</hi> and how are we gravell'd by their cutting <hi>Dilemma's?</hi> I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident many have thus <hi>imagin'd</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of their <hi>Religion</hi>; and run a ground on that more desperate absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Atheism.</hi> To say, <hi>Reason</hi> opposeth <hi>Faith,</hi> is to scandalize both: 'Tis <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> is the Rebel; <hi>Reason</hi> contradicts its impious suggestions. Nor is our <hi>Reason</hi> any more accountable for the Errours of our <hi>Opinions</hi>; then our <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for the vitiosity of our <hi>Lives</hi>: And we may as well say, that the <hi>Sun</hi> is the cause of the <hi>shadow,</hi> which is the effect of the intercepting <hi>opacity,</hi> as either.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58119:69"/>
               <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are at perfect <hi>Unisons</hi>: The disharmony is in the <hi>Phancy.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a saying of <hi>Plato</hi>'s; and well worthy a Christian subscription, <hi>Reason</hi> being the Image of the Creators Wisdom copyed out in the Creature. Though indeed, as 'tis now in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, 'tis but an amassment of <hi>imaginary conceptions, praejudices, ungrounded opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and infinite Impostures; and 'tis no wonder, if these are at odds with the Principles of our belief: But all this is but <hi>apish Sophistry</hi>; and to give it a Name so <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> is abusive and unjust.</p>
            <p>There is yet another as deplorable a deceit of our <hi>Imaginations,</hi> as any: which is, its impressing a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Truth of an <hi>Opinion,</hi> where there is no evidence to support it. And if it be such, as we never heard question'd or contradicted; 'tis then held as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitate, as <hi>first principles.</hi> Thus the most of mankind is led by <hi>opinionative</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse; and <hi>Imagination</hi> is praedominant. Hence we have an ungrounded <hi>credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> cry'd up for <hi>faith</hi>; and the more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58119:69"/>
vigorous impressions of <hi>Phancy,</hi> for the <hi>Spirits</hi> motions. These are the grand delusions of our Age, and the highest evidence of the <hi>Imaginations</hi> deceptions. This is the <hi>spirit,</hi> that works in the children of <hi>Phancy</hi>; and we need not seek to remoter resolutions. But the excellent Dr. <hi>H.

            <argument>
               <p>A fifth Reason, the praecipitancy of our Understandings; the reason of it. The most close ingagement of our minds requisite to the finding of truth; the difficulties of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. Two instances of our praecipitating; as the concluding thing impossible, which to Nature are not so; and the joyning Causes with irrelative Effects.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="5">§. 5. AGain another account of the <hi>shortness</hi> of our <hi>Reasons</hi> and easiness of deception, is, the <hi>forwardness</hi> of our <hi>Understandings assent,</hi> to slightly examin'd <hi>conclusions,</hi> contracting many times a firm and obstinate belief from weak inducements; and that not only in such things, as immediately concern the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58119:70"/>
sense, but in almost every thing that falls within the scope of our enquiry. For the declarement of this, we are to observe, That every being uncessantly aspires to its own <hi>perfection,</hi> and is rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less till it obtain it; as is the trembling <hi>Needle,</hi> till it find its <hi>beloved North.</hi> Now the perfection of a Faculty is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with its Object, to which its respective actions are directed, as the scope and term of its endeavours. Thus our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding being perfected by Truth, with all the impatience, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies strong desire, breaths after its enjoyment. But now the <hi>good</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>being,</hi> which every thing reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at, must be <hi>known,</hi> and that in the particular instances thereof; or else 'tis not attain'd: and if it be mistaken, that <hi>being</hi> courts deceit and its own delusion. Now this <hi>Knowledge</hi> of their <hi>Good,</hi> was at first as natural to all things, as the <hi>desire</hi> on't: otherwise this innate propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion would have been as much a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and misery to those things that are capable of it, as a needless imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to all others. But Nature shoots
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58119:71"/>
not at <hi>Rovers.</hi> Even inanimates, though they know not their perfection them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet are they not carryed on by a blind unguided <hi>impetus:</hi> But that which directs them, knows it. The next or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of being have some sight of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And man most perfectly had it, before the <hi>touch</hi> of the <hi>Apple.</hi> So then beside this general propensity to Truth, the <hi>Understanding</hi> must know what is so, before it can entertain it with <hi>assent.</hi> The former we possess (it may be) as entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as when Nature gave it us: but of the latter little, but the capacity: And herein have we made our selves of all creatures the most miserable. And now such a multitude, such an Infinite of <hi>uncertain opinions,</hi> bare <hi>probabilities,</hi> specious <hi>falshoods,</hi> spreading themselves before us, and solliciting our belief; and we being thus greedy of <hi>Truth,</hi> and yet so unable to discern it: It cannot be, that we should reach it any otherwise, then by the most close <hi>meditation</hi> and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our minds; by which we must endeavour to estrange our assent from every thing, which is not clearly, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58119:71"/>
distinctly evidenc't to our <hi>faculties.</hi> But now, this is so difficult; and as hath been intimated, so almost infeasable; that it may well drive modesty to despair of <hi>Science.</hi> For though possibly Assiduity in the most fixed cogitation be no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or pain to <hi>immaterializ'd spirits</hi>; yet is it more, then our <hi>embodyed souls</hi> can bear without lassitude or distemper. For in this terrestrial state there are few things transacted, even in our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi> part, but through the help and furtherance of <hi>corporal</hi> Instruments; which by more then ordinary usage lose their edge and fitness for action, and so grow inept for their respective destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Upon this account our <hi>senses</hi> are dull'd and spent by any extraordinary intention; and our very <hi>Eyes</hi> will ake, if long fixt upon any difficultly discerned object. Now though <hi>Meditation</hi> be to be reckoned among the most abstracted operations of our minds; yet can it not be performed without a considerable proportion of <hi>Spirits</hi> to assist in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though indeed such as are furnish't out of the bodies purer store. This I
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58119:72"/>
think to be hence evidenc't; in that fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed seriousness herein, heats the brain in some to distraction, causeth an aking and diziness in founder heads, hinders the works of Nature in its lower and animal functions, takes away or lessens pain in distemper'd parts, and seldom leaves any but under a weary some dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and inactivity; which I think to be arguments of sufficient validity to justifie our assent to this, that the <hi>spirits</hi> are imploy'd in our most <hi>intense</hi> cogitations, yea in such, whose objects are most elevated above <hi>material.</hi> Now the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and carrying on of this work by the <hi>Spirits</hi> instrumental <hi>co-efficiency</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that they be kept together without distraction or dissipation; that so they may be ready to receive and execute the orders and commissions of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty. If either of these happen, all miscarries: as do the works of Nature, when they want that <hi>heat,</hi> which is requisite for their intended <hi>perfection.</hi> And therefore, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of such inconveniences in <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> we choose recess and solitude.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58119:72"/>
But now if we consider the <hi>volatile</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of those <hi>officious Assistants,</hi> and the several causes which occur continually, even from the meer <hi>Mechanism</hi> of our Bodies to scatter and disorder them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the excursions of our roving <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> (which cannot be kept to a close attendance); it will be found very hard to retain them in any long service, but do what we can, they'l get loose from the Minds <hi>Regimen.</hi> So that it's no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring the body to be what it was intended for, the <hi>Souls servant</hi>; and to confine the <hi>imagination,</hi> of as facil a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, as the <hi>Goteham's</hi> design of hedging in the <hi>Cuckow.</hi> And though some constitutions are genially disposited to this mental seriousness; yet they can scarce say, <hi>Nos numeri sumus:</hi> yea in the most advantag'd tempers, this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is but <hi>comparative</hi>; when as the most of men labour under disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which nothing can rid them of, but that which loosens them from this mass of flesh. Thus the boyling bloud of youth, fiercely agitating the fluid Air, hinders that serenity and fixed stayedness,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58119:73"/>
which is necessary to so severe an intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And the frigidity of decrepite age is as much its enemy, not only through penury of <hi>spirits,</hi> but by reason of its clogging them with its dulling moisture. And even in the temperate <hi>zone</hi> of our life, there are few bodies at such an <hi>aequipoiz</hi> of humours; but that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of some one indisposeth the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> for a work so difficult and serious: For <hi>temperamentum ad pondus,</hi> may well be reckon'd among the <hi>three Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal unattainables.</hi> Besides, the bustle of business, the avocations of our senses, and external pleasures, and the noyse and din of a clamorous world are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments not to be master'd by feeble endeavours. And to speak the full of my Sentiments, I think never <hi>Man</hi> could boast it, without the Precincts of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>; but He, that came to gain us a better <hi>Eden</hi> then we lost. So then, to direct all this to our end, the mind of man being thus naturally amorous of, and impatient for <hi>Truth,</hi> and yet averse to, and almost incapacitated for, that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and painful search, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58119:73"/>
to its discovery; it must needs take up short, of what is really so, and please it self in the possession of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary appearances, which offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to its embraces in the borrowed attire of that, which the <hi>enamour'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect</hi> is in pursuit of, our impatient minds entertain these counterfeits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least suspicion of their cousenage. For as the <hi>Will,</hi> having lost its true and substantial <hi>Good,</hi> now courts the shadow, and greedily catches at the vain shews of <hi>superficial</hi> bliss: so our no less dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate <hi>understandings</hi> having suffered as sad a divorce from their dearest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are as forward to defile themselves with every meretricious semblance, that the variety of opinion presents them with. Thus we see the inconsiderate vulgar, prostrating their assent to every shallow appearance: and those, who are beholden to <hi>Prometheus</hi> for a finer mould, are not furnisht with so much truth as otherwise they might be owners of, did not this <hi>precipitancy</hi> of <hi>concluding</hi> prevent them: As 'tis said of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious <hi>Chymist,</hi> that by catching at
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58119:74"/>
it too soon, he lost the long expected trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>Philosophical Elixir.</hi> I'le il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate this Head by a double instance, and close it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence it is, that we conclude many things within the list of <hi>Impossibilities,</hi> which yet are easie <hi>Feasables.</hi> For by an unadvised transiliency leaping from the effect to its remotest cause, we observe not the connexion through the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of more immediate causalities; which yet at last bring the extreams to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without a <hi>Miracle.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we hastily conclude that <hi>impossible,</hi> which we see not in the proximate capacity of its <hi>Efficient.</hi> Hence, that a single <hi>Hair</hi> should root up an <hi>Oak</hi> (which the Mathematicks teach us to be possible) will be thought fit to be number'd with the story of the <hi>Brazen-head,</hi> or that other of the wishing Hat. The relation of <hi>Archimedes</hi>'s lifting up the ships of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> among many finds but little more credit, then that of the <hi>Gyants</hi> shouldering <hi>Mountains:</hi> And his other exploits sound no better to common Ears, then those of <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:58119:74"/>
and the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> And yet Mathematicians know, that by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Mechanical advantages, any power may conquer any resistance, and the great <hi>Syracusian wit</hi> wanted but <hi>Tools,</hi> and a <hi>place</hi> to stand on, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>Earth.</hi> So the brag of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman,</hi> that he would throw <hi>Malta</hi> into the Sea, might be performed at an easier rate, then by the shovels of his <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries.</hi> And from this last noted head, ariseth that other of joyning <hi>causes</hi> with <hi>irrelative effects,</hi> which either refer not at all unto them, or in a remoter ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Hence the <hi>Indian</hi> conceiv'd so grossly of the <hi>Letter,</hi> that discover'd his Theft; and that other, who thought the Watch an <hi>Animal.</hi> From hence grew the impostures of <hi>charms,</hi> and <hi>amulets,</hi> and other insignificant ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; which to this day impose upon common belief, as they did of old up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Barbarism</hi> of the incultivate <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> Thus effects unusual, whose causes run under ground, and are more remote from ordinary discernment, are noted in the Book of <hi>Vulgar Opinion,</hi> with

               <p>The sixth Reason discours't of, <hi>viz.</hi> the interest which our <hi>Affections</hi> have in our Dijudications. The cause why our Affections mislead us; several branches of this mention'd; and the first, <hi>viz</hi> Constitutional <hi>Inclination</hi> largely insisted on.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AGain we owe much of our <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Intellectual scarcity</hi> to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in, and power which our <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> have over, our so easily seducible Understandings. And 'tis a truth well worthy the Pen, from which it dropt; <hi>Periit Iudicium, ubi res transiit in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum.</hi> That <hi>Iove</hi> himself cannot be <hi>wise</hi> and in <hi>Love</hi>; may be understood in a larger sense, then Antiquity meant it. <hi>Affection</hi> bribes the Judgement to the most notorious inequality; and we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58119:76"/>
cannot expect an equitable award, where the Judge is made a Party: So that, that Understanding only is capable of giving a just decision, which is, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith of the <hi>Law,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: But where the <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Passion</hi> hath the casting voyce, the case of <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>desperate.</hi> And yet this is the miserable disorder, into which we are laps'd: The lower Powers are gotten uppermost; and we <hi>see</hi> like men on our <hi>heads,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> observ'd of old, that on the <hi>right</hi> hand, which indeed is on the <hi>left.</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> in us, still prosecutes a deceit, like that begun in the <hi>Garden:</hi> and our <hi>Understandings</hi> are wedded to an <hi>Eve,</hi> as fatal as the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of our <hi>miseries.</hi> And while all things are judg'd according to their suitableness, or disagreement to the <hi>Gusto</hi> of the fond <hi>Feminine</hi>; we shall be as far from the <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> as from that, which is guarded by the <hi>Cherubin.</hi> The deceiver soon found this soft place of <hi>Adam</hi>'s; and Innocency it self did not secure him from this way of <hi>seduction.</hi> The first deception enter'd in at this Postern, and hath ever since kept it open for the entry
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58119:76"/>
of <hi>Legion:</hi> so that we scarse see any thing now but through our <hi>Passions,</hi> the most blind, and sophisticate things about us. Thus the <hi>Monsters</hi> which story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to have their <hi>Eyes</hi> in their <hi>breasts,</hi> are <hi>pictures</hi> of us in our <hi>invisible selves.</hi> Our <hi>Love</hi> of one Opinion induceth us to embrace it; and our <hi>Hate</hi> of another, doth more then fit us, for its rejection: And, <hi>that Love is blind,</hi> is extensible beyond the object of <hi>Poetry.</hi> When once the <hi>affections</hi> are engag'd, there's but a short step to the Understanding: and, <hi>Facilè credimus quod volumus,</hi> is a truth, that needs not plead Authority to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it.</p>
            <p>The reason, I conceive, is this: <hi>Love</hi> as it were <hi>uniting</hi> the Object to the <hi>Soul,</hi> gives it a kind of <hi>Identity</hi> with us; so that the beloved <hi>Idea</hi> is but <hi>our selves</hi> in another <hi>Name:</hi> and when <hi>self</hi> is at the bar, the sentence is not like to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial: For every man is naturally a <hi>Narcissus,</hi> and each <hi>passion</hi> in us, no other but <hi>self-love</hi> sweetned by milder Epithets. We can love nothing, but what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us; and our desire of what is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58119:77"/>
so, hath its first inducement from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: Yea, we love nothing but what hath some resemblance within our selves; and whatever we applaud as good or excellent, is but <hi>self</hi> in a <hi>transcript,</hi> and <hi>è contrà.</hi> Thus, to reach the highest of our <hi>Amours,</hi> and to speak all at once: We love our <hi>friends,</hi> because they are our <hi>Image</hi>; and we love our <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are <hi>his.</hi> So then, the <hi>beloved</hi> Opinion being thus wedded to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect</hi>; the case of our <hi>espoused self</hi> becomes our own: And when we weigh our selves, <hi>Iustice</hi> doth not use to hold the ballance. Besides, all things being double-handed, and having the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances both of Truth, and Falshood; where our <hi>affections</hi> have engaged us, we attend only to the former, which we see through a magnifying <hi>Medium:</hi> while looking on the latter, through the wrong end of the <hi>Perspective,</hi> which scants their dimensions, we neglect and contemn them. Yea, and as in corrupt judicial proceedings, the fore-stalled Understanding passes a peremptory sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the single hearing of one
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58119:77"/>
Party; and so comes under the Poets censure of him, <hi>Qui statuit aliquid parte inauditâ alterâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to give a more particular account of this Gullery; Our <hi>affections</hi> engage us as by our <hi>Love to our selves,</hi> so by <hi>our Love</hi> to <hi>others.</hi> Of the former we have the observable instances of <hi>natural disposition, Custom</hi> and <hi>Education, Interest,</hi> and <hi>our proper Invention:</hi> Of the latter in that <hi>Homage,</hi> which is payd to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> I take them up in order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Congruity</hi> of Opinions, whether true or false, to our <hi>natural constitution,</hi> is one great incentive to their belief, and reception: and in a sense too the <hi>complexion</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> as well as <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> follows the <hi>Temperament</hi> of the Body. Thus some men are genially disposited to some <hi>Opinions,</hi> and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as averse to others. Some things we are inclined to love, and we know not why: Others we disesteem, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no better account then the Poet did <hi>Sabidius, Hoc tantùm possum dicere, Non amo te.</hi> Some faces at first sight we admire
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58119:78"/>
and dote on: others, in our impartial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions no less deserving our esteem, we can behold without resentment; and it may be with an invincible disregard. I question not, but intellectual represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are received by us, with as an unequal a Fate upon a bare <hi>Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Relish or Disgust: And I believe the Understanding hath its <hi>Idiosyncrasies,</hi> as well as other faculties. Some men are made to <hi>superstition,</hi> others to <hi>frantick Enthusiasm</hi>; the former by the <hi>cold</hi> of a timorous <hi>heart,</hi> the latter by the <hi>heat</hi> of a temerarious <hi>brain:</hi> And there are natures, as fatally averse to either. And the <hi>opinions,</hi> which are suited to their respective <hi>tempers,</hi> will be sure to find their welcome, and to grow without manure. Your dull <hi>phlegmatick</hi> Souls are taken with the dulness of <hi>sensible</hi> doctrines: and the more <hi>Mercurial</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuses calculated to what is more refined, and <hi>Intellectual.</hi> Thus <hi>opinions</hi> have their <hi>Climes</hi> and <hi>National</hi> diversities: And as some Regions have their proper Vices, not so generally found in others; so have they their mental depravities, which are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58119:78"/>
drawn in with the common air of the Countrey. And I take this for one of the most considerable causes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Laws, Customes, Religions, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> doctrines, which is to be found in the divided Regions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited Earth. And therefore I wonder not at the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> of old, or of the several parts of the world to this day, nor at the <hi>sensual expectations</hi> of the <hi>Mussel-men,</hi> nor at the fopperies of the superstitious <hi>Romanists,</hi> nor the ridiculous devotions of the deluded <hi>Indians:</hi> since that the most senseless conceits and foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot miss of Harbor, where <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> grown upon the stock of a <hi>depraved constitution,</hi> hath endeared them. And if we do but more nearly look into our <hi>faculties,</hi> beginning our survey from the lowest dregs of <hi>sense,</hi> even those which have a nearer commerce with matter, and so by steps ascend to our more <hi>spiritualiz'd selves:</hi> we shall through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discover how <hi>constitutional partiality</hi> sways us. Thus to one <hi>Palate</hi> that is <hi>sweet, desirable,</hi> and <hi>delicious,</hi> which to another is <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>distastful</hi>; or more
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58119:79"/>
compendiously in the Proverb, <hi>One mans meat is anothers poyson.</hi> Thus what to one is a most grateful <hi>odour,</hi> to another is <hi>noxious</hi> and <hi>displeasant</hi>; 'twere a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery to some to lye stretch't on a bed of Roses: And in the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>life</hi>; that's a <hi>welcome touch</hi> to one, which is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing</hi> to another. And yet to rise a little higher to the <hi>nobler pair</hi>; the <hi>musical</hi> Airs, which one entertains with most <hi>delightful transports,</hi> to another are <hi>importune:</hi> and the objects, which one can't see without an <hi>Extasie,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is no more mov'd at, than a <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> If we pass further, the <hi>phancies</hi> of men are so immediately diversify'd by the individual <hi>Crasis,</hi> that every man is in this a <hi>Phoenix</hi>; and owns some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherein none are like him: and these are as many, as humane nature hath <hi>singulars.</hi> Now the <hi>phancies</hi> of the most, like the <hi>Index</hi> of a Clock, are moved but by the inward <hi>Springs</hi> and wheels of the corporal <hi>Machine</hi>; which even on the most sublimate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals is dangerously <hi>influential.</hi> And yet this sits at the Helm of the Worlds
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58119:79"/>
belief; and Vulgar <hi>Reason</hi> is no better then a more <hi>refined Imagination.</hi> So then the <hi>Senses, Phancy,</hi> and what we call <hi>Reason</hi> it self, being thus influenc'd by the <hi>Bodies temperament,</hi> and little better then indications of it; it cannot be otherwise, but that this <hi>love of our selves</hi> should strongly incline us in our most abstracted <hi>dijudications.</hi>

               <p>A second thing whereby our Affections ingage us in Error, is the prejudice of <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Education.</hi> A third, <hi>Interest.</hi> The fourth, <hi>Love</hi> to our own Productions.</p>

            <p n="2">2. ANother genuine derivation of this <hi>selfish fondness,</hi> by reason of which we miscarry of <hi>Science,</hi> is the almost insuperable <hi>prejudice</hi> of <hi>Custom,</hi> and <hi>Education:</hi> by which our minds are

encumber'd, and the most are held in a <hi>Fatal Ignorance.</hi> Now could a man be composed to such an advantage of constitution, that it should not at all adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate the images of his mind; yet this <hi>second nature</hi> would alter the <hi>crasis</hi> of the Uuderstanding, and render it as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to aberrances, as now. And though in the former regard, the <hi>Soul</hi> were a pure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; yet <hi>custom</hi> and <hi>education</hi> will so blot and scrible on't, as almost to incapacitate it for after-impressions. Thus we judge all things by our <hi>anticipations</hi>; and condemn or applaud them, as they agree or differ from our <hi>education-prepossessions.</hi> One Countrey laughs at the <hi>Laws, Customs,</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> of another, as absurd and ridiculous; and the other is as charitable to them, in its conceit of theirs. This confirms the most sottish <hi>Idolaters</hi> in their accustomed adorations, beyond the conviction of any thing, but <hi>Dooms-day.</hi> The impressions of a barbarous <hi>education</hi> are stronger in them, then <hi>nature</hi>; when in their cruel <hi>worships</hi> they launce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with knifes, and expose their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58119:80"/>
harmless <hi>Infants</hi> to the <hi>flames</hi> as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their <hi>Idols.</hi> And 'tis on this account, that there's no Religion so ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, but can boast its <hi>Martyrs.</hi> This is it, which befriends the <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Alcoran</hi>; and did they not owe their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit more to it, then to any rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, we might expect their <hi>ashes</hi>: whereas <hi>Education</hi> hath so rooted these mis-believers in their ungrounded <hi>faith,</hi> that they may assoon be pluck't from themselves, as from their obstinate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herencies; and to convert a <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Iew,</hi> may be well a <hi>phrase</hi> for an attempt <hi>impossible.</hi> We look for it <hi>only</hi> from him, to whom our <hi>Impossibles</hi> are <hi>none.</hi> And 'tis to be feared, that <hi>Christianity</hi> it self by most, that have espoused it, is not held by any better tenure. The best account that many can give of their <hi>belief,</hi> is, that they were <hi>bred</hi> in it; which indeed is no better, then that which we call, the <hi>Womans Reason.</hi> And thousands of them, whom their profession, and our charity styles <hi>Christians,</hi> are driven to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by <hi>custom</hi> and <hi>education,</hi> as the <hi>Indians</hi> are to <hi>Baptism</hi>; that is, like a

drove of Cattle to the water. And had our <hi>Stars</hi> determin'd our nativities among the Enemies of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and theirs under a <hi>Christian horoscope</hi>; in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood <hi>Antichristianism</hi> had not been the object of our aversion, nor <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> of theirs: But we should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd the Scene of our belief with that of our abode and <hi>breeding.</hi> There is nothing so <hi>monstrous,</hi> to which <hi>educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> cannot form our ductile <hi>minority</hi>; it can lick us into shapes beyond the <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strosities</hi> of those of <hi>Affrica.</hi> And as King <hi>Iames</hi> would say of <hi>Parliaments</hi>; it can do any thing, but make a <hi>man</hi> a <hi>woman.</hi> For our initial age is like the melted wax to the prepared Seal, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any impression from the documents of our Teachers. The <hi>half-moon</hi> or <hi>Cross,</hi> are indifferent to its reception; and we may with equal facility write on this <hi>rasa Tabula,</hi> Turk, or Christian. We came into the world like the unformed <hi>Cub</hi>; 'tis <hi>education</hi> is our <hi>Plastick:</hi> we are baptized into our opinions by our Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile nurture, and our growing years confirm those unexamined Principles. For
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58119:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our first task is to learn the <hi>Creed</hi> of our Countrey; and our next to maintain it. We seldom examine our Receptions, more then children their <hi>Catechisms</hi>; For <hi>Implicit</hi> faith is a vertue, where <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxie</hi> is the object. Some will not be at the trouble of a Tryal: others are scar'd from attempting it. If we do, 'tis not by a <hi>Sun-beam</hi> or ray of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal light; but by a <hi>flame</hi> that's kindled by our <hi>affections,</hi> and fed by the fewel of our <hi>anticipations.</hi> And thus like the <hi>Hermite,</hi> we think the <hi>Sun</hi> shines no where, but in our <hi>Cell</hi>; and all the world to be in darkness but our selves. We judge truth to be circumscrib'd by the confines of our belief, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines we were brought up in: and with as ill manners, as those of <hi>China,</hi> repute all the rest of world, <hi>Monoculous.</hi> So that what some <hi>Astrologers</hi> say of our <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> and the passages of our lives; may by the allowance of a <hi>Metaphor</hi> be said of our <hi>Opinions:</hi> That they are written in our <hi>stars,</hi> being to the most as fatal as those involuntary occurrences, and as little in their Power as the <hi>placits</hi> of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58119:82"/>
               <hi>destiny.</hi> We are bound to our Countreys opinions, as to its laws: and an accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed assent is <hi>tantamount</hi> to an infallible conclusion. He that offers to dissent, shall be out-law'd in his reputation: and the fear of guilty <hi>Cain,</hi> shall be fulfilled on him, who ever <hi>meets</hi> him <hi>shall slay him.</hi> Thus <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> hath seal'd the <hi>Canon</hi>; and he that adds or takes away from the Book of <hi>Orthodox</hi> belief, shall be more then in danger of an <hi>Anathema:</hi> And the <hi>Inquisition</hi> is not confined to the jurisdiction of the <hi>Triple-Crown.</hi> So we preposterously invert the Precept; holding fast what hath the Vote of our antedating apprehensions, we try all things by these our partial <hi>Prolepses.</hi> He that dares do otherwise, is a <hi>Rebel</hi> to <hi>Orthodoxy</hi>; and exposeth his credit to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration.</hi> Thus <hi>Custom</hi> conciliates our esteem to things, no otherwise deserving it: what is in <hi>fashion,</hi> is handsom and pleasant; though never so uncouth to an unconcern'd beholder. Their antick deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with feathers is as comely in the account of those barbarous Nations, which use them; as the Ornaments of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58119:82"/>
Lace, and Ribband, are in ours. And the plucking off the shooe is to the <hi>Iapanners</hi> as decent a salutation; as the uncovering of the <hi>head</hi> is to us, and their abhorred <hi>neighbours.</hi> On the other hand we start and boggle at what is <hi>unusual:</hi> and like the <hi>Fox</hi> in the fable at his first view of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> we cannot endure the sight of the <hi>Bug-bear, Novelty.</hi> Hence some innocent truths have been affix'd with the reproach of <hi>Heresie:</hi> into which, because contrary to the inur'd belief, the violent rejecters would not endure a patient inspection: But as children frighted in the dark, who run away with an out-cry from the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of their own imaginations framing; and will not stay for the information of a better discovery: so they looking on them through their unadvised fears, and uncharitable suspicions; command their Understandings to a praecipitate flight, figuring their phancies to shapes <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous</hi> and <hi>horrible,</hi> through which they make them the objects of their aversion. Hence there is no truth, but its adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries have made it an ugly <hi>Vizard</hi>; by which it's exposed to the hate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58119:83"/>
of superficial examiners: And an opprobrious title with vulgar believers is as good as an <hi>Argument.</hi> 'Tis but writing the name, that customary recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have discredited, under the opinions we dislike; and all other refutation is superfluous. Thus shallow apprehenders are frighted from many sober <hi>Verities</hi>; like the King of <hi>Arabs,</hi> who ran away from the <hi>smoaking Mince-Py,</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some dangerous plot in the harmless steam. So then, while we thus mistake the infusions of <hi>education,</hi> for the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of universal <hi>nature</hi>; we must needs fail of a <hi>scientifical Theory.</hi> And therefore the two Nations differing about the <hi>antiquity</hi> of their Language, made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to an undecisive <hi>experiment</hi>; when they agreed upon the tryal of a child brought up among the wild Inhabitants of the Desert. The <hi>Language</hi> it spake, had no reason to be accounted the most ancient and natural: And the lucky determination for the <hi>Phrygians</hi> by its pronouncing the word <hi>Beck,</hi> which signified bread in the dialect of that Countrey, they owed not to <hi>Nature,</hi> but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58119:83"/>
the <hi>Goat-herd</hi>; from which the exposed Infant, by accompanying that sort of <hi>animals,</hi> had learnt it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, <hi>Interest,</hi> is another thing, by the <hi>magnetisme</hi> of which our <hi>affections</hi> are almost irresistibly attracted. It is the <hi>Pole,</hi> to which we turn, and our <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing</hi> Judgements seldom decline from the <hi>direction</hi> of this <hi>Impregnant.</hi> Where <hi>Interest</hi> hath engaged us; like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> we'l find a way to veritie, or make it. Any thing is a Truth, to one whose <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> it is, to have it so. And therefore Self-designers are seldom disappointed, for want of the speciousness of a cause to warrrant them; in the belief of which, they do oft as really impose upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as industriously endeavour it upon others. With what an infinite of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, controversies,</hi> and <hi>litigious cases</hi> doth the world abound? and yet every man is confident of the truth and goodness of his own. And as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> observes, the reason that Mathematical demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are uncontroverted, is; because <hi>Interest</hi> hath no place in those unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable <hi>verities:</hi> when as, did the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58119:84"/>
of any stand against them, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clids Elements</hi> would not pass with a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contradicente.</hi> Sir <hi>H. Blunt</hi> tells us, that temporal expectations bring in droves to the <hi>Mahumetan Faith</hi>; and we know the same holds thousands in the <hi>Romish.</hi> The <hi>Eagles</hi> will be, where the <hi>carcase</hi> is; and that shall have the faith of most, which is best able to pay them for't. An advantageous cause never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Proselytes.</hi> I confess, I cannot believe that all the learned <hi>Romanists</hi> profess against their <hi>conscience</hi>; but rather, that their <hi>Interest</hi> brings their <hi>consciences</hi> to their <hi>Profession</hi>: and self-advantage can as easily incline some, to believe a falshood, as profess it. A good <hi>will,</hi> help'd by a good <hi>wit</hi> can find truth any where: and, what the <hi>Chymists</hi> brag of their <hi>Elixir,</hi> it can transmute any <hi>metal</hi> into <hi>gold</hi>; In the hand of a skilful Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, in spight of the Adage, <hi>Ex quolibet ligno Mercurius.</hi> Though yet I think, that every Religion hath its bare <hi>Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>: and that Pope was one with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whose saying it was, <hi>Quantum nobis lucri peperit illa fabula de Christo!</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>5.</hi> Our Affections are engaged by our Reverence to Antiquity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This hath been a great hinderer of Theorical improvements; and it hath been an advantage to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, and Mechanicks Arts, that it hath no place in them. Our mistake of Antiquity. The unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of that kind of Pedantick Adoration. Hence the vanity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting impertinent quotations. The Pedantry on't is derided; the little improvement of Science through its successive derivations, and whence that hath hapned.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ANother thing, that engageth our <hi>affections</hi> to unwarrantable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and is therefore fatal to <hi>Science</hi>; is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58119:85"/>
our doting on <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Fathers.</hi> We look with a superstitious reverence upon the accounts of praeterlapsed ages: and with a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious severity, on the more deserving products of our own. A vanity, which hath possess'd all times as well as ours; and the <hi>Golden Age</hi> was never <hi>present.</hi> For as in <hi>Statick</hi> experiment, an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable weight by vertue of its distance from the Centre of the Ballance, will preponderate much greater magnitudes; so the most slight and chaffy opinion, if at a great remove from the present age, contracts such an esteem and veneration, that it out-weighs what is infinitly more ponderous and rational, of a <hi>modern</hi> date. And thus, in another sense, we realize what <hi>Archimedes</hi> had only in <hi>Hypothesis</hi>; weighing a single <hi>grain</hi> against the <hi>Globe</hi> of Earth. We reverence gray-headed Doctrines; though feeble, decrepit, and within a step of dust: and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count maintain opinions, which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our <hi>charity</hi> to uphold them. While the <hi>beauty</hi> of a Truth, as of a <hi>picture,</hi> is not acknowledg'd but at a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58119:86"/>
               <hi>distance</hi>; and that wisdom is nothing worth, which is not fetcht from <hi>afar:</hi> wherein yet we oft deceive our selves, as did that <hi>Mariner,</hi> who mistaking them for precious stones, brought home his ship fraught with common <hi>Pebbles</hi> from the remotest <hi>Indies.</hi> Thus our Eyes, like the <hi>preposterous Animal's,</hi> are behind us; and our Intellectual motions <hi>retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</hi> We adhere to the determinations of our fathers, as if their <hi>opinions</hi> were entail'd on us as their <hi>lands</hi>; or (as some conceive) part of the Parents soul were portion'd out to his off-spring, and the conceptions of our minds were <hi>ex tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</hi> The Sages of old live again in us; and in opinions there is a <hi>Metempsychosis.</hi> We are our re-animated <hi>Ancestours,</hi> and antedate their <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And thus, while every age is but another shew of the former; 'tis no wonder, that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath not out-grown the dwarfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of its <hi>pristine stature,</hi> and that the <hi>Intellectual world</hi> is such a <hi>Microcosm.</hi> For while we account of some admired Authours, as the <hi>Seths Pillars,</hi> on which all knowledge is engraven; and spend
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58119:86"/>
that time and study in defence of their Placits, which with more advantage to Science might have been employ'd upon the Books of the more ancient, and <hi>universal Author:</hi> 'Tis not to be admired, that Knowledge hath receiv'd so little improvement from the endeavours of many pretending promoters, through the continued series of so many succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive ages. For while we are slaves to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of our <hi>Progenitours</hi>; our discoveries, like <hi>water,</hi> will not run higher then the <hi>Fountains,</hi> from which they own their derivation. And while we think it so piaculous, to go beyond the <hi>Ancients</hi>; we must necessarily come short of genuine <hi>Antiquity,</hi> Truth; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we suppose them to have reach'd perfection of Knowledge in spight of their aknowledgements of ignorance.</p>
            <p>Now if we enquire the reason, why the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>Mechanick Arts,</hi> have so much got the start in growth of other <hi>Sciences:</hi> We shall find it probably resolv'd into this, as one considerable cause: that their progress hath not been retarded by that reverential aw of former
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58119:87"/>
discoveries, which hath been so great an hinderance to Theorical improvements. 'Twas never an heresie to out-limn <hi>Apelles</hi>; nor criminal to out-work the <hi>Obelisks. Galilaeus</hi> without a crime out-saw all <hi>Antiquity</hi>; and was not afraid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his eyes, in spight of the <hi>Opticks</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi> 'Tis no discredit to that ingenious <hi>Perspicill,</hi> that Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ne're saw in't: Nor are we shy of assent to those <hi>celestial</hi> informations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were <hi>hid from ages.</hi> We believe the <hi>verticity</hi> of the <hi>Needle,</hi> without a Certificate from the <hi>dayes</hi> of <hi>old</hi>: And confine not our selves to the sole conduct of the <hi>Stars,</hi> for fear of being wiser then our Fathers. Had <hi>Authority</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd here, the Earths <hi>fourth part</hi> had to us been <hi>none,</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> his Pillars had still been the worlds <hi>Non ultra: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s Prophesie had yet been an unfulfill'd Prediction, and one moiety of our <hi>Globes,</hi> an empty <hi>Hemisphear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a sense, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som instruction; and becoming the Vote of a <hi>Synod:</hi> But yet, in common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, it's an Enemy to Verity,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58119:87"/>
which can plead the <hi>antiquity</hi> of above <hi>six thousand</hi>; and bears date from before the <hi>Chaos.</hi> For, as the Noble Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> hath noted, we have a mistaken apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Antiquity</hi>; calling that so, which in truth is the worlds Nonage. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas seculi est juventus Mundi.</hi> So that in such appeals, we fetch our knowledge from the <hi>Cradle</hi>; which though it be nearest to <hi>Innocence,</hi> it is so too to the fatal ruines which follow'd it. Upon a true account, the <hi>present age</hi> is the worlds <hi>Grandaevity</hi>; and if we must to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> let multitude of days speak. Now for us to supersede further disquisition, upon the infant acquirements of those Juvenile endeavours, is foolishly to neglect the nobler advantages we are owners of, and in a sense to disappoint the expectations of him that gave them. Yet thus we prevent our selves of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and our knowledge, though its Age write <hi>thousands,</hi> is still in its <hi>swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> For like School-boys, we give over assoon as we have learn't as far as our Masters can teach us: And had not the undertakings of some glorious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58119:88"/>
prevented; <hi>Plato</hi>'s year might have found us, where the days of <hi>Aristotle</hi> left us. For my part, I think it no such arrogance, as our Pedants account it; that almost two thousand years elapsed since, should weigh with the sixty three of the <hi>Stagirite.</hi> If we owe it to him, that we know so much; 'tis long of his Pedantick adorers that we know so little more. I can see no ground, why his Reason should be <hi>textuary</hi> to ours; or that God, or Nature, ever intended him an Universal <hi>Headship.</hi> It was another, in whom were hid all the Treasures of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge:</hi> His reason only is the <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi>; who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Christian <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. 'Twas this vain Idolizing of Authors, which gave birth to that silly vanity of <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent citations</hi>; and inducing Authority in things neither requiring, nor deserving it. That saying was much more observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>That men have beards, and women none</hi>; because quoted from <hi>Beza:</hi> and that other, <hi>Pax res bona est</hi>; because brought in with a, <hi>said St. Austin.</hi> But these ridiculous fooleries, to your more
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58119:88"/>
generous discerners, signifie nothing but the Pedantry of the affected Sciolist. 'Tis an inglorious acquist to have our heads or Volumes laden, as were Cardinal <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> his Mules, with old and useless luggage: And yet the magnificence of many high pretenders to Science, if laid open by a true discovery, would amount to no more then the old <hi>Boots</hi> and <hi>Shooes,</hi> of that proud, and exposed <hi>Embassadour.</hi> Methinks 'tis a pitiful piece of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that can be learnt from an <hi>Index</hi>; and a poor Ambition to be rich in the Inventory of anothers Treasure. To boast a <hi>memory</hi> (the most that these Pedants can aim at) is but an humble ostentation. And of all the faculties, in which some Brutes out-vie us, I least envy them an excellence in that; desiring rather to be a <hi>Fountain,</hi> then a <hi>Hogs-head.</hi> 'Tis better to own a Judgment, though but with a <hi>Curta supellex</hi> of coherent notions; then a <hi>memory,</hi> like a Sepulchre, furnished with a load of broken and discarnate bones. <hi>Authorities</hi> alone with me make no <hi>number,</hi> unless Evidence of Reason
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58119:89"/>
stand before them: For all the <hi>Cyphers</hi> of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> are no better then a single <hi>nothing.</hi> And yet this rank folly of affecting such impertinencies, hath overgrown our Times; and those that are Candidates for the repute of <hi>Scholars,</hi> take this way to compass it. When as multiplicity of reading, the best it can signifie, doth but speak them to have taken pains for it: And this alone is but the dry, and barren part of learning, and hath little reason to denominate. A number of <hi>Receits</hi> at the best can but make an <hi>Emperick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, to what is more perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to our discourse, if we impartially look into the remains of Antique Ages; we shall finde but little to justifie so groundless a Tyranny, as <hi>Antiquity</hi> hath impos'd on the enslaved world. For if we drive the Current of Science as high, as <hi>History</hi> can lead us; we shall finde, that through its several successive deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it hath still lain under such disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as have rendred any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accession unfeasable. And though
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58119:89"/>
it hath oft chang'd its Channel, by its remove from one Nation to another; yet hath it been little more alter'd, then a <hi>River</hi> in its passage through differing <hi>Regions, viz.</hi> in <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Method.</hi> For the succeeding times still subscribing to, and copying out those, who went before them, with little more then <hi>verbal</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity; <hi>Science</hi> hath still been the same <hi>pityful</hi> thing, though in a various <hi>Livery.</hi> Now if we look upon it, either in the hand of the <hi>superstitious Egyptian, fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> and <hi>disputing Graecian,</hi> or as <hi>garru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Roman</hi>: what hath it been, but only a pretty toy in an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi>; a very slender something in a <hi>Fable</hi>; or an old nothing in a <hi>disputation?</hi> And though those former days have not wanted brave <hi>Wits,</hi> that have gallantly attempted, and made Essays worthy Immortality; yet by reason either of the unqualified capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the multitude, (who dote on things slight and trivial, neglecting what is more rare and excellent) or the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous assaults of envious and more popular opposers, they have submitted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58119:90"/>
to Fate, and are almost lost in Oblivion. And therefore, as that great man, the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> hath observ'd, <hi>Time</hi> as a <hi>River,</hi> hath brought down to us what is more light and superficial; while things more solid and substantial have been immersed. Thus the <hi>Aristotelian Philosophy</hi> hath prevailed; while the more excellent <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> have long lain buryed under neglect aud obloquy: and for ought I know might have slept for ever, had not the ingenuity of this age recall'd them from their <hi>Urne.</hi> But it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what collateral to my scope, as well as disproportion'd to my abilities, to fall upon particular Instances of the defects and Errours of the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of the <hi>Ancients.</hi> The foremention'd noble <hi>Advancer of Learning,</hi> whose name and parts might give credit to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; hath handsomly perform'd it, in his ingenious <hi>Novum Organum.</hi> And yet, because it may conferr towards the discovery of how little our adherence to <hi>Antiquity</hi> befriends Truth, and the

encrease of Knowledge; as also how groundless are the <hi>Dogmatists</hi> high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions to Science: I shall adventure some considerations on the <hi>Peripatetick Philosophy</hi>; which hath had the luck to survive all others, and to build a fame on their <hi>Ruines.</hi>

               <p> Reflexions on the Peripatetick Philosophy. The Generality of its Reception, no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of its deserts; the first charge against that Philosophy; that it is meerly verbal. A Censure of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick Iesuites. <hi>Materia prima</hi> in that Philosophy signifies nothing. A Parallel drawn between it and Imaginary Space: this latter pleads more for its reality. Their <hi>Form</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is a meer word, and <hi>potentia Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi> insignificant. An essay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect Peripatetick Verbosity, by translating some definitions.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat <hi>Aristotles Philosophy</hi> hath been entertain'd by the <hi>most</hi>; hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the credulous into a conceit, that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58119:91"/>
it's <hi>best:</hi> And its intrinsick worth hath been concluded from the Grandure of its Retinue. But <hi>Seneca</hi>'s determination, <hi>Argumentum pessimi Turba est,</hi> is more deserving our credit: and the <hi>fewest,</hi> that is the <hi>wisest,</hi> have always stood contradictory to that ground of belief; Vulgar applause by severer Wisdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held a scandal. If the numerousness of a Train must carry it; <hi>Vertue</hi> may go follow <hi>Astraea,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> only will be worth the courting. The <hi>Philosopher</hi> deservedly suspected himself of vanity, when cryed up by the multitude: And discreet apprehenders will not think the better of that <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which hath the common cry to vouch it. He that writ counter to the <hi>Astrologer</hi> in his <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack,</hi> did with more truth foretell the <hi>weather:</hi> and he that shall write, <hi>Foul,</hi> in the place of the Vulgars, <hi>Fair</hi>; passes the juster censure. Those in the <hi>Fable,</hi> who were wet with the showre of <hi>folly,</hi> hooted at the <hi>wise men</hi> that escap'd it, and pointed at their actions as <hi>ridiculous</hi>; because unlike their own, that were truly <hi>so.</hi> If the major Vote may cast it,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58119:92"/>
Wisdom and Folly must exchange names; and the way to the one will be by the other. Nor is it the Rabble only, which are such perverse discerners; we are now a sphear above them: I mean the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of pretended <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> who judge as odly in their way, as the <hi>Rascality</hi> in theirs: and many a profest Retainer to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> is but an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> a in suit of <hi>second Notions.</hi> 'Tis such, that most revere the Reliques of the Adored <hi>Sophy</hi>; and, as <hi>Artemesia</hi> did those of <hi>Mausolus,</hi> passionately drink his <hi>ashes.</hi> Whether the Remains of the <hi>Stagirite</hi> deserve such <hi>Veneration,</hi> we'll make a brief enquiry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Aristotelian Philosophy</hi> is an huddle of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>terms insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> hath been the censure of the wisest: And that both its Basis and Superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture are <hi>Chimaerical</hi>; cannot be unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by them, that know it, and are free to judge it. 'Tis a <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that makes most accurate Inspections into the <hi>Creatures</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi>; and gives the exactest <hi>Topography</hi> of the <hi>Extramundane spaces.</hi> Like our late <hi>Politicians,</hi> it makes
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58119:92"/>
discoveries, and their objects too; and deals in beings, that are nothing beholden to the <hi>Primitive Fiat.</hi> Thus the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Essence, from the several cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of its being and operations, is here multiplied into <hi>Legion,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to a number of smaller <hi>Entities</hi>; and these again into as many <hi>Modes</hi> and insignificant <hi>formalities.</hi> What a number of words here have nothing answering them? and as many are imposed at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. To wrest names from their known meaning to Senses most alien, and to darken <hi>speech by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>; are none of the most inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able faults of this <hi>Philosophy:</hi> To reckon them in their particular instances, would puzzle <hi>Archimedes.</hi> Now hence the genuine <hi>Idea's</hi> of the Mind are adulterate; and the Things themselves lost in a crowd of <hi>Names,</hi> and <hi>Intentional nothings.</hi> Thus these <hi>Verbosities</hi> do emasculate the Understanding; and render it slight and frivolous, as its objects. Me thinks, the late <hi>Voluminous Iesuites,</hi> those <hi>Laplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of <hi>Peripateticism,</hi> do but subtilly trifle: and their <hi>Philosophick</hi> undertakings
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58119:93"/>
are much like his, who spent his time in darting <hi>Cumming-seeds</hi> through the <hi>Eye</hi> of a <hi>Needle.</hi> One would think they were impregnated, as are the Mares in <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi>; they are big of words: their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Volumes have the <hi>Tympany,</hi> and bring forth the wind. To me, a <hi>cursus Philosophicus,</hi> is but an Impertinency in <hi>Folio</hi>; and the studying of them a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious idleness. 'Tis here, that things are crumbled into <hi>notional Atomes</hi>; and the substance evaporated into an <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Aether.</hi> The Intellect, that can feed on this <hi>air,</hi> is a <hi>Chamaelion</hi>; and a meer <hi>inflated</hi> skin. From this stock grew <hi>School-divinity,</hi> which is but <hi>Peripateti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi> in a <hi>Theological Livery.</hi> A <hi>School-man</hi> is the Ghost of the <hi>Stagirite,</hi> in a Body of condensed Air: and <hi>Thomas</hi> but <hi>Aristotle sainted.</hi> But to make good our charge against the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi> by a more close surveying it. That its <hi>Principles</hi> are steril, unsatisfying <hi>Verbosities</hi>; cannot escape the notice of the most shallow Inquirer. To begin at the bottom; their <hi>Materia prima</hi> is a meer <hi>chimaera.</hi> If we can fix a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58119:93"/>
conceit of nothing; that's the <hi>Idea</hi> on't: And, <hi>Nec quid, nec quale, nec quantum,</hi> is as as apposite a <hi>definition</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> as can be. If we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Imaginary <hi>Matter:</hi> we must deny all things of it, that we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and what remains is the thing we look for. And should we allow it all, which its Assertors assign it, <hi>viz. Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity interminate</hi>; 'tis still but an empty extended capacity, and therefore at the best, but like that <hi>Space,</hi> which we imagine was before the beginning of <hi>Time,</hi> and will be after the Universal <hi>Flames.</hi> 'Tis easie to draw a <hi>Parallelism</hi> between that <hi>Ancient,</hi> and this more <hi>Modern Nothing</hi>; and in all things to make good its resemblance to that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Inanity.</hi> The <hi>Peripatetick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is a pure unactuated Power: and this conceited <hi>Vacuum</hi> a meer Receptibility. <hi>Matter</hi> is suppos'd <hi>indeterminate:</hi> and <hi>Space</hi> is <hi>so.</hi> The pretended <hi>first matter</hi> is capable of all <hi>forms:</hi> And the <hi>imaginary space</hi> is receptive of any <hi>body.</hi> The <hi>matter</hi> can be actuated at once but by a single <hi>Informant</hi>: and <hi>Space</hi> is replenisht by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58119:94"/>
one <hi>Corporal Inexistence. Matter</hi> cannot naturally subsist <hi>uninform'd:</hi> And <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> avoids <hi>vacuity</hi> in <hi>space.</hi> The <hi>matter</hi> is <hi>ingenerate,</hi> and beyond corruption: And the <hi>space</hi> was before, and will be after either. The <hi>matter</hi> in all things is but <hi>one</hi>: and the <hi>space</hi> most <hi>uniform.</hi> Thus the Foundation-Principle of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticism</hi> runs but <hi>parallel</hi> to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd <hi>nothing</hi>: and their agreement in essential characters makes rather an <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> then a <hi>Parity</hi>; but that <hi>Imaginary space</hi> hath more to plead for its <hi>reality,</hi> then the <hi>matter</hi> hath, and herein only are they <hi>dissimilar.</hi> For <hi>that</hi> hath no dependence on the bodies which possess it; but was before them, and will sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive them: whereas <hi>this</hi> essentially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on the <hi>form,</hi> and cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Which yet, me thinks, is little better then an <hi>absurdity:</hi> that the cause should be an <hi>Eleemosynary</hi> for its subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence to its effect, and a nature <hi>posterior</hi> to, and dependent on it self. This <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendentia a posteriori,</hi> though in a diverse way of causality, my reason could never away with: Yea, one of their own,

that the world was <hi>educ'd</hi> out of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>imaginary space</hi>; and give that as a sufficient account of its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.

                  <hi>2.</hi> Peripatetick Philosophy is litigious; it hath no setled constant significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of words; the inconveniences here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Aristotle</hi> intended the cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controversies: prov'd by his own double testimony. Some of his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent arguings derided. Disputes retard, and are injurious to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Peripateticks are most exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the Controversal parts of Philosophy, and know little of the practical and experimental. A touch at School-Divinity.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat this <hi>Philosophy</hi> is <hi>litigious,</hi> the very spawn of <hi>disputations</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies</hi> as undecisive as needless; is the natural result of the former: Storms
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58119:97"/>
are the products of vapours. For where words are imposed arbitrariously, having no stated real meaning; or else distorted from their common use, and known sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications: the mind must needs be led into confusion and misprision; and so things plain and easie in their naked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, made full of <hi>intricacy</hi> and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>uncertainty.</hi> For we cannot conclude with assurance, but from clearly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>premises</hi>; and these cannot be so conceiv'd, but by a distinct compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the words out of which they are <hi>elemented.</hi> So that, where they are unfixt or ambiguous; our <hi>propositions</hi> must be so, and our <hi>deductions</hi> can be no better. One reason therefore of the uncontroverted certainty of <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Science</hi> is; because 'tis built upon clear and settled <hi>significations</hi> of <hi>names,</hi> which admit of no <hi>ambiguity</hi> or insignificant <hi>obscurity.</hi> But in the <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian</hi> Philosophy it's quite otherwise: Words being here carelesly and abusively admitted, and as inconstantly retained; it must needs come to pass, that they will be diversly apprehended by contenders,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58119:97"/>
and so made the subject of <hi>controversies,</hi> there are <hi>endless</hi> both for <hi>use</hi> and <hi>number.</hi> And thus being at their first step out of the way to <hi>Science,</hi> by mistaking in <hi>simple terms</hi>; in the progress of their enquiries they must needs lose both themselves, and the Truth, in a <hi>Verbal Labyrinth.</hi> And now the entangled disputants, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Hobs</hi> ingeniously observeth, like Birds that came down the Chimney; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them to the false light, seldom sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the way they enter'd: But at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting by vain, impertinent, and coincident distinctions, to escape the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity that pursues them: do but weary themselves with as little success, as the silly Bird attempts the window. The mis-stated words are the original mistake; and every other essay is a new one. Now these canting contests, the usual enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the <hi>Peripatum,</hi> are not only the accidental <hi>vitiosities</hi> of the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>; but the genuine issues of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> it self. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> seems pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to intend the cherishing of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversal digladiations,</hi> by his own affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of an intricate <hi>obscurity.</hi> Himself
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58119:98"/>
acknowledg'd it, when he said; his <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks</hi> were <hi>publish'd,</hi> and not <hi>so:</hi> And by that double advice in his <hi>Topicks</hi> 'tis as clear as light. In one place, he adviseth his Sectatours in disputations to be <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous:</hi> and in another, to bring forth any thing that occurs, rather then give way to their Adversary; Counsel very well becoming an Enquirer after Verity! Nor did he here advise them to any thing, but what he followeth himself, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly copies out in his practise. The multitudes of his lame, abrupt, equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, self-conttadicting expressions, will evidence it as to the first part: which who considers, may be satisfied in this; that if <hi>Aristotle</hi> found <hi>Nature's face</hi> under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of a <hi>veil,</hi> he hath not removed the old, but made her a <hi>new one.</hi> And for the latter, his frequent slightness in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing doth abundantly make it good. To instance, he proves the <hi>world</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, because it consists of <hi>bodies</hi>; and that <hi>bodies</hi> are so, because they consist of a <hi>triple dimension</hi>; and that a <hi>triple dimension</hi> is perfect, because <hi>three</hi> are all; and that <hi>three</hi> are <hi>all,</hi> because when
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58119:98"/>
'tis but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> we can't say <hi>all,</hi> but when 'tis <hi>three,</hi> we may: Is not this an absolute <hi>demonstration?</hi> We can say All at the number <hi>three</hi>: Therefore the <hi>world is perfect. Tobit</hi> went forth and his <hi>Dog</hi> follow'd him; therefore there's a <hi>world</hi> in the <hi>Moon,</hi> were an argument as <hi>Apodictical.</hi> In another place he proves the <hi>world</hi> to be but <hi>one</hi>: For were there another, our Earth would fall unto it. This is a pitiful deduction, from the meer prejudice of Sense; and not unlike theirs, who thought, if there were <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes,</hi> they must needs [as it's said of <hi>Erasmus</hi>] <hi>in Coelum descendere.</hi> As if, were there more <hi>worlds,</hi> each of them would not have its proper <hi>Centre.</hi> Else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where shewing, why the <hi>Heavens</hi> move this way rather then another, he gives this for a reason: because they move to the more <hi>honourable</hi>; and <hi>before</hi> is more <hi>honourable</hi> then <hi>after.</hi> This is like the <hi>Gallant,</hi> who sent his man to buy an <hi>Hat,</hi> that would <hi>turn up behind.</hi> As if, had the Heavens moved the other way; that term had not been then <hi>before,</hi> which is now the contrary. This Inference is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58119:99"/>
founded upon a very weak supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That those alterable respects are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in Nature; which will never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a considerate discerner. Thus <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> acted his own instructions; and his obsequious Sectators have super-erogated in observance. They have so disguised his <hi>Philosophy</hi> by obscuring <hi>Comments,</hi> that his revived self would not own it: And were he to act another part with mortals; he'd be but pitiful <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> every <hi>Sophister</hi> would out-talk him.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>disputing</hi> way of Enquiry is so far from advancing <hi>Science</hi>; that 'tis no inconsiderable retarder: For in <hi>Scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical</hi> discoveries many things must be consider'd, which the hurrey of a dispute indisposeth for; and there is no way to truth, but by the most clear comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>simple notions,</hi> and as wary an accuracy in <hi>deductions.</hi> If the Fountain be disturb'd, there's no seeing to the bottom; and here's an exception to the <hi>Proverb, 'Tis no good fishing</hi> for Verity <hi>in troubled waters.</hi> One mistake of either <hi>simple apprehension,</hi> or <hi>connexion,</hi> makes an <hi>erroneous conclusion.</hi> So that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58119:99"/>
of <hi>disputation,</hi> and the stir and noise of Passions, that usually attend it; must needs be prejudicial to Verity: its calm insinuations can no more be heard in such a bustle, then a whisper among a croud of Saylors in a storm. Nor do the eager clamors of contending Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, yeeld any more relief to eclipsed Truth; then did the sounding Brass of old to the <hi>labouring Moon.</hi> When it's under question, 'twere as good flip <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>pile,</hi> as to dispute for't: and to play a game at <hi>Chess</hi> for an opinion in <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi> [as my self and an ingenious Friend have sometime sported] is as likely a way to determine. Thus the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick</hi> procedure is inept for <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi> solutions: The <hi>Lot</hi> were as equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a decision, as their empty <hi>Loquaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> 'Tis these nugacious <hi>Disputations,</hi> that have been the great hinderance to the more improveable parts of Learning: and the modern Retainers to the <hi>Stagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> have spent their sweat and pains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most litigious parts of his <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi>; while those, that find less play for the contending <hi>Genius,</hi> are incultivate.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58119:100"/>
Thus <hi>Logick, Physicks, Metaphysicks,</hi> are the burden of Volumes, and the dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the <hi>Disputing Schools:</hi> while the more profitable doctrines of the <hi>Heavens, Meteors, Minerals, Animals</hi>; as also the more <hi>practical</hi> ones of <hi>Politicks,</hi> and <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> are scarce so much as glanc'd at. And the indisputable <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> the only <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> Heaven hath yet vouchsaf't Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; have but few Votaries among the slaves of the <hi>Stagirite.</hi> What, the late promoters of the <hi>Aristotelian Philosophy,</hi> have writ on all these so fertile subjects; can scarce compare with the single dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about <hi>Materia prima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor hath Humane Science monopoliz'd the damage, that hath sprung from this Root of Evils: <hi>Theology</hi> hath been as deep a sharer. The Volumes of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> are deplorable evidence of <hi>Peripatetick depravations:</hi> And <hi>Luther</hi>'s censure of that <hi>Divinity, Quam primum apparuit Theologia Scholastica, evanuit Theologia Crucis,</hi> is neither uncharitable, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just. This hath mudded the Fountain of Certainty with notional and Ethnick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtions;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58119:100"/>
and platted the head of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> truth, as the <hi>Iews</hi> did its <hi>Author's,</hi> with a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>thorns</hi>: Here, the most obvious Verity is subtiliz'd into niceties, and spun into a thread indiscernible by common <hi>Opticks,</hi> but through the <hi>specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of the adored <hi>Heathen.</hi> This hath robb'd the <hi>Christian</hi> world of its <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>; and made the Church, the Stage of everlasting contentions: And while <hi>Aristotle</hi> is made the <hi>Centre</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> what hope of reconciling? And yet most of these Scholastick controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies are ultimately resolv'd into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of his <hi>Philosophy</hi>: And me thinks an <hi>Athenian</hi> should not be the best guide to the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; Nor an <hi>Idolater</hi> to that God he neither knew nor owned. When I read the eager contests of these <hi>Notional Theologues,</hi> about things that are not; I cannot but think of the pair of <hi>wise ones,</hi> that fought for the <hi>middle</hi>: And me thinks many of their Controversies are such, as if <hi>we</hi> and our <hi>Antipodes,</hi> should strive who were <hi>uppermost</hi>; their title to Truth is equal. He that divided his <hi>Text</hi> into

               <hi>one part</hi>; did but imitate the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> in their <hi>coincident distinctions</hi>: And the best of their <hi>curiosities</hi> are but like paint on Glass, which intercepts and dyes the light the more desirable splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.

hath autoptically confuted it: And he, who is not <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of his Senses, may see; that it's no exhalation from the Earth, but an heap of smaller <hi>Luminaries.</hi> That the <hi>Heavens</hi> are void of <hi>corruption,</hi> is <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> supposal: But the Tube hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd their impurity; and <hi>Neoterick Astronomy</hi> hath found <hi>spots</hi> in the <hi>Sun.</hi> The discoveries made in <hi>Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> disprove the <hi>Antique Quintessence</hi>; and evidence them of as course <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> as the <hi>Globe</hi> we belong to.

            <p n="4">4. THe <hi>Aristotelian Philosophy</hi> is inept for New discoveries; and therefore of no accommodation to the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>life.</hi> That all Arts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions are capable of maturer improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; cannot be doubted by those, who know the least of any. And that there is an <hi>America</hi> of secrets, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known <hi>Peru</hi> of Nature, whose discovery would richly advance them, is more then conjecture. Now while we either sayl by the <hi>Land</hi> of gross aud vulgar Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or direct our Enquiries, by the <hi>Cynosure</hi> of meer abstract <hi>notions</hi>; we are not likely to reach the Treasures on the other side the <hi>Atlantick:</hi> The dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the World the way to which, is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58119:106"/>
the noble end of true <hi>Philosohpy.</hi> That the <hi>Aristotelian Physiology</hi> cannot boast it self the proper Author of any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; is praegnant evidence of its infecundous deficiency: And 'twould puzzle the Schools to point at any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable discovery, made by the direct, sole manuduction of <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Most of our Rarities have been found out by <hi>casual emergency</hi>; and have been the works of Time, and Chance, rather then of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> What <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath of Experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in his Books of <hi>Animals,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; is not much transcending vulgar observation: And yet what he hath of this, was never learnt from his <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi>; but forcibly fetch'd in to suffrage to them. And 'tis the observation of the Noble St. <hi>Alban</hi>; that that <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> is built on a few Vulgar Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and if upon further enquiry, any were found to refragate, they were to be discharg'd by a <hi>distinction.</hi> Now what is founded on, and made up but of <hi>Vulgarities,</hi> cannot make known any thing beyond them. For Nature is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58119:107"/>
is set a going by the most <hi>subtil</hi> and <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Instruments; which it may be have nothing <hi>obvious</hi> which resembles them. Hence judging by visible appearances, we are discouraged by supposed <hi>Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities</hi> which to <hi>Nature</hi> are none, but within her Sphear of Action. And therefore what shews only the outside, and sensible structure of Nature; is not likely to help us in finding out the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia.</hi> 'Twere next to impossible for one, who never saw the inward wheels and motions, to make a watch upon the bare view of the <hi>Circle</hi> of <hi>hours,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex:</hi> And 'tis as difficult to trace natural operations to any practical advantage, by the sight of the <hi>Cortex</hi> of sensible Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. He were a poor <hi>Physitian,</hi> that had no more <hi>Anatomy,</hi> then were to be gather'd from the <hi>Physnomy.</hi> Yea, the most common <hi>Phaenomena</hi> can be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known, nor improved, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight into the more <hi>hidden</hi> frame. For <hi>Nature</hi> works by an <hi>Invisible Hand</hi> in all things: And till <hi>Peripateticism</hi> can shew us further, then those gross solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Elements</hi>; 'twill

never make us Benefactors to the World, nor considerable Discoverers. But its experienc'd sterility through so many hundred years, drives Hope to despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We expect greater things from <hi>Neoterick</hi> endeavours. The <hi>Cartesian Philosophy</hi> in this regard hath shewn the World the way to be happy. Me thinks this Age seems resolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath <hi>posterity</hi> somewhat to remember it: And the glorious Undertakers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Heaven hath blest our Days, will leave the world better provided then they found it. And whereas in former times such generous free-spirited Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies were, as the Rare newly observed <hi>Stars,</hi> a single one the wonder of an Age: In ours they are like the lights of the greater size that twinkle in the <hi>Starry Firmament</hi>: And this last Century can glory in numerous <hi>constellations.</hi> Should those <hi>Heroes</hi> go on, as they have happily begun; they'll fill the world with <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> And I doubt not but posterity will find many things, that are now but <hi>Rumors,</hi> verified into <hi>practical Realities.</hi> It may be some Ages hence, a voyage to the

               <hi>Southern</hi> unknown <hi>Tracts,</hi> yea possibly the <hi>Moon,</hi> will not be more strange then one to <hi>America.</hi> To them, that come after us, it may be as ordinary to buy a <hi>pair</hi> of <hi>wings</hi> to fly into remotest <hi>Regions</hi>; as now a pair of <hi>Boots</hi> to ride a <hi>Iourney.</hi> And to conferr at the distance of the <hi>Indies</hi> by <hi>Sympathetick</hi> conveyances, may be as usual to future times, as to us in a <hi>litterary</hi> correspondence. The <hi>restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of gray hairs to <hi>Iuvenility,</hi> and renewing the exhausted marrow, may at length be effected without a <hi>miracle:</hi> And the turning of the now compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>desert</hi> world into a <hi>Paradise,</hi> may not improbably be expected from late <hi>Agriculture.</hi> Now those, that judge by the narrowness of former <hi>Principles,</hi> will smile at these <hi>Paradoxical expectations</hi>: But questionless those great Inventions, that have in these later Ages altered the face of all things; in their naked propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, and meer suppositions, were to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times as <hi>ridiculous.</hi> To have talk'd of a <hi>new Earth</hi> to have been discovered, had been a <hi>Romance</hi> to <hi>Antiquity:</hi> And to sayl without sight of <hi>Stars</hi> or shoars
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58119:108"/>
by the guidance of a <hi>Mineral,</hi> a <hi>story</hi> more absurd, then the flight of <hi>Daedalus.</hi> That men should speak after their <hi>tongues</hi> were <hi>ashes,</hi> or communicate with each other in differing <hi>Hemisphears,</hi> before the Invention of <hi>Letters</hi>; could not but have been thought a <hi>fiction. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> would not have believed the almost incredible force of our <hi>Canons</hi>; and would as coldly have entertain'd the wonders of the Telescope. In these we all condemn <hi>antique incredulity</hi>; and 'tis likely Posterity will have as much cause to pity <hi>ours.</hi> But yet notwithstanding this straightness of shallow observers, there are a set of enlarged souls that are more <hi>judiciously credulous:</hi> and those, who are acquainted with the fecundity of <hi>Cartesian Principles,</hi> and the diligent and ingenuous endeavours of so many true <hi>Philosophers</hi>; will despair of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But again, the <hi>Aristotelian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi> is in some things <hi>impious,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent</hi> with <hi>Divinity</hi>; and in many more <hi>inconsistent</hi> with it self. That the <hi>Resurrection</hi> is impossible; That <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:58119:109"/>
understands not all things; That the <hi>world</hi> was from <hi>Eternity</hi>; That there's no <hi>substantial form,</hi> but moves some <hi>Orb</hi>; That the first Mover moves by an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Immutable Necessity</hi>; That, if the world and motion were not from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then <hi>God</hi> was Idle; were all the Assertions of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which <hi>Theology</hi> pronounceth impieties. Which yet we need not strange at from one, of whom a <hi>Father</hi> saith, <hi>Nec Deum coluit nec cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi>: Especially, if it be as <hi>Philoponus</hi> affirms, that he <hi>philosophiz'd</hi> by command from the <hi>Oracle.</hi> Of the <hi>Aristotelian contradictions, Gassendus</hi> hath presented us with a Catalogue: We'll instance in a few of them. In one place he saith, The <hi>Planets scintillation</hi> is not seen, because of their <hi>propinquity</hi>; but that of the <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>setting Sun</hi> is, because of its <hi>distance:</hi> and yet in another place he makes the <hi>Sun</hi> nearer us, then they are. He saith, that the <hi>Elements</hi> are not <hi>Eternal,</hi> and seeks to prove it; and yet he makes the <hi>world so,</hi> and the <hi>Elements</hi> its parts. In his <hi>Meteors</hi> he saith, no Dew is produced in the Wind; and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58119:109"/>
yet afterwards admits it under the <hi>South,</hi> and none under the <hi>North.</hi> In one place he defines a vapour <hi>humid</hi> and <hi>cold</hi>; and in another <hi>humid</hi> and <hi>hot.</hi> He saith, the <hi>faculty</hi> of speaking is a <hi>sense</hi>; and yet before he allow'd but <hi>five.</hi> In one place, that Nature doth all things <hi>best</hi>; and in another, that it makes more <hi>evil</hi> then <hi>good.</hi> And somewhere he contradicts himself within a <hi>line</hi>; saying, that an <hi>Immoveable Mover</hi> hath no principle of <hi>Motion.</hi> 'Twould be tedious to mention more; and the qualiiy of a <hi>digression</hi> will not allow it.</p>
            <p>Thus we have, as briefly as the subject would bear, animadverted on the so much admired <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> The nobler Spirits of the Age, are disengaged from those detected vanities: And the now Adorers of that <hi>Philosophy</hi> are few, but such narrow souls, that know no other; Or if any of them look beyond the leaves of their <hi>Master,</hi> yet they try other Principles by a Jury of his, and scan <hi>Cartes</hi> with <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species.</hi> From the former sort I may hope, they'l pardon this attempt; and for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58119:110"/>
the latter, I value not their censure.</p>
            <p>Thus then we may conclude upon the whole, that the stamp of <hi>Authority</hi> can make <hi>Leather</hi> as current as <hi>Gold</hi>; and that there's nothing so contemptible, but <hi>Antiquity</hi> can render it <hi>august,</hi> and <hi>excellent.</hi> But, because the Fooleries of some affected Novelists have discredited new discoveries, and render'd the very mention suspected of Vanity at least; and in points Divine, of <hi>Heresie:</hi> It will be necessary to add, that I intend not the former discourse, in favour of any new-broach'd conceit in <hi>Divinity</hi>; For I own no Opinion there, which cannot plead the prescription of above <hi>sixteen hundred.</hi> There's nothing I have more sadly resented, then the <hi>phrenetick</hi> whimsies with which our Age abounds, and therefore am not likely to Patron them. In <hi>Theology,</hi> I put as great a difference between our <hi>New Lights,</hi> and <hi>Ancient Truths</hi>; as between the <hi>Sun,</hi> and an unconcocted evanid <hi>Meteor.</hi> Though I confess, that in <hi>Philosophy</hi> I'm a <hi>Seeker</hi>; yet cannot believe, that a <hi>Sceptick</hi> in <hi>Philosophy</hi> must be one in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58119:110"/>
               <hi>Divinity. Gospel-Light</hi> began in it <hi>Zenith</hi>; and, as some say the <hi>Sun,</hi> was created in its <hi>Meridian</hi> strength and lustre. But the beginnings of <hi>Philosophy</hi> were in a <hi>Crepusculous obscurity</hi>; and it's yet scarse past the <hi>Dawn. Divine</hi> Truths were most pure in their source; and <hi>Time</hi> could not perfect what <hi>Eternity</hi> began: our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> like the Grand-father of <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> was born in the <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> and in the strength of its manly vigour: But <hi>Philosophy</hi> and Arts commenced <hi>Embry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o's,</hi> and are compleated by Times gradual accomplishments. And therefore, what I cannot find in the leaves of former Inquisitours: I seek in the Modern at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of nearer Authors. I cannot receive <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in so extensive an interpretation, as some would enlarge it to: And that discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Maxime, <hi>Nil dictum quod non dictum prius,</hi> hath little room in my <hi>esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> Nor can I tye up my belief to the <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Solomon:</hi> Except <hi>Copernicus</hi> be in the right, there hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>New under</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi>; I'm sure, later times have seen <hi>Novelties</hi> in the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58119:111"/>

            <argument>
               <p>It's queried whether there be any Science in the sense of the Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists: <hi>(1)</hi> We cannot know any thing to be the cause of another, but from its attending it; and this way is not infallible; declared by instances, especially from the Philosophy of <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi> All things are mixt, and 'tis difficult to assign each Cause its distinct Effect. <hi>(2)</hi> There's no demonstration but where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is impossible.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58119:111"/>
none. A story of a Scholar that turn'd Gipsy; and of the power of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Of one mans binding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thoughts; and a conjecture at the maner of its performance.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>COnfidence of <hi>Science</hi> is one great reason, we miss it: whereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming we have it every where, we seek it not where it is; and therefore fall short of the object of our Enquiry. Now to give further check to <hi>Dogmatical</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, and to discover the vanity of assuming <hi>Ignorance</hi>; we'll make a short enquiry, whether there be any such thing as <hi>Science</hi> in the sense of its Assertours. In their notion then, it is the knowledge of things in their <hi>true, immediate, necessary</hi> causes: Upon which I'le advance the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Observations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Knowledge of Causes is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive:</hi> for we know none by simple intuition; but through the mediation of its effects. Now we cannot conclude, any thing to be the cause of another;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58119:112"/>
but from its continual accompanying it: for the <hi>causality</hi> it self is <hi>insensible.</hi> Thus we gather fire to be the cause of heat, and the Sun of day-light: because where ever fire is, we find there's heat; and where ever the Sun is, Light attends it, and <hi>è contrà.</hi> But now to argue from a concomitancy to a causality, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly conclusive: Yea in this way lies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious delusion. Is't not possible, and how know we the contrary, but, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which alway attends the grosser flame, may be the cause of <hi>heat?</hi> and may not it, and its supposed cause, be only <hi>parallel</hi> effects? Suppose the <hi>fire</hi> had ne're appear'd, but had been still hid in <hi>smoke</hi>; and that <hi>heat</hi> did alway proportionably encrease and diminish, with the greater or less quantity of that fuliginous exhalation: should we ever have doubted, that <hi>smoke</hi> was the cause on't? Suppose we had never seen more <hi>Sun,</hi> then in a cloudy day, and that the lesser lights had ne're shewn us their lucid substance; Let us suppose the <hi>day</hi> had alway broke with a <hi>wind,</hi> and had proportionably varyed, as that did: Had
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58119:112"/>
not he been a notorious <hi>Sceptick,</hi> that should question the causality? But we need not be beholding to such remote suppositions: The French <hi>Philosophy</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes us with a better instance. For, according to the Principles of the illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> there would be light, though the Sun and Stars gave none; and a great part of what we now enjoy, is independent on their beams. Now if this seemingly prodigious <hi>Paradox,</hi> can be reconcil'd to the least probability of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, or may it be made but a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable supposal; I presume, it may then win those that are of most difficil belief, readily to yeeld; that causes in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the most palpable, may possibly be but <hi>uninfluential attendants</hi>; since that there is not an instance can be given, wherein we opinion a more certain <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</hi> So then, according to the tenour of that concinnous <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> light being caused by the <hi>Conamen</hi> of the Matter of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> to recede from the Centre of its Motion: it is easily deducible, that were there none of that fluid <hi>Aether,</hi> which makes the body of the Sun in the

Centre of our world, or should it cease from action; yet the <hi>conatus</hi> of the circling matter would not be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly less, but according to the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Laws of Motion, must press the Organs of Sense as now, though it may be not with so smart an impulse. Thus we see, how there might be <hi>Light</hi> before the <hi>Luminaries</hi>; and <hi>Evening</hi> and <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> before there was a <hi>Sun.</hi> So then we cannot infallibly assure our selves of the truth of the <hi>causes,</hi> that most obviously occur; and therefore the foundation of <hi>scientifical</hi> procedure, is too weak for so magnificent a superstructure. Besides, That the World's a mass of <hi>heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> subsistencies, and every part thereof a coalition of distinguishable varieties; we need not go far for evidence: And that all things are mixed, and Causes blended by mutual involutions; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, to the Intelligent will be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult concession. Now to profound to the bottom of these <hi>diversities,</hi> to assign each cause its distinct effects, and to limit them by their <hi>just</hi> and <hi>true</hi> proportions; are necessary requisites of <hi>Science</hi>: and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58119:113"/>
he that hath compast them, may boast he hath out-done <hi>humanity.</hi> But for us to talk of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> from those few indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct representations, which are made to our grosser faculties, is a <hi>flatulent vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We hold no <hi>demonstration</hi> in the notion of the Dogmatist, but where the contrary is <hi>impossible:</hi> For <hi>necessary</hi> is that, which cannot be otherwise. Now, whether the acquisitions of any on this side perfection, can make good the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions to so high strain'd an <hi>infallibility,</hi> will be worth a reflexion. And, me thinks, did we but compare the miserable scantness of our capacities, with the vast profundity of things; both truth and modesty would teach us a <hi>dialect,</hi> more becoming short-sighted mortality. Can nothing be otherwise, which we conceive <hi>impossible,</hi> to be so? Is our knowledge, and things, so adequately commensurate, as to justifie the affirming, that that cannot be, which we comprehend not? Our demonstrations are levyed upon Principles of our own, not universal Nature: And, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> notes, we judge from the <hi>Analogy</hi> of our selves,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58119:114"/>
not the <hi>Universe.</hi> Now are not many things certain by the <hi>Principles</hi> of one, which are impossible to the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of another? Thus some things our Juvenile reasons tenaciously adhere to; which yet our maturer Judgements disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of: many things to meer sensible discerners are <hi>impossible,</hi> which to the enlarged principles of more advanced <hi>Intellects</hi> are easie verities: Yea, that's absurd in one <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which is a worthy Truth in another; and that's a demonstration to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which is none to <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi> That every fixt <hi>star</hi> is a <hi>Sun</hi>; and that they are as distant from each other, as we from some of them; That the <hi>Sun,</hi> which lights us, is in the <hi>Centre</hi> of our World, and our <hi>Earth</hi> a <hi>Planet</hi> that wheels about it; That this <hi>Globe</hi> is a <hi>Star,</hi> only crusted over with the grosser Element, and that its <hi>Centre</hi> is of the same nature with <hi>the Sun</hi>; That it may recover its <hi>light</hi> again, and shine amids the other <hi>Luminaries</hi>; That our <hi>Sun</hi> may be swallow'd up of another, and become a <hi>Planet:</hi> All these, if we judge by common Principles or the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58119:114"/>
Rules of Vulgar <hi>Philosophy,</hi> are prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Impossibilities,</hi> and their contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as good as <hi>demonstrable:</hi> But yet to a reason inform'd by <hi>Cartesianism</hi>; these have their probability. Thus, it may be, the grossest absurdities to the Philosophies of <hi>Europe,</hi> may be justifiable assertions to that of <hi>China:</hi> And 'tis not unlikely, but what's impossible to all <hi>Humanity,</hi> may be possible in the <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> and <hi>Physiologie</hi> of Angels. Now the best Principles, excepting <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical,</hi> are but <hi>Hypotheses</hi>; within the Circle of which we may indeed conclude many things, with security from Error: But yet the greatest certainty, advanc'd from supposal, is still but <hi>Hypothetical.</hi> So that we may affirm, things are thus and thus, according to the <hi>Principles</hi> we have espoused: But we strangely forget our selves, when we plead a necessity of their being so in <hi>Nature,</hi> and an Impossibility of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise.</p>
            <p>That one man should be able to bind the thoughts of another, and determine them to their particular objects; will
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58119:115"/>
be reckon'd in the first rank of <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> Yet by the power of advanc'd <hi>Imagination</hi> it may very probably be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and <hi>story</hi> abounds with Instances. I'le trouble the Reader but with one; and the hands from which I had it, make me secure of the truth on't. There was very lately a Lad in the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who being of very pregnant and ready parts, and yet wanting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of preferment; was by his poverty forc'd to leave his studies there, and to cast himself upon the wide world for a livelyhood. Now, his necessities growing dayly on him, and wanting the help of friends to relieve him; he was at last forced to joyn himself to a company of <hi>Vagabond Gypsies,</hi> whom occasionly he met with, and to follow their Trade for a maintenance. Among these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant people, by the insinuating subtilty of his carriage, he quickly got so much of their love, and esteem; as that they discover'd to him their <hi>Mystery:</hi> in the practice of which, by the pregnancy of his wit and parts he soon grew so good a proficient, as to be able to out-do
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58119:115"/>
his Instructours. After he had been a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty while well exercis'd in the Trade; there chanc'd to ride by a couple of <hi>Scholars</hi> who had formerly bin of his acquaintance. The <hi>Scholars</hi> had quickly spyed out their old friend, among the <hi>Gypsies</hi>; and their amazement to see him among such socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had well-nigh discover'd him: but by a sign he prevented their owning him before that Crew: and taking one of them aside privately, desired him with his friend to go to an <hi>Inn,</hi> not far distant thence, promising there to come to them. They accordingly went thither, and he follows: after their first salutations, his friends enquire how he came to lead so odd a life as that was, and to joyn himself with such a <hi>cheating beggerly</hi> company. The <hi>Scholar-Gypsy</hi> having given them an account of the necessity, which drove him to that kind of life; told them, that the people he went with were not such <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postours</hi> as they were taken for, but that they had a <hi>traditional</hi> kind of <hi>learning</hi> among them, and could do wonders by the power of <hi>Imagination,</hi> and that himself had learnt much of their Art, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58119:116"/>
improved it further then themselves could. And to evince the truth of what he told them, he said, he'd remove into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther room, leaving them to discourse together; and upon his return tell them the sum of what they had talked of: which accordingly he perform'd, giving them a full account of what had pass'd between them in his absence. The <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> being amaz'd at so unexpected a discovery, earnestly desir'd him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle the <hi>mystery.</hi> In which he gave them satisfaction, by telling them, that what he did was by the power of <hi>Imagination,</hi> his Phancy <hi>binding</hi> theirs; and that himself had dictated to them the discourse, they held together, while he was from them: That there were warrantable wayes of heightening the <hi>Imagination</hi> to that pitch, as to bind anothers; and that when he had compass'd the whole <hi>secret,</hi> some parts of which he said he was yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, he intended to leave their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and give the world an account of what he had learned.</p>
            <p>Now that this strange <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Imagination</hi> is no <hi>Impossibility</hi>; the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58119:116"/>
wonderful <hi>signatures</hi> in the <hi>Foetus</hi> caus'd by the Imagination of the Mother, is no contemptible Item. The <hi>sympathies</hi> of laughing &amp; gaping together, are resolv'd into this Principle: and I see not why the <hi>phancy</hi> of one man may not determine the cogitation of another rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as easily as his <hi>bodily motion.</hi> This influence seems to be no more unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then that of one <hi>string</hi> of a Lute upon another; when a <hi>stroak</hi> on it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a proportionable motion in the <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing</hi> consort, which is distant from it and not sensibly touched. Now if this notion be strictly verifiable; 'twill yeeld us a good account how <hi>Angels</hi> inject thoughts into our minds, and know our cogitations: and here we may see the source of some kinds of <hi>fascination.</hi> If we are prejudic'd against the <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because we cannot conceive the manner of so strange an operation; we shall indeed receive no help from the common <hi>Philosophy:</hi> But yet the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> of a <hi>Mundane</hi> soul, lately reviv'd by that incomparable <hi>Platonist</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian, Dr. H. More,</hi> will handsomly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58119:117"/>
relieve us. Or if any would rather have a <hi>Mechanical</hi> account; I think it may probably be made out some such way as follows. <hi>Imagination</hi> is inward Sense. To <hi>Sense</hi> is required a motion of certain <hi>Filaments</hi> of the Brain; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Imagination</hi> there's the like: they only differing in this, that the motion of the one proceeds immediately from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects; but that of the other hath its immediate rise within us. Now then, when any part of the Brain is strongly agitated; that, which is next and most capable to receive the <hi>motive</hi> Impress, must in like manner be moved. Now we cannot conceive any thing more capable of motion, then the <hi>fluid</hi> matter, that's interspers'd among all bodies, and contiguous to them. So then, the agitated parts of the Brain begetting a <hi>motion</hi> in the proxime <hi>Aether</hi>; it is propagated through the liquid <hi>medium,</hi> as we see the motion is which is caus'd by a stone thrown into the water. Now, when the thus moved <hi>matter</hi> meets with any thing like that, from which it received its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary <hi>impress</hi>; it will proportionably
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58119:117"/>
move it, as it is in <hi>Musical strings</hi> tuned <hi>Unisons.</hi> And thus the motion being convey'd, from the <hi>Brain</hi> of one man to the <hi>Phancy</hi> of another; it is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the instrument of conveyance, the <hi>subtil</hi> matter; and the same kind of <hi>strings</hi> being moved, and much what after the same manner as in the first <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginant</hi>; the <hi>Soul</hi> is awaken'd to the same apprehensions, as were they that caus'd them. I pretend not to any exactness or infallibility in this account, fore-seeing many scruples that must be removed to make it perfect: 'Tis only an hint of the <hi>possibility</hi> of mechanically solving the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>; though very likely it may require many other circumstances com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly to make it out. But 'tis not my business here to follow it: I leave it therefore to receive accomplishment from maturer Inventions.</p>

               <p>Another instance of a supposed Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which may not be so. Of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at distance by impregnated Needles. A way of secret conveyance by sympathized hands; a relation to this purpose. Of the magnetick cure of wounds. This discourse weakens not the certainty of truths Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical or Divine. Mathematical Science need not elate us, since by it we know but our own creatures, and are still ignorant of our Makers. <hi>(3)</hi> We cannot know any thing in Nature, without the knowledge of the first springs of natural motions, and these we are ignorant of. <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Philosophy commended.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUt yet to advance another instance. That men should confer at very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant removes by an <hi>extemporary</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58119:118"/>
is a reputed <hi>impossibility,</hi> but yet there are some hints in natural ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that give us probability that 'tis feasible, and may be compast without unwarrantable assistance from <hi>Daemoniack</hi> correspondence. That a couple of <hi>Needles</hi> equally toucht by the same <hi>magnet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set in two Dyals exactly proportion'd to each other, and circumscribed by the Letters of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> may effect this <hi>magnale,</hi> hath considerable authorities to avouch it. The manner of it is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented. Let the friends that would communicate take each a Dyal: and having appointed a time for their <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick</hi> conference; let one move his impregnate <hi>Needle</hi> to any letter in the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> and its affected fellow will precisely respect the same. So that would I know what my friend would acquaint me with; 'tis but observing the letters that are pointed at by my <hi>Needle,</hi> and in their order transcribing them from their <hi>sympathized Index,</hi> as its motion direct's: and I maybe assured that my friend described the same with his: and that the words on my paper, are of his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58119:119"/>
inditing. Now though there will be some ill contrivance in a circumstance of this invention, in that the thus <hi>impregnate Needles</hi> will not move to, but avert from each other (as ingenious Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> in his <hi>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</hi> hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:) yet this cannot prejudice the main design of this way of secret conveyance: Since 'tis but reading counter to the <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick</hi> informer; and noting the letter which is most distant in the <hi>Abecedarian circle</hi> from that which the needle turns to, and the case is not alter'd. Now though this desirable effect possibly may not yet answer the expectation of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive <hi>experiment</hi>; yet 'tis no despicable item, that by some other such way of <hi>magnetick efficiency,</hi> it may hereafter with success be attempted, when <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> History shall be enlarged by riper inspections: and 'tis not unlikely, but that present discoveries might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the performance.</p>
            <p>There is besides this another way, which is said to have advanced the <hi>secret</hi> beyond <hi>speculation,</hi> and compleated it in <hi>practice.</hi> That some have conferr'd at
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58119:119"/>
distance by <hi>sympathized</hi> hands, and in a moment have thus transmitted their thoughts to each other, there are late spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious relations do attest it: which say, that the hands of two friends being <hi>sympathized</hi> by a transferring of <hi>flesh</hi> from one into the other, and the place of the <hi>letters</hi> mutually agreed on; the least prick in the hand of one, the other will be sensible of, and that in the same part of his own. And thus the distant friend by a new kind of <hi>Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy</hi> may read in his own hand what his correspondent had set down in his. For instance, would I in <hi>London</hi> acquaint my intimate in <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>I am well</hi>: I would then prick that part where I had appointed the letter [<hi>I:</hi>] and doing so in another place to signifie that word was done, proceed to [<hi>A,</hi>] thence to [<hi>M</hi>] and so on, till I had finisht what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make known. Now that there have been some such practices, I have had a considerable relation, which I hold not impertinent to insert. A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman comes to a <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> to have his arm cut off: The Surgeon perceiving
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58119:120"/>
nothing that it ailed, was much startled at the motion; thinking him either in jest, or <hi>besides himself.</hi> But by a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate recollection, perceiving that he was both sober, and in earnest; entreats him to know the reason of so strange a desire, since his arm to him seem'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly sound: to which the Gentleman replyes, that his hand was <hi>sympathiz'd,</hi> and his friend was <hi>dead,</hi> so that if not prevented by <hi>amputation,</hi> he said, it would rot away, as did that of his deceased <hi>Correspondent.</hi> Nor was this an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable surmise; but, if there be any such way of manual <hi>Sympathizing,</hi> a very probable conjecture. For, that which was so sensibly affected with so inconsiderable a touch, in all likelyhood would be more immuted, by those greater alterations which are in <hi>Cadaverous So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</hi> And no doubt, but that by the same reason it would have been corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as some times <hi>Warts</hi> are by the decay of <hi>buryed lard</hi> that was rubb'd upon them. Now if these wayes of secret conveyance may be made out to be really practicable; yea, if it be evincible, that they are as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58119:120"/>
much as possibly so, it will be a warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able presumption of the verity of the former instance: since tis as easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that there should be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations between the <hi>phancies</hi> of men, as either the <hi>impregnate needles,</hi> or <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thized hands.</hi> And there is an instance yet behinde, which is more creditable than either, and gives probability to them all.</p>
            <p>That there is a <hi>Magnetick</hi> way of curing <hi>wounds</hi> by anointing the <hi>weapon,</hi> and that the wound is affected in like manner as is the <hi>extravenate bloud</hi> by the <hi>Sympathetick medicine,</hi> is for matter of fact put out of doubt by the Noble Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> and the proof he gives in his ingenious discourse on the subject, is unexceptionable. For the reason of this <hi>wonder,</hi> he attempts it by <hi>Mechanism,</hi> and endeavours to make it out by <hi>atomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aporrheas,</hi> which passing from the <hi>cruentate</hi> cloth or weapon to the wound, and being incorporated with the <hi>particles</hi> of the <hi>salve</hi> carry them in their embraces to the affected part: where the <hi>medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal atomes</hi> entering together with the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58119:121"/>
               <hi>effluviums</hi> of the bloud, do by their subtle insinuation better effect the cure, then can be done by any grosser Application. The particular way of their conveyance, and their regular direction is handsomly explicated by that learned <hi>Knight,</hi> and recommended to the Ingenious by most witty and becoming illustrations. It is out of my way here to enquire whether the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> be not a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then any <hi>Mechanical</hi> Solutions. The former is more desperate, the later hath more of ingenuity, then solid satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. It is enough for me that <hi>de facto</hi> there is such an entercourse between the <hi>Magnetick unguent</hi> and the <hi>vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> body, and I need not be solicitous of the Cause. These <hi>theories</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume will not be importunate to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious: and therefore I have taken the liberty (which the quality of an Essay will well enough allow of) to touch upon them, though seemingly collateral to my scope. And yet I think, they are but seemingly so, since they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently illustrate my design, <hi>viz.</hi> That what seems <hi>impossible</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> may not be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58119:121"/>
so in <hi>Nature</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matist</hi> wants this to compleat his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that <hi>'tis impossible to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I intend not by any thing here to invalidate the certainty of truths either <hi>Mathematical</hi> or <hi>Divine.</hi> These are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructed on principles that cannot fail us, except our faculties do constantly abuse us. Our <hi>religious foundations</hi> are fastned at the pillars of the <hi>intellectual</hi> world, and the grand <hi>Articles</hi> of our Belief as demonstrable as <hi>Geometry.</hi> Nor will ever either the subtile attempts of the resolved <hi>Atheist</hi>; or the passionate Hurricanoes of the <hi>phrentick Enthusiast,</hi> any more be able to prevail against the <hi>reason</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> is built on, than the blustring <hi>windes</hi> to blow out the <hi>Sun.</hi> And for <hi>Mathematical Sciences,</hi> he that doubts their certainty, hath need of a dose of <hi>Hellebore.</hi> Nor yet can the <hi>Dogmatist</hi> make much of these concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in favour of his pretended <hi>Science</hi>; for our discourse comes not within the circle of the former: and for the later, the knowledge we have of the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:58119:122"/>
hath no reason to elate us; since by them we know but <hi>numbers,</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi> creatures of our own, and are yet ignorant of our <hi>Maker's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) We cannot know any thing of <hi>Nature</hi> but by an <hi>Analysis</hi> of it to its <hi>true initial causes:</hi> and till we know the first springs of natural motions, we are still but ignorants. These are the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of Science, and Nature cannot be <hi>read</hi> without them. Now who dares pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have seen the <hi>prime motive causes,</hi> or to have had a view of <hi>Nature,</hi> while she lay in her <hi>simple Originals?</hi> we know nothing but <hi>effects,</hi> and those but by our Senses. Nor can we judge of their <hi>Causes,</hi> but by proportion to palpable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salities conceiving them like those within the sensible <hi>Horizon.</hi> Now 'tis no doubt with the considerate, but that the <hi>rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Nature are very unlike the grosser <hi>appearances.</hi> Thus in things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, there's but little resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Mucous sperm,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated <hi>Animal.</hi> The <hi>Egge</hi> is not like the <hi>oviparous</hi> production: nor the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>muck</hi> like the <hi>creature</hi> that creeps
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58119:122"/>
from it. There's but little similitude betwixt a <hi>terreous humidity,</hi> and <hi>plantal</hi> germinations; nor do <hi>vegetable</hi> derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ordinarily resemble their <hi>simple sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalities.</hi> So then, since there's so much dissimilitude between <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> in the more palpable <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> we can expect no less between them, and their <hi>invisible</hi> efficients. Now had our Senses never presented us with those obvious <hi>seminal</hi> principles of apparent generations, we should never have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected that a <hi>plant</hi> or <hi>animal</hi> could have proceeded from such unlikely <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials:</hi> much less, can we conceive or determine the uncompounded <hi>initials</hi> of natural productions, in the total silence of our Senses.

                  <hi>(4)</hi> Because of the mutual dependence and concatenation of Causes, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know any one without knowing all.

            <p n="4">(4). ACcording to the notion of the <hi>Dogmatist,</hi> we <hi>know nothing,</hi> except we <hi>knew all things,</hi> and he that pretends to <hi>Science</hi> affects an <hi>Omniscience.</hi> For all things being linkt together by an uninterrupted <hi>chain</hi> of <hi>Causes</hi>; and every single motion owning a dependence on such a <hi>Syndrome</hi> of prae-required <hi>motors:</hi> we can have no true knowledge of any, except we comprehended all, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58119:124"/>
could distinctly pry into the whole <hi>method</hi> of <hi>Causal Concatenations.</hi> Thus we cannot <hi>know</hi> the cause of any one <hi>motion</hi> in a <hi>watch,</hi> unless we were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all its motive dependences, and had a distinctive comprehension of the whole <hi>Mechanical</hi> frame. And would we <hi>know</hi> but the most contemptible <hi>plant</hi> that grows, almost all things that have a being must contribute to our <hi>knowledge</hi>: for, that to the perfect <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of any thing it's necessary to know all its <hi>causes</hi>; is both reasonable in its self, and the sense of the <hi>Dogmatist.</hi> So that, to the knowledge of the poorest <hi>simple,</hi> we must first know its <hi>efficient,</hi> the <hi>manner,</hi> and <hi>method</hi> of its <hi>efforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Plastick.</hi> To the comprehending of which, we must have a full prospect into the whole <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidoxis</hi> of Nature's secrets, and the immense profundities of <hi>occult</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: in which we know nothing till we compleatly ken all <hi>Magnetick,</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick</hi> energies, and their most hidden causes. And (2) if we contemplate a <hi>vegetable</hi> in its <hi>material</hi> principle, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58119:124"/>
look on it as made of <hi>earth</hi>; we must have the true Theory of the nature of that Element, or we miserably fail of our <hi>Scientifical</hi> aspirings, and while we can only say, 'tis <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> we are pitiful <hi>knowers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, to profound into the <hi>Physicks</hi> of this heterogeneous masse, to discern the principles of its constitution, and to discover the reason of its diversities, are absolute requisites of the <hi>Science</hi> we aim at. Nor can we tolerably pretend to have those without the knowledge of <hi>Minerals,</hi> the <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of their Concretions, and among the rest, the <hi>Magnet,</hi> with its amazing properties. This directs us to the <hi>pole,</hi> and thence our disquisition is led to the whole <hi>sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme</hi> of the <hi>Heavens:</hi> to the knowledge of which, we must know their <hi>motions,</hi> and the <hi>causes,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> as also the reasons of all the <hi>Planetary Phaenomena,</hi> and of the <hi>Comets,</hi> their <hi>nature,</hi> and the <hi>causes</hi> of all their <hi>irregular appearings.</hi> To these, the knowledge of the intricate doctrine of <hi>motion,</hi> the <hi>powers, proportions,</hi> and <hi>laws</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:58119:125"/>
thereof, is requisite. And thus we are engaged in the objects of <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> yea the whole <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> must be contributary, and to them all <hi>Nature</hi> payes a subsidy. Besides, <hi>plants</hi> are partly material'd of <hi>water,</hi> with which they are furnisht either from <hi>subterranean</hi> Fountains, or the <hi>Clouds.</hi> Now to have the true Theory of the former, we must trace the nature of the <hi>Sea,</hi> its origen; and hereto its remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>flux</hi> and <hi>reflux.</hi> This again directs us to the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the rest of the Celestial <hi>faces.</hi> The moisture that comes from the <hi>Clouds</hi> is drawn up in <hi>vapours:</hi> To the Scientifical discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, we must know the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of that action, their suspense in the <hi>middle region,</hi> the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that <hi>place,</hi> and the <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of their precipitating thence again: and so the reason of the <hi>Sphaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> figure of the <hi>drops</hi>; the causes of <hi>Windes, Hail, Snow, Thunder, Lightning,</hi> with all other igneous appearances, with the whole <hi>Physiology</hi> of <hi>Meteors</hi> must be enquired into. And again (3) in our
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58119:125"/>
disquisition into the <hi>formal Causes,</hi> the knowledge of the nature of <hi>colours,</hi> is necessary to compleat the Science. To be inform'd of this, we must know what <hi>light</hi> is; and <hi>light</hi> being effected by a motion on the Organs of <hi>sense,</hi> 'twill be a necessary requisite, to understand the nature of our <hi>sensitive</hi> faculties, and to them the essence of the <hi>soul,</hi> and other spiritual subsistences. The manner how it is <hi>materially</hi> united, and how it is aware of corporeal <hi>motion.</hi> The seat of <hi>sense,</hi> and the place where 'tis <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally</hi> affected: which cannot be known but by the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of our parts, and the knowledge of their Mechanical stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. And if further (4) we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the <hi>end</hi> of this minute effect, its principal <hi>final</hi> Cause, being the glory of its Maker, leads us into <hi>Divinity</hi>; and for its subordinate, as 'tis design'd for <hi>alimental</hi> sustenance to living creatures, and <hi>medicinal</hi> uses to man, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into <hi>Zoography,</hi> and the whole body of <hi>Physick.</hi> Thus then, to the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the most contemptible <hi>effect</hi> in nature, 'tis necessary to know the whole
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58119:126"/>
               <hi>Syntax</hi> of Causes, and their particular <hi>circumstances,</hi> and <hi>modes</hi> of action. Nay, we <hi>know nothing,</hi> till we <hi>know our selves,</hi> which are the summary of all the world without us, and the <hi>Index</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor can we know our selves without the <hi>Physiology</hi> of corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> of Souls and Angels. So then, every Science borrows from all the rest; and we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any single one, without the <hi>Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopaedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5) The <hi>knowledge</hi> we have comes from our <hi>Senses,</hi> and the <hi>Dogmatist</hi> can go no higher for the original of his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Now let the <hi>Sciolist</hi> tell me, why things must needs be <hi>so,</hi> as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual <hi>senses</hi> represent them? Is he sure, that objects are not otherwise <hi>sensed</hi> by others, then they are by him? and why must his sense be the infallible <hi>Criterion?</hi> It may be, what is <hi>white</hi> to us, is <hi>black</hi> to <hi>Negroes,</hi> and our <hi>Angels</hi> to them are <hi>Fiends.</hi> Diversity of <hi>constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or other circumstances varies the <hi>sensation,</hi> and to them of <hi>Iava</hi> Pepper is <hi>cold.</hi> And though we agree in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58119:126"/>
name, yet it may be, I have the same representation from <hi>yellow,</hi> that another hath from <hi>green.</hi> Thus two look upon an <hi>Alabaster</hi> Statue; he call's it <hi>white,</hi> and I assent to the appellation: but how can I discover, that his inward <hi>sense</hi> on't is the same that <hi>mine</hi> is? It may be, <hi>Alabaster</hi> is represented to him, as <hi>jet</hi> is to me, and yet it is <hi>white</hi> to us both. We accord in the <hi>name:</hi> but it's beyond our knowledge, whether we do so in the <hi>conception</hi> answering it. Yea, the contrary is not without its probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For though the <hi>Images, Motions,</hi> or whatever else is the cause of <hi>sense,</hi> may be alike as from the object; yet may the representations be varyed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and quality of the Recipient. That's one thing to us looking through a <hi>tube,</hi> which is another to our naked <hi>eyes.</hi> The same things seem other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise through a <hi>green</hi> glass, then they do through a <hi>red.</hi> Thus objects have a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent appearance, when the <hi>eye</hi> is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently any way <hi>distorted,</hi> from that they have, when our Organs are in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>site</hi> and <hi>figure,</hi> and some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58119:127"/>
alterations in the Brain duplicate that which is but a single object to our undistemper'd <hi>Sentient.</hi> Thus, that's of one <hi>colour</hi> to us standing in <hi>one place,</hi> which hath a contrary aspect in <hi>another:</hi> as in those versatile representations in the neck of a <hi>Dove,</hi> and folds of <hi>Scarlet.</hi> And as great diversity might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the other <hi>senses,</hi> but for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity I omit them. Now then, since so many various circumstances concurre to every <hi>individual</hi> constitution, and every mans <hi>senses,</hi> differing as much from others in its <hi>figure, colour, site,</hi> and infinite other <hi>particularities</hi> in the <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization,</hi> as any one mans can from it self, through diverse <hi>accidental</hi> variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: it cannot well be suppos'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but that the <hi>conceptions</hi> convey'd by them must be as <hi>diverse.</hi> Thus, one mans <hi>eyes</hi> are more <hi>protuberant,</hi> and swelling out; anothers more <hi>sunk</hi> and <hi>depressed.</hi> One mans <hi>bright,</hi> and spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and as it were swimming in a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> lucid moisture; anothers more <hi>dull</hi> and heavy, and destitute of that <hi>spirituous</hi> humidity. The <hi>colour</hi> of mens <hi>eyes</hi> is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58119:127"/>
various, nor is there less diversity in their <hi>quantitative proportions.</hi> And if we look further into the more <hi>inward</hi> constitution, there's more variety in the internal <hi>configurations,</hi> than in the <hi>visible</hi> out-side. For let us consider the different qualities of the <hi>Optick</hi> nerves, <hi>humors, tunicles,</hi> and spirits; the divers <hi>figurings</hi> of the brain; the <hi>strings,</hi> or <hi>filaments</hi> thereof; their difference in tenuity and aptness for motion: and as many other circumstances, as there are individuals in <hi>humane nature</hi>; all these are diversified according to the difference of each <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> and are as unlike, as our <hi>faces.</hi> From these diversities in all likelyhood will arise as much difference in the manner of the reception of the <hi>Images,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently as various <hi>sensations.</hi> So then, how objects are represented to my <hi>self</hi>; I cannot be ignorant, being conscious to mine own <hi>cogitations</hi>; but in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they are received, and what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses they make upon the so differing <hi>organs</hi> of another, he only <hi>knows,</hi> that <hi>feels</hi> them. There is an obvious an easie objection, which I have sufficiently
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58119:128"/>
caveated against; and with the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it will signifie no more then the inadvertency of the Objectors. 'Twill be thought by slight discerners a ridiculous <hi>Paradox,</hi> that all men should not conceive of the objects of <hi>sense</hi> alike; since their agreement in the <hi>appellation</hi> seems so strong an argument of the identity of the <hi>sentiment.</hi> All, for instance, say, that Snow is <hi>white,</hi> and that Jet is <hi>black,</hi> is doubted by none. But yet 'tis more then any man can determine, whether his <hi>conceit</hi> of what he cals <hi>white,</hi> be the same with anothers; or whether, the notion he hath of one <hi>colour</hi> be not the same another hath of a very <hi>diverse</hi> one. So then, to direct all against the <hi>knowing Ignorant,</hi> what he hath of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence, the very ground-work of his <hi>demonstration,</hi> is but the knowledge of his own <hi>resentment:</hi> but how the same things appear to others, they only <hi>know,</hi> that are <hi>conscious</hi> to them; and how they are in <hi>themselves,</hi> only he that <hi>made them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I in this last particular play'd with the <hi>Dogmatist</hi> in a personated
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58119:128"/>
               <hi>Scepticism:</hi> and would not have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the whole <hi>discourse</hi> measur'd by the seeming tendency of this part on't. The <hi>Sciolist</hi> may here see, that what he counts of all things most absurd and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, hath yet considerable shew of probability to plead its cause, and it may be more then some of his presumed <hi>demonstrations.</hi> 'Tis irreprehensible in <hi>Physitians</hi> to cure their Patient of one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, by casting him into another, less desperate. And I hope, I shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the frown of the Ingenuous for my innocent intentions; having in this only imitated the practice of bending a <hi>crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> stick as much the other way, to straighten it. And if by this verge to the other extream, I can bring the <hi>opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Confident</hi> but half the way, <hi>viz.</hi> that discreet modest aequipoize of Judgement, that becomes the sons of <hi>Adam</hi>; I have compast what I aim at.</p>

            <p>I Expect but little success of all this upon the <hi>Dogmatist,</hi> his opinion'd as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance is paramont to Argument, and 'tis almost as easie to reason him out of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> as out of this <hi>disease</hi> of the mind, I hope for better fruit from the more generous <hi>vertuoso's,</hi> to such I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal against <hi>Dogmatizing,</hi> in the following considerations; that's well spent upon

impartial ingenuity, which is lost upon resolved prejudice.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Opinionative confidence</hi> is the effect of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and were the <hi>Sciolist</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded so, I might spare my further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against it: 'tis affectation of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> that makes him confident he hath it, and his confidence is counter evidence to his pretensions to <hi>knowledge.</hi> He is the greatest <hi>ignorant,</hi> that knows not that he is <hi>so:</hi> for 'tis a good degree of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to be sensible that we <hi>want it.</hi> He that knows most of himself, knows least of his knowledge, and the exercised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is conscious of its disability. Now he that is so, will not lean too as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly on that, which hath so frequently deceived him, nor build the <hi>Castle</hi> of his intellectual security, <hi>in the Air of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But for the shallow passive intellects, that were never ingag'd in a through search of verity, 'tis such are the <hi>confidents</hi> that ingage their irrepealable assents to every slight appearance. Thus meer sensible conceivers, make every thing they hold a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the silly vulgar are <hi>sure</hi> of all things. There was no Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reme
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58119:130"/>
in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> more certain to <hi>Archimedes,</hi> then the <hi>Earth's</hi> immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>quiescence</hi> seems to the multitude: nor then did the impossibility of <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> to antique ages. And if great <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> doubt of many things, which popular dijudicants hold as certain as their <hi>Creeds,</hi> I suppose <hi>Ignorance</hi> it self will not say, it is because they are more <hi>ignorant.</hi> Superficial pedants will swear their controversal uncertainties, while wiser heads stand <hi>in bivio.</hi> Opinions are the <hi>Rattles</hi> of immature intellects, but the advanced Reasons have out-grown them. True knowledge is modest and wary, 'tis ignorance that is so bold, and presuming. Thus those that never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd without the <hi>Horizon,</hi> that first terminated their Infant aspects, will not be perswaded that the world hath any Countrey better then their own: while they that have had a view of other Regions, are not so confidently perswaded of the precedency of that, they were bred in, but speak more indifferently of the laws, manners, commodities, and customs of their native soil: So they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58119:130"/>
that never peep't beyond the common belief in which their easie understandings were at first indoctrinated, are indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately assur'd of the Truth, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative excellency of their receptions, while the larger Souls, that have travail'd the divers <hi>Climates</hi> of <hi>Opinions,</hi> are more cautious in their <hi>resolves,</hi> and more sparing to determine. And let the most confirm'd <hi>Dogmatist</hi> profound far into his indeared opinions, and I'le warrant him 'twill be an effectual cure of <hi>confidence.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(2) <hi>Confidence in Opinions</hi> evermore dwells with untamed <hi>passions,</hi> and is maintain'd upon the depraved <hi>obstinacy</hi> of an ungovern'd <hi>spirit.</hi> He's but a novice in the Art of <hi>Autocrasy,</hi> that cannot castigate his <hi>passions</hi> in reference to those <hi>presumptions,</hi> and will come as far short of <hi>wisdom</hi> as <hi>science:</hi> for the Judgement being the <hi>Hegemonical</hi> power, and director of action, if it be led by the <hi>over-bearings</hi> of <hi>passion,</hi> and stor'd with <hi>lubricous opinions</hi> in stead of clearly conceived <hi>truths,</hi> and be peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily resolved in them, the <hi>practice</hi> will be as irregular, as the <hi>conceptions</hi> erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58119:131"/>
                  <hi>Opinions</hi> hold the stirrup, while <hi>vice</hi> mounts into the saddle.</item>
               <item>(3) <hi>Dogmatizing</hi> is the great disturber both of our <hi>selves</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> without us: for while we wed an <hi>opinion,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedly ingage against every one, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it. Thus <hi>every man,</hi> being in some of his <hi>opinionative</hi> apprehensions singular, must be at variance with <hi>all men.</hi> Now every opposition of our espous'd opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons furrows the <hi>sea</hi> within us, and discomposeth the minds <hi>serenity.</hi> And what happiness is there in a <hi>storm</hi> of passions? On this account the <hi>Scepticks</hi> affected an indifferent aequipondious <hi>neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality</hi> as the only means to their <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxia,</hi> and freedom from <hi>passionate</hi> disturbances. Nor were they altogether mistaken in the way, to their design'd felicity, but came <hi>short</hi> on't, by going <hi>beyond</hi> it: for if there be a repose natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attainable this side the <hi>Stars,</hi> there is no way we can more hopefully seek it in. We can never be at rest, while our quiet can be taken from us by every thwarting our opinions: nor is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent an happiness, which every one can
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58119:131"/>
rob us of. There is no <hi>felicity,</hi> but in a <hi>fixed stability.</hi> Nor can genuine <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> be built upon <hi>rowling</hi> foundations. 'Tis true staidness of mind, to look with an equal regard on all things, and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved <hi>apathy</hi> in opinionative uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is a warrantable piece of <hi>Stoicism.</hi> Besides, this <hi>immodest obstinacy</hi> in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath made the world a <hi>Babel</hi>; and given birth to disorders, like those of the <hi>Chaos.</hi> The primitive fight of <hi>Elements</hi> doth fitly embleme that of <hi>Opinions,</hi> and those <hi>proverbial contrarieties</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, as soon as peremptory conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. That hence grow <hi>Schisms, Heresies,</hi> and <hi>anomalies</hi> beyond <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> I could wish were of more difficult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. 'Twere happy for a distemper'd <hi>Church,</hi> if evidence were not so near us. 'Tis zeal for <hi>opinions</hi> that hath fill'd our <hi>Hemisphear</hi> with smoke and darkness, and by a dear experience we know the fury of those <hi>flames</hi> it hath kindled. Had not Heaven prevented, they had turn'd our <hi>Paradise</hi> into a <hi>Desert,</hi> and made us the habitation of <hi>Iim,</hi> and <hi>Ohim.</hi> 'Tis lamentable that

                  <hi>Homo homini Daemon,</hi> should be a <hi>Proverb</hi> among the Professors of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and yet I fear it is as verifiable among them, as of those without the pale of visible <hi>Christianity.</hi> I doubt we have lost S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s sign of <hi>regeneration. By this we know that we are past from death, to life, that we love one another,</hi> is I fear, to few a sign of their spiritual <hi>resurrection.</hi> If our Returning Lord, shall scarse find <hi>faith</hi> on earth, where will he look for <hi>charity?</hi> It is a stranger this side the Region of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>blessedness</hi>; bitter zeal for opinions hath consum'd it. Mutual agreement and indearments was the badge of Primitive Believers, but we may be known by the contrary <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion.</hi> The union of a Sect within it self, is a pitiful <hi>charity:</hi> it's no concord of <hi>Christians,</hi> but a conspiracy against <hi>Christ</hi>; and they that love one another, for their <hi>opinionative concurrences,</hi> love for their <hi>own sakes,</hi> not their <hi>Lords:</hi> not because they have his <hi>image,</hi> but because they bear one <hi>anothers.</hi> What a stir is there for <hi>Mint, Anise,</hi> and <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min controversies,</hi> while the great practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

What eagerness in the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>disciplinarian</hi> uncertainties, when the <hi>love</hi> of God and our <hi>neighbour,</hi> those Evangelical <hi>unquestionables,</hi> want that fervent ardor? 'Tis this hath consum'd the nutriment of the great and more necessary Verities, and bred differences that are past any accommodation, but that of the <hi>last dayes</hi> decisions. The sight of that day will resolve us, and make us asham'd of our pety quarrels. Thus <hi>Opinions</hi> have rent the world asunder, and divided it almost into <hi>indivisibles.</hi> Had <hi>Heraclitus</hi> liv'd now, he had wept himself into <hi>marble,</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> would have broke his <hi>spleen.</hi> Who can speak of such fooleries without a <hi>Satyr,</hi> to see aged Infants so quarrel at <hi>put-pin,</hi> and the <hi>doating</hi> world grown child <hi>again?</hi> How fond are men of a bundle of <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> which are no better then a bagge of <hi>Cherry-stones?</hi> How do they <hi>scramble</hi> for their <hi>Nuts,</hi> and <hi>Apples,</hi> and how zealous for their pety Victories?

               </item>
               <item>(4) To be <hi>confident in Opinions</hi> is ill <hi>manners,</hi> and <hi>immodesty</hi>; and while we are peremptory in our perswasions, we accuse them all of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> that subscribe not our assertions. The <hi>Dogmatist</hi> gives the <hi>lye</hi> to all dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehenders, and proclaims his judgement fittest, to be the <hi>Intellectual Standard.</hi> This is that spirit of immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that saith unto dissenters, <hi>Stand off,</hi> I am more <hi>Orthodox then thou art:</hi> a vanity more capital then Error. He that affirms that things must needs be as he apprehends them, implies that none can be right till they submit to his <hi>opinions,</hi> and take him for their director. This is to invert the <hi>Rule,</hi> and to <hi>account</hi> a mans <hi>self better then all men.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(5) <hi>Obstinacy in Opinions</hi> holds the Dogmatist in the chains of <hi>Error,</hi> without hope of emancipation. While we are confident of all things, we are fatally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in most. He that assures himself
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58119:133"/>
he never <hi>erres,</hi> will alwayes <hi>erre</hi>; and his presumptions will render all attempts to inform him, ineffectual. We use not to seek further for what we think we are possest of; and when falshood is without suspicion imbrac't in the stead of truth, and with confidence retained: Verity will be rejected as a supposed Error, and irreconcileably be hated, because it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth what is indeed so.</item>
               <item>(6) It betrays a <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> in the Dogmatical asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. There are a set of Pedants that are born to slavery. But the generous soul preserves the liberty of his judgement, and will not pen it up in an <hi>Opinionative Dungeon</hi>; with an equal respect he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amins all things, and judgeth as imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as <hi>Rhadamanth:</hi> When as the Pedant can hear nothing but in favour of the conceits he is amorous of; and cannot <hi>see,</hi> but out of the grates of his <hi>prison.</hi> The determinations of the nobler spirit, are but <hi>temporary,</hi> and he holds them, but till better evidence repeal his former appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions. He won't defile his assent by prostituting it to every conjecture, or
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58119:134"/>
stuff his belief, with the luggage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. The modesty of his expression renders him <hi>infallible</hi>; and while he only saith he <hi>Thinks so,</hi> he cannot be deceiv'd, or ever assert a <hi>falshood.</hi> But the wise Monseur <hi>Charron</hi> hath fully discourst of this <hi>Universal liberty,</hi> and sav'd me the labour of inlarging. Upon the Review of my former considerations, I cannot quarrel with his <hi>Motto:</hi> in a sense <hi>Ie ne scay,</hi> is a justifiable <hi>Scepticism,</hi> and not mis-becoming a Candidate of <hi>wisdom.

            <head>CHAP. XXIV. AN APOLOGY FOR PHILOSOPHY.</head>
            <p>IT is the glory of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>Phrensie</hi> are her Enemies. Now to vindicate this abused <hi>excellence</hi> from the mis-reports of <hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick Ignorants,</hi> I'le subjoyn this brief <hi>Apology:</hi> Lest those unintelligent maligners take an advantage from our discourse, to depretiate and detract from what hath been alway the object of their <hi>hate,</hi> because never of their <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>capacities</hi>; Or, which is the greater mischief, lest this should discourage those enlarged souls, who aspire to the knowledge of God, and Nature, which is the most venial am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58119:135"/>
If <hi>Philosophy</hi> be <hi>uncertain,</hi> the former will confidently conclude it <hi>vain</hi>; and the later may be in danger of pronouncing the same on their pains, who seek it; if after all their labour they must reap the wind, meer opinion and conjecture.</p>
            <p>But there's a part of Philosophy, that owes no answer to the charge. The <hi>Scepticks,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, must have the qualification of an exception; and at least the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> must be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd from the endictment. Neither yet are we at so deplorable a loss, in the other parts of what we call <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>; but that we may meet with what will content ingenuity, at this distance from perfection, though all things will not compleatly satisfie strict and rigid <hi>enquiry. Philosophy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cannot immortalize us, or free us from the inseparable attendants on this state, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi> But shall we malign it, because it entitles us not to an <hi>Omniscience?</hi> Is it just to condemn the <hi>Physitian,</hi> because <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phestion</hi> dyed? Compleat knowledge
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58119:135"/>
is reserv'd to gratifie our glorified fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. We are ignorant of some things from our specifical incapacity, as <hi>men</hi>; of more from our contracted, as <hi>sinners:</hi> and 'tis no fault in the <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles,</hi> that the <hi>blind man</hi> sees not. Shall we, like sullen children, because we have not what we would; contemn what the benignity of Heaven offers us? Do what we can, we shall be imperfect in all our attainments; and shall we scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect what we may reach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some things to mortality are denyed? 'Tis madness to refuse the Largesses of divine bounty on <hi>Earth,</hi> because there is not an <hi>Heaven</hi> in them. Shall we not rejoyce at the gladsome approach of day, because it's over-cast with a cloud, and follow'd by the obscurity of night? All sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vouchsafements have their allay of a contrary; and uncertainty, in another kind, is the annex of all things this side the <hi>Sun.</hi> Even Crowns and Diadems, the most splendid parts of terrene attains; are akin to that, which <hi>to day is in the field,</hi> and <hi>to morrow is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58119:136"/>
cut down,</hi> and <hi>wither'd:</hi> He that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd them, and knew their worth, excepted them not out of the charge of <hi>Universal Vanity.</hi> And yet the Politician thinks they deserve his pains; and is not discourag'd at the inconstancy of humane affairs, and the lubricity of his subject.</p>
            <p>He that looks perfection, must seek it above the <hi>Empyreum</hi>; it is reserv'd for <hi>Glory.</hi> It's that alone, which needs not the advantage of a foyl: Defects seem as necessary to our now-happiness, as their Opposites. The most refulgent colours are the result of light and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. <hi>Venus</hi> was never the less beautiful for her Mole. And 'tis for the Majesty of Nature, like the <hi>Persian Kings,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to cover, and not alway to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate her beauties to the <hi>naked view</hi>: yea, they contract a kind of splendour from the seemingly obscuring veil; which adds to the enravishments of her transported admirers. He alone sees all things with an unshadowed compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Vision, who eminently <hi>is All:</hi> Only the God of <hi>Nature</hi> perfectly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58119:136"/>
knows her; and light without darkness is the incommunicable claim of him, that dwells in <hi>Light inaccessible.</hi> 'Tis no disparagement to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that it cannot <hi>Deifie</hi> us, or make good the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible promise of the <hi>Primitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</hi> It is that, which she owns above her, that must perfectly remake us after the Image of our Maker.</p>
            <p>And yet those raised contemplations of God and Nature, wherewith <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi> doth acquaint us; enlarge and ennoble the spirit, and infinitely advance it above an ordinary level. The soul is alway like the objects of its delight and converse. <hi>A Prince</hi> is as much above a <hi>Peasant</hi> in <hi>spirit,</hi> as <hi>condition:</hi> And man as far transcends the Beasts in large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of desire, as dignity of Nature and employment. While we only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with <hi>Earth,</hi> we are <hi>like</hi> it; that is, unlike our selves: But when engag'd in more refin'd and intellectual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments; we are somewhat more, then this narrow circumference of flesh speaks us. And, me thinks, those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Vertuoso's, who dwell in an
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58119:137"/>
higher Region then other Mortals; should make a middle species between the <hi>Platonical</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>common Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi> Even our Age in variety of glorious examples, can confute the conceit, that souls are equal: And the sole Instances of those illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heroes, <hi>Cartes, Gassendus, Galilaeo, Tycho, Harvey, More, Digby</hi>; will strike dead the opinion of the worlds decay, and conclude it, in its <hi>Prime.</hi> And upon the review of these great Sages, me-thinks, I could easily opinion; that <hi>men</hi> may differ from <hi>men,</hi> as much as <hi>Angels</hi> from <hi>unbodyed Souls</hi>: And, it may be, more can be pleaded for such a Metaphysical innovation, then can for a specifical diversity among our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamental Opposites.</hi> Such as these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a great part freed from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements of a drossie Vehicle, are imploy'd like the Spirits above; in taking a survey of Natures Riches, and beginning those <hi>Anthems</hi> to their Maker, which Eternity must consummate. This is one part of the life of Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:58119:137"/>While we indulge to the <hi>Sensitive</hi> or <hi>Plantal</hi> Life, our delights are common to us with the creatures <hi>below us:</hi> and 'tis likely, they exceed us as much as in them, as in the senses their subjects; and that's a poor happiness for man to aim at, in which Beasts are his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. But those <hi>Mercurial</hi> souls, which were only lent the Earth to shew the world their folly in admiring it; possess delights, which as it were antedate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and [though at an humble di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance] resemble the <hi>joys above.</hi> The Sun and Stars, are not the worlds <hi>Eyes,</hi> but these: The <hi>Celestial Argus</hi> cannot glory in such an universal view. These out-travel theirs, and their <hi>Monarchs</hi> beams: skipping into <hi>Vortexes</hi> beyond their Light and Influence; and with an easie twinkle of an Intellectual Eye look into the Centre, which is obscur'd from the upper Luminaries. This is somewhat like the Image of <hi>Omnipresence</hi>: And what the <hi>Hermetical Philosophy</hi> saith of <hi>God,</hi> is in a sense verifiable of the thus <hi>ennobled soul,</hi> That <hi>its Centre is every where, but it's circumference no where.</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:58119:138"/>
This is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and what <hi>Plotinus</hi> calls so, the <hi>divine life,</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more. Those that live but to the lower <hi>concupiscible,</hi> and relish no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights but <hi>sensual</hi>; it's by the favour of a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> that we call them <hi>Men.</hi> As <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith of Brutes, they have but the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, only some shews and <hi>Apish imitations</hi> of <hi>Humane</hi>; and have little more to justifie their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Rationality, then those <hi>Mimick Animals,</hi> the supposed <hi>Posterity</hi> of <hi>Cham:</hi> who, had they retain'd the priviledge of Speech, which some of the Fathers say they they own'd before the <hi>Fall</hi>; it may be they would plead their cause with them, and have laid strong claim to a Parity. Such, as these, are <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies</hi> Maligners, who computing the usefulness of all things, by what they bring to their <hi>Barns,</hi> and <hi>Treasures</hi>; stick not to pronounce the most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contemplations, needless unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble subtilties: and they might with as good reason say, that the <hi>light</hi> of their Eyes was a superfluous provision of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because it fills not their <hi>Bellies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:58119:138"/>Thus the greatest part of miserable Humanity is lost in Earth: and, if Man be an <hi>inversed Plant</hi>; these are <hi>inversed Men,</hi> who forgetting that <hi>Sursum,</hi> which Nature writ in their Foreheads, take their Roots in this sordid Element. But the <hi>Philosophical soul</hi> is an <hi>inverted Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid</hi>; Earth hath but a point of this <hi>Aethereal Cone. Aquila non captat muscas,</hi> The Royal Eagle flyes not but at noble Game; and a young <hi>Alexander</hi> will not play but with Monarchs. He that hath been cradled in Majesty, and used to Crowns and Scepters; will not leave the Throne to play with Beggars at <hi>Put-pin,</hi> or be fond of <hi>Tops</hi> and <hi>Cherry-stones:</hi> neither will a Soul, that dwells with Stars, dab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this impurer Mud; or stoop to be a Play-fellow and Copartner in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights with the Creatures, that have nought but <hi>Animal.</hi> And though it be necessitated by its relation to flesh to a Terrestrial converse; yet 'tis, like the <hi>Sun,</hi> without contaminating its Beams. For, though the body by a kind of <hi>Magnetism</hi> be drawn down to this <hi>sediment</hi> of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal dreggs; yet the thus impregnate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58119:139"/>
contracts a <hi>Verticity</hi> to objects above the <hi>Pole:</hi> And, like as in a falling Torch, though the grosser Materials hasten to their Element; yet the flame aspires, and, could it master the dulness of its load would carry it beyond the central activity of the <hi>Terraqueous Magnet.</hi> Such souls justifie <hi>Aristotles,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and in allayed sense that title, which the Stoicks give it, of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. If we say, they are not in their bodies, but their bodies in them; we have the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the divine <hi>Plato</hi> to vouch us: And by the favour of an easie simile we may affirm them to be to the body, as the light of a Candle to the gross, and faeculent snuff; which, as it is not pent up in it, so neither doth it partake of its stench and and impurity. Thus, as the Roman Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour elegantly descants, <hi>Erigimur, &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiores fieri videmur; humana despicimus, contemplantes<expan>
                     <am>

            </p>
            <p>And yet there's an higher degree, to which <hi>Philosophy</hi> sublimes us. For, as it teacheth a generous contempt of what the grovelling desires of <hi>creeping</hi> Mortals
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58119:139"/>
Idolize and dote on; so it raiseth us to love and admire an Object, that is as much above terrestrial, as <hi>Infinity</hi> can make it. If <hi>Plutarch</hi> may have credit, the observation of Natures Harmony in the <hi>celestial motions</hi> was one of the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to the belief of <hi>a God:</hi> And a greater then he affirms, that the visible things of the Creation declare him, that made them. What knowledge we have of them, we have in a sense of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. His face cannot be beheld by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Opticks, without the allay of a refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion; and Nature is one of those mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that represents him to us. And now the more we know of him, the more we love him, the more we are like him, the more we admire him. 'Tis here, that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge wonders</hi>; and there's an <hi>Admiration,</hi> that's not the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> This indeed stupidly gazeth at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted <hi>effect:</hi> But the Philosophick pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion truly admires and adores the supreme <hi>Efficient.</hi> The <hi>wonders</hi> of the Almighty are not seen, but by those that go <hi>down into the deep.</hi> The <hi>Heavens</hi> declare their <hi>Makers Glory</hi>; and <hi>Philosophy theirs,</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:58119:140"/>
which by a grateful rebound returns to its <hi>Original source.</hi> The twinkling span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, the Ornaments of the upper world; lose their beauty and magnificence; while they are but the objects of our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd senses: By them the <hi>half</hi> is not <hi>told us</hi>; and Vulgar spectators see them, but as a confused huddle of pety <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</hi> But <hi>Philosophy</hi> doth right to those <hi>immense sphears</hi>; and advantagiously represents their Glories, both in the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their <hi>proportions,</hi> and regularity of their <hi>motions.</hi> If we would see the wonders of the <hi>Globe</hi> we dwell in; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> must reare us above it. The works of God speak forth his mighty praise: A speech not understood, but by those that <hi>know them.</hi> The most Artful melody re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives but little tribute of Honour from the <hi>gazing beasts</hi>; it requires skill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>it.</hi> The most delicate musical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to us are but <hi>inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate hummings</hi>; as questionless are ours to their otherwise <hi>tuned Organs.</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Notes and Proportions, renders all <hi>Harmony</hi> unaffecting. A gay Puppet pleaseth children more, then the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58119:140"/>
exactest piece of <hi>unaffected Art:</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires some degrees of <hi>Perfection,</hi> to admire what is truly <hi>perfect</hi>; as it's said to be an advance in Oratory to relish <hi>Cicero.</hi> Indeed the unobservant Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, may have some general confus'd apprehensions of a kind of <hi>beauty,</hi> that guilds the outside frame of the Universe: But they are Natures courser <hi>wares,</hi> that lye on the <hi>stall,</hi> expos'd to the transient view of every <hi>common Eye</hi>; her choicer <hi>Riches</hi> are lock't up only for the sight of <hi>them,</hi> that will buy at the expence of <hi>sweat</hi> and <hi>Oyl.</hi> Yea, and the visible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is far otherwise apprehended by the <hi>Philosophical Inquirer,</hi> then the <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vulgar.</hi> Thus the <hi>Physitian</hi> looks with another Eye on the <hi>Medicinal hearb,</hi> then the <hi>grazing Oxe,</hi> which swoops it in with the common <hi>grass</hi>: and the Swine may see the <hi>Pearl,</hi> which yet he values but with the <hi>ordinary muck</hi>; it's otherwise pris'd by the skilful <hi>Ieweller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from this last Article, I think, I may conclude the charge, which hot-brain'd folly lays in against <hi>Philosophy</hi>; that it leads to <hi>Irreligion,</hi> frivolous and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58119:141"/>
vain. I dare say, next after the <hi>divine Word,</hi> it's one of the best friends to <hi>Piety.</hi> Neither is it any more justly accountable for the impious irregularities of some, that have payd an homage to its shrine; then <hi>Religion</hi> it self for the sinful extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances both <hi>opinionative</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> of high pretenders to it. It is a vulgar conceit, that <hi>Philosophy</hi> holds a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with <hi>Atheism</hi> it self; but most <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious:</hi> for nothing can better antidote us against it; and they may as well say, that <hi>Physitians</hi> are the only <hi>murtherers.</hi> A <hi>Philosophick Atheist,</hi> is as good sense as a <hi>Divine one</hi>: and I dare say the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Ubi tres Medici, duo Athei,</hi> is a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. I think the Original of this conceit might be; That the Students of Nature, conscious to her more <hi>cryptick</hi> ways of working, resolve many strange effects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nearer efficiency of <hi>second causes</hi>; which common Ignorance and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attribute to the Immediate causality of the <hi>first:</hi> thinking it to derogate from the Divine Power, that any thing which is above their apprehensions, should not be reckon'd above <hi>Natures</hi> activity; though
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58119:141"/>
it be but his Instrument, and works no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but as impower'd from him. Hence they violently declaim against all, that will not acknowledge a <hi>Miracle</hi> in every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effect, as setting Nature in the Throne of <hi>God</hi>; and so it's an easie step to say, they deny him. When as indeed, Nature is but the chain of second causes; and to suppose second causes without a first, is beneath the <hi>Logick</hi> of <hi>Gotham.</hi> Neither can they [who, to make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Philosophy more <hi>authentick,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Authority of an <hi>Apostle</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it <hi>vain</hi>] upon any whit more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable terms make good their charge; since this allegation stands in force but against its <hi>abuse, corrupt sophistry,</hi> or <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary impositions,</hi> which lurk'd under the mask of so serious a name: At the worst, the Text will never warrant an universal conclusion any more; then that other, where the Apostle speaks of <hi>silly women,</hi> (who yet are the most rigid ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of this) can justly blot the <hi>sex</hi> with an unexceptionable note of <hi>infamy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, what I have said here in this short <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Philosophy,</hi> is not so
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58119:142"/>
strictly verifiable of any that I know, as the <hi>Cartesian.</hi> The entertainment of which among truly ingenuous unpossest <hi>Spirits,</hi> renders an after-commendation superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impertinent. It would require a <hi>wit</hi> like its Authors, to do it right in an <hi>Encomium.</hi> The strict Rationality of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> in the main, and the <hi>critical</hi> coherence of its parts, I doubt not but will bear it down to Posterity with a <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that shall know no <hi>term,</hi> but the <hi>Universal ruines.</hi> Neither can the <hi>Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> or prejudice of the present Age, any more obstruct its motion in that <hi>supreme sphear,</hi> wherein its desert hath plac'd it; then can the howling Wolves pluck <hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> from her <hi>Orb</hi>; who regardless of their noise, securely glides through the undisturbed <hi>Aether.</hi> Censure here will disparage it self, not <hi>it.</hi> He that accuseth the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>darkness,</hi> shames his own <hi>blind eyes</hi>; not its <hi>light.</hi> The barking of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> at that <hi>Hero</hi>'s Chariot-wheels, will not sully the glory of his <hi>Triumphs.</hi> But I shall supersede this <hi>endless</hi> attempt: <hi>Sun-beams</hi> best commend themselves.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV. 5.</hi> Our affections are ingag'd by our rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Antiquity and Authority; our mistake of Antiquity; the unreasonableness of that kind of Pedantick Adoration. Hence the vanity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting impertinent quotations: the Pedantry on't is derided.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII. 2.</hi> Peripatetick Philosophy is litigious, it hath no setled constant signification of words; the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences hereof. <hi>Aristotle</hi> intended the cherishing controversies, prov'd by his own double testimony. Some of his impertinent arguings derided. Disputes retard, and are injurious to knowledge. Peripateticks are most exercised in the controversal parts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and know little of the practical and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII. 3.</hi> It gives no account of the Phaenomena. Those that are remoter it attempts not; it speaks nothing pertinent in the most ordinary; its circular, and general way of solution; it resolves all things into occult qualities. The absurdity of <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Hypothesis of the Heavens. The Galaxy is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor. The Heavens are corruptible. Comets are above the Moon. The sphear of fire derided. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> convicted of several other false assertions.</label>

It hath been the Author of no one inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It's founded on vulgarities, and therefore makes nothing known beyond them. The knowledge of Natures out-side, conferrs not to practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements: better hopes from the New Philosophy. A fifth charge against <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy, it is in many things impious, and self-contradicting; instances of both propounded. The directing all this to the design of the discourse. A caution, <hi>viz.</hi> that nothing is here intended in favour of novelty in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.

A story of a Scholar that turn'd Gipsy; and of the power of Imagination: Of one mans binding anothers thought, and a conjecture at the manner of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</label>
