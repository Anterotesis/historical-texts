            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(for whom they were provided) are dead, for the old men
must leave the storie of them, as a sad legacie to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
so we reade chap. 1. ver. 2.</p>
            <p>But the newes of this Iudgement must come first,
which invades them with such horror, as makes the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
come before they come, in the apprehension of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63015:4"/>
them: And so the newes was to them like the presence of
our Saviour to the Devills, to torment them before the
time. For God under an Alegorie of the Locust and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
worme, threatens a future destruction by the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Caldeans:</hi> A lyon like Nation shall destroy
their vines, and the drunkards must weepe for the losse
of them, ver. 5. So that now their cupps must be empty,
or they must fill them with their teares.</p>
            <p>The trees must bee undrest, and stand naked without
their barke, that so they may wither and dye, and for their
death the whole land mourn'd at the 10. verse. Nay such
scarcity did succeed, that the meate and drinke offerings
were cut off from the house of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore do
the Priests mourne, and lye all night in sackcloth, ver. 13.
And now in the second chapter, all their Iudgements are
proclaimed by the sound of a Trumpet, nay the day is so

onely seene in this, that it cannot bee seene; for a day of
darkenesse shall it be, and gloominesse, saith the Prophet.

their darknesse cannot cover them, for the darknesse is no

cannot withstand his wrath, for who can stand wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n he is
angry? There is no way to turne from these dismall and
approching evills, but by turning unto him that brings
them, and that by repentance.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Quid ad nos?</hi> what's all this to us? would God it were
not: doe not dangers threaten us also? and such dangers
that if we paralell them with these, we shall soone see they
doe exceed.</p>
            <p>God threatned to destroy them by their enemies, but
we have beene in danger to be destroyed by our friends,
for what could it be lesse then the judgement of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, that thus one Nation should rise against another,
both professing the same true religion, both the dutifull
Subjects of the same King, both having the same ground
of quarrell to maintaine Religion? will not this make rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
in the Chronicles.</p>
            <p>And truly was not the day of the Lord, the day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
judgement neere at hand, when these loving enemies
were ready to send the messages of death to one another,
in the dreadfull language of the Cannon? and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
picture out the horror of the last day, in blood, and
Fire, and vapour of smoke? And what a day of black confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
had followed, had the warre proceeded? when two
valiant Nations, united hitherto both in love, and religion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63015:5"/>
should have beene united onely in the mixture of their
blood; but in this respect I confesse the hand of the Lord is
not still stretched out, for he hath removed far from us the
Notherne armie, and our friendship (I hope) like a fracture
of a bone in our bodies, is the stronger knit, for being
broken.</p>
            <p>But though that danger's vanisht, a worse now succeeds
it, and under the feare of that we groane more then did
<hi>Iudea</hi> heere, for feare of the Chaldeans: if a forraigne foe
did threaten us, I hope we should be all united in resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>But it is not an open enemie that now doth us this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
but the serpents lye in the bosome of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and so much are we our owne enemies, that there
is great cause to feare we may destroy our selves (we read
not of Sion so) and doubtlesse it is desperate with that
state, that is ready to stabbe it selfe.</p>
            <p>For now this fortunate Island, which heretofore was
like the paradice of God, where God walk't not but in the
Coole of the day, gently dropping down our peacefull
happinesse (which found the neighbouring Nations work
enough to admire us) sees God now in the fire, punishing
us with the schorching flames of hombred divisions, our
foes being chiefely those of our owne househould. And
doe not our harts beginne to faile us for feare? and doe
we not (as Sion heere) gather blacknesse? everie man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
sensibly the feare of his owne confusion? Nay
more, may we not feare that the Sun and moone may be
darkened, and the starrs may which draw their shining?
that is, that the glorious light of the Gospell of truth may
be totally ecclip'st, when as the papist on one side, and the
(I cannot tell what to call them) on the other, both strive
to blowe out our Candle? (But Lord let death strike me
blind before I see that day) So that we may now say as

The euill is within, and why is it within? but because it
is within, within us in our sinnes, and therefore
within us by diuisions amongst our selues, which is the

            <p>'Tis a Proclamation of peace and pardon to all that will

and not evill: For now God having must'red up his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

to them to sue to him, that so he might do nothing.</p>
            <p>Strange mercy in an offended God to threaten a people
with destruction, that so he may not distroy them? Tis
reported of <hi>Tamberlayne</hi> that in all his enterprises of warr
before the furie of the sword began, that he hung out first a
white flagg, to intimate that if now they would sue for
mercie with submission, they might be secure from cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; all the sad effects of Conquest: but if upon this they
yeilded not, then he hung out a red flagg in token of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
and that he would now write the storie of their
disobedience in their blood; And if they yeeld not at that,
then he hung out a blacke flagg of defiance, to show that
now nothing was to be expected but utter ruine &amp; deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station;
which truely was a mercifull discretion, well
worth so brave a spirit. But <hi>Iuda</hi> heere had the white flagg
last, and that displayd the greater mercy; for first God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
his blacke flagge, by threatning a <hi>darke and gloomy
day</hi> of desolation, yet onely <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to awe them
to convertion: Then a red flagge, to shew the meanes of
this destruction, by fatall and bloody warre: and when all
things were thus ready to their confusion, when hope
languished, and dispaire grew bold; then he hung out a
white flagg in the offer of his grace and mercy, that if yet
they would <hi>turne</hi> unto him and repent, he would cease
to be angry, and that very wrath it selfe should consume,
that was kindled to consume them.</p>
            <p>Thus God dealt with, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he sent him word that
hee should die, onely that he might live; for <hi>Hezekiah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
<hi>wept,</hi> and <hi>prayd;</hi> and then the message of his
death, was the very death of that message; for <hi>Hezekia</hi> had
not lived so long, if he had not beene told he should die so
soone.</p>
            <p>Thus God dealt with <hi>Ninivie; Ionah</hi> must prophesie
that within fortie dayes <hi>Ninive</hi> shall be destroyed, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63015:8"/>
their repentance the Prophesie was destroyed, and not
the City: and 'tis singularly observable, that t'was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
and forecast of Gods mercy, that begot <hi>Ionah's</hi>
disobedience in flying to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> as you may see <hi>Ionah</hi> 4.
verse 2. For he knew that God being <hi>mercifull and slow
to anger,</hi> would soone <hi>repent him of the evill,</hi> and then
the message of truth from the God of truth should seeme
a lye, and put <hi>Ionah</hi> in hazard to the losse his of reputation,
if not his life: And therefore wee reade, that upon Gods
sparing the City, <hi>Ionah was very angry,</hi> Gods mercy to
them, stir'd up his wrath, to see how kindely God had
deceived them: and in that mercy he thought the credit
of a Prophet lost.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>God</hi> by this alteration inconstant to himselfe,
for his resolutions of punishment, are ever ushered with
condition; if not exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est, yet understood. The rule of
sinners is, that they shall perish, but this rule (as generall
as it is) hath an exception, for 'tis <hi>except</hi> ye repent ye shall
all likewise perish; but if they repent, they are as farre from
perishing, as God is from Injustice.</p>
            <p>For <hi>aliud est mutare voluntatem, aliud velle mutationem,</hi>
'tis one thing to alter the will, and another thing to will
an alteration, that God never doth, but this often; <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat
sententiam, non matat consilium,</hi> say the Schooles: So
that this alteration argues no change in God, since in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing hee doth what he will, and so is constant to his
will, and that will is himselfe.</p>
            <p>But they that repent not at the gratious messages of
mercy, finde a double punishment; one, for offending, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
for dispising favour; and think then (I beseech you)
what madnesse 'tis (after we have sinned) to withstand our
owne pardon, by Impenitence; and how fearefull a thing
it will then to fall into the hands of the living Lord.</p>
            <p>For if we repent not, we treasure up wrath against the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63015:9"/>
day of wrath making our selues more miserable in this
that our impenitency procures our compleater veniance:

of this, extracts this mortall Divinity; That there
are foure degrees of a sinner, corresponding to the <hi>foure
dayes</hi> of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his interment: The <hi>First</hi> is a voluntary
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63015:13"/>
                  <hi>Delectation,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> is <hi>Consent,</hi> the <hi>third</hi> is <hi>Accomplishment,</hi>
the <hi>fourth</hi> is the <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> of sinne; and he
that hath layne out these foure dayes in the grave of sin,
buried thus, is hardly raised to life againe; <hi>saith that Father.</hi>
No lesse then a miracle can call backe such a man, he must
have teares, and sights, and groanes; inward trouble and
<hi>consternation,</hi> and when these are growne to <hi>perfection,</hi> the
dead man is rais'd indeed.</p>
               <p>And though I will not conclude (as some have done)
that <hi>Lazarus</hi> thus rais'd dyed no more; yet sure I am, that
from this spirituall resurrection, no death of sinne shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap's
us; and therefore <hi>Lazarus</hi> must leave off his grave
clothes, and be unbound, forsaking all relations to the
grave, to shew that those very sinnes being dead that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, he lives by their mortality.</p>

               <p>But to prosequte the point in hand, See it figured out in
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who when he found in the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to depart, then his boyling rage ran over in the
multiplication of afflictions.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Saint Paul</hi> have a motion of the law of the spirit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the Divill urgeth his statute law in <hi>the law of his
members, to resist the law of the spirit:</hi> you see then repentance
is not without strife and conflict, it stirr's up warre in the
soule, and blessed is he who in this strife can get the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and I hope we shall thinke it a hard worke ere we have
done, it will be a signe we are the neerer to it.</p>
               <p>Much more might be added to this purpose; The <hi>Fathers</hi>
are full of it, but Ile shutt up the point with some breife
collections out of the conversion of <hi>Saint Augustine in the
eight booke of whose confessions, 1. and 2. Chap:</hi> we find his flesh
and spirit, in a dreadfull conflict; God drawing on one
side, the world, the flesh, and the Divill pulling him backe
on the other: In this Agonie of temptation, he repaires to
<hi>Simplicianus,</hi> a learned and a devout man, then to <hi>Saint
Ambrose,</hi> these were his Councell of warre in these assaults
of his soule; But after consultation with these, he was
more furiously encountered then before, (The Divill it
seemes was loath to loose this great witt,) Then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred
him selfe to privacie, and then <hi>(Saith he)</hi> what did I

               <p>Heere insued a grievous conflict, and then, (some truce
made for a time) he goes into an Orchard, ('Ile not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

aeternum?</hi> wilt thou forsake us; and must we part with thee
now for ever? And then (as the same Father tells us) the
Devill bayted his hooke with all his sinfull pleasures
past, (and truely t'was doubtfull but he might then have
swallowed some of them) but contrary, at the thought of
these, a suddaine tempest of teares shrow'rd from his eyes,
and whilst he was thus weeping and talking to God in
deepe contrition of spirit, he heard a voyce from heaven,
<hi>Tolle lege; Tolle lege;</hi> Take up and reade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then opening his booke, the first Scripture that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it selfe was that of Saint</hi> Paul Not in chambering and

               <p>And now to summe up this: Repentance is a worke of

call us, (though not thus miraculously) yet by the still

whether it be so easie a thing to repent, that it should be

                  <hi>No, no;</hi> And therefore for this, shall every man that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Now then (doubtlesse) is our time to seeke (and I pray
God we be not neere our time, not to find): The waters of

cry <hi>è profundis</hi> as <hi>Ionas</hi> did, and learne of the Waves to lift

                     </gap>ahs</hi> Arke, onely to lift our soules neerer unto Heaven.</p>
               <p>And thus you see, I have discourst out the <hi>First part</hi> of
the Text, and have considered the Authour of this great
matter in charge, <hi>Dicit Dominus, the Lord</hi> sayes it: we have
observed his loving kindnesse, in that he invites our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and so <hi>turnes</hi> to us fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us, upon our repentance, after a resolution of destruction,
shewes his mercy to us, and betrayes no inconstancy in
himselfe: and therefore we to be very ready to obey him,
in a matter that so neerely concernes our Soules.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second point</hi> was the opportunity of time: <hi>Now,</hi>
where we considered time int he flitting, and Vicissitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie

time to attend the leisure of our conversion; since God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stopt the sonne, but to declare some great misterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And therefore time being so transient, we not prodigally<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to mispend, but penitently to imploy it: where we noted
that the greatest pollicy the Devill hath to circumvent us,
is to perswade us to delay our repentance, and in that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
we saw how Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> discovered this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme
in his owne particuler, and with what resolutions
he avoyded it.</p>
               <p>We have had reasons to against this delay, and seene
how unsutable it is to the Majesty of God, to offer him a
lame, and a blinde, and a decrepit sacrifice, in a late conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and heere I shew'd, that to observe our time, was the

               <p>
                  <hi>Saint Origen</hi> held an opinion (upon what grounds I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
not) that as all thinges flow'd from God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so all things should one day slide backe againe into the
bosome of God, (the Deuills themselues not excepted)
that as at first, there was no other being but God, so at last,
all thinges should be God againe:</p>
               <p>Of this error of his I might say enough in saying nothing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63015:18"/>
yet this I will; T'were not so great a happinesse for us to
<hi>turne unto God,</hi> if the Deuils could returne from damnation;
neither neede God, nor we, take so much care for our turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
True it is that repentance is nothing else but <hi>redire ad

come as neere to God as we can, <hi>to returne</hi> to him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
from whom we <hi>turned away</hi> by impietie.</p>
               <p>Now this terme of <hi>turning,</hi> properly belongs to one
that hath lost his way; Pilgrims we are all, and a fals light

                  </gap>
we know our error; it is high time to <hi>returne,</hi> or we are
lost for ever: The <hi>Prophet</hi> that went the way he should not
met a <hi>Lyon in the way</hi> which soone devoured him: there is
a Lion in the way indeed, and to walke that way, is but
to dare our owne confusion: <hi>Balaam</hi> was madd upon this
way, when he beate his Asse for being to slow in his
Masters Destruction: an Angell must come from heauen
to beate him backe, (so resolute we are in a wronge way)
when as the very Asse (as if it had more Grace then the
Rider) chose rather to falle downe an obiect of his mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
furie, then trayterously to Convey him to his danger:</p>
               <p>The Asse preacht to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and may to us; and teach us
an unwillingnesse to paths of danger; and if by chance our
fraylties lead us thither, let us rather fall down in an hum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
acknowledgment, then post on to meete our miserie.</p>
               <p>Our life then in the <hi>Metaphor</hi> is a way, and the end of
our way is to bring us to our end; that <hi>summum bonum,</hi>
which we call happinesse; <hi>Adam</hi> went out of the way so
sonne as he was in it, and we are all to like our Father, as
soone as ever we are borne, <hi>we goe astray</hi> saith the Prophet:
The best way then will be, to have the end of our Iourney
still in consideration, with <hi>Enoch</hi> to <hi>walke with God</hi> in the
Contemplation of the place we tend to, And truely if
we could doe so, the <hi>Prophet</hi> might be stow his Counsell
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63015:19"/>
where he pleased, we were well enough with out it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>wretched men that we are are!</hi> this is not our case we
are in a way that leades to destruction, yet cofidently we
travayle on, till some twitch of conscience begin to startle
us, some close and thundring passage of a Sermon pull in
the reynes, and we stand to consider whether we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
some threatned woe in a Prophet shewes us the pit,
and we, upon the brinke of it; and then, what have wee to
doe, but that, which <hi>Lott's</hi> wife might not doe? <hi>Looke
backe</hi> first, and then returne.</p>
               <p>And indeed the very nature of Conversion will have it
so; for it implyes both a turning from, and a turning to;
a turning from sinne, and a turning unto God.</p>
               <p>And truly if we would but seriously consider the ugly

he lived the life of Angells by abstinence: nay he is

my Angell, (that is my messenger) to prepare my way
before me; and what way did he prepare him? amongst
others, A way in the wildernesse, for there he fasted, and
there Christ fasted after him:</p>
               <p>Eating came in with the creation of beastes, and so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
a thing, it seemes God thought it, that the first law did
conduce to fasting; and the first sinne was the breach of
that Law; and we suffer for it to this howre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> when he had eaten was cloathed with the skinns
of beasts (as the livery of a beastly appetite,) but <hi>Iohn

conduced to the necessity of his being:</p>

God by his Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> derides their formality, who
drest themselves in dissembled lookes that so they might
appeare to fast.</p>
               <p>Is this your fast (saith God) to hange downe your head
like bulrush? to put on sackcloth and ashes? To hang
downe your head like a bulrush and yet still remaine a
stiffe necked people? to clothe the body in sackcloth
when as the soule is naked, not one ragg of righteousnesse
upon it? To sprinkle our selves with ashes, when as our
lust burnes in a full fire? so farre are we by such a fast
from vanquishing the Devill, that it makes us like him: To
abstaine from meat and not from Iniquity, is but to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

nequitia,</hi> He eates nothing and yet is full of wickednesse;
Better to be stuft with meat then sinne, but the true fast
will have neither.</p>
               <p>But yet there is bread which we may eate when we fast,
&amp; fast the better for eating it: <hi>David</hi> calls it <hi>panem lachrima

God the better, when in the strength of penitence, we
shall doe a miracle, which the Devill ne're thought to
tempt Christ with, <hi>turne</hi> our very <hi>teares</hi> into bread.</p>
               <p>And why doth <hi>David</hi> call his <hi>teares</hi> his <hi>meate?</hi> They
were more likely to be his drinke; but onely to tell us, that
with these, the soule is no lesse nourisht, then the body is

then by <hi>Lamentation.</hi>

without these showrs, we live best, when we are

               <p>But the Day was not sufficient for <hi>Davids</hi> sorrow, the
night begets sinnes as well as the day; and therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
laid to rest, opens his eyes to <hi>weepe,</hi> so wakefull in his
penitence, that <hi>every night</hi> he <hi>washt his bed;</hi> and well he did
to <hi>wash</hi> that: <hi>David</hi> had a sin of the bed, &amp; therfore now (as
with that rare Emplaister, which apply'd to the weapon,
cures the wound) he <hi>washed his bed,</hi> to cleanse himselfe.</p>

               <p>In <hi>David,</hi> we reade of <hi>the waters above the heavens,</hi> and
one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> (I remember) interprets those waters
to be the teares of penitents; (how litterall I dispute not)
but by application, 'tis very proper to the point: for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
(like that wondred Engine of <hi>Archimedes)</hi> makes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

she powred out of her <hi>boxe,</hi> but more drop't from her

               <p>I have read of a Student in <hi>Paris,</hi> who comming to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
was so nothing else but sorrow at the consideration
of his sinnes; that griefe locking up his tongue, his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63015:23"/>
could read in it nothing else but Miracle, for the black
Caracters all vanisht, and left the paper unstained, to
Emblemise that penitence is a second innocence.</p>
               <p>Be this true, or false; sure I am, the melting soule, which
hath a floud of teares for every transgression, washeth off
all her staynes, and appeares before God (to whom alone
she is bound to Confesse) pure and spotlesse.</p>
               <p>And truly 'tis a good degree of our <hi>turning</hi> unto God,
that when we rise out of the mire of sin, we begin to see
our owne foulenesse, and then wash our selves with our
<hi>teares,</hi> And if <hi>Christ</hi> (who never laught,) wept thrise, and
yet had no sinne of his owne, how many teares need we,
who often laugh, and yet do nothing else but sinne?</p>
               <p>If one we love die, passion presently leapes out at our
eyes, and we <hi>weepe</hi> much: Alas, our soules by sinne die
dayly, and do we not take it so heavily as to weepe? Can
we loose a neerer freind? To have sinnes past number,
and so few teares, as perhaps, will not make a number?
