            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

great fruit. Afterwards he goes out to <hi>Philippi</hi> (the cheife City in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and on the Sabbath day, the people were gathered together: a company of women were resorted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and there he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them: As indeed holy communion is never without a blessing; they met together on a good day, the Sabbath, and for a good end they were met together; Now <hi>Paul</hi> tooke the advantage of their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, he cast his net, and he catcheth one with her family, namely <hi>Lydia.</hi> The Gospell was a sweete savour of salvation to her.</p>

If they live to yeares of discretion, then be of good comfort, he is Gods Child more then mine, I have dedicate him to God, and to Christ, he was baptized in the name of Christ, Christ will care for him as well, as for me.

no further (as prophane spirits doe not) then the water, and the elements, we can have no comfort by these things: but wee should consider Gods blessed institution, and ordinance, to strengthen our faith.

So it is the nature of faith that knits us to Christ, the same spirit of loue knits us to others, and reacheth forth fruit to all wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Triall of faith by love</note>As wee desire to haue evidence of the soundnes of our faith, let us see what spirit of loue we haue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially loue to these three things,<note n="1" place="margin">To Christ.</note> loue to Christ to whom wee are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and loue to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shew kindnesse to Christ, he is in heauen:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1090:54"/>
but his ministers,<note n="2" place="margin">To his members.</note> and his poore are upon the earth when wee can buy oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to poure on Christs feete his poore members, and his Ministers; and loue to the word of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note n="3" place="margin">To his Word.</note> they are the three issues of a gracious beleeuing heart, and where they are not, there is no faith at all.</p>
               <p>I beseech you let us imitate this blessed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. You see here the name of <hi>Lydia,</hi> is precious in the Church: the name of <hi>Lydia,</hi> (as it is sayd of <hi>Iosiah</hi>) it is as a boxe of oyntment powred out: the name of <hi>Lydia</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee named in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1090:55"/>
Church, but there is a sweete sauour with it. As soone as shee beleeued; the Holy Ghost, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD blowing upon the garden of her heart, where the spice of Grace was sowed, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp a sweete sent of faith and of bountie and liberalitie in the cause of Christ.</p>
               <p>Let not this bee in vaine to us: but euery one of us labour to bee like <hi>Lydia</hi>: you see what loadestone drew PAVL heere to goe unto her house: shee had Faith, and shee expressed it in loue.</p>
               <p>Let us labour to haue
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1090:55"/>
faith, and to expresse it in loue to GOD vnto CHRIST, to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and word, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that haue his stampe on them, and let us boldly owne the cause of CHRIST: let us not regard the censures of vaine men that say thus and thus. Faith and loue forget danger, it is bold. Shee forgot all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that shee was in by countenancing <hi>Paul</hi> and such men.</p>
               <p>Let us labour for faith and loue and wee shall not say this and that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a Lion in the way,</hi> but wee shall goe on boldly vntill wee doe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1090:56"/>
receiue the end of our faith and loue, the salvation of our soules.</p>
