            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu deſire to know what I have to ſay to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that are made by a late Writer againſt the Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in what he ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Submiſſion that was made to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great by <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High-Prieſt of the Jews, and againſt the uſe that is made of it by ſome that have written in Defence of the Oath of Allegiance to Their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Againſt the Story it ſelf; the Objector ſaith, <hi>It is very ſuſpitious,</hi> on two accounts: Firſt, That <hi>no Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Joſephus</hi> and his Followers, <hi>mention any ſuch thing. Secondly,</hi> He ſets forth the <hi>difficulty of reconciling it with Chronology:</hi> To which he adds, That there are <hi>ſeveral Inconſiſtences</hi> in the Story it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Objector ſaith, That <hi>if the Story were true, yet it would not prove the Point for which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61625:5"/>To conſider what he bringeth under theſe Heads, we ſhall begin with what he ſaith of the <hi>ſuſpiciouſneſs</hi> of the Story. To prove this charge, his firſt Argument is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>no Author beſides</hi> Joſephus, and thoſe that had it from him, <hi>mentions or takes notice of any ſuch thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument lyes againſt all that <hi>Joſephus</hi> has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Affairs, within the Hiſtorical time of the Heathens, except what he takes out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or out of the Books of the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> for we have no other Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory. If there had been any other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian that had written the things of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time, and ſaid nothing of this Story of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> nor of <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> himſelf, (for his living then is queſtioned by our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector,) then indeed there had been great occaſion to ſay, that their ſilence had made this Story ſuſpicious. But when there is no <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writer that pretends to write a Hiſtory of thoſe Times, in this caſe to argue againſt the Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> only from the ſilence of <hi>Heathen</hi> Hiſtorians; this ſeems to be very unjuſt and unreaſonable. Who knows not that the <hi>Heathens</hi> generally contemned and hated the <hi>Jews,</hi> as being not only Revilers of their Gods, but Enemies to all the reſt of Mankind? Hence it came to paſs, that thoſe Writers he mentions, have ſcarce ever named the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Hiſtories. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> deſign'd nothing more than to give us a Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews.</hi> How then ſhould his Credit be impeacht by the ſilence of <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers? Eſpecially in a Matter which they would be ſure to conceal, for that very reaſon that he had to mention it, namely, becauſe it made for the honour of his Nation.</p>
            <p>It was the ſame reaſon, that they had to paſs by all the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Should we therefore grant the Story of theſe to be <hi>ſuſpicious,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Writers of thoſe times <hi>take no notice of any ſuch thing?</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61625:5"/>
We ought to take heed of ſuch Arguments as an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary may make uſe of againſt the Goſpel it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But if it were true that our Objector here ſays, that thoſe <hi>Heathens tell us the clean contrary</hi> to that which we have from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> there might be ſomething in this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, tho not in the ſilence of <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers. But perhaps the Objector might mean, that the Account of thoſe Hiſtorians is contrary to that of the Author, againſt whom he writes. For this Author, as he cites him, (I know not how truly,) ſaith, That from <hi>Tyre Alexander came directly to</hi> Jeruſalem. That indeed doth not agree with the account that is given us by the Hiſtorians he mentions. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth not ſay this: He tells us, That <hi>Alexander</hi> having beſieg'd <hi>Tyre</hi> ſeven months, and then taken it, came forward to <hi>Gaza,</hi> and took it after a Siege of two months; and then haſtened to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſubmitted to him, as alſo did the Neighbouring Cities. This conſiſts very well with what we read in thoſe Hiſtorians. For tho they agree, that from <hi>Tyre</hi> he went directly to <hi>Gaza,</hi> yet after the taking of that City, they do not ſay that he went preſently into <hi>Egypt;</hi> He might ſtay long enough to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Fifty miles diſtant, and receive the Submiſſion of that and the Neighbouring Cities, before he went into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> I ſay he might well do this, according to <hi>Diodor</hi>'s Account, who ſaith, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Diodor. Sic. Edit.</hi> 1559. p. 566. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> That <hi>having ſettled things about Gaza,</hi> afterwards he ſent away <hi>Amyntas</hi> with ten Ships for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and then went with his Army into <hi>Egypt.</hi> This being not contrary, but very conſiſtent with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that we have from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> there is no farther cauſe of <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> on this head.</p>
            <p>The next is the <hi>difficulty of reconciling it with Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology;</hi> Nay, this is not all the Objector tells us, for he ſaith afterwards, there are <hi>difficulties that have perplext all</hi>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61625:6"/>
               <hi>Chronologers:</hi> And at laſt, <note n="*" place="margin">p. 11.</note> There are <hi>inſuperable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> in this Story. Where are they? For I confeſs I do not ſee any difficulty. He tells us, in the Ages of the perſons, <hi>pag. 9. Mighty Ages, not in the leaſt mentioned by any Hiſtorian:</hi> Namely, <hi>that</hi> Sanballat <hi>lived to above 145, and</hi> Jaddus <hi>to above 124, years of age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doth <hi>Joſephus ſay this?</hi> Not in words, nothing like it. But it muſt come to this, if the Objector reckon true. And if he miſreckons for <hi>Joſephus,</hi> he deals as ill with the Scripture, only he doth not charge it with <hi>ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on this account. But according to the Scripture, as he underſtands it, <hi>Ezra</hi> muſt have lived to a much greater Age than either of thoſe before mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Objector <note n="*" place="margin">p. 17.</note> will have <hi>Ezra</hi> born about ſix years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, and to have ſeen the firſt Temple yet ſtanding; and 59 Years after this, <hi>viz.</hi> in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to have return'd from the Captivity. So that then <hi>Ezra</hi> was 65 years of Age by his reckoning: From thence to the ſeventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> are ſeventy nine years; ſo that then <hi>Ezra</hi> muſt have been One hundred and fourty four years of age, according to our Objectors account. And yet it is certain, that in that year of <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> made a Journey from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ezr. 7.</note>; and it is as certain, that he lived 13 years after that, namely till the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and then, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Objector, he muſt have been 157 years of age; and yet, as old as he was, that very year <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 12. 36, 37.</note> he led the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion up Stairs and down Stairs about the Wall of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> He might live many Years after this, as we may judge by his ſtrength of Body in that Exerciſe. But if he dyed that year, being 157 years old, as he muſt be by the Objectors reckoning; he that finds no difficulty in this, or takes no notice of it, for fear of reflecting upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ought not to call that Story in <hi>Joſephus Suſpitious,</hi>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61625:6"/>
becauſe of the <hi>difficulty of reconciling it with Chronology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in vain do Men talk of <hi>reconciling</hi> Differences, where there are none but of their own making. They that take <hi>Ezra</hi> to have been born before the Captivity, judge ſo for this <note n="*" place="margin">p. 8.</note> reaſon; becauſe it is ſaid, That he was the Son of <hi>Seraia</hi> the High-Prieſt, that was kill'd before the Captivity: But in like manner, <hi>Seraia</hi> is there made <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. 1. &amp;c.</note> the <hi>17th.</hi> from <hi>Aaron,</hi> that lived near a thouſand years before. The meaning of theſe words is, that <hi>Seraia</hi> was deſcended from <hi>Aaron,</hi> (and ſo <hi>Ezra</hi> was from <hi>Seraia,</hi>) not immediatly, but with others between, that are not mentioned. And ſo <hi>Johanan</hi> the High-Prieſt is called <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 12. 23.</note> the Son of <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> who indeed was his Grand-Father, and his Father was <note n="*" place="margin">12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> that is not there mentioned. This is a common way of ſhortning Pedegrees, which if the Objector had conſidered, he would not have run himſelf into that difficulty of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Age, which, tho he takes no notice of it, is much greater than thoſe are of which he complains.</p>
            <p>And yet theſe that he complains of are Difficulties of his own making, and proceed only from an eager deſire to find faults in that Story in <hi>Joſephus.</hi> If this had not blinded his Eyes, he might have ſeen, that, admitting that Story to be true, yet there was no neceſſity of making either <hi>Jaddus</hi> or <hi>Sanballat</hi> live to ſo great an Age.</p>
            <p>Firſt for <hi>Jaddus,</hi> who (as he ſaith) muſt have been 124 years old at the taking of <hi>Tyre,</hi> the Objector proves his Age by theſe ſteps.</p>
            <p>Firſt he takes it for granted, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> was High-Prieſt at the time when the Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was written; but he takes this only as <note n="*" place="margin">p. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>probable,</hi> and therefore by his own confeſſion, all can be but probable that he builds on it.</p>
            <p>Next for the time when that Book was written, it muſt have been before <hi>Nehemiah</hi> dyed; that is certain. But when did he dye? The Objector tells us from <hi>Briet,</hi>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61625:7"/>
that he died the laſt year of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> who reigned 41 Years. But to what end doth he tell us this? For he himſelf could not believe it, as appears by his Words. For ſaith he, <hi>I think the leaſt we can allow for the time of</hi> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah's<note place="margin">p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>living after he ended his Book, is 30 Years; and it is very probable it was much more.</hi> Well, ſay but 30 Years, and account that upward from the time of his death ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Briet;</hi> and then <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Writing of his Book will be in the <hi>11th.</hi> Year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that is, his Book was written 9 Years before any of thoſe things happened that are written in it. Now this I think the Objector could not mean, and therefore he doth but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe us with that idle Quotation.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, as if he had prov'd ſomething by this, he infers from it (I know not how) that <hi>Jaddus</hi> was High-Prieſt the laſt Year of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Grant him this, and he has no more to ask. For then, <hi>Jaddus</hi> being 30 years old, <hi>to this add</hi> 94 (which is the time from the death of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> till <hi>Alexander</hi>'s coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,) and then</hi> Jaddus, <hi>at that time</hi> Joſephus <hi>faſtens this Story, muſt have been 124 years old.</hi> Q. E. D.</p>
            <p>But tho I do not ſee which way he proves this, I ſee very clear Reaſons to the contrary, which I think are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was not written, till after the death of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus: Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Jaddus</hi> was not High-Prieſt at the Death of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> nor probably born then, nor long after, till the end of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Nothus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not write in any part of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>'s Reign, but either in or after the time of <hi>Darius</hi> his immediate Succeſſor: This is certain; For in his Book he mentions <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 12. 22.</note> the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Perſian.</hi> I think none will ſay he did this by the Spirit of Prophecy. But to

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61625:7"/>
come nearer the point, I inſiſt upon it, that he writ <hi>after</hi> the Reign of <hi>Darius.</hi> So the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words ſhew, that he writ when that Reign was expired; for there it is ſaid, That the Heads of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and alſo the Prieſts, <hi>were recorded,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>over</hi> or <hi>throughout</hi> the Reign of <hi>Darius.</hi> It appears, that the words are ſo to be underſtood, by what followeth in the next Verſe, where it is ſaid, that the Heads of the <hi>Levites</hi> were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> till the days of <hi>Johanan,</hi> that is, till he came to be High-Prieſt. I take <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s meaning in thoſe two <note n="*" place="margin">v. 22, 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Verſes, to be thus in ſhort: Having given account <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 12. 1, 7.</note> of the Heads of the Prieſts that were in the time of <hi>Jeſhua</hi> the High-Prieſt, and afterwards <note n="‖" place="margin">v. 12. 21.</note> of them that were in the time of his Son <hi>Joiakim;</hi> having alſo given account <note n="‖" place="margin">v. 8, 9. &amp; 24, 25, 26.</note> of the Heads of the <hi>Levites</hi> that were in <hi>Joiakim</hi>'s time; he thought ſome account would be expected of them that were in the days of the following High-Prieſts: Therefore he inſerted theſe <note n="*" place="margin">v. 22, 23.</note> two Verſes, wherein he tells us, That as for the <hi>Levites</hi> that were in the days of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhib, Joiada, Johanan,</hi> and <hi>Jaddua,</hi> the Heads of thoſe <hi>Levites,</hi> and alſo the Prieſts, all that were in the Reign of <hi>Darius Nothus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> were recorded in the Book of <hi>Chronicles;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Prieſts were not recorded, but only the Heads of the <hi>Levites;</hi> and thoſe, only during the High-Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> and <hi>Joiada</hi> who were then dead, but not of <hi>Johanan,</hi> who it ſeems was then newly come to be High-Prieſt, when this Book was written. As for <hi>Jaddua,</hi> he is mentioned, both <note n="‖" place="margin">v. 22.</note> here, and before <note n="‖" place="margin">v. 10.</note> in this Chapter, not as being High-Prieſt then, (how could he in his Fathers <hi>days?)</hi> but only as being then living, and Heir apparent of the High-Prieſthood; ſo the words are underſtood by the moſt Learned <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſer. Ann. A. M.</hi> 3589.</note> Primate, who was as well a great Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger, as a good Textuary.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, that if this Interpretation be true, <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61625:8"/>
muſt have lived to a very great Age. No doubt he did ſo; for he was Cup-bearer to King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in the <hi>20th.</hi> year of his Reign. We may ſuppoſe <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to have been then about 25 years of Age; after that, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſee the High Prieſthood paſs from Father to Son for four Generations: And he ſaw a fifth coming in view, namely <hi>Jaddua,</hi> whom we ſuppoſe to have been then about 30 years old. All this might very well be, if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> were born 470 years before Chriſt, and writ in the year 347 before Chriſt. Then he was about 104 years old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our reckoning, which is not ſo incredible an Age, as that of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s being 157 years old when he went in that clambering Proceſſion according to the account of our Objector.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For <hi>Jaddus</hi> his being High-Prieſt at the time of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Death, which our Objector makes the ground of his Calculation, I have ſhewn he has no ground for his affirming of this, and that might ſuffice for an Anſwer. But beſides, that it is groundleſs, it is alſo highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. For if this had been true, there muſt have been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dying no leſs than 5 High Prieſts in one direct Line, from Father to Son, in the ſpace of two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> His Grand-Fathers Grand-Father <hi>Joiakim,</hi> was High-Prieſt within the time while <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Neh.</hi> 12. 28.</note> was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; that is certain. But his Government began in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> It appears, that <hi>Joiakim</hi> dyed the ſame year; for his Son <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 1.</note> was High Prieſt at the time when the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was building. And he was High Prieſt <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 28.</note> in the <hi>32d.</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſhib</hi> continued much longer, as I underſtand it; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he dyed that very year, there muſt be ſome time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for his Son <hi>Joiada</hi> after him, and then for his Grand-Child <hi>Johanan;</hi> for both theſe were High-Prieſts, as has

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61625:8"/>
been already ſhewn. But after the <hi>32d.</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> there were but eight years more before the end of his Reign. We have ſcarce known a Change of five Popes in the time that this Objector allows for ſo many to come and go in a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Succeſſion: And then the Age of <hi>Jaddus</hi> being conſidered, (of which our Objector ſaith when he came to be High-Prieſt, <hi>The leaſt we can allow is 30 years, and it is very probable it was much more:</hi>) If it was but 30 years, then the Age of <hi>Joiakim</hi> when he dyed, muſt have been at leaſt 90 years; his Son <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> at leaſt 62; his Son <hi>Joiada</hi> near 70; his Son <hi>Johanan</hi> near 60; and each of theſe, as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector ſaith, <hi>it is very probable much more;</hi> and four of theſe muſt have been born when their Fathers were but 20 years old. If any one of theſe things did not happen, then our Objectors ground-work fails; but that all things happen'd thus, I think there is no probability.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, there is nothing improbable in that Account which I offer'd before: <hi>Jaddus</hi> might have been born any year before his Father <hi>Johanan</hi> came to be High-Prieſt, (at which time I conceive with very good ground the Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was written;) and yet <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> might have been mention'd as he is in that Book. But I ſuppoſed him born 30 years before, in compliance with the moſt Learned Primate, who <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſer. Annal.</hi> A. M. 3602</note> reckons that <hi>Jaddus</hi> might be about 83 years old at his Death. So he judged by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Scripture together with <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Antiquities. I attribute very much to his judgment in theſe Matters: But not to reſt upon that only, I have alſo conſider'd the years of the High-Prieſts above-mentioned. They are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Chronicon Paſchale;</hi> but I think better in <hi>Georgius Syncellus;</hi> who tho he doth not quote his Author, yet is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably preſumed to have tranſcribed them from <hi>Julius Africanus;</hi> an Author that lived little more than 100 years after <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and living in the ſame Country,

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61625:9"/>
might have his Information from them that knew as well as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> himſelf. In placing the years of theſe Prieſts, I begin from the Death of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> who is ſaid <note n="‖" place="margin">Joſ. Ant. x<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. ending.</note> to have died about the ſame time with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great: Reckoning from thence upwards, the Death of <hi>Joiakim</hi> will fall in the <hi>20th.</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeth with the Account of his Death that I have given from Scripture. And indeed there is nothing ſaid of any of theſe Prieſts, either in the Holy Scripture, or in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> but what very well conſiſts with the Account of their years that is given us in this Catalogue. That you may the better judge of this, I have given you a ſhort view of their Years, compared with thoſe of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as they are in <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s <hi>Canon.</hi>

            <p>But with his leave, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> knew what he writ, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61625:10"/>
by his fixing the time of this Story: There was no date of time better known among the <hi>Iews,</hi> than that of the building of their Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> nor among the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> than that of the building of the Temple of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim.</hi> They remembred nothing more, than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Temples: It was a thing in every ones mouth, <hi>Our Fathers worſhip'd in this Mount,</hi> ſaid <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> iv. 20.</note> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria</hi> to our Saviour. And no doubt, if they had any Records or any Hiſtories, the times of theſe things were chiefly remembred in them: But it was within 200 years of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> his time, that the Temple at Mount <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Iohannes Hyrcanus.</hi> It happen'd at a memorable time, being ſoon after the Death of <hi>Antiochus Pius,</hi> (which was in the year before Chriſt 130<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) then that Temple was deſtroyed, ſaith <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">p. 10.</note> 200 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the building of it. How long that Temple ſtood, and when it was deſtroyed, none knew better than the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> themſelves. And as they were Enemies to the <hi>Iews,</hi> ſo they muſt be particularly to that Author, who provokes them as oft as he mentions them. How then durſt he have put it in their power to diſprove him, as they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would, if this had not been true? I take it therefore for certain, by their account as well as his, (accounting 200 years upward from the deſtruction,) that their Temple was built in the year before Chriſt 430, which falls in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and not as the Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or would have it, in the time of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſaith the Objector to this? He <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioſ. Ant.</hi> xiii. 17.</note> tells us from <hi>David Ganz, That the Iewiſh Chronologers do affirm, That the Temple on Mount</hi> Garizim <hi>was built long before the times of</hi> Alexander; <hi>and that all the time of</hi> Alexander, Simeon Juſtus <hi>was High-Prieſt; which</hi> Simeon <hi>was the Grandſon of</hi> Iaddus. The Objector tells us afterwards, <hi>That</hi> Calviſius, <hi>and not only he, but all Chronologers, find</hi> Ioſephus'<hi>s Errors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61625:11"/>
               <hi>concerning thoſe times ſo many and groſs, as would make any Man that acted upon Principles of Sincerity, very fearful to uſe an Example taken out of him in Matters of Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe the Objector <hi>acts upon Principles of Sincerity</hi> in other things; notwithſtanding that he ſeems to forget them in his Quotations. In theſe I muſt needs ſay, he gives great ſuſpicion of the contrary, by omitting thoſe words that make againſt him in his own Authors: Of which I ſhall give a clear proof by and by, and I doubt not you will find the like in other places of his Book.</p>
            <p>But whereas he bringeth all Chronologers on his ſide againſt <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> he ſhould have excepted all the Beſt, both Ancient and Modern; and among them particularly our excellent Primate, who followeth <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in every part of this Story. I allow him indeed the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who are as much the Enemies of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> as he is himſelf; for they have the like quarrel againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he breaks all their Meaſures.</p>
            <p>But yet the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Chronologers will not help the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector in his Cauſe. They will not make <hi>Iaddus</hi> live to 124 years of Age, and <hi>Sanballat</hi> to 145. They are ſo far from that, that they ſcarce allow either of them any Age. For they make <note n="d" place="margin">

               <hi>But beſides theſe difficulties in Chronology,</hi> which I have proved to be none; the Objector ſaith, <hi>there are ſeveral Inconſiſtencies in the ſtory it ſelf, noted by</hi> Salian.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Ieſuit</hi> was an Enemy to the very name of <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> for <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s ſake. But without engaging in the quarrel between them, I take the <hi>Inconſiſtencies</hi> as they ly here before me.</p>
            <div type="argument">
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The firſt is, that <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who followed <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he came againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> thought to have plunder'd the City.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> He might have <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> in his Army, of thoſe whom he had taken at <hi>Iſſus,</hi> many of whom turn'd over to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſerved him, as he <note n="i" place="margin">Arrian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de exp. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex. ii.</hi>
                  </note> told <hi>Darius</hi> in his Epiſtle. But I confeſs I know not why theſe <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> ſhould be named together with the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> as if theſe two Nations ſhould be eager for the ſpoils of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> above all the reſt that were in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army. There muſt be ſome particular reaſon for this eagerneſs in theſe two Nations above others: And that probably either for

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61625:12"/>
their own eſpecial gain, or for ſome National ſpite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Iews.</hi> And indeed for the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> the firſt of theſe Reaſons is plain, becauſe they had the chief Sea-Ports, and the Trade of that part of the World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tyrus</hi> ſaid of old <note n="k" place="margin">Ezek. 26. 2.</note> againſt <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the time of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. Aha! ſhe is broken,——ſhe is turned unto me: I ſhall be repleniſht, when ſhe is laid waſte.</hi> The ſame hope they might have now again. But this being a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon peculiar to the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> no other Nation could be ſo intent upon the ſpoils of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but only for ſpite, and that was not to be imagined in the <hi>Chaldaeans;</hi> who after ſo long acquaintance as they had with the <hi>Iews</hi> in their Captivity, were kinder to them than any other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and have continued ſo ever ſince. But theſe here ſpoken of muſt be Enemies of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and who ſhould they be of all the Nations that <hi>Alexander</hi> had in his Army? Of all the Nations in the World none ſo likely as the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans.</hi> And of them <hi>Ioſephus</hi> told us lately before, there were 8000 ſent by <hi>Sanballat,</hi> that were now in the Army. But when <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſpeaks of theſe People in anger, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly calleth them <hi>Chuthaei;</hi> which is ſo near the word <hi>Chaldaei,</hi> that I cannot forbear offering this as an Emendation of the Text: For <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The next thing might very well have been ſpared; for there is no Inconſiſtency in it: That the <hi>Iews</hi> when they had found favour with <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhould ask the like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for their Brethren that were in <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Media.</hi> Thoſe Countreys, tho <hi>Alexander</hi> had not yet conquered, yet it could not be doubted, that they would be ſhortly in his hands.

               <p>But the fault is, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhould put it in <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi>'s Mouth to ask <hi>Alexander,</hi> wherefore he ſhould adore another, that was himſelf ador'd by all.

               <p>The things in theſe two laſt Anſwers are ſo plain, that I cannot think how it came to paſs that the Objector did

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61625:13"/>
not ſee them: unleſs it be that <hi>Joſephus</hi> had offended him ſo much, that he was too greedy of Objections againſt him, and did not regard what might be ſaid in his vindication.</p>
               <p>In this angry humour he runs on in the next page. And there he calls in <hi>Calviſius</hi> to be his ſecond.</p>
               <p>He could not have found a fitter Man to take his part. For he had a quarrel of his own againſt <hi>Joſephus,</hi> for writing ſuch things as would not conſiſt with his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology. But that was <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s fault, that had crampt that part of his Chronology, by beginning <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 70 Weeks in <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> his time. In conſequence of that, he muſt make <hi>Nehemia</hi>'s <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be <hi>Mnemon</hi> inſtead of <hi>Longimanus:</hi> And the <hi>Darius</hi> that he mentions muſt not be <hi>Nothus,</hi> but <hi>Codomannns:</hi> And if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> liv'd till <hi>Codomannus</hi> his time, ſo might his <hi>Sanballat</hi> as well: And then why ſhould not the Prieſt that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> depriv'd, be <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> the ſame that is mention'd in <hi>Joſephus?</hi> All this both <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calviſius</hi> are for; and our Objector if he pleas'd might have quoted them for theſe things. But then his Arithmetick would have been of no uſe: For <hi>Sanballat</hi>'s 145 years would have been but fourſcore, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> might have been a young Man, and <hi>Jaddus</hi> of middle Age; and ſo there had been an end of all his <hi>Inſuperable difficulties.</hi> Thoſe two learned Men were ſo far from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any difficulty in the Story of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells it, that they take it for unqueſtionable Hiſtory. But why then doth the Objector bring in <hi>Calviſius,</hi> as if he were of his ſide in this Argument? He will ſay he doth not, here is no mention of <hi>Jaddus.</hi> Very well, but here are hard Cenſures on <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which being brought in in this place, tho' they do not belong to it, may ſerve as well as if they did: Though <hi>Calviſius</hi> intended them for things wherein <hi>Joſephus</hi> differ'd from him, yet the Reader may apply them to that <hi>Story</hi> wherein he agreed with him.</p>

               <p>He was aware how much their judgment would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before his, where he differs from them.

It was plainly their Judgment, that <hi>both</hi> theſe were not neceſſary, but that <hi>either</hi> of the two might ſuffice, for the ſetling of an Authority. But <hi>Alexander</hi> had one of the two, that is, the general ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the People; whereupon, without the other, they were his <hi>Subjects</hi> according to the Convocation-Book, as much as they had been before the Subjects of <hi>Darius,</hi> though he was yet living.</p>
               <p>But this will not go down with the Objector. He ſaith, <hi>For the other part of the Story, of</hi> Jaddus <hi>ſubmitting to</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>while</hi> Darius <hi>was living, the Convocation take no notice of it.</hi> They do not name <hi>Jaddus</hi> indeed.

                  </hi> ALEXANDER? Thoſe words ſeem to be intended chiefly of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> at leaſt they take him in among the Prieſts and People. But then ſaith the Objector, <hi>it doth not any where appear, That they</hi> (the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,) <hi>thought</hi> Darius <hi>was then living.</hi> No: Doth it appear, that they thought what they writ? Their Book ſaith, <hi>He by flight eſcaped, when his Army was diſcomfited.</hi> And tho they do not ſay, he was living when <hi>Alexander</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet no Learned Man can be ignorant,

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61625:15"/>
That he lived two years after this. But the Convocation were not concern'd whether he were living or no, any longer than while the People of God were under his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Changes of Governments over the <hi>Jews,</hi> was the thing which the Convocation were to conſider. And now upon this Change of Government, they tell us, That the <hi>Jews, both Priests and People,</hi> being <hi>Subjects of Alexander,</hi> (whether <hi>Darius</hi> was living or dead,) they were <hi>bound to pray for the long life and proſperity both of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>and his Empire, as they had been bound before to pray for the long life and proſperity of the other Kings and their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>while they lived under their Subjection.</hi>
                  </hi> Therefore when they were no longer in ſubjection to <hi>Darius,</hi> it was all one to them whether he were living or dead.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, the Anſwer is plain to his Queſtion, concerning <hi>Submiſſion to a Poſſeſſor of Power, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an Oath to a lawful King, who is alive, and inſists upon his right,</hi> whether it be <hi>argued from the Story or from the Convocation-Book?</hi> It may be from either or both, for ought that he hath ſaid to the contrary: The Story hath been clear'd from all ſuſpicion of Falſhood, That he hath endeavour'd to faſten upon it. The Convocation-Book hath ſpoken for it ſelf, and hath much more to ſay; but this little is enough to ſhew our Objector, that he might better have let it alone than brought it into this Controverſy.</p>
               <p>After all he comes to this, that <hi>grant the Story true, it is not to the purpoſe it is urg'd for.</hi> How ſo? Becauſe this of <hi>Jaddus</hi> is <hi>a ſingular and exempt Caſe.</hi> What he did was by <hi>eſpecial Revelation from God;</hi> who, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, <hi>appear'd to him in a Dream, and warn'd him to ſubmit to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, <hi>and to meet him in that ſolemn manner as he did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61625:15"/>He is aware, that there is a prejudice againſt this; namely, That <hi>Prophecy was then departed from the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church.</hi> This is certainly true: <hi>Malachi</hi> having given them <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> iv. 3.</note> warning, that the next Prophet that ſhould come, would be <hi>Elias.</hi> But the Objector ſhifts off this, by telling us, That <hi>when there were no more Prophets, yet ſtill there was an inferior degree of Prophecy, which laſted for a long time, as the</hi> Bath Kol, <hi>and probably ſome other way, as by Dreams,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To make way for theſe, he tells us, <hi>it was always the Cuſtom in the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church, in caſes of great Extremity, to have recourſe to God for ſome expreſs Revelation what they ſhould do.</hi> This is more than the <hi>Jews</hi> knew, or they did not think of it, at that time <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Macc.</hi> ix. 27.</note> when <hi>Judas Maccabaeus</hi> being ſlain, <hi>there was a great affliction in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the like whereof was not ſince the time that a Prophet was not ſeen among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For then they took meer humane Counſels, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any <hi>expreſs Revelation.</hi> That in ſuch Diſtreſſes, they uſed Faſting and Prayer, was to ſeek God for Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as hath been uſed in all Ages. And thus <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, the <hi>Jews</hi> did at this time when <hi>Alexander</hi> was coming againſt them. They faſted and prayed for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. Thus far there is nothing ſtrange in the Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>But then mark what follows. <hi>The next night God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to Jaddus, and order'd him ſo to do;</hi> that is, <hi>ſo</hi> as he told us before, namely, <hi>to ſubmit to</hi> Alexander, <hi>and to meet him as he did.</hi> Here he would make us believe we have a Wolf by the Ears, for whether we admit this, or deny it, we are in his danger either way. If we deny this part of the Story, why may not the Objector as well deny all the reſt? But if we admit it, then it is <hi>wholly beſide the purpoſe:</hi> For ſaith he (with his uſual civility)

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61625:16"/>
                  <hi>if theſe Gentlemen will ſhew us any expreſs Revelation for what they do, as</hi> Jaddus <hi>had, then they ſay ſomething: But 'till they can ſhew that, this Example, if true, will do them no ſervice.</hi> He hath oblig'd me ſo much with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, that I cannot chuſe but admit, that here was <hi>an expreſs Revelation.</hi> But I cannot grant him his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, till I ſee how it follows from the Premiſes. In order to this, he ſhould have told us what Revelation it was that <hi>Jaddus</hi> had, and what uſe it was for: And then have ſhew'd that we have the like occaſion, before he had required us to ſhew the like Revelation. But ſince he is ſo ſhort in his account of theſe things, I muſt be the longer in conſidering them more particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take every thing as the Objector would have it, namely, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> had a Revelation from God, that he ſhould SUBMIT to <hi>Alexander,</hi> though <hi>Darius</hi> was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and notwithſtanding his Oath by which, as <hi>Jaddus</hi> formerly thought, he was bound to the contrary. If <hi>Jaddus</hi> was <hi>then</hi> in the right concerning the Obligation of his Oath to <hi>Darius,</hi> the thing that he was <hi>now</hi> put upon was the horrible ſin of Rebellion, aggravated with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and whatſoever elſe the Objector thinks fit to load his Brethren with: only this of <hi>Jaddus</hi> he tells us was a <hi>ſingular and exempt Caſe,</hi> for he was put upon it by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. But even in this caſe, there would have been ſomething elſe neceſſary to engage the people to go along with him in this ſubmiſſion. For ſince now they were to look for no Prophet more, till the coming of <hi>Elias,</hi> as <hi>Malachi</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> iv. 3.</note> told them, but were left under a ſtrict charge to <hi>remember the Law of Moſes with the Statutes and Judgments;</hi> this change of their Allegiance from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> being as the Objector will have it, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Perjury, than which nothing can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61625:16"/>
to the Law of God; how could <hi>Jaddus</hi> hope to bring them to this, by telling them only that he had a Revelation from God? He could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, without making himſelf as great a Prophet as thoſe were by whom thoſe Precepts were given. And then he muſt prove it, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſigns as thoſe former Prophets did: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo far from being bound to believe him, that they were to look upon him as a falſe Prophet, and as ſuch to put him to death. We ſee how ready the <hi>Jews</hi> were to Execute this upon our Saviour, as oft as he ſeem'd to teach any thing contrary to their Law, though he did prove himſelf a Prophet by the working of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth not tell us, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> did any Miracle; (if he had, we ought not to have believed him;) and yet the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church at that time, was ſo far from ſtoning <hi>Jaddus</hi> for pretending this Revelation, that they all join'd with him in ſubmitting to <hi>Alexander,</hi> even while <hi>Darius</hi> was living. And therefore we may be ſure, that this Revelation was not againſt their <hi>common and ſtanding Rules,</hi> as our Objector would have it.</p>
               <p>It was ſo very agreeable to them, that if the Matter of the Revelation were as he reports it, there could be no reaſon given why <hi>Jaddus</hi> ſhould have a Revelation, but this, that God ſaw it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the correcting of that former Error of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> by which, if he had run on it, and ſtood out pertinaciouſly againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> (as ſome do againſt Their preſent <hi>Majeſties,</hi>) it had been a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61625:17"/>
way to have deſtroyed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. Bleſſed be God, that hath preſerv'd our Church, by letting us ſee, that our Submiſſion is ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules of our Religion and to the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Church in all Ages, that there is no need of proving it to be our Duty that way which the Objector requires, namely, by <hi>an expreſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if there was nothing of Submiſſion to <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Revelation that was made to <hi>Jaddus?</hi> Then thoſe words upon which all his Argument moves, namely, the words TO SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIT, were thruſt in by the Objector. If he did this by miſtake, he may eaſily correct it, by reading the place in <hi>Joſephus.</hi> There he will find nothing of any Revelation that <hi>Iaddus</hi> had <hi>to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and to meet</hi> Alexander: There was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it. For thus far he had determin'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, before the Prayer and Faſting, upon which he had this Revelation. Theſe are <hi>Ioſephus</hi> his words; Alexander <hi>having taken</hi> Gaza, <hi>made haſte to go up to</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>The High Prieſt</hi> Jaddus <hi>upon the hearing of this, was in an Agony of fear; being at his wits end to think how he ſhould MEET the</hi> Macedons; <hi>the King being angry at his Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence formerly.</hi> It ſeems he was reſolved to have no more anger on that account, but to make his Peace by an humble Submiſſion: And therefore he was in care how to <hi>meet the</hi> Macedons, ſaith <hi>Ioſephus.</hi> Who thus goes on, <hi>having therefore order'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make Supplications, and himſelf with them offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61625:17"/>
                  <hi>Sacrifice to God, he beſought him to protect the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to deliver them from the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> It is plain, that theſe were Prayers for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and not for a Revelation, as the Objector is pleas'd to ſay. But was there not a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after this? Yes, it follows, That <hi>after the Sacrifice, when he was gone to bed, in his ſleep, God bad him be of good courage; and let them Crown the City, and open their Gates; and for their</hi> MEET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, (which they had reſolved before, but were in care how to do it, ſo as might move the Kings favour or compaſſion,) <hi>Let them go,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>the reſt in White Garments, but he with the Prieſts in thoſe Veſtments which the Law hath preſcrib'd, and be confident they ſhall ſuffer no evil, for that God will provide for them:</hi> Here is every word of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; in which, God that beſt knew what a Dream he had ſent to <hi>Alexander</hi> before his coming out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> now orders <hi>Iaddus</hi> to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into that Dreſs in which <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſeen him in that Dream. This was a likely way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſtrike an awe into the Conqueror, and to make him reverence the Prieſt of that God by whoſe Conduct he had gotten thoſe Victories. And it had that effect, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> did acknowledge this was he that firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him over into <hi>Aſia. I ſaw him then</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>in the ſame habit:—I never ſaw any other in ſuch a Robe: And now ſeeing him, and remembring my Dream, I am ſatisfyed it was God that ſent me on this Expedition,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61625:18"/>It appears that <hi>Jaddus</hi> had a direction from God in what manner he ſhould meet <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo as not only to pacify his wrath, but to recommend himſelf into his favour. For the <hi>Command</hi> of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which is not in <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> there was no need of that, for the People had determined to ſubmit, being not able to reſiſt. But if it had been as the Objector imagins, yet it would do him no Service, as I have ſufficiently ſhewn: And therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that he hath ſaid, this Story of <hi>Iaddus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us a very good unqueſtionable inſtance of the judgment of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church in his Age; that it is lawful to ſubmit to a Prince that comes in by Conqueſt, and that it is our Duty to pay Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him as his Subjects, when he is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the general conſent of the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an Oath to a former King who is yet living.</p>
               <p>One thing the Objector hath to ſay againſt this, which I think was put out of it's place, and ought to come in here for a Reſerve. In caſe it appear'd that the Story of <hi>Iaddus</hi> was not only true, but to our purpoſe, then it had been time for him to tell us, that all this is nothing to him and his party. They care not what <hi>Iaddus</hi> did, they know what they will do. He ſaith this in effect, in the following <note n="*" place="margin">p. 11.</note> words, <hi>The Practice of the High Prieſt in that corrupt State of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church, will not ſignify much to us, and no more in this, than in their other Immoralities.</hi> This

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61625:18"/>
was frankly ſaid, but I think not very ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſpeaks as if <hi>Iaddus</hi> were ſingle in this Act of Submiſſion; when it is evident, that the whole Church of God at that time, went along with him: And the <hi>Iews generally, both Prieſts and People were Subjects to</hi> Alexander, in the words of the Convocation Book.</p>
               <p>He tells us of <hi>that corrupt ſtate of the Jewiſh Church</hi> in <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s time: This is news. All Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers ſpeak of thoſe times as the beſt that ever were under the ſecond Temple. The Church was much reform'd by thoſe excellent Men that flouriſhed in the Age next before; namely by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> the Governour, <hi>Ezra</hi> Prieſt and Scribe, and <hi>Malachi</hi> the laſt of the Prophets. At this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, beſide <hi>Iaddus</hi> himſelf, whom the Jews <note n="*" place="margin">

point. So here we have a Teſt, to try who are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who are not honeſt Men.</p>
               <p>Yet I dare be bold to ſay, he never found <hi>Iad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> charged with any Immorality whatſoever. Nor we have not found him in any Error but this, that he thought himſelf bound to <hi>Darius</hi> while he was living. This was an Error indeed, if he meant as the Words ſtrictly ſignifie. For an Oath of Allegiance to any King, can bind one no longer than while he is that King's Subject. It doth not bind, ſaith the <note n="*" place="margin">p. 19. 20, 21.</note> Objector, in caſe of Ceſſion or Submiſſion. Nor, ſay other Divines, in Caſe of Conqueſt: And <hi>Iaddus,</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubject to <hi>Alexander,</hi> was plainly of this later Opinion, by which he explain'd or corrected what he ſaid formerly.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Iaddus</hi> being a Man of that high place in the Church, of ſo clear a Repute ever ſince in all Ages; what ſhould make the Objector and his Party (which I hope is not great) make ſo light of ſuch an eminent and venerable Example? He tells us <hi>Iaddus becoming a Subject to</hi> Alexander <hi>contrary to his Oath, is no more a Pattern for us to follow, than</hi> Eliaſhib'<hi>s building a Chamber in the Temple for</hi> Tobia, <hi>is an Argument for us to act contrary to the expreſs Laws of God.</hi> This is home to the purpoſe, and being ſaid at the firſt, might have ſav'd him and me all this trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61625:19"/>Now all the Queſtion is, whether <hi>Jaddus</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to his Oath to <hi>Darius,</hi> in becoming a Subject to <hi>Alexander.</hi> To judge aright of this Queſtion, we muſt conſider what Circumſtances he was in at the taking of this Oath, and how they were chang'd at the time of his ſubmitting to <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He was a Subject to <hi>Darius</hi> before the taking of this Oath: and by it he gave no other right to <hi>Darius,</hi> than what he had before, he gave him only a greater aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The right that <hi>Darius</hi> had over the <hi>Iews,</hi> was no other than what deſcended to him from <hi>Cyrus:</hi> And that was by his Conqueſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that were their former Lords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That right of Conqueſt being deſcended to this <hi>Darius,</hi> was won from him by <hi>Alexander,</hi> that had overcome him in War, and ſo made himſelf Lord of that Country, and ſo <hi>Alexander</hi> now had the ſame right to their Allegiance which <hi>Darius</hi> had before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His right to their Allegiance being ceaſed, their Oath to him was of no Obligation: But they were as free, and had as much reaſon to pay their Allegiance now to <hi>Alexander,</hi> as they had formerly to <hi>Darius</hi> or <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61625:20"/>This ſeems to be the ground that <hi>Iaddus</hi> went upon. And if it was, he had reaſon to think he did not contrary to his Oath. For he kept it to the laſt, till there was no ſuch King as he had ſworn to: And then, having no Revelation to Guide him, he yielded to the Providence of God, in ſubmitting to him that had won the Kingdom from <hi>Darius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Objector having ſaid, becauſe he will have it ſo, that this Submiſſion of <hi>Iaddus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Oath; goes on, and compares it with that Fact of <hi>Elaſhib,</hi> which the Scripture it ſelf ſaith, was contrary to expreſs Laws of God. And therefore he would have us take heed of following <hi>Iaddus</hi> for our Pattern; as if we were as well aſſur'd of what he ſaith, as we are of what we read in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>He values his own Opinion too much, that would impoſe it upon others at this rate.</p>
               <p>And yet he that will not ſubmit to it, falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the heavy Cenſures of his Book. They muſt be <hi>Deſerters of Principles,</hi> and guilty of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> and <hi>Perjury;</hi> and why not? Should we think to come off better than <hi>Iaddus</hi> who is condemned already, and with him all the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church of that Age. But all other Churches of God have done like them, as oft as they have come into their Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61625:20"/>I do not except that which he fills his Book with namely the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church in <hi>Iehoiada</hi>'s time; for they were in much different Circumſtances, as I doubt not you will ſhew. He cannot pretend to ſhew, that any other Church hath done otherwiſe then that under <hi>Iaddus,</hi> which he hath condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. He will ſhortly ſee, that they are all againſt him in this Cauſe; and then we are to expect the like Judgment upon all Churches, <hi>Iewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> unleſs the Objector think better, and change his mind, or at leaſt forbear ſuch unjuſt and uncharitable Cenſures, which I wiſh he may both for his own and for the Churches ſake.</p>
               <p>This I hope will be the Fruit of your Anſwer to his Poſtſcript, which is earneſtly expected by</p>
