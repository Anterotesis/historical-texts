            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with our Lord Forbes, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the towne: they strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and said, that they were the Kings
loyall subjects, and had not offended in
the least thing, but that the souldiers in
the Kings Fort had done them wrong:
but had the King sealed to our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
we should have found enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, that we might truly have
made an onset upon the towne: wee
were so neere the towne with our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
that we could heare them plainly
call our Parliament rogues, Parliament-dogs,
and Puritan-Dogs: so you may
very well conceive what subjects they
are. On the third and fourth day we
re-fetcht aboard our souldiers, and the
sixth day wee set saile from Gallaway to
go to Limbrick, and on the ninth day
we arrived in Limbrick river, and on
the two and twentieth day we laid siege
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61023:4"/>
to the Knights of the Elmes Castle, that
is to say in English, the Knights of the
valley; the which Castle we plaid upon
two dayes and two nights with two
Demi-Canons: so the second day we
entred the Castle, slaying all we found
alive: but when we came to burie them
we found but eighteene or twentie, the
rest made an escape and got into the
woods: there came a great army of the
Irish within sight of the Castle; there
marched out betwixt four and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and when they began to approach,
the Irish men fled, and durst not stand:
We tooke in this Castle a thousand bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels
of Wheat, three or foure thousand
vveight of Butter, besides Barley, Malt
and salt Beefe: this Castle vve took on
the three and tvvcntieth of September

The Lord Generall hath sent Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

secure themselves from the Cavaliers,

come without distinction of persons:
for the Cavaliers endeavour to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
London, and plunder by the way,
hoping that the Lord Generall cannot
remove fast enough to prevent them,
but his Excellency hath sent ten Peeces
of Ordnance and two thousand men to
stop their passage at Coventry, that they

Northampton and Warwick are already
