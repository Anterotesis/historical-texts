         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

shame and confusion of their enemies were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
preserved and so delivered over to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The <hi>Romans</hi> had their <hi>Salii</hi> Priests, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any victory went dancing through the City,
singing their <hi>Hymes,</hi> and <hi>Paeans</hi> to <hi>Mars,</hi> and the
rest of the favourable Gods. And the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
sometimes in <hi>Verses,</hi> sometimes by <hi>Sculpture,</hi> used
to set forth their famous Battels and Victories,

their Gods, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

from the Lord <hi>Jehovah's</hi> dealing with his owne
people, who alwayes directeth them thus to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
his noble acts, and their great deliverances.
Thus <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> sang unto the Lord,
when he <hi>triumphed gloriously over Pharaoh and all

               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. The scope of the Chapter.</note>
And this whole Chapter is nothing but a
<hi>Triumphant song,</hi> setting forth in an elegant and
lofty verse, the great Victory which <hi>Barak</hi> and
<hi>Deborah</hi> and a small army with them had gotten,
(the Lord marching before them) against King
<hi>Jabin</hi> and his Generall <hi>Sisera,</hi>

            <p>In which song, First, all <hi>prayse</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> is given
to <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Lord of hoasts the Prince who
lead them, by whose strength alone the victory
was obtained. <hi>Prayse yee the Lord for the avenging
of Israel. I will sing unto the Lord. Lord when thou

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62121:4"/>
to the <hi>due praises</hi> of their generall <hi>Barak,</hi> and his
assistant <hi>Deborah,</hi> yea the severall <hi>Regiments</hi> and
Companies both of Horse and Foot doe receive
the praise and reward of their courage and valour.
And not only so, but the Song proceeds to <hi>Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize</hi>
and brand with reproach, and marke out
for punishment all such companies, as had played
either the Traitours or the Cowards, or were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

and remembers them all, and lets them know
he had great thoughts of heart about it, and in

               <note place="margin">Division.</note>
there are these two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, the</hi> Author <hi>of the doome or sentence,</hi> the
Angell of the Lord. Curse yee Meroz said the Angell
of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Sentence</hi> given against them:
<hi>Curse ye Meroz,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein likewise consider these two things.</p>
            <p>First, What their <hi>fault</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What their <hi>punishment</hi> was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their</hi> Fault <hi>yee have in these words,</hi> They came
not out to the helpe of the Lord, to the helpe of the
Lord against the mighty.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Punishment</hi> was a <hi>curse,</hi> and a <hi>bitter</hi> one:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62121:5"/>
               <hi>Curse ye Meroz, Curse yee bitterly,</hi> or (as the word
signifies) in cursing, curse <hi>the inhabitants of Meroz,</hi>
continue to curse them, vehemently curse them,
never leave cursing them.</p>
            <p>I shall briefly interpret the words,<note place="margin">And interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
(with Gods assistance) to some profitable
instructions.</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Angell of the Lord.</hi> I finde great
difference among Interpreters, who this <hi>Angell</hi>
of the Lord should be. Some thinke it was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi>
the Prophetesse who penned this Song. Some
thinke <hi>Barak</hi> the Generall was likewise at this
time inspired by the Holy Ghost. Some thinke it
was the Angell that led them, <hi>Michael</hi> their Prince
who went out with them. Some thinke the Angell
of the Lord, signifies all that have <hi>Divine inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but all agree in the intent of it, namely, that
the Author is alledged, that all might know that
this curse came not from the <hi>private Spirit</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah
or Barak</hi> (as <hi>Sauls</hi> once did,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 24.</note> when he cursed
every one that shall taste any meate untill the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
that he might be avenged on his enemies)
but was pronounced by the direction of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and so consequently, they who are thus cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are cursed indeed, <hi>The Angell of the Lord,</hi> that
is <hi>divine Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Meroz.</hi> Who was <hi>Meroz,</hi> and what people
were they? I could never learne whether <hi>Meroz</hi>
were a <hi>City</hi> or a <hi>Province,</hi> few or many, rich or
poore, weake or strong; in this all agree that they
were <hi>Jewes;</hi> the <hi>Canaanites</hi> should not have been
cursed for not joyning with <hi>Israel,</hi> in their warres.
All likewise agree, that they dwelt neere Mount

               <hi>Tabor</hi> and the River <hi>Kison,</hi> the place where this
battle was fought, and so consequently neere the
danger: and in all probability were called by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi>
and <hi>Barak</hi> to come and assist them. Which
is likewise judged to be the cause, why they
had a heavier doome than any other. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide to have such ill neighbours to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
when they are in distresse.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Curse</hi> them. The word signifies, <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

verbo, malefacere re,</hi> to speake evill of
them, to revile them, to reproach them and wish
mischiefe to them, to doe any evill against them,
to execute in deed, what they would wish in
words. What the particular Curse was, or what
the event of it was, no man can determine; this
I finde, which is most probable, It was ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observed among the Iewes, that whatsoever
was justly cursed grew <hi>unfruitfull</hi> presently. If a
<hi>Woman</hi> were cursed shee proved <hi>barren.</hi> If the
<hi>Earth</hi> were cursed, it brought forth <hi>Briars</hi> and
<hi>Thornes,</hi> no profitable Seed or Plants would <hi>grow</hi>
there. If <hi>Trees</hi> were cursed they <hi>withered</hi> away.
If Gods curse fell upon <hi>Houses</hi> or <hi>Cities,</hi> the <hi>Walles</hi>
and <hi>Foundations</hi> would fall downe. Gods curse
alwayes wasted that which it fell. So in
all likelyhood this curse is the cause wee never
read more of them. If they were a <hi>Province,</hi>
their Land proved a <hi>desolate Wildernesse.</hi> If a <hi>City</hi>
it was <hi>destroyed,</hi> or grew <hi>unpeopled:</hi> this bitter
curse like the <hi>Water of Jelousie</hi> made an end of
them.<note place="margin">Numb. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>4. They came not to the helpe of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Mighty,</hi> Who are these <hi>Mighty?</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62121:6"/>
Without all question by the mighty are litterally
meant King <hi>Iabin,</hi> and his <hi>Generall Sisera,</hi> because
these were those potent enemies, against whom
the battell was fought. But in Gods intent (this
being a propheticall Song) the mighty are all, of
what <hi>ranke</hi> or <hi>quality</hi> soever, who are eminent in
<hi>wisdome, strength, authority</hi> or <hi>riches,</hi> and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
an <hi>ill cause</hi> against the Lord or against his
Church.</p>
            <p>Lastly, they came not out to the helpe of the
<hi>Lord</hi> by the helpe of the <hi>Lord</hi> you will easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that in this particular, the helpe of <hi>Deborah</hi>
and <hi>Barak</hi> are meant. They came not to joyne with
the Tribes of <hi>Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthaly,</hi> and that small
handfull of <hi>Israelites</hi> who by Gods direction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke
this battell against the great Captaine <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sera.</hi>
Because they joyned not their strength with
Gods people, they are judged not to help the <hi>Lord.</hi>
For (as I shall shew anon) the <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>People</hi>
are so <hi>conjoyned,</hi> that their friends are his friends,
and their enemies are his enemies, and whosoever
helpes not <hi>them,</hi> are interpreted to <hi>refuse</hi> to
<hi>assist</hi> the <hi>Lord himselfe.</hi> I know nothing else
in the Text, that hath the least shew of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>Were this Text to bee handled at large
in many Sermons, such Observations as these
could not briefly be passed over: as first,</p>
            <p>That although Gods people must (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
<hi>blesse, blesse</hi> I say, and not <hi>curse.</hi> Curses are edged
tooles, dangerous to be medled with, yet there
may fall out such cases, that Gods blessed servants
must come downe from Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62121:7"/>
Mount of <hi>blessing;</hi> and go up on Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi>
the Mount of <hi>Cursing;</hi> and there <hi>curse,</hi> and <hi>curse
bitterly. Curse yee Meroz said the Angell of the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That although it bee true that the
curse causelesse shall not come, yet when Gods
people according to Gods direction, <hi>(clave non er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante)</hi>
do curse, their curse is like the <hi>flying Roule</hi>
which we read of,<note place="margin">Zech. 5. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>it consumes the house it lights up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the timber thereof, and the stones thereof.</hi> It is
like the Wolfes foot, of which they say, that no
herbe upon which it hath once trod will grow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the mighty do frequently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Lord: it is no new thing to finde the
Mighty in strength, the Mighty in authority, the
Mighty in wealth, the Mighty in parts, in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in Counsell, to engage all against the Lord,
his Church, and Cause. The Lambes followers
and servants, are often the poore and off-scouring
of the World,<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 18.</note> when Kings, and Captaines, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and Wisemen, being drunke with the
Wine of the Whores fornications, proceed to
make warre with the Lambe, and to give all their
strength unto the Beast, till the Words of God
shall be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That when the mighty of the World
do oppose the <hi>Lord,</hi> Gods <hi>meanest servants</hi> must
not be afraid to oppose the <hi>Mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And fifthly, That whosoever come out to joyn
their strength, and to give assistance to the Lords
<hi>people,</hi> the Lord doth interpret them all to give
helpe and assistance to <hi>himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62121:7"/>
But because my Discourse upon this Text, in this
place must be hedg'd into one Sermon, I may not let
it out into such a spacious field. I shall passe by all
these and many other seasonable truths, which in this
Text are obvious to all your eyes, and betake my selfe
to cleare one lesson only; which you will quickly see
to be the maine scope and intent, not only of this <hi>verse,</hi>
but of the greatest part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and most sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
for these times, for this Assembly and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The maine Doctrine propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
               <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>All people are cursed or blessed according as they do or do
not joyne their strength and give their best assistance to
the Lords people against their enemies.</q>
            <p>I beseech you see how cleare this is,<note place="margin">Explained.</note> not only in
this <hi>verse</hi> (God laid nothing else to <hi>Meroz</hi> charge but
only this, they came not out to help the Lord against
the mighty) but in other passages of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">And proved v. 9.</note> 
               <hi>My
heart is toward the Governors of Israel, that offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
willingly among the people. Hallelujah, Praise the
Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> They are not so much as named without an
<hi>Euge.</hi> The <hi>Princes of Issachar</hi> are <hi>blessed</hi> for being
with <hi>Barak. Zebulun and Nepthali were a people that jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parded
their lives to the death in the high places of the field.</hi>
These are blessed also. <hi>Blessed above women was Iael the
wife of Heber the Kenite.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 18.</note> What made <hi>Jael</hi> such a <hi>blessed
woman?</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 24.</note> Even this, <hi>she put her hand to the naile, and her
right hand to the workmans hammer, and with the hammer
she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced
and smitten through his temples.</hi> On the other side see
the <hi>displeasure</hi> that there is against the Tribes who came
not out to helpe in this <hi>expedition. Ruben</hi> had busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his own, his flocks were to be attended. <hi>Gilead</hi>
could plead that the River <hi>Jordan</hi> divided him, from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62121:8"/>
               <hi>Barak</hi> and his company:<note place="margin">Men are cursed or blessed.</note> 
               <hi>Asher</hi> had his own breaches
to make up, and the Sea coasts to looke to. A man
might think, these were faire <hi>excuses.</hi> But God had
<hi>great thoughts of heart against them all.</hi> And wo to him,
or them, against whom <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>great thoughts.</hi> The
whole Chapter runs in this straine, they are cryed
up, they are honoured and <hi>blessed:</hi> not only the heart
of <hi>Gods people,</hi> but the soule of God himselfe (as I
may say) tooke pleasure in them, who appeared on
the Churches side; his <hi>displeasure, indignation, wrath</hi>
and <hi>curse</hi> did rise against all, who came not to
the helpe.</p>
            <p>This is most plaine in many other Scriptures. I
shall cull out but three among three hundred, <hi>Jer. 48.
10.</hi> That whole Chapter containes the <hi>doome of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 16.</note>
Gods curse was now to be executed upon <hi>Moab,</hi>
and you may read of <hi>Moab,</hi> that the Lord once sent
to him when his people were in distresse.<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Let my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casts
divell with thee Moab, be thou a shelter to them in the
time of a storme.</hi> But <hi>Moab was too proud</hi> to listen to
Gods counsell. <hi>Moab</hi> was alwaies an ill enemy to
<hi>Israel.</hi> Now God comes to reckon with him for it.
Now the spoyler shall come upon all his Cities. And
to <hi>them</hi> who were to <hi>execute</hi> this vengeance of God
against them, marke what a <hi>charge</hi> is given in the
tenth verse, <hi>Cursed is he that doth the worke of the Lord
negligently,</hi> or fraudulently, or deceitfully, as the word
signifies; Now what was the worke which was
to be done? the next words will tell you, <hi>Cursed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that withholds his hand from shedding of bloud:</hi>
the strangest reason of a curse that ever was read of, if
ever a man might have pleaded (with <hi>Peter</hi> when the
voice said unto him. <hi>Arise Peter kill and eate) not so
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62121:8"/>
Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">as they help or help not the Church of God.</note> I have not beene accustomed to this, here
were roome for such a <hi>plea,</hi> when his worke was to
go and <hi>embrew</hi> his hands in the <hi>bloud of men,</hi> to spill
and <hi>powre</hi> out the <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>women</hi> and <hi>children, like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in every street. But he is a <hi>cursed man that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
his hand from this,</hi> or that shall do it <hi>fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that is, if he do it as <hi>Saul</hi> did against the <hi>Amalekites,</hi>
kill some and save some, if he go not through with
the work: he is a cursed man, when this is to be done
upon <hi>Moab</hi> the <hi>enemy of Gods-Church.</hi> So that <hi>whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
imployment</hi> men are put to, they are cursed men,
that take not part with God in his worke. Another
place you shall find in <hi>Psal. 137. v.</hi> 8, 9. The daughter
of <hi>Babylon</hi> was there to be destroyed, observe now
the epithete which God gives to the <hi>executioners</hi> of his
<hi>wrath</hi> against <hi>Babylon. Blessed is the man that rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thee, as thou hast served us. Blessed is the man that
makes Babylon drinke the same cup, which Babylon had
made Gods people to drinke.</hi> Now he that reades the
booke of the Lamentations, may finde how <hi>Babylon</hi>
had used the Church of God, they had <hi>broken</hi> their
<hi>bones</hi> as a <hi>Lion</hi> breakes the bones of a Lamb, brought
their <hi>necks</hi> under <hi>persecution,</hi> made their <hi>skin blacke
like an oven, hang'd up their Princes by the hand,</hi> and
which is most of all cruell, had <hi>dashed their children
against the stones.</hi> Now saith the Spirit of God, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is the man, that thus rewards Babylon, yea, blessed is
the man that takes their little ones and dashes them against
the stones.</hi> What <hi>Souldiers heart</hi> would not start at
this, not only when he is in <hi>hot bloud</hi> to cut downe
<hi>armed</hi> enemies in the <hi>field,</hi> but afterward <hi>deliberately</hi>
to come into a subdued <hi>City,</hi> and take the <hi>little ones</hi>
upon the <hi>speares point,</hi> to take them by the heeles and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62121:9"/>
beat out their <hi>braines against the walles,</hi> what inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and barbarousnesse would this be thought? Yet
if this worke be to revenge Gods Church against <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
he is a <hi>blessed man that takes and dashes the little ones
against the stones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is one Text of Scripture (if no other
were to be found in the whole booke of God) which
is a <hi>sufficient</hi> proofe <hi>that all are blessed or cursed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they doe or doe not helpe the Church of God in
their need:</hi> and that you shall finde, <hi>Matth. 25. 33. &amp;c.</hi>
The summe whereof in a few words is this, At the
latter end of that Chapter is a description of the <hi>day
of judgement,</hi> and of the <hi>manner</hi> of Christs <hi>proceeding
at that day.</hi> First, that when <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> shall come
in the glory of his Father, he will divide all the <hi>godly</hi>
to the <hi>right hand,</hi> and all the <hi>wicked</hi> to the <hi>left hand,</hi>
as the Shepheard divides the Sheep from the
Goates. Secondly, he pronounces all on his right
hand <hi>blessed,</hi> all upon the left hand <hi>cursed: Come yee
blessed, goe ye cursed.</hi> Here are all the <hi>blessed,</hi> and <hi>there
are</hi> all the <hi>cursed.</hi> Marke now what is assigned as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reason and evidence why the one sort are <hi>blessed,</hi>
and the other <hi>cursed.</hi> It is most plaine in the Scripture,
that at <hi>that day</hi> the Lord will call people to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for <hi>all they have done in their whole course, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or evill:</hi> but in <hi>this place, Christ</hi> gathers all that
shall be opened and come to receive blessing or curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reward or punishment to this one head, according
as they <hi>did or did not helpe and succour his Church and
people in their time of need.</hi> To, the one side, <hi>Come yee
blessed, receive the Kingdome prepared for you,</hi> for you vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
my <hi>Church</hi> when it was <hi>sicke,</hi> you gave <hi>meale</hi> to
my <hi>Church</hi> when it was <hi>hungry,</hi> you gave <hi>my people
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62121:9"/>
drinke</hi> when they were <hi>thirsty,</hi> you tooke <hi>them</hi> in when
they were <hi>strangers, you cloathed them when they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
you came to them when they were in prison: Inasmuch
as you have done it unto these, even unto one of the least of
these my brethren, you have done it unto me.</hi> On the other
side, <hi>Go ye cursed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Why are they cursed? <hi>I was hungry and
ye gave me no meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink,
I was a stranger and ye took me not in, naked and you cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me not, sick and in prison and ye visited me not: Verily
I say unto you, inasmuch as you did it not unto the least of
of one of these, ye did it not to me.</hi> As if the Lord at that
great day did take notice of nothing, but what the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of all people hath been to or against his Church
and children. What greater evidence can there be in
the world, that men are <hi>blessed</hi> or <hi>cursed,</hi> than this? that
they either <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>do not help</hi> the <hi>Church of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will yet be clearer if we consider the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
First, as it stands in relation to <hi>God.</hi> Secondly, as <hi>we</hi>
stand in relation to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">First from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as the Church stands in relation to God:
when I speake <hi>of God</hi> in relation to the Church, or
the Church to God; you must alwayes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>God in Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Being made one with him in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Emanuel. God is in Christ reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the world unto himselfe.</hi> And thus the Churches
relation to God, gives us two excellent grounds of this
doctrine.</p>
            <p>First, the Church and the meanest member of it is
<hi>united</hi> to him, made one with him, they are not only
his <hi>servants,</hi> his <hi>friends,</hi> such as he <hi>loves,</hi> but he and
they make but one <hi>person,</hi> I meane one <hi>mysticall person.</hi>
Insomuch that throughout the whole Scripture he that
blesseth them blesseth him, he that curseth them curseth
him, he that relieveth them relieveth him, he that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62121:10"/>
fights against them fights against him,<note place="margin">All are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> he that
touches them touches the Apple of his eye, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which argue intimacy, tendernesse and deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
meete in this conjunction betwixt God and his
Church, he is their <hi>Father</hi> they are his <hi>children,</hi> he is
their <hi>head,</hi> they are his <hi>members,</hi> he is their <hi>husband,</hi>
they are his <hi>wife,</hi> yea they are called by <hi>his name</hi> and
he vouchsafes to be called by <hi>their name.</hi> Take but
this for granted, and you will make no doubt, but all
men are blessed or cursed, as they do or do not help
the Lord. The Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the fountaine of all
blessednesse more than the Sunne is the fountaine of
light, from his favour and good will necessarily flows
all happinesse, and consequently all are blessed or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
according as the aspect betweene God and them
is malignant or benevolent. This ground is fully laid
downe in that forementioned placed, <hi>Matthew 25. You
did it to them, therefore you did it to me, you refused it to
them, therefore you refused it to me.</hi> It is clearely there
taught, but I believe there is no man on earth that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
it, or believes it fully. And that very Text
gives me a hint to thinke so. Because the very <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
themselves, though they do all to the Saints out
of the good will they beare to <hi>Christ,</hi> yet when <hi>Christ</hi>
shall acknowledge this and say, <hi>Come ye blessed, you
fed me, you cloathed me, you visited me, They shall answer,
Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or thirsty, or a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or naked, or sicke, or in prison and administred unto
thee?</hi> It shews that themselvs did not fully understand
how neare they were to Christ for whom they did
all these things. I have somewhere read a story
of a <hi>Sarazen</hi> Embassador, who being with a Christian
Prince, and seeing Nobles and great men to wait upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62121:10"/>
him,<note place="margin">as they help or help not Gods Chur.</note> and the Prince himselfe to waite upon a Table
full of poore ragged people, desired to know what
they were, to whom he shewed so much respect, he
answered to this effect, they were the servants of
his Lord, and that he served his Saviour in them.
Well said the Embassador, if your Lord have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
servants than these, I desire to be none of them. I
care not for your Religion. And truly it is a hard
thing to perswade not only <hi>Sarazens</hi> but even <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
themselves, that whatsoever is done to poore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the off-scouring of the world should be done to
Christ himselfe. No earthly Prince would do so,
equally to accept and reward him, that should give a
nights lodging or any succour to one of his meanest
and basest groomes, as if it had beene done to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of himselfe or of his son. Yet this is the very
case betwixt Christ and his Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another ground from the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to God, is this, that as their persons are neerely
united to him, so their <hi>cause</hi> is his cause. As they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
every cause of God to be their cause, so God
accounts every cause of theirs to be his cause,<note place="margin">Their cause is his cause.</note> 2 <hi>Chro.
20. Moab and Ammon</hi> and they of <hi>Mount Seir,</hi>
came with a huge army against <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> hee
and his people being suddenly surprised betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to prayer, and seeke helpe from God: Now
marke what Gods answer was,<note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> 
               <hi>Be not you afraid nor
dismaied by reason of this great multitude, the battell is
not yours but Gods.</hi> Was not the battell theirs, all they
were worth lay upon that battell, their wives and
children, their lives and liberties, their countrey and
religion, lay all at the stake, and yet the battell none
of theirs, that is, not so much theirs as Gods, so in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62121:11"/>
the 74. <hi>Psalm.</hi> When <hi>Asaph</hi> had laid down all the
Churches sufferings, the pulling down of their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
the wasting of their Countrey, the reproach
and scorn cast upon them by their enemies,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 22, 23.</note> he interests
God in all this, <hi>Arise O God, plead thine own cause, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how the foolish man reproacheth thee, forget not the
voyce of thine enemies.</hi> Thus is their cause Gods cause,
their enemies Gods enemies: and indeed, if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it narrowly, whatsoever is done to them and their
cause, good or evill, is done for Gods sake. This then is
a strong argument to prove men blessed or cursed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they joyn with, or oppose the cause of God.
Because first, if it be Gods cause, it is a <hi>good</hi> cause. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it is a <hi>noble</hi> cause. Thirdly, it is a <hi>successefull</hi>
cause.</p>
            <p>First, I say it is a good cause. <hi>The just Lord that is in
the midst of his Church will do no iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 4:</note> 
               <hi>The righteous
Lord loveth righteousnesse.</hi>

               </note> though it be a meane
cause.<note place="margin">Psal. 35. 27.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> often pleaded this before God, that his
cause was just, his cause was upright. <hi>Let them shout for
joy, that favour my righteous cause.</hi> And on the other
side it must needs be a <hi>cursed thing</hi> to manage a
<hi>cursed cause:</hi> when <hi>David's</hi> cause was <hi>good,</hi> his
adversaries must needs bee <hi>evill,</hi> and then he could
foretell that <hi>they should be ashamed and brought to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>

               <hi>clothed with reproach and dishonour who opposed
themselves against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">A noble cause:</note> being Gods cause, it is a <hi>noble</hi> cause: a
man may possibly among men have a good cause and
the thing but a trifle, a thing of no great consequence:
but if it be Gods cause, let it appeare never so contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
it is subservient to the highest end, that can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62121:11"/>
be thought of.<note place="margin">All are blessed or cursed.</note> The salvation of soules, the glory
of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Honour uses to put men upon hard and

               </note> though but a <hi>corruptible crowne.</hi> There is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in doing good to one, but to advance the good of
many, especially of the Church of God, how honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
how glorious is it?</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">A successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cause.</note> Gods cause is a <hi>successefull</hi> cause, <hi>no weapon
can prosper that is formed against it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isay 44. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and every tongue that
rises up in judgement against it shall be condemned.</hi> The
mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.<note place="margin">Acts 5. 38.</note> This <hi>Gamaliel</hi> saw,
when he advised the councell of the high Priests, and
Pharisees, and Rulers, to refrain from opposing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
<hi>If this work be of men it will come to nought, but if
it be of God ye cannot overthrow it,</hi> it is in vaine to fight
against God. Since then the Churches cause is Gods
cause, and consequently a <hi>good</hi> cause, a <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
cause, you may easily hence conclude the <hi>happinesse</hi>
that accompanies the promoting of it. And on the
contrary as easily discern, how cursed a thing it is, not
only to undergo the disgrace of mannaging a wicked
and base enterprise, but to fail of that which wicked
men use to cherish themselves with, the hopes of the
comfort of reward and obtaining their desires.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Church.</note> consider our <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi> And
that affords three other excellent arguments to prove
men blessed or cursed, according as they help or help
not the Church of God.</p>
            <p>First, whatsoever abilities any man enjoyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he may any wayes be usefull,<note place="margin">All our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to serve the Church.</note> they are all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him to this very end, to make him serviceable to
the Church. <hi>All the manifestations of the spirit are given
to profit withall.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 7.</note> All the gifts which Christ powred out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62121:12"/>
when he ascended up on high, are <hi>for the perfecting of
the Saints, and the building up of the body of Christ. As e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one hath received a gift, so let him minister, as good
stewards of the manifold graces of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 15.</note> The Church is
the common storehouse to which all our wealth must
be carried.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Salus Ecclesiae suprema lex.</hi> Which being so,
the happinesse of every thing being the attaining of
the end for which it was appointed, and the curse of it
the perverting of it to a wrong end, they must needs
be blessed who serve the Church, and he must needs
be cursed that deprives the Church of its own due.
<hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that <hi>he that withholds corne</hi> in a time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,<note place="margin">Prov. 11. 26</note>
               <hi>the people shall curse him,</hi> though it were his owne
corne, but suppose a man had the keeping of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the whole town corne, which were none of
his <hi>owne,</hi> he only <hi>intrusted</hi> with the keyes of it, and
should let the people starve for want of that food<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which he should keepe purposely for them: or that a
man had the keeping of a Magazen for an Army to
furnish them with what might make them victorious,
and their safety and victory hazzarded, if not lost
through his default, were not this man a villaine and
a traitor to his country?</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Our conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Church.</note> Consider how <hi>neare</hi> the relation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> (except we be of the <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
Church, of the <hi>Dragons</hi> army, and then no more
need be said to prove men cursed.) The <hi>Church</hi> is our
<hi>Mother,</hi> and all the <hi>Saints</hi> are our <hi>Brethren,</hi> a Relation
which all Lawes of God and man do fasten duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 17.</note>
               <hi>The eye that mocketh at his father or despiseth to obey

               <note place="margin">Rom, 9, 2, 3,</note>

sorrow in his heart, and could wish himselfe accursed from
Christ for his Brethren his kinsmen, who were Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, All our own blessednesse <hi>stands</hi> or <hi>falls</hi>
with the blessednesse of the Church.<note place="margin">Our stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church Rom. 12. 4.</note> The Church is
such a corporation or mysticall body, as hath in it all
the properties of a naturall body wherein no members
can be happy in an abstracted sense,<note place="margin">1. Coo. 12, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> but as parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with the whole: because every part hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the neare relation to the whole a subsistency in it,
which is the foundation of any other good it receives.
And so consequently, the good or gaine of the whole
is the gaine of every member, and whatsoever tends
to the dissolution of the whole, cannot but be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to all the parts. As when a company of
Merchants have but one joyned stocke, every penny
gained or lost is gaine or losse to them all. Or as it is
with a company of passengers in the same Ship, save
the vessell and you save all, sinke the Ship, and every
mans Cabbin is cast away. Now this is a more prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
argument than reason can make, it is grounded in
nature which must prevaile with all; Nature makes
heavy things to ascend, rather than the whole should
be endangered by a <hi>vacuum.</hi> Nature teaches the
tongue to cry out, when the toe is trod upon, the hand
to work, that the belly starve not, the feet to runne, that
the back be not cold. Every man finds this in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
body; and Gods Spirit dwelling in all the Saints
workes the same spirituall disposition in them that are
partakers of the divine nature,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 25 26.</note> 
               <hi>That there be no Schisme
or division in the body of Christ, but that all the members
may have the same care one for another, That whether one
member suffer, all the members should suffer with it, or one
member be honoured, all the members should rejoyce with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62121:13"/>
By this time I hope it is cleare, that if we look upon
<hi>Gods promises</hi> or <hi>threatnings, mens experience</hi> in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or the <hi>Churches interest</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>neare union</hi>
with it, his <hi>affection</hi> to it, his <hi>owning</hi> the Churches
<hi>cause,</hi> or if we consider our own <hi>engagements</hi> to the
Church, our neare <hi>conjunction</hi> with it, and under God
the <hi>dependance</hi> of all our comforts and wellfare upon
it, we may and must conclude, <hi>that all men are blessed or
cursed according as they help or help not the church of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Application</note>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the time I shall spend in the Application
of it, that what is thus cleare to your judgement and
conscience, may by <hi>Gods</hi> blessing take due place in
your hearts and conversations. And there are but <hi>two</hi>

            <p>First,<note place="margin">1 For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe to them who help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church.</note> for reproofe. This speaks very sadly against

themselvs to be Christians. As first, Are all they cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

what then are they, who instead of <hi>helping the Lord

who instead of joyning all their strength, and giving
all their assistance to the Church in her distresse, doe
give all the assistance they can to the enemies of the
<hi>Church,</hi> that they may do mischief against the <hi>Church?</hi>
What shall we thinke of these men? How many are
there who have as it were entred their names into the

the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in every good cause? who walke

As who should say, if you gave gotten the day, we are

friends deale with the Church of God, turne <hi>Jewes,</hi>
when they have an honoured <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and as ready to
cut their throats when <hi>Haman</hi> prevailes against them.
They will be sure to be of the winning side, that they
may save their own stake; but what <hi>Gideons</hi> answer
was to the men of <hi>Succoth</hi> and <hi>Penuel, when the Lord
hath delivered Zeba and Zalmunnah into mine hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 6, 7 16, 17,</note>

            <p>2 There is a second sort of Neuters who neither
oppose the Church nor helpe it;<note place="margin">2 Out of slothfull carelesnesse</note> not out of policy,

but meere sluggishnesse and desire of ease or basenes

Lord and his Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, some <hi>directions</hi> to enable you in truth
and realitie to be usefull. And although most of the
things that I shall speake doe chiefely concern you,
our honourable Worthies, yet they will in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
reach the meanest in the congregation.</p>
            <p>To stir you up,<note place="margin">1 From Gods honour.</note> consider these three motives.</p>
            <p>First, the honour of God. Certainly the highest
end of our living in this world, is to honour God.
Hallowed be thy name, is the first petition of every
one that saith the Lords Prayer. Now a man
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62121:16"/>
never gives glory to God as God, never sets up God
in his right place, till he have devoted himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and absolutely to serve him in what is most acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
with him. And I have made it apparent
that the Church of Christ is that field from which
he expects the most plentifull crop of glory, and
and therefore would have the most cost bestowed on
it; He gets glory by all our actions, but in what wee
doe for the Church, wee give him glory and that in
the highest degree.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">3 From our relation to the Church and the churches gaine</note> as for <hi>Gods</hi> sake, so for the <hi>Churches</hi>
sake. It is ever well with the Church, when the
members of it, doe preferre the Churches good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their owne. <hi>Polititians</hi> and <hi>Historians</hi> observe
this of States and Empires, that they usually thrive
when the Subjects are <hi>Common-wealths men,</hi> every
one endeavouring to promote the <hi>publick</hi> good. <hi>Livie</hi>
observes this of <hi>Rome,</hi> that so long as men would
leave their trades, farmes and merchandise, Ladies
part with their Jewels and ornaments, rather than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
detriment should come to the Citie, all Nations
were subdued to them: But when they grew <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
wealths men,</hi> every one labouring to preserve and
adorn his owne Cabbin only; the ship presently was
endangered and went to decay. This is as true of the
Church. In all the rising times of it, God hath ever
stirred up such noble and generous spirits, who have
given themselves to the Lord, and the service of the
Church. In the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> you shall find <hi>that
they were all of one heart and one mind.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap, 2, 44, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 4, 31.</note> 
               <hi>No man said that
ought of the things that he possessed was his own, they had
all things common. Sold their possessions and goods, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
them as every man had need,</hi> and lived so, as if
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62121:16"/>
one soule possessed them all: This was the thriving
time of the Church. Then their multitude increased
by thousands and ten thousands and walking in the
feare of the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost
were multiplyed. But when once men grew to seeke
their <hi>owne things,</hi> and not <hi>the things of Iesus Christ,</hi> and
his Church, the Church soone fell into a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condition.<note place="margin">Act. 9. 3.</note> As therefore you desire to keepe up
the spirits and strength of the Church, so labour to
keepe up your own spirits for the Church, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that may not faint, so doe you take heed of faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the service of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as for Gods sake, and the Churches sake,
so for your owne sake,<note place="margin">3 From our owne good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both</note> for your owne comfort and
benefit, and that in many respects. As first, Such a
frame of Spirit as this will bee the best evidence of
your owne safe condition, of your peace with God;
tis a comfortable thing for a man to hate his lusts,
to strive against them, to waite upon duties, to
attend upon Ordinances,<note place="margin">In our in, wardpeace</note> to bee often enquiring,
<hi>What shall I doe to bee saved?</hi> but all this may bee
but selfe love (although such a love God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of) but when the soule comes to enquire,
what shall I doe that Christ may bee glorified,
that his Church may bee edified? to know no
crosse but the Churches crosse? to preferre the
joy of the Church before all his owne peace and
wellfare? this is not only an Argument of a man
looking Heaven-ward, but one that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
farre in the way; A Scholler of the first
and highest forme; and this is that which Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> meanes, when hee doth so frequently ang
all our evidence to Heaven, upon Love of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62121:17"/>
brethren, <hi>Hereby wee know that wee are translated
from death to life, because wee Love the Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In this are the Children of God manifest from the
children of the Divell: Hee that loves not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 14</note>
               <hi>is not of God: Hereby wee know that wee are
of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
Every one that loves God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> 
               <hi>loves him also that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of him.</hi> And many other expressions, as
if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew no other evidence but Love;
now what Love is it? Hee meanes it not of an
inward affection only, to wish well to them, and
so forth, but by love to serve our brethren, to lay
out our selves, our lives, and parts, and all to serve
them, <hi>To lay downe our lives for the Brethren, as
Christ laid downe his life for us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 16</note> This was that
that bore up <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> heart in the time of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Isa. 38. 3.</note>
when hee could pleade, <hi>Lord, remember
that I have done that which is good in thy sight.</hi>
What was the good that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had done? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
this, Hee had set himselfe to purge Religion,
to set up Gods Ordinances, to make the Church
prosper, given up himselfe to the publick service
of the Church of God, This made <hi>Nehemiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
to goe to God; Oh my God, wipe not
out the good deeds, that I have done for the House
of my God,<note place="margin">Heb 13.. 41</note> And indeed, there neither is nor can
be, any more certaine or infallible signe of a living
member of Christs body, and of our communion
with Jesus Christ in his holy Spirit, that Spirit which
dwels and acts in his whole mysticall body, then
this, to sympathize with the Church, to suffer in the
sufferings of it, to rejoyce in the consolations of
it and to preferre the good of it, before that of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62121:17"/>
our owne soules: Secondly, the honour of it
may provoke you. Ingenuous and Noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
will doe more for their honour than for their
gaine, now if you waigh it in the Ballance of the
Sanctuary,<note place="margin">And our honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men.</note> you shall finde, that to bee a publick
servant of the Church, to have an influence into
the wellfare of many,<note place="margin">Heb. 1, 14</note> is the greatest honour
which God communicates to any Creature; The
Creatures which are for publick and universall use,
are most noble and excellent, the World might
stand well enough without Pearles and Jewels,
and a thousand such like things, but the fire, the
water, the Sunne, the Earth, which are servants
to all, the World were ruined without them.
Yea this will make us like to the Angels, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentest
of all Gods creatures, whose delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
employment is to bee <hi>Ministring Spirits,
sent forth to Minister for them, who shall bee heires
of salvation.</hi> What shall I say, this makes us (more
than any thing else) like unto God himselfe, <hi>thou
art good and doest good:</hi> almost all the knowledge
which we have of the glory of God, comes from
the good which God diffuseth into the Creature,
and they partake most of Gods nature, and
most eminently beare his Image, who are his most
usefull instruments in doing good to his Church
and people; and if we marke it, wee shall seldome
finde the Holy Ghost in the Scripture, to point
out any as truly honourable, but under this notion,
that they study the wellfare and good of Sion.
Marke them whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commends in the
twelfth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and yee shall see this is
the matter of their praise; <hi>Phaebe was a servant of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62121:18"/>
the Church at Cenchrea, shee was a favourer of many:
Aquila and Priscilla were Pauls helpers, ready to
lay downe their neckes</hi> for a publick good. <hi>Mary,
Andronicus, Vrban, Triphena, Triphosa,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, this is their commendation, <hi>They labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much in the Lord.</hi> So the houshold of <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Paul</hi> would have all of them subject to the
houshold of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> he would have them num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the <hi>Patricii.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 15.</note> What was the house-hold
of <hi>Stephanus?</hi> It may bee some honest
Tradesman in his Civill ranke: but here is the
Crowne: <hi>They addicted themselves to the service
of the Saints:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor, 8, 23.</note> and of the messengers of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
some good men that came on the Churches
errand, the Apostle saith, if any inquired what
they were, what ranck or qualitie they were of,
hee answers, they were <hi>The Messengers of the
Churches, the glory of Christ.</hi> Yea Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of
himselfe, who seldome gloryed of himselfe, who
though hee were the greatest Apostle, esteemed
himselfe the greatest sinner, yet could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
glorying in this, <hi>That hee laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
than any others, that the Care of all the
Churches lay upon him, that hee became all things to
all men, that hee might save some,</hi> and the <hi>Stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
the brands or markes that hee bore about his
body for his service in the Church, hee did more
glory in, than any Noble man can of his George
or Blew Ribband: You shall see it, <hi>Galathians</hi>
6. verse 17. The <hi>Galathians</hi> had used Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
somewhat coursely, judged his actions and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and marke how Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seemes to take state
upon him, <hi>from henceforth let no man trouble mee;</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62121:18"/>
What made him thus high in his Spirit? <hi>I beare in
my body,</hi> the <hi>Stigmata, the markes of the Lord Iesus:</hi>
this was a badge of his honour, and therefore
they must use him honourably, and indeed if wee
compare the honour and glory that rests upon men
for the service of Christ and his Church, and
that which vaine men seeke in other things, the
truth of this would easily bee seene. Suppose
one man could say, this would I received in
fighting for a <hi>Mistris</hi> in a Duell: Another thus,
my state is empaired in brangling suites at Law,
Another in gameing and Whoreing. What fruit?
what glory is in these things? but now on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, when a servant of God can say, <hi>Haec
manus ob Ecclesiam pugnando, &amp;c.</hi> these offices I
lost, this preferment I went without, thus was
I scorned, thus is my body wasted for Christs sake
and for his Churches sake; this is glory indeed,
this glory exceeds the happinesse of mortalitie, and
will outlive all wealth and pleasure. And all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
shewes us, that however such men are most
opposed and scorned by the enemies of the
Church, who alwayes most fight against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praines
and Leaders, yet among the Saints these
are the most precious men, one of them esteemed
worth a thousand of others: and this some thinke
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to aime at in the fifth to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
when he saith, <hi>scarcely for a righteous man will one
dye, yet peradventure for a good man,</hi> that is,
a usefull Man, a serviceable Man, a Man
whose life and labours benefits many,<note place="margin">v. 7. Thirdly in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our reward.</note> 
               <hi>Some
would even dare to die.</hi> Thirdly, nor is the
Reward lesse,<note place="margin">Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62121:19"/>
may loose <hi>Houses, or brethren, or children, or
lands, and their owne lives,</hi> but they shall finde it
againe, <hi>in this life a hundred fold besides the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of everlasting life.</hi> Bread cast upon these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is seed sowen in fertile ground; the bosome of
the Church is the most fruitfull soile in the world.
Flesh and blood will never believe this, but Jesus
Christ the Lord of Life and Glory, whose all
the Silver and Gold in the World is, who hath
power enough to promote his servants and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
hath sufficiently assured us of this in his
Gospell; Men will securely adventure their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
upon Ropes and Cables in the deepe Seas,
when the ensuring office is ingaged for their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
if yee dare trust the insureing office of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

Name of Christ to you, yee shall bee paid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
penny, every houres sleepe which yee have
broken, every gray haire which is hereby scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon your head, every disease which yee have
contracted, every reproach which you have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
ye shall loose nothing by all or any of these,
he will repay it you in this world an hundred fold
in better things, it may be with trouble and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
but in the world to come ye shall have life
everlasting; Thus farre the motives, which would
the Lord let sinke into your hearts: how would yee
with <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyce to be offered up a Sacrifice for
the Church of Christ? how willingly would yee
continue to spend, and to bee spent in so good
worke?</p>
            <p>Secondly, some directions how we may be able
to doe this: where</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62121:19"/>
First, I shall shew what is requisite to prepare us
and fit us to bee the Churches servants. Secondly,
how and wherein they that are fit should help the
Church.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Meanes to make us use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> men must bee fitted for it; this <hi>Mercury</hi>
is not made of every wood; the Lord needs no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
if hee use any, it is <hi>propter munificen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi>
not <hi>propter indigentiam;</hi> because hee meanes
to honour them, not because they can benefit him:
and therefore hee will make them choice spirits,
rare and singular men,<note place="margin">The persons must be</note> to whom he will thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
his owne glory, and three things must
meet in them.<note place="margin">First Godly</note> First, They must be godly; a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
in an Army neither gives pay nor command
to any, untill they bee duly entred into his muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book:
Now men are never numbred among the
Lambs followers, their names are not entred into
his List, untill they be Saints. Read <hi>Revelation,</hi> where
ever the Lambs followers are described,<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 14.</note> 
               <hi>They are
such as have washed their Robes, made them white in
the blood of the Lamb,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14. 4.</note> 
               <hi>serving him night and day;
they are redeemed from the earth; in their mouth is
found no guile.</hi> They that are with the Lamb are
<hi>called, and chosen, and faithfull.</hi> And it must needs be
so; for so long as men are in their unregenerate
condition, they are Satans vassals in the maine; there
is not in them a <hi>substratum</hi> of reall usefulnesse to
the Church; their heart cannot be with the Lord
nor his people: 'Tis only the new life which is
the right principle of this service which is here
expected: If therefore the Lord hath kindled in
any of your hearts a desire to doe him service, I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62121:20"/>
beseech you, first, humble your souls deeply before
God for your sinnes; get your Robes washed in the
blood of the Lamb, rest not till the Spirit of Christ
come to dwell in you, and when yee have, once with
the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> given your selves first to the Lord,
then yee are fit to give your selves to the Church
for the Lords sake.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Deniers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> as they must be <hi>godly,</hi> who would be
servants to the Church; so they must learn to <hi>deny
themselves;</hi> they must be taken off from all private
selfe-engagements; they must set light by their
own ease, their own profit, and their own life: <hi>If any
man</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>come to me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 14. 26.</note> 
               <hi>and hate not his father,
and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot bee my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
Search through all the Scriptures, you shall
hardly finde a man who ever was fitted to bee use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the Church, till he had set himselfe aside;
<hi>No man that warreth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Tim. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>entangleth himselfe with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen
him to be a souldier.</hi> And therefore it was the <hi>A, B, C,</hi>
which Christ taught all his followers, even this
lesson of <hi>selfe-deniall:</hi> You shall read <hi>Mat. 20. v.</hi> 22.
That when the mother of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> came to
seek <hi>preferment</hi> at Christs hand for her two sonnes,
that the one might sit at his <hi>right</hi> hand, and the other
at his <hi>left</hi> in his Kingdome; Christ presently nips
that motion in the head, and tells them, that instead
of expecting such high and pleasant things in this
world, they must (if they meant to be his Apostles)
prepare to <hi>drink of his cup, and to be baptized with his
baptisme;</hi> that is, take paines and suffer trouble.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62121:20"/>
And verily sad experience hath taught this, that
men are never cordiall to the Church of Christ,
who <hi>embrace this present world.</hi> It is recorded of the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> then a Protestant, being pressed by
<hi>Beza,</hi> to appeare more in the cause of God, and to
owne religion to the purpose: He makes him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this effect, That he was their friend, but he
resolved to put no further to Sea, than that he might
<hi>get to shore if a storme should rise;</hi> he resolved not to
hazzard his hopes of the Crown of France, and you
know what became of him. So when men will make
religion as <hi>twelve,</hi> and the world as <hi>thirteene,</hi> they
will in sad tryals,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 23.</note> with <hi>Demas, forsake the cause and
servants of God, and embrace the present world:</hi> Like
those Potters recorded in the first of the <hi>Chro.</hi> who
<hi>dwelt among plants and hedges: There they dwelt with
the King for his work.</hi> A brand which the holy Ghost
sets upon them, who when <hi>Cyrus</hi> proclaimed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and encouragement to returne to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
to rebuild the Temple, and set up the worship of
God, refused to goe back with their brethren, and
chose rather to dwell among <hi>plants</hi> and <hi>hedges,</hi>
than to hazzard a gainefull trade, which they made
of the Kings work. O beloved, take heed of these
choaking thorns, the riches, cares, and pleasures
of this world; especially beware of the world, when
it comes with flattering allurements: Many ships
have been swallowed in a <hi>calme,</hi> when they have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
severall <hi>stormes.</hi> Troubles and persecutions,
(like the wind in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Parable) make men gird
their cloak (their profession of religion and service
to the cause of God) closer to them, when the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62121:21"/>
warme Sunne-shine of preferments steales it from
them:<note place="margin">Men are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</note>

            <q>Rebus in adversis facile est contemnere vitam.</q>
            <p>There is a notable story of a souldier of <hi>Antigonus,</hi>
one whom the Prince observed to be a very valiant
man, ready to adventure upon any desperate service,
and therefore much favoured him; and observing
that he still looked pale and lean, would needs know
what he ayled, and finding that he had a secret and
dangerous disease, he caused all possible meanes to
be used for his recovery; which when it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
the Prince observed him to be lesse forward
in service than formerly, and demanding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he ingenuously acknowledged that now he felt
the sweetnesse of life, and was loth to lose it. And
thus doe many thousands, who with <hi>Ionathan</hi> when
they come into a wood that drops with honey, leave
the chase of Gods enemies, and feed upon the
sweetnesse of worldly advancement. But, O yee
Worthies,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 24</note> 
               <hi>fly all these things;</hi> with <hi>Paul, esteem your
lives not deare to you: Let no earthly thing move you, so
you may finish your course and service appointed you from
and for the Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> and conclude with
<hi>Esther, if I perish, I perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 They must love the Church.</note> whosoever would bee a reall usefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
for the good of the Church, must get an
<hi>unfaigned love</hi> to the Church planted in his heart,
that it may beare fruit in his life and actions. All we
do is nothing but <hi>our labour of love. Love</hi> will force
more than the strappado, draw more than a yoke of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62121:21"/>
oxen; It is a sweet and strong tyrant. When the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had pressed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> earnestly
to study for the best gifts to make them usefull in
the Church: and to this purpose gives them a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of the severall gifts and graces which Christ,
for this end, had shed abroad, when hee ascended up
on high:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 27, 28.</note> Yet in the last verse of that chapter hee
promiseth to <hi>shew them a more excellent way,</hi> and that
is the way of <hi>love,</hi> which he layes downe in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter: which will <hi>doe</hi> all things, <hi>endure</hi> all
things, without which if men had the tongues of
men and Angels, all other gifts of prophesie, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp;c. <hi>they are but as sounding brasse, or tinckling
cymbals.</hi> This is the reason why Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all his Epistles calls for almost nothing but
<hi>love;</hi> because in that he calls for all. <hi>My little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
love one another.</hi> And this is also the reason
why the Devil doth so infinitely labour to sow the
tares of division in the field of the Church; hee
knowes if he can break the <hi>bond of love,</hi> he breaks the
<hi>bond of perfection,</hi> and opens the <hi>flood-gates</hi> to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Rest not therefore, who ever thou art that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest
to do good in the Church, till the love of it be
fixed in thy breast, as deeply as the love of the <hi>Ark</hi>
was in the heart of the wife of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> who <hi>died</hi>
for griefe when the Arke of God was taken: Or as
<hi>Calice</hi> is said to have been in Queen <hi>Maries,</hi> who
affirmed, that <hi>if her body were opened Calice would bee
found in her heart.</hi> To this end, consider often how
deare the Church is to thy deare Redeemer; how
comely and beautifull it is in it self; <hi>comely as the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Solomon,</hi> even when it is <hi>black as the tents of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62121:22"/>
Kedar</hi> with persecution: How deformed, uncleane,
and every way vain <hi>all other societies</hi> are in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>this; As the Lilly among the thorns;</hi> How near
to thy selfe, begotten of the same seed, laid in the
same womb with thee, and thou also wert laid in its
womb, and sucked its breasts, redeemed with the
same blood, enjoyest all the same priviledges, hast all
thy welfare in this world wrapt up in its welfare,
and expectest to live with it to all eternity in the
same glory. These thoughts rightly working upon
thy heart, would make thee willingly spend and be
spent for the Churches good: thy services would
not be as the motion of a stone cast out of a sling, at
first swift by virtue of a violent impression; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and strongest rather toward the later end, as
those motions are said to be which proceed from a
naturall inward principle. So then you easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the excellent use, and indeed the necessity
of the concurrence of these three qualifications of
<hi>godlinesse, self-deniall,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> to the making up of
a good Chruch-man: the Lord make them evident
in all your hearts and wayes.</p>
            <p>Next followes,<note place="margin">What these friends of the Church must doe.</note> What men thus accomplished
may and must doe for the Church. The service re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
may be reduced to these two heads:</p>
            <p>First, somewhat to prepare us for action.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to act as we are prepared.</p>
            <p>By way of preparation three things are requisite.
First,<note place="margin">1 By way of preparation, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> must</note> carefully to <hi>informe</hi> our selves of the state and
condition in which the Church is, otherwise wee
deprive our selves of all possibility of being help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to it. Be a man never so willing, and never so
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62121:22"/>
able to relieve the distresses of his brethren, hee can
neither heal the sick, nor help the poor, unlesse hee
knew who and where they were that needed,<note place="margin">1 Know the wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of the Church.</note> and
what helpe they wanted. This made <hi>Nehemiah</hi> so
diligently to enquire concerning <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 1 2.</note> 
               <hi>and his
brethren which were left of the captivity.</hi> This made
<hi>Daniel</hi> search into <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> Prophesies,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> to know
the condition of the Church, and learn his own duty.</p>
            <p>2. This enquiry must not be out of Athenian cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,<note place="margin">2 Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with them.</note>
as most people enquire after newes; but so to
know, as to work our hearts to a <hi>fellowfeeling</hi> of
their condition, otherwise all our intelligence will
be as dry clouds, flying over our heads without a
drop of raine. Thus did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> as soone as hee
understood that <hi>his brethren were in great affliction
and reproach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 1 4.</note> 
               <hi>the wall of Ierusalem broken downe, and
the gates thereof burnt with fire, he sate down and wept:</hi>
this prepared him for the good service he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.<note place="margin">Dan 8 27.</note>
Thus also did <hi>Daniel,</hi> who when God had
shewed him, though but in a vision, the calamities
that were to come upon the Church of the Jewes
by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes, he fainted, and was sick certain
dayes.</hi> And the want of this fellow-feeling is both
taxed and threatned by God in <hi>Amos 6. No man is
sorry for the affliction of Ioseph.</hi> God esteeming it an
argument of little love to sit downe with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
at a banquet, when the City of <hi>Shushan</hi> is in
perplexity.</p>
            <p>3. As wee must know and bee affected with the
Churches want,<note place="margin">3 They must enquire what is in their hand to help.</note> so we must enquire what is in <hi>our
power</hi> to do for it, wherein <hi>we</hi> may be helpfull. This
I shall have occasion to speak of afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62121:23"/>
The second sort of directions are for action. And
these may be brought to two heads.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">2 By way of action, they must</note> somewhat we must do immediately <hi>to God
for the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, somewhat wee must doe <hi>for the Church
from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1 Pray for it.</note> that which wee are to doe to God for the
Church is to pray for it. I name this <hi>first,</hi> because it
is the first and chiefest service that we can perform.
If any other talent bee a penny, Prayer is a pound.
This is the talent of all talents: concerning which
I shall speak a little more fully, as the seasonablenesse
of it requires.</p>
            <p>First it must be granted, that all the friends of the
Church <hi>may help it</hi> with their prayers: if with <hi>Peter</hi>
they have no silver nor gold, but will give such as
they have, they may afford a subsidy of prayer. They
have all the spirit of adoption, enabling them to cry,
<hi>Abba, Father:</hi> So that what the Master of the ship said
to <hi>Ionah, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise and call
upon thy God:</hi> (though he could neither sit at sterne,
nor handle the tacklings, yet he might pray;) may
be said to any man in regard of the Church; though
thou canst neither runne, nor ride, nor write,
nor fight, yet thou canst pray: Awake, awake. And
as plaine it is, that <hi>God requires</hi> it should bee so. <hi>O
pray for the peace of Ierusalem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 6.</note> 
               <hi>You that make mention
of the Lord keep not silence:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 62. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>give him no rest, till hee
establish and make Ierusalem the praise of the earth.
You that have escaped the sword remember the Lord afar
off,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 51. 50.</note> 
               <hi>and let Ierusalem come into your minde.</hi> But the
chiefe thing I aime at is, to discover the power of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62121:23"/>
Prayer. Which I shall never bee able fully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse:
None can tell what <hi>Prayer</hi> can do, but he that
can tell what <hi>God</hi> can do.<note place="margin">What great things Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is able to doe.</note> Yet these few conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may give some light toward it.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>God hath not promised to do any thing without
it.</hi> It is confest, he doth many things without Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but he hath not <hi>promised</hi> to do any thing for his
Church without it.<note place="margin">Ezek 36 37.</note> 
               <hi>All this will I doe,</hi> (saith the
Lord) <hi>but for all these things will I be enquired by the
house of Israel.</hi> Secondly, As he hath promised to
do nothing without,<note place="margin">Ier. 29. 10. 17.</note> so he <hi>will do all things by it: I
will visit you</hi> (saith God) <hi>and performe my good word
toward you;</hi> but you must <hi>performe</hi> your <hi>good work</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me: <hi>Then shall ye call upon me, and you shall goe
and pray unto me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>Aske and you shall receive: this is
the confidence that we have, that whatsoever we aske ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, we know that we have the petitions
that we desire of him.</hi> What cannot Prayer doe? It
is able to overthrow all enemies:<note place="margin">Psal. 56 9.</note> 
               <hi>When I pray, mine
enemies shall turn back.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 37. 36.</note> An hundred eighty five
thousand were overthrowne in one night,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 8. 37, 39.</note> after the
Prayer of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> It is able to turne away all
plagues, <hi>pestilence, famine, sword, wild-beasts;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
plague or sicknesse there be, prayer aud sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
will heal all. It is able to bring downe all
mercies; it is the key of heaven: <hi>Eliah,</hi> a man sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the same infirmities with us, hee prayed, and
the heaven was <hi>shut;</hi> he prayed again, and the heaven
was <hi>opened.</hi> It is the most efficacious engine in the
world; it opened the prison doores, and the iron
gate, to set <hi>Peter</hi> at liberty. It is the summe of all
wisdome, strength, and policy. What should I say
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62121:24"/>
more? It prevailes over God himselfe. <hi>Iacob wrastled
with God,</hi> and prevailed: What was his wrastling?
What was the strength,<note place="margin">Gen 32 26. &amp; Hos. 12. 4</note> whereby, <hi>as a Prince, he had

and thou Moon in the valley of Ajalon;</hi> but (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence

            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it.</note> These four things meet in prayer, which
are the strength of it, and may be your satisfaction.
First, The <hi>persons</hi> who pray are Gods <hi>owne children,</hi>
dearer to him than heaven and earth, tender as the
apple of his own eye: and we who are parents know
how prevalent the cryes of our own children are: <hi>we
being evill can give good things to our children.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Gods <hi>owne Spirit dictates</hi> and endites their
prayers for them: <hi>Wee know not what to pray for as wee
ought,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>but the Spirit it selfe makes intercession for us.</hi>
Now as it is said of the Sonne, <hi>I know thou hearest me
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62121:24"/>
alwayes;</hi> so may it be said of the Spirit. What regard
soever he may bear to <hi>us</hi> poore sinners, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
regard the intercessions of his <hi>owne Spirit.</hi>
Thirdly, The Prayers of Gods people they are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up and presented to God by <hi>his owne Son,</hi> our
Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>the high Priest of our profession, the
Angel of his presence, who is at the right hand of God,
who daily makes intercession for us,</hi> as the Spirit makes
<hi>intercession in us,</hi> and mingles <hi>his incense, with the
prayers of the Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>upon the golden altar which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the throne.</hi> Fourthly, There is this in prayer,
that it gives the <hi>greatest glory unto God.</hi> Of all gifts
or graces which God hath given to any creature, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any thing (except faith only) was found to give
that glory to God which prayer doth: especially
in these <hi>two things.</hi> First, it <hi>brings God into the field</hi>
to fight the battell for them, makes him to work all
their works for them; as indeed he doth. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a man prayes for, he doth by interpretation say,
Lord, I never shall have this, unlesse thou <hi>give</hi> it
me; I never shall <hi>do this,</hi> unlesse <hi>thou doe</hi> it for me.
And that is the reason why in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. after <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
and his people had prayed, and professed
they had no strength of their owne, left the worke
only and wholly upon Gods hand. Then God tells
them, <hi>The battell is not yours, but Gods;</hi> Now you
have put it into my hands, you shall see what I will
doe for you. And secondly, When the work is done
it ascribes the <hi>praise and glory</hi> of all to him, to whom
alone it is due. If we mark it, God hath little glory in
the world for those good things which men receive
without Prayer; their friends, parts, wit, industry,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62121:25"/>
must share with God; but what is <hi>won</hi> by Prayer is
<hi>worn</hi> with thankfulnesse; there being a naturall relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>praising,</hi> as the rivers returne
by the sea from whence they come.</p>

                  </gap>nd delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances come</note> and blesse God for you; wee have received
great mercies by your means: but are you the cause
of them? Have they been done by your wisdome
and forecast, or for any worthinesse found in your
selves? Hath not God done them all almost by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries?
Have not you been many times at a losse,
even at your wits end? Hath not God marvellously
discovered wicked enterprises against you, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
miraculously preserved you by his own naked
arme, ever since the beginning of your meeting?
Give therefore the glory where it is due, you shall
have the honour of excellent instruments, but this
honour is too high for you. Know therefore, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
(and it will encrease your honour to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it) that Prayer, and God by Prayer hath done
all this: While you have been with <hi>Ioshuah fighting</hi>
in the <hi>valley, Moses, Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> have been <hi>at prayer</hi>
upon the <hi>mountain.</hi> God hath poured out upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of the Kingdome, but more especially in
and about this great City, a most fervent Spirit of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62121:25"/>
Prayer: In many thousand families you are every
day mentioned at the throne of grace; few dayes
of your Sessions have passed over, without extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
fasting and prayer, either publike or private
on your behalfe: And when prayer doth thus as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
mercies must needs descend. Let God therfore
have the chiefe honour for pouring out the spirit of
prayer and supplication, the fruit whereof is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
your hearts and spirits daily in your work.</p>
            <p>And this also intimates the best hope wee have
of your good successe for the time to come,<note place="margin">And our hopes of more.</note> even
because God hath put it into the heart of the <hi>Kings
Majesty and your selves,</hi> to put the whole kingdome
into a <hi>posture of prayer;</hi> we hope your care in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Kingdome into a <hi>posture of defence,</hi> will be
serviceable: but wee expect our greatest help and
advantage, as from our <hi>daily prayers,</hi> so more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from those <hi>solemn monthly dayes</hi> of humiliation,
that are afforded and appointed us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, when he was Duke of
<hi>Normandy</hi> (according to the superstition of those
times) builded many Abbies, Monasteries and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,
and told his friends he was at this cost to
strengthen his Kingdome, esteeming them as strong
fortifications, wherein he provided many to fight
against the devill, the world, and the flesh: this he
said according to his light. I can more truly speak
from God that in every congregation where godly
Ministers and godly people shall, according to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
direction, ly in the dust, fasting, and mourning,
and praying before the Lord; there are strong holds
set up for the safety of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62121:26"/>
Secondly, how sadly doth this speak against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands of professed Christians! some <hi>cannot</hi>
pray,<note place="margin">2 For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> some <hi>will not</hi> pray, sure I am many <hi>doe not</hi> pray,
who in all this long time of <hi>Germanies</hi> afflictions
have never separated themselves to afford one dayes
prayer for the help of their brethren: and in all
our owne exigents and darknesses have never stood
upon the walls to help either <hi>England, Scotland,
Ireland,</hi> King, or Parliament: these are a miserable
generation. And this their not praying for the
Church is a sad token against them, that when the
Church of Christ shall <hi>sing for joy of heart, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
shall cry for sorrow of heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and howle for vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            </p>
            <p>What remaineth then,<note place="margin">3 Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to help the Church by Prayer.</note> but that all you who make
mention of the Lord, and bear his Name, who have
received this mercy, that you may have accesse to
the throne of grace, be quickned up, for the time
to come, to stand upon the walls, to give God no
rest night nor day, to let <hi>Ierusalem</hi> come into your
mind, constantly to do that which Master <hi>Bradford</hi>
made the subscription of his letters,<note place="margin">Motives thereunto.</note> 
               <hi>pray, pray, pray.</hi>
God hath done <hi>great things</hi> for us; but many <hi>great
things</hi> are yet to bee done; much rubbish to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;
many obstructions to bee cleared, many
enimies to be overthrown. <hi>Ireland</hi> is to be relieved,
Religion to bee established; <hi>Prayer</hi> may doe all
this; wee may overmatch all our enimies by <hi>prayer,</hi>
discover all their plots by <hi>prayer.</hi> Let us not bee
traitors against the Church and State, in slighting or
forbearing the use of that, which may work all our
works for us; this is to betray the forts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62121:26"/>
But remember when I exhort you to pray, I
mean, First, it must be <hi>prayer</hi> indeed; many can read
<hi>prayers,</hi> say <hi>prayers,</hi> sing <hi>prayers,</hi> many can conceive
or utter <hi>prayers,</hi> who yet cannot pray: Prayer is a
pouring out of the soul to God. And secondly, this
spirit poured out in prayer must bee a pure spirit:
<hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 66. And d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herein.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord will not hear
my prayer.</hi> And thirdly, this prayer must bee a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of faith; Pray in faith and waver not: And in
a prayer of faith three things must meet. First,
That the things begg'd bee according to the will
of God. Secondly, That they bee begg'd in the
name of Christ. Thirdly, that we rely upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of God, for the performance of them. This
is to pray in faith. Fourthly, Our prayers must bee
fervent, humble, constant; and when we have prayed,
wee must remember, that though prayer be the great

I passe from this great help of prayer. And that
is, in what esteem praying spirits should bee had
amongst all wise men; I know the world slights and
scornes them, but in truth they are the very <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
and Horsemen of Israel:</hi> Ten praying men might
have saved <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Cities round about.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62121:27"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>There was a little City and few men it,
and a poore wise man by his wisdome delivered this
City from the siege of a great King;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles 9. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Yet no man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that same poore man.</hi> Truly thus it is with
poore praying Christians, they deliver the Iland
and yet no man regards them. <hi>David</hi> knew how
to prize such spirits, who, though hee were a King,
thought them fit to bee his companions who cal'd
upon the name of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 15 30.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> knew how to prize
them who begged for prayers, as a prisoner for a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
<hi>Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Iesus Christs
sake, that you pray for me.</hi> Yea, <hi>Ioash</hi> though an Idolater,
when the praying Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> lay a dying, wept,
and cryed, as sensible of loosing the chiefe support
of his Kingdome,<note place="margin">2 King 13 14.</note> 
               <hi>O my father, my father, the Chariots

more, a heathen Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> finding by
experience the power of the prayers of Christians,
gave all the world notice of it, staid the persecution
against the Christians, and call'd that band of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<hi>Legio fulminatrix,</hi> the thundring band. Let
us therefore not fall short of heathens, let us not
undervalue or slight them, who carry the Keyes of
heaven at their girdle.<note place="margin">Isa. 19. 24.</note> Verily (Right honourable
and beloved) if you knew what blessings they are in
the midst of the land, you would take pleasure in
them, you would seek for <hi>praying</hi> friends, <hi>praying</hi>
servants, <hi>praying</hi> tenants; you would desire to have
a stock goe in every one of their vessels. You would
say to them all, as they to their companions going

               <hi>To pray before the Lord, and to

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62121:27"/>
hold upon the skirt of these men, saying we will goe with
you, for we have heard that God is with you.</hi> This is
the greatest help which we can give to the Church
of Christ. This wee doe immediately <hi>to</hi> God <hi>for</hi>
the Church.</p>
            <p>There are some things also which we must doe

cleare to your understandings, although the practise
of it require the study of your whole lives.</p>
            <p>The conclusion is this, Whatsoever abilities any
have received in any kind, they are given to them
to this very end, to be serviceable and usefull to the
Church of Christ with them:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>All the manifestations
of the spirit</hi> in gifts and graces, <hi>are chiefly given</hi> for

of our naturall faculties, of our actions, of our
wordly wealth, of office or authority, are given
us, not for our own carnall ends, no nor primarily
for our own salvation; but that with them all wee
should be <hi>as good Stewards of the manifold graces of
God.</hi>

and doe afford to any creature which they see to
be in distresse; they love the <hi>Church,</hi> they pity the
miseries of the <hi>Church,</hi> they are sorry for <hi>Germany,</hi>
when they think on it, and that is but seldome:
They grieve for <hi>Ireland;</hi> but require either their
hands to underwrite, their legs to walk, their
purses to contribute, their authority to command or
countenance, &amp;c. they can spare none of all
these. They have a bottomlesse <hi>gulfe</hi> called <hi>selfe,</hi>
which swallowes all they <hi>are, have,</hi> or <hi>can doe,</hi> and yet

do nothing for the Church, they answer readily they

pray for it with all their heart, and that is all they
can doe. But let all such false-hearted Christians
know, that the Lord needs none of their help, and
cares as little for their dry barren prayers, as the
poore beggar did for the Bishops blessing, who
begging for a peny, but denyed that, and put off
with the offer of a benediction, told him that hee
perceived his peny was better than his blessing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
he had denyed him that also. In the meane

            <p>Secondly, for exhortation to all, especially to
you Right honourable, and beloved; What words
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62121:29"/>
shall I use? How shall I make up a strength to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with you, to give up your selves and all you have
so wholly to the Lord and to his Church, that all
your other outward occasions may not so much as
dare to expect any thing from you, so long as the
Church hath need of it; that your pleasures and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uities,
nay your profits &amp; sometimes necessities,
may never offer to come in competition with the
Church of God, for any thing which you call yours.
O that you could hear the Lord speaking to you in
the same language as once he spake to <hi>Cyrus, For Jacob
my servants sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called
thee by the name!</hi> I confesse that instead of exhorting
we have just cause to blesse God for you, when we
consider how you, who heretofore have lived at ease
and in pleasure enjoying the delights of the sons of
men, have now changed your <hi>pleasures</hi> for <hi>paines,</hi>
your <hi>delights</hi> for <hi>dangers,</hi> your <hi>profits</hi> and <hi>gains</hi> for
<hi>expences,</hi> your <hi>houses</hi> for <hi>lodgings,</hi> and still continue
to deny your selves in all these things, and goe on in
your unwearied labours for the Church and cause of
God. This is great matter of praise to God, and
honour to your selves. Generous plants and odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
spices (they say) grow onely in hot regions:
such fruits as yours are not brought forth by every
plant, such plants as you grow not on every ground.
But go ye on, ye Nobles and Worthies, forget what
is behind; God and his people will not forget it:
look and presse to the work which yet remains: Get
the resolution of <hi>Zisca</hi> that brave <hi>Bohemian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
who not onely was willing to fight while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but be queathed his skin when he died, to bee
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62121:29"/>
made a drum head for the service of the warre. Hold
out to the end, <hi>Cloath ye with zeale as with a cloak, put
on righteousnesse as your ornament:</hi> Bee good shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
still,<note place="margin">Iob 29.</note> to rescue and feed the flock committed
to you:<note place="margin">Obad. v. ult.</note> Be so many <hi>Saviours upon mount Sion.</hi> All
this shall be done for the best Master; all this seed
will be sown in the most fruitfull ground, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of the Church: and to quicken you the more,
remember how much of the golden time which is
gone <hi>you</hi> have wasted, with <hi>Domitian,</hi> in catching of
flyes; how much of <hi>your</hi> estate hath bin spent need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
in pictures, feastings, buildings, sportings, if
not worse, in riot and disorder; how much of <hi>your</hi>
strength hath been bestowed in the service of this
world, and the God of it: and now when the gray
haires are scattered upon many of you, and God
might justly cast you aside as broken vessels, the Lord
should choose you, and accept you in the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
service that the sons of men are capable
of; nay that service which he employed his owne
Son in. How readily and cheerfully ought you to
consecrate your selvs and service to this work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you
should come from your habitations and countries,
as the <hi>Levite from the place where he so journed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 18 60.</note> 
               <hi>with all
the desires of your minds to serve the Lord your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to you the rest,<note place="margin">2 To all others.</note> beside your Prayers, the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Church at this present time requires
from you many otherthings. It may be some of you
may be called, as souldiers, to spend your blood in
the Churches cause: If you knew the honour and
the reward that belongs to such a service, you would
say, as the Martyr once, Had every haire on your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62121:30"/>
head a life, you would venture them all in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
cause. It may be others of you may, with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi>
be called from your own ease and honour to
some wearisome task, embrace it readily. It is like
your collections and contributions will be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
than ordinary, and very shortly in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occasion, for the relief of our distressed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in Ireland: many in the City of London have
set excellent examples, let me provoke you by their
pattern, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did the Corinthians to
the like work, by propounding to them the example
of Macedonia: Onely remember this, that what
you give in this case is interpreted by Christ as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his owne person;<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 35.</note> and whom would not this
provoke? It is reported of Master <hi>Fox,</hi> that when a
poore man asked something of him for Christ Jesus
sake, he questioned with the man, whether hee knew
Jesus Christ; and finding signes that the man was a
Beleever, hee gave him his horse, when hee had no
money. I commend not his discretion, but his zeal
and charity were admirable. Do somewhat propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the distresse of your brethren; Behold
your Saviour comming naked, and hungry, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in these his afflicted members. And in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else the Lord and his Church may have
any need of you, remember that Gods blessing is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that come to helpe him: and that <hi>Meroz,</hi>
and with <hi>Meroz</hi> all others are cursed, who <hi>come not
out to the help of the Lord against the mighty.</hi>
