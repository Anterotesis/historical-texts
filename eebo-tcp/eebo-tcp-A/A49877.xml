            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE, spoken by Flora.</head>
            <l>WILL nothing take in these Ill-natur'd times?</l>
            <l>Neither low Farce nor great Heroick Rhimes?</l>
            <l>'Tis strange you should such Sectaries be grown,</l>
            <l>Thus to allow no Doctrine but your Own;</l>
            <l>And in the Pit as they in Pulpits rage,</l>
            <l>Preach up Rebellion to undoe the Stage.</l>
            <l>Like angry Fate you Damn without Controul,</l>
            <l>Ruine your Own, but not the Poets Soul.</l>
            <l>If Wit should be the Substance of a Spark,</l>
            <l>Why is your Talk so Dull? your Sence so Dark?</l>
            <l>Things much admir'd by Fops both great and small,</l>
            <l>Are to be Drunk, keep Miss, and visit Ball;</l>
            <l>But the great Essence, Wit, few have at all.</l>
            <l>Wit does in Plays to some Gay Fops appear,</l>
            <l>Like a New Mistress in their full Carear;</l>
            <l>All Ayre and Charming, till the Minute's past,</l>
            <l>And then you kick her out with all your hast,</l>
            <l>Tax'd with the Crime, Damme she's False you cry,</l>
            <l>Another Lord keeps her as well as I.</l>
            <l>This makes the Trade of Miss and Poet Dull,</l>
            <l>They care not how Debauch'd to please a Fool.</l>
            <l>But what's all this to me? I've yet been true,</l>
            <l>But 'twas for want of Wit, like some of you.</l>
            <l>'Sdeath who would be so singularly kind,</l>
            <l>Toblige but One? Faith they' re not of my mind.</l>
            <l>'Tis Wit in Women to accept of All,</l>
            <l>The Knight, the Squire, but Gold in Generall.</l>
            <l>The more they swarm, the greater store comes in,</l>
            <l>And 'twill be pleasure then to pay for Sin.</l>
            <l>But to be left in this unruly sort</l>
            <l>By you the Great Pretenders of the Court,</l>
            <l>Would make a Saint, a Mistress ne're so true,</l>
            <l>Forget her Vows, and prove as False as you;</l>
            <l>Turning her House, since you are grown so Fickle,</l>
            <l>As we must ours, into a Conventicle.</l>
            <l>There's no Redemption, thank our daily Iars,</l>
            <l>The Men are all resolv'd go to Wars;</l>
            <l>The Women thus grown out of Favour too,</l>

of precious sweet delight! Oh let me dwell upon these hands a
while, and breath my soul into each trilling Pore: thy melting
lips have made me all a charm, and when I cast my arms about
thy neck, I thought I grasp'd a God; the darkness of the Covert
could not shade thy piercing beauty from me, for through those
thick and darksome Clouds of Night, I could behold the
glances of thy Eyes, which shot fresh joys into my panting
heart.</p>

to you would have witness'd it, if you had had the Patience
