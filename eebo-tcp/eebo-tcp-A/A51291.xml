            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou standest not to the judgement of thine eye more then of thy reason, this fragment may passe favourably, though in the neglectfull disguise of of a fragment; if the strangenesse of the argument prove no hinderance. INFINITIE of WORLDS! A thing monstrous if assented to, and to be start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at, especially by them, whose thoughts this one have alwayes so engaged, that they can find no leisure to think of any thing else. But I onely make a bare proposall to more acute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of what my sportfull fancie, with pleasure hath sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested: following my old designe of furnishing mens minds with varietie of apprehensions concerning the most weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie points of Philosophie, that they may not seem rashly to have settled in the truth, though it be the truth: a thing as ill beseeming Philosophers, as hastie prejudicative sentence Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall Iudges. But if I had relinquishd here my wonted self, in proving Dogmaticall, I should have found very noble Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage for the cause among the ancients,</hi> Epicurus, Democritus, Lucretius, &amp;c. <hi>Or if justice may reach the dead, do them the right, as to shew, that though they be hooted at, by the Rout of the learned, as men of monstrous conceits, they were either ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise or exceeding fortunate to light on so probable and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an opinion, in which notwithstanding there is so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie and seeming inconsistencie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay and that sublime and subtil Mechanick too,</hi> Des-Chartes, <hi>though he seem to mince it must hold infinitude of worlds, or which is as harsh one infinite one For what is his</hi> mundus indefinitè extensus, <hi>but</hi> extensus infinitè? <hi>Else it sounds onely</hi> infinitus quoad nos <hi>but</hi> simpliciter finitus. <hi>But if any space be left out unstuffd with Atoms, it will hazard the dissipation of the whole frame of Nature into disjoynted dust. As may be proved by the Principles of his own Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51773:3"/>
               <hi>And that there is space whereever God is, or any actuall and self-subsistent Being, seems to me no plainer then one of the</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For mine own part I must confesse these apprehensions do plainly oppose what heretofore I have conceived; but I have sworn more faithfull friendship with Truth then with my self. And therefore without all remorse lay batterie against mine own edifice: not sparing to shew how weak that is, that my self now deems not impregnably strong. I have at the latter end of the last Canto of</hi> Psychathanasia, <hi>not without triumph concluded, that the world hath not continued</hi> ab aeterno, <hi>from this ground:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Extension</l>
                  <l>That's infinite implies a contradiction.</l>
               </q>
               <hi>And this is in answer to an objection against my last argument of the souls Immortalitie,</hi> viz. <hi>divine goodnesse. Which I there make the measure of his providence. That ground limits the essence of the world as well as its duration, and satisfies the curiositie of the Opposer, by shewing the incompossibilitie in the Creature, not want of goodnesse in the Creatour to have staid the framing of the Universe. But now roused up by a new Pbilosophick furie, I answer that difficultie by taking away the Hypothesis of either the world or time being finite: defending the infinitude of both. Which though I had done with a great deal of vigour and life, and semblance of assent, it would have agreed well enough with the free heat of Poefie, and might have passed for a pleasant flourish: but the severitie of my own judgement, and sad Genius hath cast in many correctives and coolers into the Canto it self; so that it cannot amount to more then a discussion. And discussion is no prejudice but an honour to the truth: for then and never but then is she Victorious. And what a glorious Trophee shall the finite world erect when it hath vanquished the Infinite; a Pygmee a Giant.</hi>

               <hi>For the better understanding of the connexion of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, with the Poem of the souls Immortalitie; I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the last stanza's thereof, and added some few new ones to them for a more easie and naturall leading to the present Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> Psychathan. lib. 3.

                  <l>Upon a day as best did please my mind</l>
                  <l>Walking abroad amidst the verdant field</l>
                  <l>Scattering my carefull thoughts i'th' wanton wind</l>
                  <l>The pleasure of my path so farre had till'd</l>
                  <l>My feeble feet that without timely rest</l>
                  <l>Uneath it were to reach my wonted nest.</l>

                  <l>In secret shade farre moved from mortals sight</l>
                  <l>In lowly dale my wandring limbs I laid</l>
                  <l>On the cool grasse where Natures pregnant wit</l>
                  <l>A goodly bower of thickest trees had made.</l>
                  <l>Amongst the leaves the chearfull birds did fare</l>
                  <l>And sweetly carrol'd to the echoing air.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Hard at my feet ran down a crystall spring</l>
                  <l>Which did the cumbrous pebbles hoarsly chide</l>
                  <l>For standing in the way. Though murmuring</l>
                  <l>The broken stream his course did rightly guide</l>
                  <l>And strongly pressing forward with disdain</l>
                  <l>The grassie flore divided into twain.</l>

The place a while did feed my foolish eye</l>
                  <l>As being new, and eke mine idle ear</l>
                  <l>Did listen oft to that wild harmonie</l>
                  <l>And oft my curious phansie would compare</l>
                  <l>How well agreed the Brooks low muttering Base,</l>
                  <l>With the birds trebbles pearch'd on higher place.</l>

                  <l>And mindlesse of the mirth the birds expresse,</l>
                  <l>Into my self 'gin softly to retire</l>

                  <l>And drawing to the head with might and main,</l>
                  <l>With fell intent he aim'd to hit my heart.</l>

the species audible in the strucken aire, as also of the visible species. In brief any thing is said to circulate that diffuseth its image or species in a round.
