         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BASSA
OF
BUDA.</head>
            <p>I Am not at all ſurpriz'd to ſee
that Love occaſions many
Diſorders in Private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
It ever did ſo, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will: But to find that it is It
that has kindled the War we at
preſent ſee between the <hi>Turks</hi> and
the Empire, is a matter very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and nevertheleſs very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42899:4"/>
true. Eaſie will it be to know
this Truth, from the following
Hiſtory, which I ſhall faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
from the Memoirs I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from one of my Friends at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
where he has an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
under a Foreign Miniſter, by
whom, as he writes me word, he
was inform'd of what I am going to
recount.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Teckeley,</hi> that famous Head
of the <hi>Male-contents,</hi> that has ſo
long born Arms againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
after having (according to
the Deſtiny of thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in ſuch like Enterpriſes) found
that there is nothing more difficult
than to ſucceed in their Projects,
was ready to ſink, when he reſolv'd
to ſend his Secretary, once for all,
to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> of whom he
had already receiv'd divers Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
but too ſlender to bring
his Deſigns about. He expreſly
encharg'd him to tell this Prince,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42899:4"/>
and the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> that he was
oblig'd to come to an Accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Emperour, unleſs they
aſſiſted him better than they had
hitherto done. That all his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
were weary of the War they
had made for ſo long a time, and
for the moſt part at their own coſt.
That he could no longer hinder
them from returning to their own
homes, where they had their Wives
and their Children, principally ſince
the Emperour, gave them hopes of
Liberty of Conſcience, and the
Preſervation of their Priviledges;
for whoſe Infraction they had taken
up Arms againſt him. That they
daily perſecuted him to accept theſe
Conditions, which he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to elude; remonſtrating to
them, that theſe were Promiſes that
would never have effect. That this
had ſtopp'd them hitherto: but that
at length the want of Power he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
under, would oblige him to
cloſe with thoſe Offers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42899:5"/>
This Secretary having laid theſe
Reaſons before the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi>
this Miniſter laid 'em before his
Maſter; a Prince that having been
brought up amid the effeminacy of
the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> did by conſequence,
love Peace much better than Wan.
The <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> for his part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
nothing but Quiet; not but
that he was well experienc'd in
Martial Affairs, but becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a <hi>Sultana,</hi> whoſe ſight he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before all things. By theſe
means the Secretary had but a ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Reception; and the Anſwer
made to him, was, that the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> would by no means engage
openly in the War; but that he
would give Order for the aſſiſting
of his Maſter, under hand, as had
been done ſince his Revolt, againſt
the Emperour. For this purpoſe
ſeveral <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s had Order to repair
to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and there, in the
Secretaries preſence, were they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to keep a ſecret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42899:5"/>
with <hi>Teckeley,</hi> and to favour
him in all they could, yet without
committing any Hoſtility that could
embroil the two Empires.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, who was but ill
ſerv'd in Spies, hearing of <hi>Tecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s
Secretary's arrival at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and this meeting of the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>'s,
imagin'd all to be for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of War againſt him; and an
Envoy he had in that Court; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſignify'd to him, that the
thing was ſo, he ſent him Order
to break the Deſigns that might be
eſpouz'd to his prejudice in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
by ſeveral advantageous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
he caus'd to be made to the
<hi>Turks,</hi> if they would for Twenty
Years prolong a Truce, that was
made between the Two Empires,
after the Battel of St. <hi>Godard.</hi> The
<hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> who expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs than this, was over joy'd
at this juncture, and reſolv'd to
procure the advantage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that was offer'd without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42899:6"/>
any Riſque; he began to give
out a Rumour of an approaching
Rupture, that ſo the Emperour
augmenting his allarums, might
cauſe ſtill more advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to be propos'd to him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
for the better inſinuating
of the War, he ſent for the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of
<hi>Buda,</hi> who had not been ſummon'd
to the firſt Aſſembly: and as he was
the Perſon the Port was wont to
conſult in what concerned <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
the Emperour did not doubt,
but that the <hi>Turks</hi> would proceed to
a Rupture with him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Baſſa</hi> was a Man between
Eight and Twenty and Thirty
Years old, as well made as a Man
could be, brave to the higheſt
Degree; but whoſe Wit did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
ſurpaſs his Bravery, and
Good Mien. He had obtain'd his
Government, not ſo much however
by his Good Qualities, as by the
Love the <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for him: And this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42899:6"/>
is extraordinary, and ſparkiſh
enough, ſo as to believe that I ſhall
not weary out my Reader, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him an account of it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Baſſa</hi> was one of thoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute-Children
that are rais'd upon
the <hi>Christians;</hi> and his Mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not been able to diſpenſe her
ſelf from this unhappy Law, which
thus obliges to give what one beſt
loves, no ſooner ſaw that her Child
was cull'd out by thoſe that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to exact it, but that ſhe
made a Mark in his Face, that ſhe
might be able to know him again
another day. This Mark was juſt
for all the World, as if he had put
on a Patch; and far from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
by 't, it on the contrary, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as a Beauty-ſpot. For this muſt
needs be granted, that it does not
unbecome a Man. Nevertheleſs,
as it is a Token of an effeminate
Spirit, that has recourſe to theſe
ſorts of Artifices, it muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the ſame time, that thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42899:7"/>
who pretend thereby to pleaſe, far
from ſucceeding in their Deſigns,
render themſelves contemptible to
the Fair Sex, which loves a man
that does not thus trifle away his
time in playing the Woman. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Mother having taken this
Precaution, ſaw him carry'd away
with the leſs regret, as hoping ſhe
had not wholly loſt him. He was
educated in the place where the
Children of Tribute are brought
up; and when he was at an Age of
learning ſomething, he diſtinguiſh'd
himſelf from all the reſt: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he was from that time
obſerv'd to be a Subject worthy of
officiating one time or other, the
higheſt Places of Truſt. Nor were
they deceiv'd in the hopes they had
conceiv'd of him. The <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi>
who had been inform'd of
his fine Qualities, having one day
ſent for him into his Preſence, he
lik'd him ſo very well, that he
would needs have him to be his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42899:7"/>
Page. But this Youth, who was
but between Twelve and Thirteen
Years old, fell on his Knees before
him, and beſought him rather to
let him bear Arms; promiſing him,
that he would one day render him
ſuch good Services, that he ſhould
not be ſorry he had granted him his
Requeſt. It is often a Capital
Crime to oppoſe the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>'s
Will. And as their Yoak is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannick,
ſuch like Complements
have been often known to coſt
the Lives of thoſe that made them.
But either that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
was in a good Humour that day,
or that he was pleaſed with the
prettineſs of this Child, he granted
him what he deſired.</p>
            <p>He was put among the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
and being one day upon the
Guard, at the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Tent,
this Miniſter commanded him with
his own Mouth, not to ſuffer any
body to enter, be it who it would.
A moment after the <hi>Aga,</hi> who is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42899:8"/>
the Captain of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither, our Youth deny'd him
the Door, which he being ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
at, he lift up his Hand to
ſtrike him; asking him, if he
knew not his <hi>Aga.</hi> The Anſwer
the young man made him, was,
levelling his Piece at him; and
he had been a dead man, if ſome
Officers, that were with the <hi>Aga,</hi>
had not interpos'd to ſave him.
The <hi>Janizary</hi> would not fire, for
fear of killing an Innocent inſtead
of the Offender; but ſtill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Arms in a Poſture, he
prevented his being ſeiz'd, which
the <hi>Aga</hi> would have gladly done,
that he might have punish'd him
upon the Place, for the Affront he
imagin'd he had receiv'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> hearing a
noiſe, ſent to ſee what was the
matter; and being told the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Diſorder, he himſelf
came out of his Tent-door, where
Both demanded Juſtice of him.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42899:8"/>
The young man was in ſuch a
Rage, that the <hi>Aga</hi> had dar'd to
lay his Hand upon him; that he
could hardly open his Mouth. He
remonſtrated to the <hi>Vizier,</hi> that he
had done nought but executed his
Orders: That thus he was as much
concern'd as himſelf, to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
ſince that the <hi>Aga,</hi> who had
been inform'd of the Prohibition,
did ſufficiently ſhew the little value
he had for his General, in thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
his Commands. But all
that he could ſay, did not hinder
the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> from making him
in the wrong; telling him, that he
ought to have the Judgment to
conſider, that the Prohibition did
not regard the <hi>Aga,</hi> who being
the Head of his Guard, ought to
have free Ingreſs and Egreſs to
his Quarters, for the receiving and
executing what ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him. Nevertheleſs, as the
Greenneſs of his Years render'd
him excuſable, beſides his having
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42899:9"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o expreſly forbidden any one
ſhould enter, as that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Prohibition was for
all, he order'd the <hi>Aga</hi> to contain
his Reſentment, and impoſed Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
on him. He fancy'd he had
not ſo many meaſures to take on the
young man's account, whom he
look'd upon as a ſimple <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and to whom beſides he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
he had been very kind, in
cauſing him to be pardon'd. But
it lying upon our Youth's Heart,
that a Hand had been lift up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, far from being ſatisfy'd
with his Sentence, he reſolv'd to
right himſelf, ſince the Perſon he
expected it from, had not done
it.</p>
            <p>Nor was the <hi>Aga</hi> on his ſide ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd;
and as he imagin'd it to be
a Blot upon him, in having been
inſulted by a Man who was bound
to obey him, he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to ſtrange Extremities, if
he had not been afraid of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42899:9"/>
the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> who would
be abſolute. Things being in this
manner, they both would quickly
have found the means of ſatisfying
themſelves, if they had been of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Condition: But inequality
being the Cauſe that the <hi>Aga</hi>
ſlighted the young man, and that
the young man durſt not on his
ſide offer to challenge him; they
both watched for the Occaſion to
give themſelves ſatisfaction; and
the <hi>Aga</hi> went this way to work:
He commanded the Youngſter in
all perillous occaſions, hoping it
would be impoſſible for him to
eſcape periſhing in one or other.
But Fortune taking care of him,
not only preſerv'd him from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but alſo extended his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſo far, by the fine Actions
he performed, that he was talk'd
of in the moſt remote Provinces of
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. Nay, and
as People are wont to magnifie all
Objects, according as what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42899:10"/>
is more or leſs diſtant, he
was ſaid to have atchiev'd ſuch
great things, as would have been
capable of defacing thoſe we read
in Hiſtory, if they had been true.
In ſhort, he began to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
known in Places whither he
was never like to go; and People
had every where ſo good an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him, that as ſoon as the
leaſt advantage befel the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Empire, the better part of it was
attributed to him, tho very often
he had not been preſent in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</p>
            <p>This did not at all pleaſe the <hi>Aga,</hi>
who far from diminiſhing any thing
of his Reſentment, in favour of his
Merit, found, on the contrary, the
averſion he had for him to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He look'd upon him as a
Riſing Enemy, and as a man that
would ſtand candidate with him
for the firſt Offices of the State,
and the favour of his Maſter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prejudic'd with ſuch like Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42899:10"/>
he did all he could in
ſome wiſe to leſſen his great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and not being able to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
him of the Honour that was
due to him, he endeavour'd, at
leaſt, to make him ſhare it with
ſome others; hoping, that the
more People partook therein, the
leſs would be ſaid to his advantage.
The young <hi>Janizary</hi> would not
perchance have taken notice of
this, if he had not moreover had
a Grudg in his Heart. But being
attentive to all he did, he quickly
perceiv'd with what Spirit he was
animated; which ſtill encreas'd the
Deſire he had of meaſuring his
Sword with his. The Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
was great for a young Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.
Nevertheleſs, the Affront
he had done him, being ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to his Memory, he had no
Quiet till he had ſatisfy'd himſelf in
this. This he effected by an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that was offer'd; and in this
manner were matters brought about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42899:11"/>
The Troops being in Winter-Quarters,
the <hi>Aga,</hi> who had a great
Paſſion for hunting, ſent for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Hounds; and though it is not
the Cuſtom of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to hunt
like us, a certain <hi>Renegadoe</hi> he had
with him, diſcours'd him so often
of the Pleaſure we had in Stag-hunting,
that he ſuffer'd himſelf to
be led along with the temptation
of ſeeing whether our way was
better than theirs. Thus being out
a hunting, the young man, who
being ſtill animated with the ſame
Deſign, put himſelf into a falſe
path, and caus'd one of his Friends,
whom he had engag'd in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
to ſuggeſt to him, that if he
meant to be at the fall of the Stag,
that was juſt coming to a Bay, he
muſt ſcour along that way. The
<hi>Aga</hi> was over-joy'd at this advice,
which he took in good part; and
being extraordinarily heated, he
thunder'd along, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether he was attended, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42899:11"/>
not. And indeed, he that had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him this Council, ſeeing that
he was fallen into the Trap that
was laid for him, inſtead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him, gallop'd after the
Dogs. By theſe means the young
<hi>Janizary</hi> had the pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf alone with his Enemy,
whom he cry'd to as ſoon as he
ſaw him, that he had long ſought for
ſuch an opportunity as that, and
that ſince it offer'd it ſelf ſo happily,
he deſired him to give him ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the Outrage he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>This Complement ſurpriſed the
<hi>Aga.</hi> However, as he did not
want Courage, he laid hand to his
Piſtol, rather than to anſwer him:
For you muſt know he had a pair
at his Saddle Bow, contrary to the
cuſtom of thoſe that go a Buck-hunting.
The Young <hi>Janizary</hi> did
the like on his ſide; and as they
were in a place where they could
not make any eſcape, to avoid a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42899:12"/>
Shot, a Cut, or Thruſt, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the Combat to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than cruel on both ſides.
However, the young <hi>Janizary</hi>
meaning to let him ſee that he had
a Courage above all Fear, bid him
fire firſt; and the <hi>Aga</hi> not ſtanding
to be twice bid, levell'd his Piſtol
at him, and miſs'd him. The young
<hi>Janizary</hi> call'd out to him, to take
his other Piſtol, and bid him fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
which the <hi>Aga</hi> did, but with
as little ſucceſs as the time before.
He was very much at a loſs, after
having thus miſs'd in his twice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charing:
But he was very much
ſurpriz'd when the <hi>Janizary,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of availing himſelf of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to kill him, or at leaſt, to
make him beg his Life, cry'd out to
him, not to be under any fear, and
that out of acknowledgment for
the Obligation he had to him for
fighting him, he was willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the hopes he had of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
However, to let him ſee,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42899:12"/>
that he ſaid nothing to him, but
what he was ready to do, he fir'd
his two Piſtols in the Air, which
put the <hi>Aga</hi> into great admiration.
But he had not the leiſure to make
any great Reflexion upon his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity:
For at the ſame time the
<hi>Janizary</hi> attack'd him with his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
in his Hand, and preſs'd him in
ſuch manner, that he plainly ſaw,
that though he was rid of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
yet was he not the leſs to be
feared. He ſtood upon his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and did all he could to ſtop
him; but either that the <hi>Aga</hi> was
not ſo expert as the <hi>Janizary,</hi> or
that <hi>Fortune</hi> concern'd it ſelf in
the matter, the <hi>Janizary</hi> gave him
two Wounds, one in the Arm, of
no great moment, and the other in
the Body, which was much more
dangerous.</p>
            <p>While this Combat was in Hand,
the <hi>Aga</hi>'s People not ſeeing him, and
having heard firing ſeveral times,
moſt of 'em quitted the Chace, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42899:13"/>
made that waywards, where they
heard the noiſe. As they ran full
gallop, they were not long a get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Place of Battel, and
were much ſtartled to find him
wounded. Yet as part of theſe
People belong'd to him, and that
the reſt were his Friends, they did
not enquire into the occaſion of the
Quarrel. All their care was only to
ſecure the young <hi>Janizary,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a narrow way, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
falling into their Hands. In
vain was it that he ſtood upon his
Defence; the Number overwhelm'd
his Vertue, inſomuch, that he was
loaded with Fetters, as if he had
done the moſt criminal action in the
World.</p>
            <p>It was a great misfortune to him,
in that the <hi>Aga</hi> did not ſee how they
miſus'd him; for after having try'd,
as he had done, his Generoſity, in
all likelihood, far from ſuffering
ſuch a thing, he would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it with all his Power. But
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42899:13"/>
the Wound he had receiv'd, and
whoſe danger. I have intimated,
had reduc'd him to ſuch a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as that he had loſt both Speech
and Knowledg. However, it could
not be ſaid, that he had been aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated;
for he had been alſo found
with his Weapons in his Hands:
And thoſe that took the young <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizary,</hi>
did themſelves declare, that
he ſingly had brought him into that
Condition. All this, together with
the Youth of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> (ſo was the
<hi>Janizary</hi>'s Name), and the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he had done, did occaſion his
being generally pity'd by all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
eſpecially when reflexion was
made, that the <hi>Aga</hi> had put a ſignal
Affront upon him; and for which
any man of Courage, as well as he,
would have taken his Revenge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was the firſt
of this Opinion; but with all this
not one durſt interpoſe in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
If it was on one ſide conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that the Reſentment ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42899:14"/>
to Men of Valour, was the
Cauſe of his Fault: on the other,
they made reflexion, that this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was of mighty Conſequence; at
leaſt, without being ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.
Thoſe that had the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
for him, did allow, that if
he was pardon'd, it was the means
to heighten the audaciouſneſs of
the Soldiers againſt their Leaders;
a Crime that already reign'd ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much among the <hi>Militia,</hi> that it
was abſolutely neceſſary to remedy
it. Thus Policy prevailing over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Conſideration, the whole
Diſcourſe was of making him ſerve
for an Example to others. The
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi> himſelf appear'd the
moſt earneſt to have him brought to
a Tryal; but it was only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for under hand he caus'd the
Officers of the Council of War to
be ſounded, by whom he was to
be try'd, to know, whether there
was no way to bring him off. If he
would have employ'd his Authority
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42899:14"/>
in the Caſe, it would have been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
for him; and he needed only to
ſay one word; but he was afraid of
getting the <hi>Odium</hi> of all the Officers
in the Army, that ſeem'd concern'd
in the <hi>Aga</hi>'s revenge.</p>
            <p>Thoſe whom he had thus given
order to ſound the Council of War,
having brought him back word,
that not one of them would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
him any thing, he be-thought
himſelf of a very ſingular Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,
which was to ſend for each of
them apart. Some he told, that
the <hi>Janizary</hi>'s Crime being the
moſt enormous that a Soldier
can commit, there was no Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
great enough to expiate it.
That thus they would oblige
him, by detaining thoſe that
be prone to commit a like Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in condemning him to have
his Hand cut off, and then to be
empal'd alive. His Directions to
others were quite in an other Stile.
He told them, That indeed the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42899:15"/>
               <hi>Janizary</hi> deſerv'd a moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Puniſhment; that Martial Law
requir'd his Hand to be cut off, and
then undergo an infamous Death:
However, as he had perform'd a
thouſand fine Actions, and this the
only ill one, he ſhould be oblig'd
to them, if they would in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
relax of the Rigour of the
Ordinances. That he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of them abſolutely to abſolve
him, but barely to condemn him to
run the <hi>Gauntlet;</hi> a Sentence that
nevertheleſs would be ſufficiently ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
ſeeing, that hardly any thing
worſe can be done to a man, ſave
putting him to death.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
for them to dare to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
him: every one of 'em pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
what he requir'd, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
kept their Words. Thus
when the young <hi>Janizary</hi> came to
a Tryal, they were divided in their
Opinions, ſome requiring he ſhould
be empal'd alive, after having had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42899:15"/>
his Hand cut off, and others, that
he ſhould barely run the Gantlet
Not a man of them would deſiſt
from his Sentiments; ſo as that they
could not agree upon the Sentence,
for which cauſe they had it referr'd
to the <hi>Grand Vizier.</hi> But he, far
from deciding, bid both Parties be
ſtedfaſt; and in the mean while
outwardly to terminate this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
he nominated Six Officers more
to aſſiſt at the Tryal of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs..
He for his Reaſons gave, that
theſe would not perchance be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as the others; and that thus he
ſhould make them agree in their
Sentence. But before he nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, he made them all to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
all that he desired; inſomuch,
that Three opin'd on one ſide, and
Three on the other; which rather
augmented, than laid aſleep the
Diſſention. And indeed I may call
by this name, what had like to have
been the occaſion of a great Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
for every one thinking, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42899:16"/>
the Opinion he declar'd himſelf of,
was that of the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> they
ſpar'd one another ſo little, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having been at hard Words,
they appointed a Rendezvouze, to
ſee one another with Sword in
Hand. Of this the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>
was inform'd by one of thoſe who
thought to make his Court to him,
by letting him ſee to what a Pitch
he was affected to him. He was
not miſtaken; for the thing pleas'd
the <hi>Vizier</hi> extreamly: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
not judging it convenient to
let it proceed farther, he forbid
theſe Officers from proceeding to
any ſuch Extremity; and under
Colour of not augmenting the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of their Enmity, he ſaid,
That ſince they could not agree
upon the Point, he would ſend
away the Priſoner to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
to be try'd by the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>
himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42899:16"/>
All the Officers that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
have found fault, had he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to ſave him, of his ſingle
Authority, far from diving into his
Secret, were the firſt to approve
of his Prudence. Whereupon he
ſent him under a good and ſure
Guard; at leaſt it ſeem'd ſo: but
having way-laid it with Men, that
were ſtill more numerous than the
Convoy, they freed him out of its
Hands, after having put thoſe to
flight that ſhould have oppos'd their
Attempt. The young <hi>Janizary,</hi>
who expected to die at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
as well as in the Camp, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
joy'd at this Adventure, which
he knew not what to attribute to.
However, his joy was but of ſhort
continuance: for he had ſcarcely had
time to thank his Deliverers, when
that the Convoy return'd, with a
Troop of Horſe, which it had met
on the way, and whoſe aſſiſtance it
had implor'd. As ſoon as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſaw this, and that the Match
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42899:17"/>
was not equal, they in their turn
fled, and abandoned the poor <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizary,</hi>
who being ill-mounted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Cuſtom of all Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,
could not follow them, tho
his Heart did. The Convoy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus taken him again, without
much truoble, it did not otherwiſe
mind running after the reſt, who,
to cut off all knowledg of their
March, threw themſelves into a
Forreſt on their Right Hand, and
which contain'd ten Leagues at leaſt
in length.</p>
            <p>By this means the young <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
was conducted to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi>
which the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of, all that he could do, was
to write to the <hi>Sultana Zelinda,</hi>
who was very much his Friend,
that ſhe would employ her Credit,
to ſave him. In the mean while
the <hi>Aga</hi> had had time to recover;
and as he was generous of himſelf,
and that beſides, he valu'd the
young <hi>Janizary's</hi> Courage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42899:17"/>
he had had good proof in the
Combat he had had with him, he
was no ſooner upon his Legs, but that
he entreated the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> to
ſuffer him to go to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
where he promis'd him to do all
that in him lay, to obtain the
young <hi>Janizary</hi>'s Pardon. The
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi> having this very much
at Heart, did not only give him
leave, but that he might make the
more expedition, he advis'd him
to embark in a Ship, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him. The <hi>Aga</hi> accepted it,
and going accordingly on Board,
there aroſe ſo great a Storm the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
firſt day, that he was forc'd to
come to an Anchor on the Coaſts
of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> This Re-publick
was then in Peace with the Port, ſo
as that the <hi>Aga</hi> there met with all
ſort of good Reception. He ſtaid
two or three days, waiting for good
weather; and in that ſpace a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
came to beg of him, he would
give her leave to embark in his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42899:18"/>
Ship, when that he made Sail.
This Woman, who was already
pretty well advanc'd in years, had
a Daughter with her of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Beauty; and the <hi>Aga</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſhe would go the Voyage
too, not only granted her Requeſt,
in conſideration of the Damſel,
but likewiſe made her a thouſand
offers of Service. For he ſaid in
himſelf, that this was a Bit fit for
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Tooth; and
that if he could make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of her, he ſhould not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>Janizary</hi>'s Pardon, but that
he ſhould alſo oblige his Maſter to
do many things for him.</p>
            <p>While that he fed himſelf with
theſe hopes, the Woman told him,
that this Beauteous Perſon, who
was her Daughter, would not go
the Voyage; which oblig'd him to
take other meaſures. That which he
contriv'd, was to conceal what paſs'd
in his Mind; telling this Lady, on
the contrary, That ſhe did well, in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42899:18"/>
not expoſing her Daughter to the
danger of the Sea, or to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of a long Voyage. By
this means he remov'd all the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
ſhe might have conceiv'd,
joyn'd to this, that he never look'd
upon this Beautiful Perſon, but as
if ſhe had been altogether indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to him. In the mean while,
the day of his departure being
come, and the Nymph returning
to conduct her Mother to the Ship,
he made Sail all on the ſudden. The
Mother having perceiv'd, that they
were moving, begg'd of him, to
cauſe the Long-boat to be put out,
to carry her Daughter back on
Shoar: But the <hi>Aga</hi> ſeeing that there
was no longer any danger for him,
in declaring his Mind, he told her
plainly, that her Daughter was too
lovely to be the Wife of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſon; that he pretended to
preſent her to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
as ſoon as he was arriv'd at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi>
That he believ'd ſhe would
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42899:19"/>
infinitely pleaſe him: But if it
prov'd not ſo, her Fortune would
be greater than if ſhe ſtaid in her
own Countrey: That he had not
been able to ſee her, without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her the moſt Charming Perſon
breathing; and that if he did not
love her, it was only for that it was
not allowable in a Slave, as he was,
to lift up his Eyes upon a Perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for his Lord: That he ſaid
no more, becauſe he was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to explain his mind further;
that Time would ſhew the reſt;
and that this depended on the
manner of her Reception by the
<hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Complement was extreamly
vexatious to this Lady, as well as to
her Daughter: And it is impoſſible
to relate all the melting things they
ſaid to perſwade him, nor how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tears they ſhed, ſeeing their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
were in vain. However,
that I may not dwell longer upon
a Subject ſo worthy of Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42899:19"/>
you muſt know, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
to the <hi>Aga</hi>'s Deſires, he
had ſo fair a Wind, that his Ship
made more way in Two Hours
than he expected to do in Four.
By this means he arriv'd at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
before that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was
conducted thither; which was of
extream conſequence to him, ſince
it was to be feared, that the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> might take a Fancy to put
him to Death as ſoon as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd.
It was no extraordinary
thing, that the <hi>Aga</hi> ſhould have this
thought, ſince he was ignorant of
what the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> had done
for him, or that he had written to
the <hi>Sultana</hi> in his behalf. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
having begg'd Audience of the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> he preſented him
the Beautiful Perſon he had brought
along with him, who was in ſome
manner chang'd, both by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency
of the Sea, and out of
Grief to be thus led into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
But though for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42899:20"/>
ſhe did not ſhine ſo much as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually,
ſhe nevertheleſs appear'd ſo
beauteous and charming to the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that he whiſper'd
to himſelf a thouſand times, that
there was nothing in his <hi>Serraglio</hi>
comparable to her. He made her
at the ſame time ſeveral magnificent
Preſents, and worthy of ſo great a
Prince. This Beautiful Perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
inſenſible to all this, as well
as to the other Tokens of Love
given her by the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi>
But as the Will of thoſe Princes
ſerves for Law in all their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whatever repugnance ſhe had
to grant him any favour, ſhe could
not diſpenſe her ſelf from doing all
that he required.</p>
            <p>Enjoyment, which is wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
all Deſires in other Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
produc'd a quite contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in him. It is impoſſible to ſay
to what Degree he lov'd her; and
his fondneſs appear'd ſo ſtrong, that
it gave a jealouſie to all the other
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42899:20"/>
               <hi>Sultana's</hi> of the <hi>Serraglio.</hi> In the
mean while, ſhe had not been eight
days thus declared the Favourite,
when the Guard that conducted
the <hi>Janizary</hi> arriv'd. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it, having had Audience of
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> he preſented
him the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Letter, by
which this Principal Officer inform'd
him of all that paſs'd between the
<hi>Aga</hi> and the <hi>Janizary:</hi> And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
him with Sentiments of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he gave him an exact Account
of all the Occaſions <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had
been in; and forgot not to give
him the Praiſes that were due to
him. While that the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>
read this Letter, the <hi>Aga</hi> being
then preſent, had his Eyes fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, to mind after what manner
he took the thing; and he only
waited till he had done, to throw
himſelf at his Feet, and demand his
Pardon. For after having chang'd
Colour ſeveral times while that he
read this Letter, an indubitable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42899:21"/>
mark that it ſenſibly affected him;
he toar it in a thouſand pieces; then
walking thereupon, as a furious
man; <hi>This inſolent Wretch ſhall pay
for it,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>and I am over joy'd
that he is brought hither, that he may
gratifie my own ſight with his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How!</hi> continued he, <hi>to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
his</hi> Aga! <hi>And what Torment
can be invented, but what he deſerves
to have a thouſand times more
cruel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every one ſeeing the</hi> Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>in so great a Paſſion, caſt down
their Eyes, and trembled. Thus
not a Perſon but look'd on</hi> Ibrahim
<hi>as a loſt Man, and all People pitty'd
him, without knowing him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by Fame. In the mean
time</hi> Sultana Zelinda, <hi>being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what paſs'd, ſent to entreat
the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>to come and ſee
her upon a matter of moment ſhe
had to ſay to him. The</hi> Grand
Signior <hi>went thither, and as ſoon as
ſhe ſaw him, ſhe went about to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42899:21"/>
him, in favour of the</hi> Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zary,
<hi>by a Relation of his fine Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>not
being pleas'd with this Diſcourſe,</hi>
Yes, Madam, <hi>he anſwer'd,</hi> he has
done all you ſay: but d' ye alſo know
what he has done more? D' ye know
that he would have kill'd his <hi>Aga?</hi>
And that to morrow I'le have him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal'd
before my Eyes? Ah! God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
Sir, <hi>the</hi> Sultana <hi>anſwer'd,</hi> and
have you no more care of your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.
Conſider, Sir, that after thoſe
Trials of Skill this poor Wretch has
made, he is born for the Glory of your
Empire. If he had had leſs Courage,
he would more patiently have born the
Affront put on him by the <hi>Aga.</hi> See
with what greatneſs of Mind he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
revenging himſelf, when it was
in his Power to do it. He fires his
Piſtols in the Air, againſt a Man that
had newly fir'd two at him. Where
is the Man that has done the ſame
thing? and what Example have you
of it in your Empire? Beſides, if
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42899:22"/>
your Celſitude did but conſider what
you might expect from ſuch a Man,
who is ſaid not to be Eighteen Years
old as yet; and if you be not reſolv'd
to yield to ſo many illuſtrious Marks
of Valour, that you would, at leaſt,
yield to my Entreaties. Yes, Sir,
<hi>continued ſhe,</hi> 'tis I that implore your
Mercy for that unfortunate Man.
You know, Sir, I know him not; but
I am ſo affected with his great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that though he were my Brother,
I ſhould not intercede more for him.
<hi>At theſe words ſhe threw her ſelf
at his Feet, and embrac'd his Knees,
telling him, ſhe would never riſe,
unleſs he granted her Requeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Sultana</hi> had formerly been
his whole Inclination; and it was
only ſince the Arrival of the New
Commer, that her Credit was no
longer ſo great. Nevertheleſs, this
Prince ſtill expreſs'd a great regard
for her; and the World ſaw, that
notwithſtanding his new fondneſs,
he ſtill honour'd her with his Viſits.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42899:22"/>
Wherefore ſhe did certainly believe
that her Requeſt was going to be
granted her. But this Prince ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,
that it was for his Intereſt
to puniſh a Crime, that being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,
might give an Ill Example
to his Soldiery; <hi>Ask me, Madam,</hi>
ſaid he to her at the ſame time, <hi>all
you pleaſe, and I will inſtantly grant
it you; but do not importune me any
longer, I beſeech you for a thing which
I muſt, of all neceſſity, deny you. It
ſenſibly troubles me, loving you ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
as I do; but you would not have
my Complaiſance proceed ſo far, as to
injure my Empire. You ſee the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of it as well as I; but as I
fancy, you did not reflect upon them.</hi>
Thereupon he repreſented to her,
how neceſſary it was to keep up O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
among the Soldiery; and
that if <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was not puniſh'd, all
the others would think it allowable
in them to do what he had done.
However, to let her ſee, that it was
not out of Paſſion that he ſpoke in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42899:23"/>
this manner, tho he had manifeſted
ſome in the beginning of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
upon her Conſideration, he
chang'd the manner of his Death,
and promis'd her, that he ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be be-headed.</p>
            <p>As this <hi>Sultana</hi> did not act of her
own motion, and that it was only to
do the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> a kindneſs, ſhe
would not importune him any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
contenting her ſelf with telling
him, that her Deſign was not to
torment him; but that if he could
have granted her this Requeſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injuring of himſelf, ſhe ſhould
have been much obliged to him.
The <hi>Aga,</hi> who had ſaid nothing as
yet, having learnt, that this <hi>Sultana</hi>
had been refus'd, durſt not ſpeak,
well knowing, that his Credit did
not come near to hers. Thus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
now was expected, but to ſee
the <hi>Janizary</hi> dye, the Day of whoſe
Execution was aſſign'd on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had the
Cruelty to have it perform'd in his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42899:23"/>
Preſence, and appointed the Place
under the Windows of the <hi>Serrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi>
contrary to the uſual Cuſtom.
The Hour drawing near, he went
to the new-come <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Room,
and there, without being ſeen, he
view'd through a Lettice-Window,
the whole Preparation for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
having the Young <hi>Sultana</hi>
by his ſide, and her Mother, whom
he had left with her. A Moment
after came the Young <hi>Janizary;</hi> and
the Mother had no ſooner caſt her
Eyes upon him, but that ſhe cry'd
out; <hi>Ah, Sir, what ſee I here! this
is my Son; and if you do not pardon
him, I ſhall die at your Feet.</hi> Theſe
Words did extreamly ſurpriſe the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> as well as the Young
<hi>Sultana:</hi> And the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
imagining, that ſome body made
her ſay this, to ſave him: <hi>Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
ſaid he to her, <hi>how can this be
your Son? and though it were ſo, how
can you know him again, he that is not
above Eighteen Years old, and has
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42899:24"/>
been here above theſe Fourteen? It is
my very Son, Sir,</hi> ſhe anſwer'd him
in a frightful Condition, <hi>and if you
have any kindneſs for the Siſter, ſave
her unhappy Brother.</hi> Thereupon
ſhe told him ſuccinctly the Mark ſhe
had caus'd to be made upon him,
that ſhe might know him again; and
that ſhe came to ſeek him out, when
that the <hi>Aga</hi> ſtole away her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
She added, That if it was her
Son, he muſt likewiſe have a Mark
on the left Arm, but which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;
That it was of the form of a
Pigeon: and that if it were not ſo,
ſhe did not pretend he ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a Perſon that had had the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
to diſpleaſe him.</p>
            <p>The Young <hi>Sultana</hi> hearing the
Mother talk in this manner, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
partaking in her Grief, ſhe
threw her ſelf at the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>'s
Feet, and told him, That after
having rais'd her to the Rank ſhe
poſſeſs'd, ſhe did not think he would
give her the Affliction of ſeeing her
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42899:24"/>
Brother paſs through the Hands of
an Executioner: That ſhe found her
ſelf in a ſtrange Concern, a Token
that her Mother was not miſtaken:
That ſhe muſt however tell him the
ſame thing that ſhe had told him;
namely, that they ſhould view his
Arm, and then paſs on to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
in caſe they did not find the
deſigned Mark. The <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>
taking care to lift her up again;
<hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>what
you demand is juſt; and though I
am going to make a ſcurvy Buſineſs
on't with the</hi> Sultana Zelinda, <hi>to
whom I have refus'd</hi> Ibrahim'<hi>s Life,
I am very glad that this has thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
to let you ſee, that I conſider you
above all others.</hi> At theſe words, he
gave a Slave order, to go immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the Place, where the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was going to be perform'd,
to make the <hi>Janizary</hi> ſhew his Left
Arm; and if the Mark before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
was there, to cry out Pardon
at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42899:25"/>
The Slave knowing what part the
<hi>Sultana.</hi> Favourite took in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
did not leave off running
till ſhe came to the Place, where it
had been too late, had ſhe ſtaid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo little longer. For indeed in
a moment later it had been done;
and, as I may ſay, the Executioner
had already his Arm lift up to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
his Work. But the coming in
of this Slave having ſtopp'd him:
<hi>Look upon me,</hi> ſaid ſhe to the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zary,</hi>
who did not mind her: <hi>I come
from the</hi> Grand Signior, <hi>and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
thee to ſhew me thy Left Arm
bare. Does he already repent,</hi> he
anſwer'd her with a firmneſs becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his great Courage, <hi>of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to me? If he will have my Hand
to be cut off, 'tis not the Left I am to
give thee, but the Right, with which
I attack'd the</hi> Aga. At the same
time he preſented the Hand to him
he then mention'd: But the Slave
ſaid to him, <hi>The</hi> Grand Signior <hi>does
not ſend me hither to do thee more
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42899:25"/>
harm than thou haſt receiv'd. I can ſay
no more to thee, but ſhew thy Obedience
to his Commands, by letting me ſee
the other Arm inſtead of this.</hi> The
<hi>Janizary</hi> ſeem'd very indifferent at
theſe Words, and ſhewing her what
ſhe demanded, ſhe had no ſooner
turn'd up his Shirt Sleeve, but that
ſhe perceiv'd the Form of a Pigeon:
She immediately cry'd out, <hi>Pardon,
pardon;</hi> which amaz'd all thoſe that
were preſent, who knew that <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Zelinda</hi> had been refus'd the ſame
thing, as was declar'd by the Slave.
The Officers would not believe her
upon her bare word; but alſo not
daring to proceed, becauſe that ſhe
ſpake in the name of the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi>
they ſent to know his Pleaſure.
The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> confirm'd what
ſhe had ſaid: And thus in an Inſtant
the <hi>Janizary</hi> was ſeen to paſs from a
ſhameful Puniſhment, to a Fortune
that would have been much greater,
but for an unhappy Accident that
befel his Siſter: She was become
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42899:26"/>
big with Child, miſcarry'd, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that had a flux of blood, that
hinder'd the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her of a long time in private:
And as ſhe no longer contributed
to his pleaſures, ſhe was quickly in
the Rank of forgotten Perſons.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> became
more than ever in favour. She had
mortally hated the other, during the
little time ſhe had been in Credit;
Not content to ſee her ſelf triumph
o're her Rival, through the Diſaſter
that was befallen her, ſhe did what
ſhe could to ruine her entirely in
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Opinion. She
forged ſeveral Letters, by which ſhe
ſeem'd to be a Damſel that had had
ſeveral Intrigues in her own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
And if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had
been Credulous, ſhe would have
been ſhamefully turn'd out of the
<hi>Serraglio.</hi> But this Prince knowing
what to attribute this Detraction to,
and who beſides look'd upon himſelf
as the only Cauſe: of this <hi>Sultana</hi>'s
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42899:26"/>
Calamity, entreated <hi>Zelinda</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him no longer with ſuch like
Diſcourſes; adding, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſhe muſt live in good Terms
with her, if ſhe meant to be agreeable
to him.</p>
            <p>This Advice was a kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Thus <hi>Zelinda</hi> was to uſe
Violence to her own Inclination.
But what is not a Perſon capable of,
when the Buſineſs is to captivate the
Heart of a Great Monarch? Not
only ſhe abſtain'd from ſpeaking ill
of her any more, but ſhe likewiſe
ſaw her with as great Expreſſion of
Kindneſs as any other: So true is it,
That when the Maſter commands,
nothing is impoſſible. This pleas'd
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> extreamly, who
was daily more and more concern'd
at the unhappy Condition the other
<hi>Sultana</hi> was reduc'd to. For you
muſt know, that her flux of Blood
did not ceaſe, which was doubtleſs
worthy of Compaſſion. Now that
he might declare to her his Regret
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42899:27"/>
for her Illneſs, he granted her all the
Favours ſhe demanded of him: nay,
and often prevented her Requeſts:
Inſomuch, that Pity, with him, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Place of Love. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could ſo much perſwade her of
the Conſideration he had for her, as
his giving her Brother leave to come
ſee her Twice a Week in the <hi>Serrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</hi>
A thing that was never ſeen in
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
will never be ſeen again. He
had already given him the Office of
Vice-Admiral of the Seas, and had
heap'd ſundry other Favours upon
him; inſomuch, that he might be
ſaid to be a fine Example of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
of Fortune, who after
having us'd him ſo ſeverely, ſmil'd
ſo much upon him at that time, ſo
far, as that he was one of the Men of
that Empire, to whom He promis'd
moſt, and who, on his ſide, had
the fineſt Qualities therewith to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond.
For tho we daily ſee, that
ſhe makes her Choice fall upon ſuch
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42899:27"/>
Perſons as are unworthy of it; yet
muſt you agree with me, that when
ſhe ſheds her Favours upon Men of
Worth and Ability, they are much
more capable of keeping them than
others.</p>
            <p>This is a Truth that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd.
But without dwelling long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
upon this Subject, you muſt
know, that one day when he went
to ſee his Siſter, the <hi>Sultana Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
came thither, but in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Magnificency, that had
ſhe had a Deſign of Dazling the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> ſhe could not have
done more. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
had given the ſick <hi>Sultana</hi> order,
not to admit any body into her
Lodgings while her Brother was
there. Thus when the other came
to the Door, ſhe let her know, that
ſhe was extreamly griev'd that ſhe
could not receive her, and told her
the Occaſion. But <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi>
made anſwer, that the Prohibition
was not for her; and at the worſt,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42899:28"/>
it was but letting the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
know nothing of the matter. This
anſwer ſeem'd very <hi>ſparkiſh</hi> to the
ſick <hi>Sultana;</hi> and as ſhe was afraid
of incurring the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
Diſpleaſure, ſhe roſe up haſtily to
go mind her her ſelf, that far from
the Prohibition's not being made for
her, it would be found to be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
on her account, if the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> was brought to explain his
Intentions. But the other making
a Jeaſt of all ſhe ſaid to her, reply'd,
That they were Both too wiſe ever
to ſay a Word of the matter; and
that thus there was no great danger
in not remembring the Prohibition.
And going ſtill on, as ſhe ſaid theſe
Words, ſhe came into the Room,
where was the ſick <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Since he had been in <hi>Turky</hi>
he had ſeen a World of fine Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
ſo as that he had no reaſon to
be ſurpriz'd at Beauty: yet could
he not ſuſtain the Luſtre of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>'s,
which he gaz'd upon with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42899:28"/>
Admiration. But this Admiration
produc'd no Softneſſes and Wiſhings,
either that he was withheld by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
or, as is more probable, that
Sympathy, which is wont to produce
ſuch ſurprizing effects in an Inſtant,
was not in him. He would have
gone away that very moment, which
put <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> in a Maze; and
ſhe ask'd him, whether ſhe frighted
him? He made her ſuch an Anſwer
as <hi>Gallantry</hi> requir'd of him to ſuch
a Queſtion as that: Then he added,
That he knew the Reſpect he ow'd
her, and that this was the Cauſe that
he was content to deprive himſelf
of the Pleaſure there was in ſeeing
her. <hi>That's being too wiſe, and too
prudent,</hi> ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of your Age: And if Reſpect, as
you ſay, obliges you to be gone, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
you from that, nay, and require
you to ſtay here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe ſeem'd very free
for ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Zelinda,</hi> who
had ſo many meaſures to keep: and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42899:29"/>
the ſick <hi>Sultana,</hi> and her Brother,
did preſently imagine that ſhe muſt
have powerful Reaſon to induce
her to talk in that manner. If it
had been becoming a Man to have
had a little good Opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> might have fancy'd
that he had ſome ſhare therein; and
though this had happen'd, he would
not have been much in the wrong,
ſince in Truth <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> was
fallen in Love with him, upon the
Rumour of his Reputation; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that being very willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her ſelf, whether greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
were not beſtow'd upon
him than were due to him, ſhe had
paſs'd o're a great many Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to have a ſight of him. Thus
was ſhe far from ſuffering him to be
gone; and as People are wont to
interpret all things to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
ſhe took for Tokens of a bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Paſſion, all the fine things he
could not forbear ſaying to her, both
upon her Beauty and her Wit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:42899:29"/>
It is a wonder how <hi>Ibrahim</hi> came
away from this Interview, without
being in Love. For it is certain ſhe
did all ſhe could to pleaſe him,
which joyn'd to her Beauty, which
was not Common, ought to produce
great effect upon a Man of Eighteen
Years old. She was oblig'd to go
away firſt, becauſe that word was
brought her, that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
was going into her Apartment.
<hi>Fough,</hi> ſaid ſhe in <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Ear, <hi>he
knows not how troubleſome his Viſit is
to me; and if I might ſpeak my Mind,
I ſhould deſire him to put it off till an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was a ſufficient hint to a man
that was not ſtupid: But what gave
him ſtill a better Opinion of his
good Fortune, is, that ſhe preſs'd his
Hand at her going away. He
thought not fitting to ſay the leaſt
of this to his Siſter, though he was
not wont to conceal the leaſt thing
from her; but he believ'd there to
be ſuch as he could not divulge,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42899:30"/>
without being wanting to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a well-bred Man, and he
plac'd in the Number of theſe what
had newly happen'd.</hi> Sultana Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda
<hi>being gone, the beauteous ſick</hi>
Sultana <hi>ask'd him, what he thought
of her:</hi> All that a man can think,
Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> of a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Perſon; and I know only You
that ever was capable of diſputing the
Prize of Beauty with her. What I
now ſay, <hi>he continued,</hi> ought not to
be ſuſpected by you: You know, that
Flattery is very ill becoming in the
Mouth of a Perſon that has the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of being ſo nearly related to you:
But if what I now ſay to you, be not
ſufficient to perſwade you of my ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
I mean to tell you with the ſame
ingenuity, that I have hardly in my
Life ſeen a more Beautiful Perſon;
and yet I know none that affects me
leſs.</p>
            <p>This Converſe held them till the
time requir'd for him to go to his
own Houſe. The fair, though ſick
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42899:30"/>
               <hi>Sultana,</hi> was over-joy'd to ſee him
have theſe Sentiments: For though
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had commanded
her to live in good Terms with <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana
Zelinda,</hi> ſhe againſt her had a
certain Jealouſie, which is natural
to Perſons that aſpire to one and the
ſame Heart. And indeed, though
in the beginning ſhe had only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Deſires, out
of a kind of neceſſity, ſhe came in
proceſs of time, to reliſh the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
not, perchance, his Perſon,
but at leaſt the Grandeur of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
which he had ſhar'd with her,
ſo long as ſhe had enjoy'd a perfect
Health. So ſweet a time being ever
preſent to her Memory, ſhe wiſh'd
nothing ſo much as that ſhe might
recover. It was rather on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
than to deliver her from the
Indiſpoſition ſhe labour'd under,
that ſhe ſent for Phyſicians from all
parts, to whom ſhe promis'd Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Sums, if they could ſtop the
Malady with which ſhe was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42899:31"/>
Several promis'd her what
they did not perform; but at laſt,
after having paſs'd through the
Hands of all theſe Quacks, there
was one that offer'd his Service, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her, that he would ſtake his
Life againſt her Recovery. That
nevertheleſs, as ſhe was weakned
both by the Nature of her Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the violent Remedies that
had been given her, it requir'd time
to ſee the effects of his Promiſes, for
as much as that ſhe was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
by little and little, before the
laſt Hand could be put to her Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>The Promiſes this Phyſician made
were quickly divulg'd throughout
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Court; and tho
they could hardly obtain Credit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo many others that had fail'd the
beauteous <hi>Sultana;</hi> yet <hi>Zelinda</hi> was
allarum'd at them, principally when
ſhe knew, that by the Means of the
Remedies he had given her, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
began to mend daily. She
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42899:31"/>
would willingly have doubted of it,
ſo ungrateful was the thing to her;
but it was impoſſible for her to do it,
ſeeing her ſelf, by the Change that
appear'd in her Face, that to think
the contrary, would be to flatter her
ſelf. However, you muſt know,
that ſhe ſtill continu'd to love her
Rival's Brother: and of this ſhe had
given him ſeveral Tokens, in ſome
other Viſits which ſhe had ſtill paid
him when he was there. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
things had not proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as yet, either for want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
or that perhaps ſhe was
afraid of truſting her Secret with a
Perſon engag'd in Intereſts ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to hers. But in ſhort, ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
o're this Conſideration in ſome
days after, and that becauſe ſhe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd
ſhe ſaw in him a Love that fell
in nothing ſhort of hers. It was in
her Siſters Apartment; where ſhe
imagin'd ſhe perceiv'd it. She was
gone to pay her a Viſit, after her
uſual manner; and diſcourſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42899:32"/>
with him of the return of
her Siſters Health; <hi>She will be more
beautiful than ever,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him;
<hi>and as the</hi> Sultan <hi>will not fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
his Flames, you will quickly
ſhare his Favour with her. I do not
envy,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>her happineſs; but
I am vex'd that the Benefits you are
going to receive, ſhould come to you
through any other hands than mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I tell his Anſwer, you muſt
know, that what ever indifference
he had entertain'd for her in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
he had in the proceſs of
time, found ſo many Charms in her
Converſation, that if he was not
Hand over Head in Love with her,
yet it might be ſaid, that ſhe was not
indifferent to him; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
taking that time to declare the
Sentiments to her he had for her, <hi>I
love my Siſter,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>as a
Brother is bound to love her; but in
ſhort, if I was ſuffer'd to tell my whole
thoughts upon the matter, as there are
others in the World whom I love infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42899:32"/>
more, it would be much more
grateful to me, that they took care of
my Fortune. Wherefore,</hi> added he,
<hi>if it muſt b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to their Prejudice, that
ſhe recovers her Health, though it
would be more handſome in me to think
it than to ſay it, I am willing you
ſhould know, that I wiſh ſhe might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be cured.</hi> This was a ſufficient
Explanation of his Mind, as not to
leave any room for doubt, but that
ſhe was the Party ment in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
So as that ſhe was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well ſatisfy'd: And as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that makes greater progreſs
with a Perſon, as her knowing that
you correſpond with her Paſſion,
<hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> was quickly ſenſible
of ſuch raging Flames, that ſhe was
oblig'd to unboſome them to their
Author.</p>
            <p>It was not without Confuſion
however, that ſhe reſolved to take
this Courſe. Such a ſtep is ever a
wrecking ſort of Buſineſs to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
and if ordinary ſort of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42899:33"/>
make ſuch a do in coming to that
paſs, what muſt it not be when it
befalls ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Zelinda?</hi>
Nevertheleſs, Love being ſtronger
in her than all the Reflexions ſhe
could make, ſhe took Pen and Ink,
and wrote theſe Words to him:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Sultana Zelinda's Letter to

                  <p>IT is time that I lay aſide the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that ſtop me. I love you, ſince
I muſt needs tell it you: And indeed,
to what purpoſe would it be for me to
conceal it, ſince you are ſufficiently
clear ſighted, to ſee it in every thing
I daily do. Your Siſter has no ſhare
in the Viſits I make her: You ought to
make the Application of them wholly
to your ſelf: And ſhe is ſo very far
from flattering her ſelf with them, as
that we both of us make ſuch Figures,
as would hinder us from ever being
good Friends, had ſhe not a Brother
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42899:33"/>
that is capable of making me forget
all things. Thus let her in peace enjoy
the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Heart; I ſhall never be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

            <p>
               <hi>Ibrahim</hi> being daily more and
more taken with the <hi>Sultana Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
reliſh'd this Letter extreamly;
and for fear ſhe ſhould repent of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

his own Gallantries in theſe
Terms:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>Ibrahim's Anſwer to Sultana

                  <p>IF hitherto nothing but my Looks
has told you, that I love you, do
not think, Madam, that I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by any other Conſideration, than
the Reſpect I have for you. I do not
fear enting upon the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Tenures,
and though it were to coſt me my
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42899:34"/>
Life, I am prepar'd for all, rather
than remain any longer in ſilence. Thus
it is not your Letter that quickens me,
I had already my Pen in Hand, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, that you are the moſt lovely
Perſon in the World, and that I am
the moſt in love of all men. Give
me, I beſeech you, Madam, an Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
elſewhere than at your Siſters;
You will ſee, that the Expreſſion I have

            <p>Though <hi>Ibrahim</hi> took mighty
pleaſure in reading the Letter that
was ſent him, yet <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi>
was no leſs ſatisfy'd than he. Thus
Both having Sentiments ſo conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to one another, they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
when they ſaw one another at
the Siſters Lodgings, to procure a
more particular Interview to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<hi>Zelinda</hi> brib'd an Eunuch,
who introduc'd <hi>Ibrahim</hi> privately
into her Apartment; and there they
interchang'd ſo many Teſtimonies of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42899:34"/>
a Reciprocal Love, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpent the Night together, <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
did not talk of going, nor <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana
Zelinda</hi> of ſending him away
home. In the mean while, it being
already broad-day, and <hi>Zelinda</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to ſhew her ſelf to her Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Woman,
ſhe ſhut <hi>Ibrahim</hi> up in
a Cloſet; and he, in hopes of having
the ſame Pleaſures the following
Night, as he had had the Night paſt,
was not at all ſorry to be thus put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Priſon. He there ſpent Two or
Three Hours in be-witching Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
as is uſual with happy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
But, as there is nothing ſo
common as to ſee them paſs all on the
ſudden, from the top of Happineſs
to an Abyſs of Miſeries, at the time
he was deepeſt plung'd in theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Thoughts, he heard a great
noiſe, which oblig'd him to liſten. It
was the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who was
come to ſee <hi>Sultana Zelinda;</hi> and
Both being ſeated pretty near the
Cloſet-Door, he heard the <hi>Sultan</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42899:35"/>
ſpeaking theſe Words to her:</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange thing, <hi>Zelinda,</hi> to
ſee how you uſe me at preſent: I love
you daily more and more, and yet far
from correſponding therewith, you can
hardly ſuffer my Careſſes. I ſee that
all you do is only out of Conſtraint;
and as that is not natural, ſome body
muſt certainly have robb'd me of your
heart. There was a time when I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
my ſelf, that I had it all entire;
and when I compare ſo happy a time
with the preſent, I find my ſelf under
ſo profound a Grief, that I know not
how it comes that I do not die of deſpair.
For you I renounce all the other <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana's:</hi>
With whatever Charms Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has provided them, my Eyes are
not favourable to them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
they all do what they can to pleaſe
me. Whereas you now look on me ſo
indifferently, that it ſeems as if. I was
burdenſome to you. What does all
this mean, Madam, <hi>added he,</hi> can
I be ſo unhappy, as that you ſhould have
a diſguſt for me, or that my Conduct
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42899:35"/>
ſhould make me incur ſo ill a Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
If I am the cauſe of it, you
need only to ſpeak, and you will ſee
me ſo complaiſant, that though I were
your Slave, I could not obey you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But what do I ſay! Am not I
effectually ſo? And do you ſee, that
I ever in your regard, made uſe of the
Power given me by the Rank I here
hold. All the People you ſee of both
Sexes, make it their main Pride to
ſooth my Will; and for my part,
I make it mine wholly to ſooth
yours.</p>
            <p>Such a Diſcourſe at any time is
troubleſome, principally when one
knows, that there is ſome ground
for it: But it's quite another thing,
when a natural Coldneſs is joyn'd to
ſome Conſideration. Thus the Fear
<hi>Zelinda</hi> was in for her Lover, who
was not ſo well concealed, but that
he might be diſcovered, rendring
her altogether unhing'd, or rather,
quite nonpluſs'd and in utter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
ſhe made ſuch a ſorry De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42899:36"/>
that the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who
was not, perhaps, as yet jealous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to harbour ſome gauling appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.
<hi>You have reaſon, Madam,</hi>
he ſaid to her, <hi>for not vouchſafing me
ſo much as the trouble of diſabuſing
me: When one hates People, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
indifferent, whether they think they
are beloved or not. But, what do I
ſay? You would be glad that I left you,
that ſo you might be at eaſe.</hi> He then
held his Peace, to ſee whether ſhe
would uſe her utmoſt endeavour<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to give him better Impreſſions: but
perceiving that ſhe continued in a
kind of Inſenſibility, which was
worſe to him, a thouſand times,
than the greateſt Slights: <hi>Ah! this
is too much, Madam,</hi> renew'd he,
<hi>and ſince now I can no longer doubt,
but that you deſpiſe me, at leaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being inſenſible, I muſt watch ſo
narrowly, to diſcover who can be the
Cauſe of it, that nothing may eſcape my
Penetration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42899:36"/>
               <hi>At theſe words he roſe up, all in
Anger, and his Deſign was to be
gone that very Inſtant; but his Love
detaining him in ſpight of his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
But pray, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to
her,</hi> have you nothing to ſay to me?
And will ye let me go away deſperate?
What can I ſay to you, Sir? <hi>ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
him:</hi> And if you be in an ill
Humour, am I the Cauſe of it? Yes,
that's it that makes me now incur all
theſe Complaints: wherefore, as I
hope it will quickly be over, far from
detaining you, I ſhould be glad you
would go your ways. <hi>She paid him
her Reſpects after the rate of our
Womens Courteſies, as ſoon as ſhe
had finiſh'd this Diſcourſe: And the</hi>
Grand Signior <hi>not being wont to be
treated in this manner:</hi> Yes, I will
go, Perfidious Woman, <hi>he ſaid to
her,</hi> ſince you will have it ſo. Nay,
I'le do more: I am going to uſe my
utmoſt endeavours to forget thee; and
happy ſhall I be, if I can accompliſh
this Deſign. Nevertheleſs, I muſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42899:37"/>
tell thee, that I plainly perceive from
whence thy inſenſibility proceeds; thou
loveſt ſome other; and as thou muſt
have ſeduced the People that are about
thee, to ſerve thee in thy new Paſſion,
my Wrath is going to pour upon them,
till ſuch time as that my Love does
permit me to revenge my ſelf on thee.
<hi>At theſe Words he ſent for all thoſe
he had plac'd about the</hi> Sultana, <hi>and
after having queſtion'd them each
by him, or her ſelf, and threatned
cruelly, for that they had not with
ſufficient Fidelity look'd after the</hi>
Sultaneſs; <hi>he caus'd Two to be
ſtrangled in his Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was matter to ſtartle her
mightily, as well as</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>who
heard all that paſs'd, from the place
where he was ſhut up. However,
after having thus given Inſtances of
his Cruelty, he went his ways in a
terrible ſtorm. But hardly was he
got out of her Chamber, but that
he return'd his Eyes, all ſparkling
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42899:37"/>
with Fury:</hi> Open me, Madam, <hi>ſaid
he to her,</hi> your Cloſet, to ſee if you
have not had the imprudence to keep
ſome Love-Letters: And ſince that
I am ſo unhappy, that the People I have
plac'd about you, are more truſty to
you than me, let me, at leaſt, omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what may inform me of the
Occaſion of my Misfortune. <hi>It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to apprehend, that theſe did
ſtrangely ſurprize the</hi> Sultana <hi>as well
as</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>who had heard them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.
However,</hi> Zelinda, <hi>after
having committed the fault of not
managing this Prince, as became her,
by ſome kind Words, hoping that
ſhe might repair it:</hi> Ah, Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe
to him,</hi> Muſt your Celſitude needs
continue to outrage me by the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſuſpicions imaginable? Should I
write to any Body but my Dear Lord?
And ſhould I receive Letters from any
other than himſelf? <hi>In ſaying theſe
Words, ſhe threw her Arms about
his Neck: but he ſtepping back,</hi>
How, Madam, <hi>he anſwer'd her,</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42899:38"/>
from whence comesit, that you are ſo
ſenſible to this Reproach, and that you
were not ſo but a moment ago to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others that I made you. I ſaid a
thouſand things t' ye more outraging
than this; and not content with
Words, I proceeded to Effects. All
this, nevertheleſs, was not capable, as
I may ſay, of unlocking your Teeth.
You ſaw, that I exerciſed my Justice
upon Wretches, without ſo much as
vouchſafing to implore my Mercy.
What'<hi>s</hi> the meaning of your talking
now, when what I do does not come
near the hundredth part of what I
did. I muſt certainly, <hi>added he,</hi>
have caught you by your Feeble; and
I beſeech you to open this Cloſet to me
inſtantly, to ſee whether I be miſtaken
or not. <hi>The</hi> Sultana <hi>ſeeing that her
Artifices had availed her nothing,
found her ſelf ſtill at a greater loſs
than before. She would ſtill have
trifled him off with ſome ſorry Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
but he, inſtead of being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſatisfy'd, thinking, as it was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42899:38"/>
true, that all her Excuſes only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the fear ſhe was in of
his diſcovering her Concerns:</hi> Ah!
this is delaying too much, Madam,
<hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> and if you give me not
the Key which I demand of you, I
ſhall quickly break open the Door.
<hi>The</hi> Sultana <hi>no longer knowing
what to ſay, made ſemblance of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for it in her Pocket, and not
finding it, making the</hi> Grand
Signior <hi>very impatient;</hi> Piſh, once
again I tell you, this is trifling too
long, <hi>ſaid he to her in a furious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
and I ſee plainly that you fool
me. <hi>At theſe Words he call'd ſome
Perſons of his Train, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to command them to break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibrahim</hi> did not attend that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
to ſhift for himſelf; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
devin'd, that Matters would
come to that paſs, he had ſeaſonably
open'd the Cloſet-Window, that
look'd into the Garden, and leap'd
out of it. It was full Thirty Foot
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42899:39"/>
high; but he had been ſo happy, as
not to hurt himſelf. However, in
avoiding one danger, he fell into an
other. No-Body comes into this
Garden, but the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> and
the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s; and were he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
it was almoſt the ſame thing
for him, as if he had been caught in
<hi>Zelinda</hi>'s Cloſet. As he knew all
this very well, he immediately
ſought out ſome place where he
might hide himſelf. This was no
difficult matter; for Places there
were enough, where a Man might
hope not to be perceiv'd: but wiſely
making reflexion, that it was not
ſufficient to avoid all Peoples ſight,
but that he muſt likewiſe contrive
the means to get out of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
which he could not do, but by
the Miniſtry of the Gardiner: He
reſolv'd to truſt himſelf to him:
For this purpoſe he caſt his Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
to ſee if he could ſpy him;
and getting no Body in ken, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
an Houſe, which could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42899:39"/>
to none but him: Thither ſtole
he, and after having liſten'd atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
at the Door, he knock'd, and
a Woman came and open'd it, and
was mightily ſurpriz'd to ſee ſo
handſome a Man, and of ſo good a
Mien. <hi>Save my Life,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
to her, without Heſitation; and to
merit her giving ſome attention to
his Words, he gave her his Purſe,
which was top-full of Gold, with a
Diamond of great value. This
does Wonders in the Age we live;
and in <hi>Turkey,</hi> as well as here, there
are very ſerviceable People, when a
man knows how to engage them by
ſuch winning, Such attractive Means
as theſe <hi>Ibrahim</hi> made uſe of. And
indeed, this Woman, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any Reflexion on the Danger
ſhe expos'd her ſelf to, if it ſhould
chance to be known, that ſhe had
given him harbour (for in fine, ſhe
might well imagine, that he came
from the <hi>Serraglio),</hi> let him in very
amicably; and having diſcours'd
ſome time together upon this Ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venture,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42899:40"/>
he was oblig'd to tell her,
that <hi>Love</hi> was the Cauſe of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
yet without ſpecifying to
her any further particulars.</p>
            <p>The Woman, who was the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner's
Wife, hearing him talk in
this manner, bid him fear nothing;
and as ſhe had been formerly in
Love, ſhe would take a moſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Care of him. That ſhe knew
what a Perſon was capable of in
that Condition; not that ſhe had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done any thing but in Honour
and Honeſty, but becauſe that her
Relations being againſt her marrying
the Husband ſhe had, they were
both oblig'd to have recourſe to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices,
to deceive them. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhe began to run into Particulars
of her Husband's Courtſhip; and
already began to make known by
the Prologue, that the Hiſtory
would be long, when <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who
had other things in his Head, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her to defer that Account till an
other time; giving her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42899:40"/>
that ſome body or other
might pop in upon them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately;
and that it was expedient to
find out a Place where to hide
him.</p>
            <p>In all this Houſe there was but
one Chamber, and a Garret over
it; and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was of Opinion to
go into the Garret; but was diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from that by this Woman, who
told him, that a Fellow her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
employ'd in his Profeſſion, lay
in it; and that as they knew not
how long he ſhould be obliged to
ſtay there, it was not fit he ſhould be
ſeen by a young giddy-pated Cox-comb,
who might perchance diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the whole Myſtery. She was
rather of advice, to diſguiſe him as
a Woman; and he jumping with
her in Opinion, ſhe gave him a
whole Suit of hers, and hid his in
the Bed. While that this <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi>
was doing, in came the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who was mightily ſurprized
to ſee a ſtrange Face, and whoſe Sex
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42899:41"/>
his dear Spouſe was buſie a chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
As ſhe was ſo ſo pretty, and
that it's very natural to be jealous,
he began to make a terrible Busſle;
nay, and perhaps things would have
proceeded further than Noiſe, had
he had the ſtrength in his Hand.
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> threw himſelf at his Feet,
begging him not to ruine him, and
owning ingenuouſly to him, that it
was for an other Woman than his
Wife, that he was fallen into that
Perplexity, it moderated his Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
a little. But nothing put him in
ſo good an Humour as the Purſe and
the Diamond, which his Wife
ſhew'd him. Whereupon <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
added, that what he ſaw was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and that he would make him
other-gueſs Preſents, in caſe he was
truſty to him.</p>
            <p>This Husband ſeeing ſome likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in what he ſaid to him, did a
little calm his Anger. Nevertheleſs,
having heard, that Gallants paulm'd
ſtrange things upon Husbands, he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42899:41"/>
began to fall again into his jealous
fit, telling <hi>Ibrahim</hi> very reſolutely
(for fear all this was Trick), that
he would know from what part of
the <hi>Serraglio</hi> he had thrown himſelf
into the Garden. This was a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
he would never have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
upon to ſatisfie, nay, though
it had coſt him his Life, if in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
he had not remembred that his
ſteps were printed in the place where
he fell, and that thus it was a Proof
againſt the <hi>Sultana,</hi> ſhould the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> come to take notice
of it. For this reaſon did he no
longer perſevere ſo much in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Secret from him; he own'd
all ingenuouſly to him; and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him at the ſame time to take a
Spade, and under pretence of
working in that place, ſet what he
ſhould think neceſſary to rights, as
well for the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s ſafety as his
own. Though that at the Name of
the <hi>Sultana Zelindu,</hi> the Gardiner
knew her to be the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42899:42"/>
Favourite, he was a little troubled
at the danger he was going to throw
himſelf into, if the Intrigue ever
came to be diſcovered. Yet as one
is ever more ſenſible to one's own
Concerns, than to thoſe of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he was very glad that he had
cured him of thoſe Suſpicions that
might have remained in his Head.
He went immediately to do what
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſaid to him; and he had
hardly ſtruck twice with his Spade,
but that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> appear'd
to him out of the Cloſet-Window,
asking him if he had not ſeen any
body leap down.</p>
            <p>As you will doubtleſs wonder,
that after the Orders the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>
had given to his Men, to break
open the Door, ſo much time had
paſs'd before he came into that Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
it is fitting that you know, that
thoſe he had brought with him to
the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Apartment, thinking
he would ſtay there ſome time, as he
was wont to do, had ſtragled up
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42899:42"/>
and down, ſo as that when he
wanted them, they were not to be
found. Nay, ſome hearing what
paſs'd, and thinking to oblige the
<hi>Sultana,</hi> who they knew had a
great aſcendant over him, went out
of the way on purpoſe, ſo that he had
himſelf been forc'd to take an Iron
Crow; and as the Door was ſtrong,
he had been a long while before he
could break it open. Beſides, he
had proſecuted his firſt Thought;
That is to ſay, of ferretting her
Scrutoir, and all the other Places
where ſhe might conceal her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
But in ſhort, having found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
he made reflexion, that the
Window was open, and that perhaps
ſome body, having been hid in this
Cloſet, had made his Eſcape that
way. He had not dreamt in the
leaſt of this before: So true it is,
that when a Perſon is in Anger, they
are but little guilty of reaſoning.
This had made him ask the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
whether he had ſeen any thing;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42899:43"/>
But this Man having anſwer'd him
in the Negative, he was vex'd that
he had made ſuch an Hurricane for
nothing. It is not neceſſary that I
ſay, how that the <hi>Sultana</hi> was in a
terrible allarum while all this paſs'd;
it is eaſie to be imagined. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to her ſelf at each inſtant,
how ſhe had ſeen Two Perſons
ſtrangled in her Preſence, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expected the moment that the
ſame thing ſhould befal her, as well
as <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> But at length, ſeeing
that the thing had turned ſo happily
for her, ſhe began to be haughty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and told the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
with an Accent that rather ſpoke
the Miſtreſs than the Slave: <hi>That the
Condition of thoſe that are deſtin'd to
enter the</hi> Serraglio, <hi>was a ſtrange
thing; That they were expoſed to his
Caprices, and to his Jealouſie: That
Two poor Wretches had newly periſh'd
in her ſight, whoſe Blood was every
moment in her Mind: That this was
not the first time ſhe had endured
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42899:43"/>
his peeviſh Humour: That it would
be a greater kindneſs to kill her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
than thus put her to a lingring
Death: That in a Word, if he was
reſolv'd ever to treat her in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ſhe would rather make away with
her ſelf than ſuffer it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> had diminiſh'd much
of his Anger, when he had found
nothing in the Cloſet. Thus being
wholly diſpos'd to make her ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<hi>I am too blame, Madam,</hi> he
ſaid to her, <hi>I own it: but in ſhort;
blame your ſelf, if I have puſh'd my
Jealouſie ſo far: A Word ſaid time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would have freed me out of this
Extremity: but you took delight in
augmenting my Suſpicions; and you,
doubtleſs, did it to ſee, whether I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
lov'd you. You know that Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
is inſeparable from true Love:
You were not content with mine, it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
having been ſedate and calm:
But why put ye me to this Teſt, you
that know 'tis you I only love, and
that for your ſake I ſhould be ever
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42899:44"/>
capable of quitting my Empire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ready way to a Reconciliation,
was certainly ſuch words as theſe,
coming out of the Mouth of ſo
great a Monarch; and <hi>Zelinda</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not altogether ſo fierce as ſhe
might have been, if ſhe had found
her ſelf innocent, quickly clos'd
with it. Things having paſs'd in
this manner, the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having ſpent an Hour, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
in an Entertainment all full
of Affection on his part, and all full
of Artifice on <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s, propos'd
to her to go walk in the Garden.
As ſhe could not imagine any thing
elſe, but that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was there,
ſhe did what ſhe could to divert
him from this Reſolution. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
ſeeing that he perſiſted
therein, ſhe durſt no longer oppoſe
it, for fear that a longer Refuſal
might make him ſuſpect ſomething.
They took ſeveral Turns in a cover'd
Alley, and which was very pleaſant;
but the <hi>Sultan</hi> being weary of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42899:44"/>
there, he propos'd to her the
going into a Grove, that was the
whole Ornament of that place.
The ſame Reaſon that had oblig'd
her to decline coming down into
the Garden, ſet her a ſtudying to
contrive ſome Excuſe to avoid that
Walk. But the <hi>Sultan</hi> taking her
by the Hand, hall'd her along, as a
Man may ſay, in ſpight of her
teeth. She would not ſtand upon
any further Entreaty; and having
made way into the thickeſt of the
Wood, the <hi>Sultana</hi> rely'd upon the
Fancy ſhe had, that if <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
ſhould by Chance be there, he
would take care to hide himſelf;
when ſhe perceiv'd a Man ſtealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
the Grove, ſhe did not doubt
but that it was he, and imagin'd her
ſelf abſolutely ruin'd. And indeed
this Object, which the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>
had perceived as well as ſhe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reviv'd his Jealouſie, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her ſurlily, to run after the
Spark. In that Inſtant the <hi>Sultana</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:42899:45"/>
fell into a Swoon; and if by chance
the <hi>Sultan</hi> had come preſently back,
there needed nothing elſe to convince
him of her Infidelity. But he was
ſo taken up with his Purſuit, that
though his whole Empire were at
ſtake, it is to be thought it would
not have diverted him. The Man
being a good Runner, made him
take ſeveral Turns before he could
overtake him; but, as ill luck
would have it, his Cloaths catching
upon a Paliſado, the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who
follow'd him cloſe, got up to him
before he could get looſe. <hi>Thou
ſhalt die, thou Wretch,</hi> ſaid he, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold of him, <hi>but of ſo cruel a
Puniſhment, as ſhall detain all thoſe
that might, like thee, be capable of
corrupting the Fidelity of the</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana's.
<hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful Woman ſhall
alſo periſh,</hi> added he; <hi>And though I
ſhould love her ſtill more tenderly than
I do, which nevertheleſs is impoſſible,
I ſhould chuſe much rather to die my
ſelf than pardon her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:42899:45"/>
The Man was ſo ſeiz'd with Fear,
to ſee that it was the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf
that had ſtopp'd him, that he was as
a Man that had loſt all manner of
Knowledge. Wherefore he ſuffer'd
himſelf to be led on, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any reſiſtance, or ſo much as
ſaying a Word. Now this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the way to confirm the <hi>Sultan</hi>
in his Suſpicions. It is impoſſible to
expreſs to what a Degree his Anger
proceeded; and after having put
this Man again into the Hands of
the Eunuchs of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> he
commanded them to carry him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi>'s Apartment, and
to attend his Orders there. After
this, returning back, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſought out the Perſon he
thought he now hated much more
than he had ever loved her, he found
her in the ſame place where he left
her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She was recovered from the
Swoon ſhe fell into; but ſhe was
in ſuch a piteous Condition, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42899:46"/>
ſhe might be ſaid to be rather dead
than alive. The manner of the</hi>
Sultan'<hi>s accoſting her, was the way
to put her into a greater Diſorder.</hi>
Thou hadſt Reaſon a while ago, <hi>ſaid he
to her,</hi> to tell me, that thou wert ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unhappy, in being bound to ſuffer
my peeviſh Humours. Perfidious,
faithleſs Woman, I have at length in
my hands, he that robs me of thy
Heart, and within a moment I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to give him his due deſerts. I
ought already to have ſacrificed him
to my Reſentment; but I will have
thee to know, that if I have deferred
his puniſhment, 'tis only that thou
maiſt ſee him expire thy ſelf under
the moſt cruel Torments. I ſhall
ſpare thee no more than he: And ſince
thou haſt had ſo much Pleaſure in
preferring that miſerable Wretch to
me, thou muſt alſo go and keep him
company in the other World.</p>
            <p>At theſe Reproaches the <hi>Sultana</hi>
fell again into a Swoon; and as the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> had call'd his Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42899:46"/>
of <hi>Eunuchs</hi> about him, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them to carry her into her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.
There they threw her
upon her Bed, and while they did
what they could to bring her to her
ſelf, he ſent for Executioners, that
ſo as ſoon as ſhe had open'd her
Eyes, he might before her Face put
to Death the Man he had taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.
This Man, who had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo dejected at the time he was
laid hold of, had mightily chang'd
his form. He was prepared for all
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſhould cauſe to
be done to him, with a wonderful
Courage: Wherefore, making a
generous Contempt of Death;
<hi>Why doſt thou tarry,</hi> ſaid he to him,
<hi>to bereave me of Life? Know, that
it is ungrateful to me, ſince thou haſt
robb'd me of what could make me love
it. I love the</hi> Sultana, <hi>it is true;
And ſince it is a Capital Crime in
ſuch a Barbarous Nation as thine, I
would have thee know, that this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of troubling me, is the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42899:47"/>
thing I could have met
withal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words put the <hi>Sultan</hi> into
ſuch an Exceſs of Rage, that he
drew his Sword to ſacrifice him to his
Reſentment; But at the time he
was going to run it through his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
coming to make Reflexion, that
he would come off at too cheap a
rate; <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>I will not
follow the Dictates of my Anger;
And I plainly perceive, that thou only
ſeekeſt to animate me, to eſcape the
Torments I deſign for thee. Arm thy
ſelf with a true Constancy, instead of
the bare Appearances thou now ſhewest
us. It is ſeaſonable for thee, I aſſure
thee; and never hadſt thou more need
of it.</hi> And indeed, the Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were juſt ready; and if they
began not their Work, the Reaſon
was, that the pitileſs <hi>Sultan</hi> would
needs feed <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s Eyes with this
fatal Spectacle. He gave Order for
that purpoſe, that ſhe ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
brought to her ſelf again
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42899:47"/>
by the means of Remedies: And
through the impatience he was in
of wrecking his Revenge, he was
ſeen to run where ſhe was, hoping
that his Preſence would give more
Vertue to the Remedies. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this had no effect as yet, he
return'd again to that Wretch,
whom he endeavoured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
with New Reproaches. <hi>For
all this staying,</hi> he ſaid to him, <hi>thou
ſhalt ſuffer nevertheleſs; And if I
hold theſe Executioners hands, it is
only becauſe I mean, that the</hi> Sultana
<hi>ſhall be her ſelf an Eye witneſs of thy
Puniſhments. Her Fear for the
Torments I am preparing for her her
ſelf, had made her fall into a Swoon,
out of which they have much a-do to
fetch her; but in ſhort, this will laſt
but little longer, and you ſhall quickly
ſee an end on't.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou think'st this is an horrible
wrecking of me, <hi>cry'd this Unhappy
Priſoner,</hi> in ſaying all thou ſaist to
me: but I would have thee to know,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42899:48"/>
that thou canst not oblige me more.
How! is it poſſible that the <hi>Sultana</hi>
ſhould think of me, and ſhe, whom
I have ever found cruel in the time
that I might believe that ſhe opened
her Eyes to the Propoſition I made her
of marrying her, ſhould be propitious
to me now, that ſhe ſees me in thy
Hands, and just ready to periſh for
having loved her too much. No, I
have no longer any regret to die, if
thou telleſt me true; And though I
had already comforted my ſelf after
all the misfortunes that perſecute me
ſince I ſaw her, it is now quite an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, that I know ſhe yields to
ſo many illustrious Marks that I have
given her of my Affection. Let her
only come and ſpeak one word to me
with her lovely Mouth, and after
that do the worſt thou canſt. I defie
thee to get one bare Word from me
that may expreſs any impatience;
nay, and provided, that I have but the
pleaſure of ſeeing her once again, I
ſhall be but over-well contented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42899:48"/>
This Exceſs of Love put the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
into a Rage, as thinking this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Creature did only ſay, he
was unhappy in his Miſtreſs, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Reſentment from falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. Wherefore, to let him
ſee, that he did not ſo eaſily credit
him; <hi>We ſhall ſee in a moment,</hi> ſaid
he to him, <hi>whether we are able to
humble this Pride, and whether by
the means of Torments we can force
the Truth from thee.</hi> Juſt as he had
utter'd theſe words, he had notice
brought him, that the <hi>Sultana</hi> was
come again to her Sences. And as
each Moment was a Year to him, as
I may ſay, ſo hot was he upon his
Revenge: <hi>Bring that ungrateful
Woman hither,</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>and let
us ſee whether we can find out any
thing ſevere enough to puniſh her.
Provided that thy Vengeance falls on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon me,</hi> reply'd the unfortunate
Priſoner, <hi>thou needest only to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thy ſelf; and I tell thee once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I ſhall have ſufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42899:49"/>
not to utter one ſole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Grand Signior <hi>did not
vouchſafe to anſwer him any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and caſting his Eyes that way
the</hi> Sultana <hi>was to come, he had no
ſooner perceived her, but that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Tongue again;</hi> Come near,
Perfidious Woman, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi>
and after having render'd thy ſelf ſo
unworthy of the Honour I did thee,
come and view the Torments that are
prepared for thoſe that dare to ſully
the Bed of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors.
This is a Capital Crime among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but know, that it is much
greater here than elſewhere. Other
Princes do not chuſe Women, but
through reaſon of State; and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
they do not love them; but for
my part, I love thee tenderly; and
it was on that account that I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
thee to an infinite number of
others, that would have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
honoured by my Choice, and
who would have been favourable to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42899:49"/>
me, though it were only in gratitude
for the Favours I had rais'd them
to.</p>
            <p>Ought not this Obligation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the like Sentiments in thee? But
what do I ſay! Wert thou not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to it by a more engaging Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than this? Oughtſt thou not to
anſwer to my Love, whereof I give
thee ſo many instances; and for a
reward of which, thou would'ſt now
give me my Death?</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Sultan</hi> had put himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Priſoner and <hi>Zelinda;</hi> to
make theſe Reproaches, they could
not ſee each other: but ſtirring
from his place, the Priſoner, who
was at watch to ſee a Perſon he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
lov'd, and for whoſe ſake
he had expos'd himſelf to ſo
great a danger, had no ſooner
view'd <hi>Zelinda,</hi> but that turning
towards the <hi>Sultan; With what
falſe hopes haſt thou fed me,</hi> he ſaid
to him, <hi>and after having made me
expect to ſee the Perſon for whoſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42899:50"/>
ſake I came ſo far, muſt thou inſult
me to that degree, as to ſhew me an
unknown Face, inſtead of that which
is ſo well engraven in my Heart, that
I can never forget it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hitherto</hi> Zelinda <hi>had had her
Eyes down upon the Ground, as a
Perſon that found her ſelf Culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and who expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be convicted. For ſhe had
ſo fix'd it in her Head, that it was</hi>
Ibrahim <hi>whom the</hi> Grand Signior
<hi>had taken, as that ſhe did no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
doubt of it. But finding by the
Tone of his Voice, how far he was
miſtaken, ſhe interpos'd with her
Tongue, and thereby hinder'd the</hi>
Grand Signior <hi>from ſpeaking, tho
he had already his Mouth open to
anſwer the Priſoner. She addreſs'd
her Diſcourſe to the</hi> Sultan, <hi>and
did it in theſe Terms:</hi> It is ſo dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a thing to me, Sir, to ſee my
ſelf ſo unjuſtly accus'd; and my
Grief muſt have very much deceiv'd
me, that I now find my ſelf alive.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42899:50"/>
And it is in this, that I am oblig'd to
jump in an Accord with what People
ſay of our Sex; namely, that only
Men die of Grief, and that for our
parts, we live by't. God keep me,
however, from it, and after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
that you do me, if I am ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
as not to ſink under my Griefs,
I know the Means to free me all of the
ſudden. Yes, I will my ſelf stab
my own Boſom, <hi>added ſhe;</hi> And all
that I require of God, and my Great
Prophet, is, that you may have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
a Regret for the ſad Extremity
you have reduc'd me to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Grand Signior, <hi>who look'd
upon both their Diſcourſes as Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
as ſuſpecting them of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
the better to deceive him:</hi>
Piſh, to others, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to
her;</hi> for I am not ſo eaſily impos'd
upon. We ſhall preſently make that
Wretch ſing an other Tune; <hi>and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ſame time towards the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners;</hi>
Come, <hi>ſaid he to them,</hi>
Employ your whole induſtry to force
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42899:51"/>
the Truth out of his Mouth. That is
not neceſſary, <hi>this unfortunate Man
anſwer'd, with a firm and vigorous
Voice;</hi> and I ſhall tell it thee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without thy needing their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
I do not ſay this to thee, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he,</hi> that I might eſcape the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that thou art preparing for me:
I know, that thou ought'ſt to ſatisfie
thy Cruelty. A Man that deſpiſes
Death, has nothing to fear; And all
that I can tell thee, is, that if I could
be reveng'd on the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and ſee her once again I love, I
ſhould die the moſt contented of all
Men. But thou denieſt me the One,
and as for the Other, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for me to ſucceed in the Projects
I had laid, it being the VVill of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny,
that this <hi>Aga,</hi> whom I had ſo
much Reaſon to hate, was no longer
here when I arriv'd. And what has
the <hi>Aga</hi> done to thee, <hi>the</hi> Sultan <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party'd,</hi>
that thou ſhould'ſt have that
inveteracy againſt him? He has
robb'd me of my Miſtreſs, <hi>this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42899:51"/>
Priſoner anſwer'd;</hi> And
what makes me hate him ſtill the
more, is, that he carried her away
contrary to Good Faith, and as a
Thief as he is. I will inform thee of
that Circumſtance, <hi>added he,</hi> if thou
art ignorant of it; And thou muſt
know, that her Mother going to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
him to afford her Paſſage in his
Ship, to come hither, to ſeek out a Son
that had been a long while in theſe
Parts; and this lovely Virgin having
accompany'd her on the day of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
to give her her farewell, he
weigh'd Anchor, without being affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either by her Cries or her Tears. I
have been ſince told, <hi>added he,</hi> that
he has delivered her into thy Hands;
And it was to ſee her once again, that
I paſs'd o're the Garden Walls, where
thou found'ſt me. This is the whole
Naked Truth, ſince thou wilt needs
know it. But let not this hinder
thee from doing all that thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
on: I did not tell it thee, to
avert the Puniſhments with which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42899:52"/>
thou haſt menac'd me: And once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
thoſe that do not fear Death,
do little fear all that can uſher it
in.</p>
            <p>Never was Man ſo out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
as the <hi>Sultan,</hi> when he
heard him talk in this manner: For
in fine, as a body cannot feign ſo
well, but that it may plainly be ſeen
when a Perſon lies, it is in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
eaſie to know when he ſpeaks
the Truth. However, that he
might not paſs for too credulous
a Man, he ſent for the other <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
and when ſhe was come into
the Anti-chamber, he went out to
meet her, and queſtion her. And
indeed, he was reſolved to be Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to neither of them; and though
he no longer loved this latter, yet
was he not without Jealouſie. The
<hi>Sultana,</hi> little dreaming of what
paſs'd, ſeeing him coming, advanc'd
with a ſmiling Countenance, asking
him from whence ſhe derived her
great Felicity, to ſee her ſelf ſent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42899:52"/>
for to a place where he was ſeldom
us'd to think of her. But the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
far from anſwering, as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
to ſo handſom a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>Forbear, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to
her, <hi>going about to abuſe me any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
I am inform'd of your Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
and if I ſend for you hither, it
is only to puniſh you, as you deſerve.</hi>
The <hi>Sultana</hi> was much ſurprized
at theſe Words. Nevertheleſs, as
ſhe knew her ſelf innocent, and
that People when ſo, are never at
ſuch a loſs as when they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon their Conſcience: <hi>My
Life, Sir, is in your Hands,</hi> ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
him; <hi>but I think you too juſt
to go about to deprive me of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
firſt telling me wherein I may have
offended you: For the more I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
my ſelf, the leſs can I gueſs it;
and unleſs you acquaint me with it
your ſelf, I ſhall remain all my Life
long without knowing it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42899:53"/>
               <hi>Theſe Words were ſaid with a
certain Air, that made the</hi> Sultan
<hi>know that ſhe was innocent. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
being willing that ſhe
ſhould fully juſtifie her ſelf,</hi> How,
Madam! <hi>he renewed,</hi> d' ye call this
nothing, to have an other Lover than
me; the appointing him Aſſignations;
And after having been rais'd to the
glorious Rank of <hi>Sultana,</hi> to allow a
Slave to ſhare the Favours you have
granted me? <hi>Theſe Reproaches
made a ſhift to put the</hi> Sultana <hi>into
the utmoſt Surprize: Nevertheleſs,
her Innocence continuing to give
her aſſurance:</hi> Theſe Words, Sir, <hi>ſhe
anſwer'd him,</hi> would not deſerve my
puzzling my Head in the leaſt with
them, if they came to me from any
other than you: but ſince they depart
from a Mouth I muſt ever revere,
whatever it may utter againſt me, I
have nothing to anſwer, but that you
would let me ſee thoſe that dare to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me, and I will make their Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſo clearly known to you, that I do
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42899:53"/>
not believe you will any longer ſuſpect
me. This is just, Madam, <hi>the</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<hi>reply'd to her, he being ſtill
more and more perſwaded of her
Innocency; and making her paſs at
the ſame time into the Chamber
where the Man was I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
ſhe was in a ſtrange ſurprize
when ſhe had caſt her Eyes upon
him, and had already open'd her
Mouth, to expreſs her Wonder to
the</hi> Sultan, <hi>when this Man prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her.</hi> There's ſhe, <hi>cry'd he,</hi> ſhe I
came ſo far to ſeek: And how could
I miſs of knowing her again, after
having imprinted her ſo deeply in
my Heart? But alas! I plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſhe is no more propitious to me
than ſhe was in our own Countrey; ſhe
already colours for Anger: And ſince
it is impoſſible for me to live without
loving her, you will do me a kindneſs,
<hi>Sultan,</hi> in taking away my Life, which
in my Circumstances, cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than ungrateful to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42899:54"/>
Sultana Zelinda, <hi>after having
been in ſo terrible a Fright, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd
in her mind to ſee her ſelf
delivered from it with ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
And as ſhe was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Jealouſie of her Rival;</hi> From
whence comes it, Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe to the</hi>
Sultan, that you have us'd me ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill, upon a bare ſuſpicion, and that
now that things are made out, your
Anger is cool'd, to a degree, that you
ſeem to be inſenſible? Why are not you
curious to know whether you have been
told All? Perchance that this Wretch
has ſtill a Deſign upon me. What
has been newly told you, might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
on purpoſe to make your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
fall upon an other, and to
skreen me from your Anger. Lovers
have Fences that are not always
found out. And when one has the
Soveraign Power in Hand, as you
have, methinks that good ſence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that you ſhould not thus ſtop
at the half way of your Revenge.
Command theſe Executioners to do
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42899:54"/>
their Duty, and you will perhaps
diſcover things which you did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>Now if we make Reflection on
this Diſcourſe, nothing is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious.
It was an inſinuating into
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that the other
<hi>Sultana</hi> was capable of deceiving
him; and that in a word, this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Wretch correſponded with
her. But as he was naturally far
from the Cruelty of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
I mean, when he had no
Cauſe: for upon the leaſt ſuſpicion
he was like them; and what I have
above related is a good Teſtimony
of it, as I ſay, he fancy'd he was
ſufficiently inform'd, as not to need
to go any further: <hi>Ceaſe, Madam,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>a Diſcourſe that is ſo very
much out of ſeaſon. If I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but a moment ago Marks of my
Cruelty, you ought only to impute it
to my Jealouſie; and far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Anger at it, you ought to
have been vex'd if I had not done
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42899:55"/>
it, ſince Tranquility, upon theſe ſort
of Matters, is a ſign of but little
Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words were as many Stabs
with a Ponyard, into the other <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>'s
Boſome, who ſaw, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſhe recover'd her
Health, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> made
ſo little account of her, that even
in her own Preſence, he did not
ſtick to ſay ſoft and kind things to
her Rival. However, as Peoples
Demeanor towards theſe Emperors,
is not the ſame with that to other
Perſons, ſhe was oblig'd to ſwallow
her Affliction, which <hi>Sultana Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
having perceiv'd, ſhe did further
all ſhe could to inſult her. At the
laſt, being no longer able to bear
with ſo many Inſtances of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
from her, and from the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> too; <hi>I joyn my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe to the <hi>Sultan,
to thoſe of</hi> Zelinda, <hi>that you would
revenge the injury that this Wretch
has done to you, and of which I am
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42899:55"/>
as culpable as he, ſince I muſt needs
tell you the Truth. Yes, if h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> had
not known he was beloved, he would
not have expoſed himſelf to ſo great a
danger. I can no longer live without
him, juſt as he was no longer able to
live without me; and the greatest
kindneſs that you can do to us Both, is
to bereave us of our Lives, that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
burdenſome to us Both, ſince
that the <hi>Aga</hi> has ſo cruelly parted
us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to hear this Diſcourſe, he ſhe
pointed at in it was ſtill more than
he.</hi> Ah! Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi>
would to God, that what you have
now ſaid was true, and that I, on that
condition, were deſtin'd to endure all
that theſe infamous Executioners can
invent moſt cruel againſt me. But to
my Misfortune, you are but too cruel to
me; and what ſtill plunges me into a
farther deſpondency, is that I plainly
perceive with what Spirit you are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
at preſent. You lay to Heart,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42899:56"/>
that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſays kind
things to an other in your preſence;
And the injuſtice of my Fate, is ſuch,
as that not content with all the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti's
that you have exerciſed againſt me,
to compleat my miſery, you add what I
could never have expected.</p>
            <p>I thought that Virtue was the Rule
of All your Actions; but by what I
perceive, you are very much a ſtranger
to it. And this is what ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me in my preſent Condition, ſince
that the loſs I have is not ſo great as
I imagin'd it. Yes, <hi>Sultan,</hi> 'tis out
of Jealouſie that ſhe goes about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you; And if I had ſtill ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Power to acquaint thee what her
Cruelty was to me, thou would'ſt ſee,
that I am ſo far from ever having
been happy, that my Misfortune has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſurpaſſed that of the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</p>
            <p>As much as <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> had
been tranſported with joy at her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val's
Diſcourſe, whom ſhe thought
ruin'd in the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Good
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42899:56"/>
Opinion, after her Confeſſion; ſo
much was that of this Man unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to her. Wherefore, that ſhe
might not give the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
time to make Reflexion upon it;
<hi>D' ye not ſee, Sir, that the Exceſs of
his Love ſets him upon ſaving his
Miſtreſs at the Expence of his own
Life. Now are Torments and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſeaſonable; and I am very much
deceived, if you do not find out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things.</hi> The <hi>Sultan</hi> had almoſt
forgot the Love he had had for the
<hi>Sultana</hi> while that ſhe had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed:
but the Words of this
Man having made him return into
himſelf: <hi>It is not your Buſineſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
ſaid he to <hi>Zelinda, to teach me
what I have to do. I love the</hi> Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
<hi>well enough to be willing this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
ſhould be unravelled; And I
ſhall take care to revenge her Love, or
reward it, according as it ſhall prove
guilty or innocent. But there are
ways of informing ones ſelf, which
though they be leſs cruel the one than
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42899:57"/>
other, are nevertheleſs equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
It is to thoſe of Mildneſs that
I am very willing to have recourſe:
And who knows not, that very often,
instead of extorting a Truth by the
means of Tortures, the miſerable are
often oblig'd to ſay all they have not
done, ſo to free themſelves from the
Exceſs of the Torments they are made
to ſuffer.</hi> At theſe Words he ſent
<hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Siſter back into her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment;
commanding, that no
body ſhould ſpeak to her till far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Order: Then queſtioning her
Lover, he would needs have of
him a particular Account of his
Paſſion. And this Man, who had
made the <hi>Sultana</hi> a Thouſand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
when ſhe went out, but
nevertheleſs lov'd her beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
thinking, that the only
means to ſave her, was to tell
the <hi>Sultan</hi> the Truth, related his
Hiſtory to him. And as it is full
of a World of Incidents, I am
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42899:57"/>
perſwaded the Reader will not be
ſorry that I impart it to him. And
here you ſhall have it Word for
Word as he told it to the <hi>Grand

purpoſe would it be for me to tell
you any thing to the advantage
of our Extraction, ſince no regard
is had to that in your Empire? I
will tell you nevertheleſs by the
by, that we are both Natives of
a Town, which is but Two <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Miles diſtant from that where
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42899:58"/>
the <hi>Aga</hi> plaid his Prank: That our
Relations are the moſt eminent for
Eſtate and Quality in that Place:
That for my part I had all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Reaſon to be ſatisfy'd with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
if Love had not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs,
and robb'd me of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
At Fifteen Years old my
Father ſent me to <hi>Venice,</hi> to ſerve
the Re-publick in its Armies,
where, in his time, he had had
conſiderable Employs; and Three
Years after I was liſted under its
Colours, the Senate ſent me Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to return into the City, and
gave me a Regiment. During the
abode I made there, I lead the
ſame Life which People of Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years of Age do commonly
lead, and who want no Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That is to ſay, that being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prone to Love, I ſaw an infinite
number of Courtezans, which that
Town is better ſtock'd with than
any other in the Univerſe At
length, growing weary of that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42899:59"/>
Life, which, in Truth, is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of an Honeſt Man, I abſtain'd
from returning into that Place of
Debauchery, which did in no
wiſe pleaſe thoſe that had taſted of
my Liberality; and eſpecially a
certain Woman, whoſe Miniſtry I
had made uſe of in my amorous
Expeditions. I was daily perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by her; ſhe every day ſhew'd
me the Picture of ſome new Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan;
and I own, that among
them there were ſome of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Beauty, and for whom a
Man would have been capable of
doing all things, if their Beauty
had been accompany'd with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But as I was utterly pawl'd
by the eaſineſs of theſe ſorts of
Conqueſts, or rather, I knew
they were common to me with
the firſt Comer, I perſiſted in
the Reſolution I had taken of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Diſcreet. This almoſt
madded this Woman; and I was
for ſome time without hearing of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42899:59"/>
her: But at the Months end I ſaw
her come into my Room with a
ſatisfy'd Countenance; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

there is nothing but what you may

                        <p>
                           <q>My Surprize was not ſo great,
but that I preſently re-collected
my ſelf out of it; and ſtill holding
my Eyes fix'd upon that Picture;
<hi>Is it poſſible,</hi> ſaid I to this Woman,
<hi>that you can put the Original into my
Hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doubtleſs,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe
me; <hi>And provided you do what is
requiſite for that purpoſe, you will
quickly ſee the Accompliſhment of my
Promiſes.</hi> I thought that this
Woman, who was ſelf-intereſted,
as are commonly all thoſe of her
Profeſſion, meant, that I muſt be
liberal: Wherefore taking out my
Purſe at the ſame time, I gave it
her, with a Promiſe, that it ſhould
be only a Sample of my Gratuities.
In fine, being enflam'd more than
I can repreſent to you, I told her,
that I pretended not to wait any
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42899:60"/>
longer than Night, to ſee whether
ſhe was a Woman of her Word:
Whereupon ſhe told me, that I
was too hot upon the Spur; and
that the Conqueſt ſhe propos'd to
me, was none of thoſe that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved
in ſo ſhort a time. Nay,
ſhe added, that the Perſon being
in nothing inferior to me, as I know
very well my ſelf, ſhe did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to grant me any Favour that
could redound to her Prejudice:
That this was what ſhe had to tell
me on her behalf; and that if I
was an Honeſt Man, and would
think of marrying her, that then it
ſhould be my own fault, if I was not
happy.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This Complement, far from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
me, was extreamly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to me. There wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to my budding Paſſion, but a
little Eſteem, to render it ſuch as it
ought to be, that it might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in nothing. Thus there being
nothing more now to ſtop the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42899:61"/>
of it, <hi>Yes,</hi> I ſaid to her, a
Thouſand times more enflamed
than before, <hi>I accept of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
and I charge you to tell her,
that I ſhall never enfringe them.</hi> In
uttering theſe Words, I ſnatch'd
the Picture from her, and kiſs'd it
with ſo much tranſport, that a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
muſt have been very blind, as
not to perceive that I was paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
in Love. After a thouſand
Follies of this nature, and which
would be too long to relate: <hi>But
tell me,</hi> I ſaid to her once again, <hi>is
it really true, that ſhe is as beauteous
as her Picture? And may I flatter
my ſelf, that my Vows may with her
meet with a kind Reception? I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
ye both,</hi> ſhe reply'd to me:
<hi>And if you would have me tell you
things as they are, I come hither on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by her Order. You may know this
from her when you pleaſe. And to
ſhew you, that I tell you nothing but
the Truth, be you a while hence, at
her going out of her Houſe to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42899:61"/>
Church: She is lodg'd near the
Church of St.</hi> Mark: <hi>Follow her,
and when ſhe comes near the Holy
Water, ſpeak ſomething to her, and
you will ſee in what manner ſhe will
anſwer you.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Theſe Words were ſo poſitive,
that I had not the leaſt room left
for doubt, but that ſhe ſpoke the
Truth to me. Thus abandoning
my ſelf to joy, I confirm'd the
Promiſes I had made her, that ſhe
ſhould not loſe her Pains: After
which I accepted of the Expedient
ſhe propos'd to me, that I might
fully ſecure my happineſs to my
ſelf. Now you muſt know, that
this Woman did really ſpeak the
Truth; and that at that time I was
not indifferent to the beautiful <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana.</hi>
But I muſt inform your
<hi>Celſitude</hi> how this came to paſs:
This Woman ſeeing that ſhe loſt
all her Gains of me, by the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
I had taken, to be no
longer debauched: And having
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42899:62"/>
thereby loſt her beſt Cuſtomer,
had been cudgelling her Brains, to
contrive the means of getting my
Favour again. As ſhe had ſeen me
very ſenſible for the Fair Sex, ſhe
fancy'd there was no other Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for her, than to bait me with
this Temptation. Nevertheleſs,
having ſeen me pawl'd by all the
<hi>Courtizans,</hi> ſhe ſought out one that
was no Miſs, but who might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one by her way of Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
As ſhe was attentive to this
Jeaſt, ſhe ſaw <hi>Lidiana,</hi> whoſe raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beauty offer'd her the Fetter
wherewithal ſhe ſought to enſnare
my Liberty. She inform'd her ſelf
carefully, who ſhe was, how ſhe had
been brought up, whether ſhe was
giddy-headed, and well diſpoſed to
the World; and in ſine, whether
her Mother, in whoſe Company
ſhe was come, had a ſtrict Eye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her: But all that ſhe was told,
having inform'd her, that ſhe had
fed her ſelf with hopes, which ſhe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42899:62"/>
was far from ſeeing effected; ſhe
took other Meaſures, and ſuch as I
am going to re-count to your <hi>Celſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Having acquainted her with the
Name of the Town where I was
born, and ſhe knowing <hi>Lidiana</hi> to
be of the ſame Place, our Birth,
our Age; and in ſhort, all that
People ſeek to make a Match ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuitable to her, between us
Two, ſhe found the Means to get
to the Speech of this lovely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and after having told her,
who I was, and that I was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken with her Beauty and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
though I had never ſeen her,
ſhe us'd her Perſwaſions ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
that ſhe inſpir'd her with the
Curioſity to ſee me. <hi>Lidiana</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Credit to all ſhe ſaid to her,
made her ſwear, that ſhe would
not give me intimation of it,
which the other was very glad of,
as having not yet diſcours'd me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Matter, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42899:63"/>
fearing that I might have
made ſome falſe ſtep, that might
have diſcovered her Cheat. The
Place ſhe appointed her to ſee me
in, was the Church of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi>
whither I commonly went to <hi>Maſs;</hi>
and there, without dreaming of it
in the leaſt, I was contemplated by
<hi>Lidiana</hi>'s fair Eyes, to whom I
could not make Returns, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mobb'd up, after the Mode of
<hi>Italy,</hi> in a great Veil, that rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
me of the ſight of her. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to her the ſame as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had deſcrib'd me to her; and
though it was very advantageouſly
to me, I may, without Vanity,
ſay, that I did not belye the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
ſhe had conceived upon the
<hi>Go between</hi>'s Relation.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This interview being made in
this manner, <hi>Lidiana</hi> ſaid a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
things to her in my favour:
And after ſeveral Diſcourſes, of
which I was ever the Subject; and
wherein the Woman did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42899:63"/>
to aſſure her, that I daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more and more in Love, and
that I continued in the Deſign of
marrying her; ſhe brought her at
length to conſent to give her her
Picture; and it was the ſame ſhe
brought me. Things being in ſo
fair a way, without it's having coſt
me either Cares or Pains, which
however is ſeldom ſeen in ſuch an
Occaſion as this. I had no longer any
other diſquiet, than the longing to
ſee ſo fair an Original. It was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
for our Go-between to procure
me this ſatisfaction; and after what
ſhe had done, ſhe needed only to
ſpeak, to effect that. It was ſtill in
a Church where this interview was
made; and <hi>Lidiana</hi> ſeeing that I
did not take my Eyes from off her,
this confirm'd her ſtill in all that
had been told her; and ſhe lift up
ſlily her Veil, and gave me
ſufficient leiſure to contemplate
her; ſo as to tell my ſelf a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times, that I had ſeen nothing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42899:64"/>
in all my Life that came near her
Beauty.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>To tell you, that after this, I had
no longer any Repoſe, till ſuch
time as that I had ſpoken to her, is
to tell you nothing new. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has ever been in love, knows,
that Lovers require ſomething
more real than ſight. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
it was a Difficulty, and as the
Mode of <hi>Italy</hi> is, that Maidens do
not render any Viſit, ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
a Cuſtom did not allow me to
have a plenary ſatisfaction in that
point. This Faileur advis'd the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Stratagems. But though I
was paſſionately in Love, and that
the Property of Love is to inſpire
Wit, I muſt needs own to my own
Confuſion, that I was endebted to
our <hi>Go-between</hi> for our Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This Woman having pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
judg'd, that we could never
do any thing, unleſs we had ſome
Servant to be a Confident in the
Concern, had wriggled a Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42899:64"/>
Gentlewoman into the Family,
of whom the Mother had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
She daily gave <hi>Lidiana</hi> one
Letter or other that I had written to
her, and very often two or three,
inſtead of one, She likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
her Anſwers to me: And
this Petty Commerce was a mighty
Eaſement to both of us. Now
our <hi>Go-between</hi> having ſo good a
ſtring to her Bow, ſhe bid this
Maid to tell <hi>Lidiana,</hi> that ſhe
ſhould make ſemblance of falling
all of the ſudden into a Swoon,
when that the Mother was gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
which <hi>Lidiana</hi> having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done, this Maid went
our, as if it were to fetch a <hi>Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi>
to bleed her; and as I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Myſtery, I ſtaid hard by
in a Decent Habit. Thus was I
conducted into <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Chamber,
where becauſe there were ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Domeſticks, ſhe told me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
that ſhe would not ſuffer me
to blood her; and that I was too
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42899:65"/>
young for that. The Waiting-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
with whom all things were
concerted, and who had her Leſſon
at her ſingers ends; <hi>You ſay right,
Madam,</hi> ſhe ſaid to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>but as it
is not certain, that we ſhall find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other than this; and as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
is preſſing, I am of Opinion,
that he stay here till you ſee whether
an other will come.</hi> At theſe words
ſhe gave the Servants Order to go
ſeek out one; nay, and a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
And that they might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
too ſoon, ſhe ſent them to
ſuch as were lodged at the fartheſt
end of the Town, as if they had
been the moſt expert.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>To prevent giving of ſuſpicion,
I made ſemblance of being vex'd
at this Preference, and would needs
be gone; but they promis'd me, I
ſhould be rewarded as much as if I
had let her Blood: And as the part
I acted required my ſeeming ſelf-intereſted,
I promis'd to ſtay upon
theſe Conditions. All of them by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42899:65"/>
this means being diſpatched out of
the way, except the Waiting-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
I threw my ſelf at the
Feet of <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Bed, who had
caus'd her ſelf to be undreſs'd on
purpoſe, the better to make her ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thought to be real; and I not
only confirm'd to her, what our
<hi>Go-between</hi> had told her on my
part, but I alſo vow'd to her an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Love. She ſeem'd to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with all theſe Aſſurances;
and as there is nothing that more
re-doubles the Affection, than the
being poſſeſs'd, that ſhe for whom
one ſighs, has a grateful ſenſe of it,
it is impoſſible to expreſs to what
a Degree I found my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I cannot tell exactly how long I
ſtaid with her; but I dare affirm,
that though, as I have ſaid, the
Lodgings of thoſe Perſons we ſent
for, were a mighty way off, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
came when I thought
they muſt needs be ſtill a long time
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42899:66"/>
before they could return. That is
to ſay, in one word, that I was not
weary in her Company. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
hearing the others upon
the Stair Caſe, and having nothing
more to do there, at leaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expoſing my ſelf to the being
diſcovered, I was obliged to ſound
a Retreat. The Waiting Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
conducted me back; and
to make it the more believed I was
what I really repreſented, ſhe put
the piece of Money into my Hands
in the Preſence of the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>That interview having paſs'd in
this manner, both our Paſſions
augmented in ſuch ſort, that in an
other Viſit that was procured me by
the like Artifice; That is to ſay, in
ſtill ſeeking to deceive thoſe that
might be concerned therein: Tho
by other means, ſhe propos'd to
me, to demand her in Marriage of
her Mother. I made her anſwer;
That it would be but ill timing of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42899:66"/>
our Buſineſs; and that it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a thing that depended on the
Father than on her: That hers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
far off; and as there was no pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him this Deference, by reaſon
of his Abſence, we muſt e'en ſtay
till I could have the honour to ſee
him. That I would take a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
on purpoſe to our Countrey-Houſe,
at my return from the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
then at hand: That in this
Expectation I ſhould think it a
Thouſand Years long; and that
if ſhe doubted of it, ſhe would
do me a great deal of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I know not what to attribute
the refuſal to that <hi>Lidiana</hi> made of
being ſatisfy'd with my Reaſons,
unleſs that Fortune, being weary
of favouring me, was reſolved to
play me the moſt cruel Prank that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could befall a Man. But ſo it is,
that ſhe, after having urged ſeveral
things in oppoſition to the Reaſons
that I gave her, I had not any qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42899:67"/>
till I had promis'd her to break
the Matter to her Mother. I did
ſo out of hand, to ſatisfie her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than out of any hopes I had,
that ſhe could give us ſatisfaction.
And indeed, the Mother, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
receiv'd me with great Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo far as to tell me, that no
greater advantage could befal her
Daughter, gave me to underſtand,
that I ask'd her a thing that was out
of her Power; but that ſhe would
write concerning it to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who was particularly
informed of my Birth, of my
Eſtate, and of the Repute I had
acquired in the World, to receive
my Alliance with the ſame Joy ſhe
did. Thereupon I entreated her
that I might accompany her Letter
with one of my own; and having
declared to me, that my Requeſt
was too juſt to be deny'd, I gave it
into her Hands, that ſhe might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
it in her Pacquet.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:42899:67"/>
                           <q>
                              <hi>Lidiana</hi> ſeeing things in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
far from being ſorry at
the ſtep ſhe had made me take in
this Matter, was over-joy'd at it,
and advis'd me to ask to ſee her
till ſuch time as that her Father's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
came. This was my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had ſhe not mention'd
it to me. Thus I went to pay a
Viſit on purpoſe to her Mother;
but ſhe told me, that could not be,
without furniſhing Matter of Talk
to the World; and that if I lov'd
her Daughter, as ſhe was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
I did, I would not inſiſt upon
that, as being bound to take more
Care than any body of her Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
She urg'd to me a World
of things to the ſame purpoſe, and
ſuch as were conformable to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of the Countrey, and even
to Decency. But as a Lover is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
well content to have ſuch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
bounds preſcribed him, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Reaſons againſt her, but which
ſeem'd ſo weak to this Lady, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42899:68"/>
ſhe continued to refuſe me what I
required.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Things remaining in this Poſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to my great Regret, I impatiently
waited for the Father's Anſwer.
In the mean while, not being able
to be without ſeeing <hi>Lidiana,</hi> I had
recourſe to the <hi>Go-between,</hi> whom
I was upon the point of diſmiſſing,
as ſecretly reproaching my ſelf for
ſuffering ſuch an Affair as that to be
manag'd by ſuch an Hand as hers.
But having been withheld by ſome
Conſideration, I was very happy
in meeting her ſtill to do me Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
I went to <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Houſe
when her Mother was not at home,
and having ſhut our ſelves up in
that Ladies Chamber, having with
us only the Waiting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> woman I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
a while ago, whom we had
for a Witneſs of our Actions; I
perceiv'd a Paper behind a Glaſs;
and Curioſity having ſet me to ſee
what it was, I found it to be the
Letter I had given her. It was juſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42899:68"/>
the ſame as I had put it into her
Hands; at which, being both of
us ſurprized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>Lidiana</hi> told me, that
ſhe muſt of neceſſity have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it there, which I thought to be
very probable. Nevertheleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not at all ſatisfy'd with this
Neglect, I told her, that it would
be convenient that we put it again
where we found it, and that ſhe
making ſemblance of perceiving it
when her Mother was come home,
ſhe ſhould ask her what was the
Reaſon ſhe had not ſent it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I was ſo out of Humour at this
Adventure, and ſo eager to find
out the Riddle of it, that I left <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>
in that very inſtant, as if my
Departure muſt have forwarded
her Mothers Return. <hi>Lidiana,</hi>
who had no leſs impatience than I,
ſeeing her come back, immediately
performed what we had agreed on
together. This Lady appear'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſurpriz'd to her: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ſhe fancy'd ſhe had ſent that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42899:69"/>
Letter, which ſhe had left by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.
The thing ſeem'd ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
to <hi>Lidiana,</hi> in a Concern
of that Conſequence, that ſhe
thought it to be an Excuſe ſhe us'd,
and which ſhe paulm'd upon her:
But in Truth, it was really ſo as ſhe
ſaid: and what had been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of this Miſtake, is, that ſhe
had ſo much Buſineſs on the day ſhe
had written, that one thing had
made her forget an other. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
what is extraordinary in ſuch
an Occaſion as this, is, that though
ſhe had thus forgot my Letter, ſhe
had not however been wanting to
make mention in hers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
I had made to her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe told <hi>Lidiana,</hi> that I needed
not to be concerned; and that this
would nevertheleſs produce its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>Lidiana</hi> repeated this to me the
firſt time that I found the occaſion
to ſee her again; and thinking to
comfort me mightily, by vending
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42899:69"/>
the ſame Money to me with which
ſhe had been paid, this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
plung'd me into the utmoſt
Deſpondency: <hi>So much the worſe,</hi>
ſaid I to her, <hi>if ſhe has committed
that Fault alſo: And what will your
Father ſay, when he ſhall ſee that I
demand you of your Mother, and
that I do him not the leaſt Civility;
he who is the Head of the Family,
and whoſe Affection I only ought to
captivate, if I mean he ſhould be
propitious to me. Lidiana</hi> made a
Mock of my Fears, aſſuring me,
that her Father was not a Man of
ſuch ſcrupulous Regards. She told
me farther, that though he were of
that Humour, he might be appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by letting him know that it was
none of my Fault. I made a ſhew
of believing her, becauſe I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
I oblig'd her in ſo doing; yet
I could not forbear trembling ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
till ſuch time as that they
heard from him: and when the
Letters were come accordingly, it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42899:70"/>
was with a greater trembling ſtill,
that I went to her Mothers Houſe,
to enquire what they contained:
But alas! I was but too good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
She ingeniouſly told me,
that her Husband was piqu'd that I
had not accompany'd her Letter
with one of mine. But as ſhe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
did cordially eſpouſe my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
ſhe told me, that ſince it
was ſhe that had committed the
Fault, ſhe would repair it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
I ſhould not trouble my Head about
the matter.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Theſe Promiſes had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to a Man that had been leſs
perſwaded than I of the Capricious
Humour of the Perſon, which I had
heard inſtanc'd ſeveral times. I
knew, without being particularly
acquainted with him, that he was
of the ſame Temper with thoſe
Countrey ſort of Noblemen that
will have every thing preciſely in its
form, and a ſuperſtitious Obſerver
of Method. All his Life long he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42899:70"/>
had been wedded to Appearances,
without ever ſtanding to ſhrift in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Truth: And what could I
expect from a Perſon that paſs'd for
ſuch in the Opinion of all People.
My Suſpicions prov'd to be but too
real; his Wife having ſent my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to him, and given him a fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how all matters went: <hi>Piſh,
to others,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it's now too late:
This was a convenient Match in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
I own it: But I'le ha' no Son
in Law that knows not how to live,
that underſtands not good Manners.</hi>
At the ſame time he divulg'd my
Courtſhip throughout the whole
Town; and as I had many Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Friends there, I received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
from ſeveral Hands, that I
had nothing to hope. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
he made his Wife, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to what was ſignify'd to
me; inſomuch, that having loſt
all Hopes on that ſide, I went to
ſee that Lady, to whom, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made known how ſenſible I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42899:71"/>
was to this Refuſal, I propos'd, that
ſhe would give us her Conſent for
a Private Marriage. To make her
condeſcend thereunto, I told her,
as it was Truth, that her Husband
having found nothing to reprehend
in me, ſave the Fault whereof I
was accuſed, he would be oblig'd
to be appeaſed, when the thing was
once done. That ſhe had promis'd
me to repair the Miſchiefs, which
ſhe knew very well her ſelf to be
the only Cauſe of. That thus I
hop'd ſhe would not diſapprove of
the Expedient I ſtarted; and that
it was the only Remedy to my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
This Lady lov'd me, and
I cannot deny it, though indeed,
ſhe was the only occaſion of all my
Misfortunes: Nevertheleſs, ſhe was
frighted at my Propoſal; telling
me, that ſhe ſhould be ruin'd if
ſuch a thing ſhould happen. That
her Husband was a Man not only
never to relent, but likewiſe to
cauſe my Proceſs to be made as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42899:71"/>
                              <hi>He'll not meddle, Madam,</hi>
I anſwer'd her: <hi>And d' ye not know,
that we have ſeen People as much
wedded as he to their Sentiments,
that have been oblig'd to conform to
ſuch an Occaſion?</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>I told her ſtill many things more
to perſwade her; but all that I
could ſay having been to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I was obliged to take other
Meaſures. Thoſe that came into
my Head, as likely to be the moſt
effectual, were to ſpeak to</hi> Lidiana,
<hi>having ask'd whom, whether ſhe
laid her Father's refuſal to Heart?</hi>
As much as you, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> at
leaſt; And I think it ſtrange, that
after ſo many inſtances that I have
given you of my Eſteem, you ask me
ſuch a Queſtion. It is not that I
doubt of it, Beauteous <hi>Lidiana, I
anſwer'd her:</hi> And if I was willing
to hear you once more ſay, that you
love me, it is a Token of the ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of my Paſſion: And to demand
ſuch Proofs of yours as may ſolace me
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42899:72"/>
in my Misfortune. I have propos'd
them to your Lady Mother; But as
ſhe more cordially eſpouſes Conjugal
Love than that ſhe had given to me as
her future Son in Law, ſhe would not
liſten to them. I hope it will not be
the ſame with you; and that having
look'd upon me by her Order, as a
Perſon that was one day to have the
happineſs of being your Husband,
that ſame Conjugal Love will make
you concur with me, to procure the
things that are neceſſary for our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſatisfaction. You ought not to
doubt on't, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> provided
you only propoſe ſuch things as I may
honeſtly do: for otherwiſe I do not
think you expect I ſhould obey you.
No, my dear <hi>Lidiana, I reply'd to
her;</hi> and you would be too blame, did
you ſo much as but ſuſpect it; And
all the Propoſal that I have to make to
you, is only that we may marry pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42899:72"/>
                           <q>
                              <hi>I pretended to go on, and tell
her how things would be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
after that ſhe was once
my Wife. I would farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
by good and ſpecious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
how that ſhe could be in no
wiſe prejudic'd, and that there
were thouſands daily, who by theſe
means brought their Parents to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
but inſtead of giving me time
for ſo doing, ſhe interrupted me
with theſe Words:</hi> I wonder, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli,
ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> how you dare
make Propoſals of this nature to
me. I muſt certainly have given you
Occaſion, by ſome Action unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Virgin, which puts me ſo out of
countenance, that I promiſe you to
prevent it for the future. No, my
dear <hi>Lidiana, I anſwer'd her, all in
a maze at this Diſcourſe,</hi> you never
did any thing that could ſhock De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;
And though I ſhould have ſeen
you of a humour to do it, which God
be thank'd, is far from your incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
my Love is of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42899:73"/>
that I ſhould have quickly have
advertiz'd you of it. I love you not
only becauſe you are lovely, but alſo
becauſe that you are virtuous. With
theſe Sentiments can I propoſe any
thing to you that may make you unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
And then why exclaim you ſo highly
for telling you, that I wiſh to be your
Husband? There are often ſecret
Reaſons that oblige a Lover to make
the like Propoſitions. The Fortune
of ſhe they love, that is more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
than their own; the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they derive from an illuſtrious
Alliance; and ſometimes alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of deluding them, after having
gratified their fooliſh Paſſion. But
thanks be to God, I am exempt from
all theſe Weakneſſes; and I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that you can ſuſpect me of them.
I have a Fortune conſiderable enough,
ſo as not to mind that of a Wife:
Your Birth, all illuſtrious as it is,
does not ſurpaſs mine: And as for
my Deſign, I do not think there is
any need of telling you, that it has
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42899:73"/>
only Virtue in Recommendation. If
it was otherwiſe I ſhould not have
made the Paces you have ſeen me
make: And you know, that it was
not till after the Refuſal of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
that I have been oblig'd to make
you this Request.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>I told her nothing but the Truth;
and ſhe knew all this as well as I;
nevertheleſs, giving me a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
than before.</hi> If I did well,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after ſeveral ſharp
things that uſher'd in this,</hi> I ſhould
never ſee you more after ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
And though I will not deny
that it is not Intereſt that has ſet you
to court me, yet you must agree with
me, that you offend me in the moſt
ſenſible part imaginable. Is it not
the diſhonouring of me, the propoſing
a ſecret Marriage to me? How can
the matter be conceal'd when People
ſtand in ſuch fair Terms? What
can thoſe ſay that take notice on't?
And muſt one carry in one's Pocket
one's Contract of Marriage, or the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42899:74"/>
Certificate of the
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſts.</note>
                              <hi>Papas,</hi> to oblige
them to paſs a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Judgment? Ah Madam! <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
her,</hi> can one ever paſs an ill
one of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you that paſs for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Virtue in every Bodies Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
Such an Apprehenſion is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
for thoſe whoſe Virtue appears
doubtful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the leaſt thing may make
the Balance incline on the Bad ſide:
Whereas thoſe that reſemble you,
would do all things without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerving
the least Suſpicion. That is
to ſay, <hi>Rivelli, ſhe retorted upon
me,</hi> that you would inſinuate to me,
that Reputation all alone is ſufficient
for a Woman: But know from me,
that we are ſo far from being bound
to believe you, that they are thoſe
that have the moſt meaſures to keep.
The Reaſon is, that when People
come to diſcover their Concerns, the
noiſe of 'em is much beyond that of
thoſe they call Perſons of mean Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Now as that you propoſe to me,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42899:74"/>
muſt of all neceſſity be one day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
you will take it in good part,
that to avoid ſuch a trouble, I deſire
you to deſiſt from all ſuch Pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>In ſpight of all the intereſt I had
in theſe Words, I muſt own to you,
that they gave me Admiration. I
tacitely applauded my ſelf for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo virtuous a Perſon. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
as I was more ſenſible to
my Love than all the reſt, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cautious of unboſoming theſe
Sentiments to her. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I ſtill did all I could to make
her lay aſide hers: But not having
been able to bring that about, my
only care was now to ſweeten her
up, ſeeing her beyond meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens'd.
This I had much a-do to
effect: but in fine, all things being
reconciled by my Submiſſion, we
thus parted as good Friends as ever,
after I had promis'd her neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
that I would never make her
the like Propoſition again. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42899:75"/>
it was very neceſſary that I
ſhould ſet my Mind at reſt on that
ſide; For Two Days after her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arriv'd, he having run Poſt
to ſtop the Progreſſes of my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo pre poſſeſs'd was he againſt
me, on the account of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
I have before-hinted. The
firſt thing he did upon his Arrival,
was to forbid his Daughter ever to
think of me; and told his Wife,
that as he judg'd by her Letters,
that ſhe eſpous'd my intereſts, he
commanded her abſolutely to lay
them aſide. Theſe were the very
Terms he made uſe of; of which
I had notice by <hi>Lidiana;</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
me at the ſame time, that if I
remained faithful to her, all this
ſhould not make any impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Mind: That ſhe would ſo
order Matters, as to make him
come to himſelf, by a feigned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention:
And ſhe entreated me
to ſet my Friends to work, and to
go to work my ſelf, to gain his
good Opinion.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42899:75"/>
                           <q>It was needleſs in her to give me
this Counſel; my intereſt obliged
me to take it of my ſelf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I went to pay him a Viſit as
ſoon as he had made known his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival;
but I was very much amaz'd
to ſee, that though the Door was
open to all People, it was ſhut to
me. He ſent me word, that he
was buſie in writing of Letters,
and deſired me to excuſe him. This
might have paſs'd current with me,
if the ſame Complement had been
made to all Comers: but a Man
coming at the ſame time to ask for
him, the Porter let him in under
my Noſe, either that he had not
the Wit to know that this might
vex me; or, as is more probable, he
did nothing without his Maſter's
Order. If it had been in an other
Occaſion, I leave it to be gueſs'd
how I ſhould have taken this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front:
But the Concern of my
Love not permitting me to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
my Reſentment, I went my
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42899:76"/>
ways without ſaying a word; but
not without carrying along a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs,
as render'd me quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man. I returned thither on
the morrow; and the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
having been made me;
or at leaſt, the Porter having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
an other Excuſe not to let me
ſee his Maſter, this was more than
needed to cauſe me to make a noiſe,
if the ſame Reaſons that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
me the Evening before,
had not ſtill detain'd me that
Day.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>What ſhall I ſay? In ſhort, I had
the Patience to do the ſame thing
for Eight Days together; at the
end of which, ſeeing that it would
be the way to make me ridiculous,
if I went again, I choſe to write to
him; and accordingly did ſo in
moſt ſubmiſſive Terms: And the
Tenour of this Letter was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
him of there being any
Fault of mine in what had paſs'd;
and to let him know that I had
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42899:76"/>
been ſeveral times at his Houſe to
diſcourſe him my ſelf on this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.
I gave it to One of my Men,
with Order to deliver it to him
himſelf, and to demand his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
Nevertheleſs, as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
after what had befallen me
my ſelf, they would not introduce
him, if he ſaid he belong'd to me, I
forbid him ſaying of that; but
only that he had a Letter to give
him from one of his Friends. With
this Pre-caution he was introduced
to him: And as my Man could
then no longer excuſe himſelf from
telling him from whom he came;
he had no ſooner mention'd my
Name to him, but that he refus'd
to take the Letter; telling him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily,
That when he had been once
offended he never pardoned. As
I did not expect ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Complement, I had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
him what Anſwer to make
him. Nevertheleſs, happening to
have ſome Wit: <hi>My Master is not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42899:77"/>
a Man,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>to be treated
in this manner: And though it
were true, that he had offended you,
which however I ſhall not grant, the
Submiſſion he makes to you would be
capable to ſweeten any other Spirit
than yours.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Theſe Words, far from produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Effect he hoped, did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerve to inſenſe him the more: So
as that my Man ſeeing there was
nothing to be done with ſuch a
rugged Temper, thought fitting to
come his ways. But in coming out
of the Chamber, he left the Letter
upon a Stool; telling him he was
afraid I ſhould beat him if he
brought it back. As I was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to know the Succeſs of this
Embaſſy, I thought the time tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
till he return'd: But I had ſo
little Reaſon to be ſatisfy'd with the
Reception that had been made him,
that the hopes that had fed me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
quickly vaniſht. I approv'd
what he had done, and what he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42899:77"/>
had ſaid: And as he was making
an end of giving me an Account of
all, word was brought me, that a
Footman ask'd for me. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to ſee <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Livery.
<hi>What would'ſt thou, Friend?</hi> I ſaid
to him haſtily; already hoping for
ſome better News. <hi>It is a Letter,</hi>
Signior, anſwer'd he, <hi>that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſends you back; and he deſires
you never to take the pains of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to him.</hi> At theſe Words he
preſented me my Letter, which
was ſtill ſealed up; And as there was
no way for me to decline taking of
it, I was ſtruck with grief, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to do with a Perſon of ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reaſon.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This was as yet but the Moiety
of my Misfortune. This whymſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Man, gueſſing that I did not
make all the Paces without finding
ſome returns in his Daughter, he
forbid her not only to have any
Commerce with me, but he watcht
her ſo narrowly, that though ſhe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42899:78"/>
had been of an Humour to do
things to the prejudice of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
it would have been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for her. Nevertheleſs, he
knew not that we had a String to
our Bow, which it was difficult for
him to break: This was the Waiting-woman
whom the <hi>Go-between</hi> had
placed with the Mother, by whoſe
means I receiv'd five or ſix Letters
after one another.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But all on the ſudden I ſaw my
ſelf depriv'd of this Conſolation;
and when I ask'd the Reaſon, the
<hi>Go between</hi> told me, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had taken away all the Ink
and Paper that was in the Houſe;
that there was no longer any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
but by his Order; and not
content with this, he had plac'd
Maids with his own Hand about
the Mother and Daughter, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any one from being ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as to furniſh them wherewithal
to keep on foot our Commerce.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42899:78"/>
                           <q>All theſe Pre-cautions ſeem'd to
me very ſtrange in a Man I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
offended: and all the Comfort
I had left in ſo great a Misfortune
was, that I could ſtill write, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Anſwers by word of Mouth.
I knew not whether they were ever
conformable to what the <hi>Go-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi>
told me: But in fine, as they
could not be more obliging for me,
I took thence an occaſion to revive
the Deſign I had interrupted for
the Reaſons already ſpecify'd: I
mean the propoſing a-new a private
Wedding. To oblige this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to do her Duty well, I not
only ſhew'd my ſelf beneficial
to her, but ſtill made her hope for
great rewards if ſhe ſped. This is a
Secret very ſerviceable to many
People; and there are thouſands
that thereby ſucceed in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
But for my part, who am the
moſt unfortunate of all men, I found
my ſelf Ship wrack'd where others
find an Harbour.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="152" facs="tcp:42899:79"/>
                           <q>That you may apprehend this
Truth, I muſt tell you, Sir, That
this Woman underſtanding her
Trade to Perfection, lur'd me for
ſome time without giving me any
poſitive Anſwer. One while <hi>Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
did but weakly oppoſe my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal;
another while ſhe abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected it, as the thing in the
World the moſt injurious for her.
At length, after having thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon me for Two Months;
That is to ſay, during the whole
time that my Employment permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me to ſtay at <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhe no
ſooner ſaw me upon the Point of
my Departure, but ſhe told me,
That <hi>Lidiana</hi> being perſwaded of
the Honeſty of my intentions, had
at length reſolved no content me.
So great a piece of News, and
which beſides was ſo little expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by me, overwhelm'd me with
an indicible Joy. <hi>Is it poſſible,</hi> I ſaid
to this Woman, <hi>that</hi> Lidiana <hi>yields
to my Deſires? And how ſhall I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42899:79"/>
acknowledge this Obligation, for
which I know I am only endebted to
you?</hi> I told her thereupon, all that
an <hi>Inamorato</hi> is capable of ſaying,
when he thinks himſelf juſt ready
to enjoy a Felicity after which he
has long ſigh'd: And not content
with expreſſing my Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to her by Words, I made her
Preſents ſo-ſo conſiderable.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>The Joy I was in had hinder'd
me from asking her, after what
manner ſhe had agreed with</hi> Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana
<hi>to execute our Project: but
ſuſpecting that I ſhould not be
long without asking it, ſhe
prevented me by queſtioning me
how I pretended to go to work:</hi>
For in ſhort, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> I do
not ſee that you would have been the
better by having her Conſent, at least,
if I had not ſmoothened a Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that was offer'd. You know ſhe is
kept in her Father's Eye, and by the
Perſon he has put about her; and
how to deceive theſe Two <hi>Argus</hi>'s,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42899:80"/>
and find the time neceſſary for you
Both, before you can put your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
in a good way. Yet this is what
I have done, <hi>added ſhe, without
giving me time to anſwer her:</hi> For
having objected this ſame Difficulty
to <hi>Lidiana,</hi> now in diſcourſe, I let
her ſee, that having but a Quarter of
an Hours time, this Marriage could
not be done in the Forms; but that
if ſhe would trust to a Promiſe you
ſhould give her of marrying her, it
was all one and the ſame thing, ſince
that you lov'd her too much to deceive
her.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This, Sir, is what this danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Woman told me; to which
ſhe added, that after having had a
great deal to do before ſhe could
bring <hi>Lidiana</hi> to reſolve upon this,
ſhe gave her her Word at the long
run; That in conſideration of this
Promiſe ſhe would do all I pleas'd.
That if I had the aſſurance of
mounting by Night into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
with a Rope-Ladder, I ſhould
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42899:80"/>
find the Window open: But that I
was to make no Noiſe when I was
once got in, becauſe that the leaſt
Word was capable of diſcovering
me: That I knew there was only a
ſingle Wall between her Mothers
Chamber and hers; Nay, and that
the Two Beds were very near one
another: That therefore I ought to
take my meaſures accordingly:
That I needed only to preſent my
Promiſe; that was my Paſport:
That <hi>Lidiana</hi> would take it; after
which ſhe would grant me all things
as her Husband.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It is impoſſible to expreſs the joy
theſe good News gave me. That
I had before was nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of this: Not that I meant
to abuſe <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s facility, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſaw my ſelf thereby deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the trouble of lulling
to ſleep a Father more difficult to
deceive than a jealous man: Beſides
I had no time to loſe, being upon
the Point, as I have already ſaid, of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42899:81"/>
my Departure. Be it as it will;
being urg'd on by my Love, and
this Circumſtance, I deſired the
<hi>Go-between</hi> to procure the Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for that very Night; and to
ſignifie to me, whether it would
be accepted. Her Anſwer was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to my impatience: She
told me, that <hi>Lidiana</hi> would leave
the Window open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to me on her behalf, that
I ſhould not in the Sequel abuſe the
Favour ſhe did me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a profound ſilence. I told
her I would perform all ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
in ſuch manner as that <hi>Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
ſhould never have the leaſt
matter to upbraid me withal.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Things being thus concluded on
both ſides, I kept my ſelf ready for
the Hour of the Rendezvouze:
And having written the Promiſe in
agitation, which I was ſo fooliſh as
that I muſt needs ſign it with my
Blood, I went from home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
under <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Windows:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42899:81"/>
at the time I thought all People to
be in Bed, I ſlung up my Ladder
of Ropes, which ſhe was to faſten,
for fear I ſhould break my Neck;
and finding it fixt, I mounted-up
in ſuch haſte, as that I ſeem'd to
fly. When I was at the Window,
I puſh'd againſt it, to ſee if it was
open; and having found all things
conformable to what had been told
me, I entred the Chamber, where
I ſhould have ſee my ſelf up againſt
the Wall, though I knew the Room
well enough, if one had not come
to take me by the Hand. <hi>Ah!</hi>
Lidiana, I ſaid to her ſoftly, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as nigh as I could to her Ear;
<hi>how infinitely am I oblig'd to you?
And though I ſhould give you to the
laſt Drop of my Blood, can I ever
acquit my ſelf to you of what I owe
you?</hi> I was ſo very much in Love,
that notwithſtanding the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was made me, I was going
to launch out into a Diſcourſe of a
World of ſuch like things, when
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42899:82"/>
this Perſon put her Hand upon my
Mouth. I thereby underſtood
that ſhe barr'd my ſaying any thing
more; and ſtudying only to pleaſe
her, I held my Tongue immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But in exchange I took that
Hand, and kiſſing it with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports
that are more eaſie to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
than deſcribed; I held my
Fortune ſo great, that I would not
have exchanged it for that of a
King. From thence I would have
proceeded to the Face, but this
Perſon repuls'd me gently with her
Hand; inſomuch that ſhe did but
the more augment the flames I was
ſenſible of for her.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>What ſhall I tell you in ſhort, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeveral little things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſhe yielded to my Deſires,
after having receiv'd the Promiſe I
have mention'd, and which I gave
her upon my accoſting her. <hi>How!</hi>
the <hi>Sultan</hi> interrupted, <hi>has</hi> Lidiana
<hi>granted you the last Favours? And
dare you boast of this in my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42899:82"/>
you that know, that of a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Slave, as ſhe was, I made her a</hi>
Sultana; <hi>nay, and a</hi> Sultana-<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.
Pardon me, Sir,</hi> this Man
anſwer'd; <hi>Matters went not ſo;
and if you would be pleas'd to have
one Moments Patience, I will quickly
acquaint you how all this Concern was
unravell'd.</hi> You muſt know, that
in the Moment that I thought my
ſelf the moſt Unhappy of all Men,
I found ſo little of what I ſought,
that I could have wiſh'd my ſelf a
good way off. Is it poſſible, ſaid
I in my ſelf, that there can be ſuch
deluding Maidens, and that it is
my ill Fortune to have made ſo ill a
Choice? I did not make theſe
Lamentations without cauſe: She I
had in my Arms had been already
in thoſe of ſeveral others, by what
appeared to me. Thus my Love
being changed all of the ſudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a terrible Diſguſt, I need not tell
you that the Night ſeem'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Years long to me. This is a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42899:83"/>
thing you may eaſily ſuppoſe of
your ſelf; and it is not neceſſary
that I utter my mind further. In
fine, I made the Day come at leaſt
Two Hours ſooner than ordinary:
I mean, that there were Two Hours
of Night ſtill to come, when I told
this Perſon that I was going my
ways becauſe the Day drew near.
She graſp'd me in her Arms, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to make me believe that ſhe
let me not go without Regret:
But this little avail'd her, ſince I was
ſo far from making Returns to her
Fondneſſes, that I could have been
content, as they vulgarly ſay, to
have been kick'd out thence. In
ſhort; having broke out of her
Arms without obſerving many
Meaſures, I went my ways with a
Mortal Vexation; but which would
have ſtill been much greater but
for a dexterous Trick I us'd This
Perſon had put my Promiſe under
the Bolſter; I took it ſlily away,
with a full Reſolution not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42899:83"/>
her, ſince that inſtead of the
Raviſhments I had promis'd my
ſelf to have met withal in her, I
had found ſomething ſo different,
that the Day was not more from
Night.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now theſe are the Particulars of
that Rendezvouze; to which it is
convenient to add to undeceive you
at preſent of the thought you had
of its being <hi>Lidiana:</hi> for the <hi>Go-between</hi>
having propos'd to her the
Secret Marriage I have before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and in no wiſe prevailing
with her to conſent to it, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
her ſelf of making an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſupply her Room, to merit
the Recompences I had propos'd.
Thus one may ſee how dangerous
it is to truſt in thoſe Venial Souls;
and provided they have your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
they mind not by what
means. Beſides it was an eaſie
matter for her to paulm this Trick
upon me. She had in the Houſe a
Creature ſhe had ſeveral times put
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42899:84"/>
to all ſorts of Tryals: Beſides ſhe
lay in <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Chamber; nay
and in her Bed; the Father of that
fair Virgin thinking fit to have her
by him, for fear of thoſe Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rendezvouzes by which the
ſharpeſt circumſpection is over-reach'd.
Now I was ignorant of
this Circumſtance. Thus all things
conſpiring to my Misfortune, it is
not to be wondred that I was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
deceived.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>In the mean while I went away
the next Morning without bidding
<hi>Adieu</hi> to the real <hi>Lidiana,</hi> of whom
however I had no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
But the Adventures of a
Wicked Night had ſo pawl'd me,
that I was no longer capable of
Gratitude or of Love. Being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
with ſuch Sentiments, if I
could have made my Horſe fly, I
ſhould have done it; ſo eager I was
to diſtance my ſelf from <hi>Lidiana;</hi>
to whoſe diſadvantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told my
ſelf then at leaſt as many things
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42899:84"/>
as I had told my ſelf a little before
in her favour. So precipitated a
Departure did extreamly ſurprize
her: She was not for ſome time to
be perſwaded that I was gone: but
at length having no room left for
doubt, if her Love made her be
troubled for my Proceedure, her
Spight ſuggeſted into her ſo many
things againſt me, that it may be
ſaid to have got the Victory. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
ſhe was not ſo well Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of her ſelf as that ſhe could
entirely forget me; wherefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having waver'd a long time,
whether ſhe ought to write to me
or not, her weakneſs was more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
than her Haughtineſs. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſhe thought hereby rather to
revenge her ſelf on me, than make
appear the Remnants of her Love.
Nevertheleſs, as in regard of that
Paſſion it is more grateful to a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to meet with Reproaches than
to be treated with indifference, this
had been ſtill matter of Triumph
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42899:85"/>
to me; ſuppoſing I had been ſtill as
ſenſible to her Merit as I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been. But leaving this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
apart, which nevertheleſs was
never conteſted by able People, I
will repeat to you the Tenour of
the Letter ſhe ſent me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <floatingText type="letter">

                              <head>LIDIANA's Letter to
RIVELLI.</head>
                              <p>I Thought you of a Character ſo
different from that of other Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that I made no Scruple of giving
you Teſtimonies of my Weakneſs. But
in fine, it was a folly in me to believe
otherwiſe than that all Men reſemble
one another: There is not one but
that is a Deceiver: And as it would
be Blindneſs to doubt of this after your
Carriage, I am become ſo wiſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that I ſhould rather chooſe to loſe
my Life than ever more commit the
Folly I have done. In ſhort, I hate
you now as much as I ever lov'd you:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42899:85"/>
This ſays All to expreſs the Sentiments
I am in, ſince it is certain that I have
been ſo poſſeſs'd in your Favour, that
nothing could be added to my good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>

                        <p>
                           <q>She has Reaſon, ſaid I ſmiling in
my ſelf, never more to commit the
Folly ſhe has done. It is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the means to diſquiet thoſe that
have to do with her; and I adviſe
her to ſtick to her Face; which far
from diſcovering her Defects, has
ſo many Attractions, that no body
would ever imagine that the reſt
was ſo little anſwerable thereunto.
After this Reflexion, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were as little to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
I felt my Pulſe, as I may
ſay, to know whether I ought to
make her an Anſwer; but fearing
if I did ſo, it might make me incur
an other Letter, I reſolv'd by my
ſilence to break off all Commerce
between us Two.</q>

                           <q>Now this was my Proceedure;
whence it is eaſie to conjecture, that
<hi>Lidiana</hi> ſeeing her ſelf ſlighted in
this manner effectually hated me
in ſucceſſion of time, as much as
ſhe had ever lov'd me. But what
do I ſay? Her Averſion did much
ſurpaſs the Love ſhe had ever had
for me: I will make who will be
Judge: And I will take you your
ſelf, Sir, to Witneſs, after I ſhall
have related to you the Sequel of
my unhappy Hiſtory.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>You muſt know, that the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
being ended, I was in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in a City where all the Women,
even ſuch as were of the very
Dregs of the People, were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Beauties. And certainly though
I have travell'd as much as any Man
of my Age, I know no place where
Beauty is more generally found.
This infinitely pleaſed all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
Severall allured by ſo great a
Charm, married in this Place; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that had not as yet Devotion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42899:86"/>
enough for ſo holy a Buſineſs, got
Miſtreſſes; and of the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of us I may ſafely ſay, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I remained inſenſible. They all
wonder'd at this; and particularly
thoſe that knew me to be of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
very prone to Love: But in
ſhort, one ſingle Night had given
me a Diſguſt to all Women; and
they were all <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s to me,</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>About the middle of our Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Quarters I had a Boon to ask
of the Senate; and thinking to
obtain it better in Perſon than to
demand it by a Letter, I departed
Poſt; though to tell the Truth, I
conſidered on it more than once by
reaſon of <hi>Lidiana,</hi> whom I was
afraid of meeting ſome where or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
nay and for whom I had ſo
much Averſion, that I dreaded to
hear her ſo much as ſpeak. Being
arriv'd at <hi>Venice</hi> I did not ſo much
as enquire after her, for fear ſome
troubleſome Perſon or other ſhould
come and extoll her Gracefulneſs
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42899:87"/>
and Beauty to me. Only the <hi>Go-between</hi>
knowing of my Return,
came to ſee me; or to ſpeak more
exactly, to renew ſome Commerce
with me; ſo to get ſome Money
from me. But I ſent her Word,
that I would not ſpeak with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yet this not making her deſiſt, ſhe
came again ſeveral times; which
oblig'd me to ſend her Word, That if
ſhe was ever more ſeen at my Gate,
I would have her whipt. She knew
not what to think of ſo great an
Alteration: But in fine, theſe Words
being poſitive, ſhe was afraid of
the Baſtonnade, and importuned
me no more.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>I came not alone to Town; one
of the moſt Conſiderable Officers
of the Army kept me Company.
As he was Young, well-made and
very Rich, he quickly made an
Hurry-durry among the Ladies;
who were not all Cruel to him.
Nevertheleſs he met with One to
whom he ſigh'd in vain: And as he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42899:87"/>
very ingenuouſly told me his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
after having entertain'd me
with his good Succeſs with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he imparted to me the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of this Perſon; at which he
ſeem'd to me to be very much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
As I was no longer an</hi> Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morato,
<hi>I did not take his Paſſion
by the ſame Byaſs I ſhould former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have done. On the contrary, I
told him, That I wonder'd that he
who was ſo richly ſtock'd with
Wit, laid a thing ſo very much to
heart that was only the Well-bred
Man's Trivial Play-thing; or at
moſt ought to ſerve him only as an
Amuſement. He was ſurpriz'd to
hear me talk in this manner; I
whom he had ever known to be of
a Character quite different from
this Diſcourſe.</hi> You are no longer
the ſame Man I knew, <hi>he ſaid to
me:</hi> And pray ye ſince when have
you been ſo very much chang'd? Since,
<hi>I anſwer'd him,</hi> that I have found
all Women to be deceitful. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42899:88"/>
told him my Hiſtory; <hi>at which
he did but laugh, after the rate of
moſt Young People, that make a
Jeaſt of all.</hi> You laugh at my Coſt,
<hi>I ſaid to him:</hi> but have a care I do
not quickly laugh at yours. This
cannot be long first, ſince you tell me
you are ſo very much in Love; For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
craving all Lovers Pardon, there is
not One but is a Culty: And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all your Wit and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
I have no better Opinion
of you than of an other. All Women
cheat us, <hi>continued I:</hi> Some ſmile
upon us, as having need to recover
their Honour that has long been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Cloud; Others ſeek to loſe
it: And if there be any one that has
ſincerity at firſt, ſhe keeps it not long,
either that We being firſt wicked, we
quickly teach them to become ſo as
they cannot repair the Corruption of
their Nature; which makes them run
full ſpeed to Perdition. The truth
is, <hi>he ſaid to me,</hi> you ſurprize me
ſtill more and more by ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42899:88"/>
Sentiments: I do not much
wonder to ſee you have ſuch a bad
Opinion of her that has deceived
you; but to extend it indifferently
over all Women, is what I cannot
reliſh; nor will ever any Body reliſh
it no more than I. Pardon me, I
<hi>ſaid to him;</hi> For let a Man but
have never ſo little Practice of the
World, and he will quickly know that
they are all mark'd in the ſame Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and all the difference I find in
them is, that ſome are cunninger
than others; inſomuch that they
can longer diſguiſe their ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>We could never agree upon this
Matter; which did not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my Head no more than the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
he ſpread abroad of me, that
I ſlighted all Women. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were all ſo indifferent
to me, that he aſſerted nothing but
the Truth. Nevertheleſs as he was
daily more and more poſſeſs'd in
Favour of his Miſt reſs, he was ſo
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42899:89"/>
particularly aſſiduous in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to her, as oblig'd her to
look upon him with a better Eye
than ſhe had hitherto done. He
came to proclaim this Triumph to
me with an unequall'd Joy; and
in all probability expected I ſhould
have complemented him upon the
Occaſion; when I told him with a
very dull Face; <hi>Well! You ſee now
which of us two was in the right:
Now the Cheat's diſcovered: You
was only put off at firſt that you
might be the more enflam'd; and now
you are only look'd upon with a better
Eye for fear you ſhould be gone.
Do but continue, and you will ſee
ſtrange things. In fine; I do not
deſpair but that the ſame thing
will quickly befall you as did
me; and you need only to preſs
on, as I did, to be convinc'd of
this Truth from your own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42899:89"/>
                           <q>I ſhall not tell you, Sir, all that
he reply'd to me upon this Point:
that would be too tedious: and it
is ſufficient that you know, that he
having continued to ſing to me ſtill
in the ſame favourable Tune of his
Miſtreſs, I was oblig'd to draw him
<hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Picture, to ſhew him,
that thoſe that had the fineſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
were not the <hi>Shees</hi> in
whom he ought moſt to truſt. He
was very attentive to the firſt
Stroaks I touch'd of her; but I
perceived that he afterwards grew
concerned; which I was preparing
to ask him the reaſon of, when he
interrupted me with this Diſcourſe:
<hi>Forbear your Raileries, I beſeech
you,</hi> Rivelli, <hi>and do not draw the
Pourtraict of my Miſtreſs inſtead of
yours.</hi> I! the Pourtraict of your
Miſtreſs, ſaid I to him, ſtrangely
amaz'd: Faith I had no ſuch
Thoughts: I know not who ſhe
is, and hitherto have not been
much concerned to know her;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42899:90"/>
but you will ſee, that if they be ſo
alike in Face, they are much more
alike in inclination: I told you
plainly enough, that all of them
are Cheats; and you will never
believe it till you are caught.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q> He took in ill part all I ſaid to
him; and ſeeing it impoſſible for
me to get him out of his penſive
Humour: But for God's ſake, <hi>I ſaid
to him,</hi> acquaint me with your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
Name; for I know that of
mine; and this will be ſurer than
all the Conjectures you can derive
from my Diſcourſe. <hi>She is call'd</hi>
Lidiana, he anſwer'd me; <hi>and ſhe
is a Perſon of Quality, who is come
hither with her Mother for a Proceſs
of Conſequence which they have before
the Senate.</hi> I leave it to be judg'd
whether I was not ſurpriz'd at this
Declaration. Nevertheleſs I judg'd
it not convenient to tell him what
I thought of the matter: On the
contrary, being very willing that
he might be caught as well as I:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42899:90"/>
You have been falſly allarum'd,
<hi>ſaid I to him;</hi> I only knew <hi>Lidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
by Fame; and though ſhe is of
my Countrey, as I departed thence
when very young, I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I ever ſaw her. A body has
never ſo much aſſurance when he
tells a Lye as when he tells the
Truth; either that the ſerious look
I put on, made him ſuſpect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or that there appear'd Signs
in my Face that I did not ſpeak ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely;
he had no ſooner left me,
but that he left <hi>Lidiana,</hi> whom he
ask'd if ſhe knew me. She bluſht
at this Queſtion, and appearing
ſtrangely <hi>non plus'd; What is the
meaning of all this, Madam,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd?
<hi>And the Queſtion I put to
you, is it ſo extraordinary that it
muſt needs caſt you into the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I ſee you labour under.</hi> This
perplext her ſtill more than before;
inſomuch that it was not neceſſary
he ſhould queſtion her farther to
diſcover that it was ſhe I had point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42899:91"/>
at in my Diſcourſe: <hi>Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
he ſaid to her, <hi>who would have
thought it of ſo lovely a Perſon?
And what will become of me after all
I know?</hi> He ſaid no more: but as
this was more than needed to make
<hi>Lidiana</hi> apprehend that ſome Story
had been told him that touch'd her
Honour: <hi>Yes, Sir,</hi> ſhe ſaid to him,
<hi>I know</hi> Rivelli: <hi>But whence comes
this Perplexity, and the Diſcourſe
you hold me?</hi> He was in ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a Condition, that he could
not anſwer her in his Turn:
Whereupon <hi>Lidiana</hi> confirming
her ſelf ſtill more and more in her
Suſpicions: <hi>From that proceeds
what I ſee,</hi> ſhe renew'd: <hi>And is
it a Crime in me to have known</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli?
<hi>I'le tell you farther, he has
lov'd me; or at leaſt he would have
made me believe ſo: and perhaps
he would have marry'd me, but for
Conjectures which it's not neceſſary I
inform you of. I believe it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
Madam,</hi> he anſwer'd: <hi>But
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42899:91"/>
let me adviſe you not to mention it to
any Body. Nay and I adviſe you to
tell</hi> Rivelli, <hi>that he be more diſcreet
an other time: And if like him, I
had had the Fortune to have Favours
from ſo beautiful a Lady as you,
I would ſooner have been kill'd than
ever have ſpoke of them to any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>He judg'd not convenient to ſay
more to her, though ſhe earneſtly
entreated him to conceal nothing
from her: But what he had ſaid
to her being more than ſufficient
to make her underſtand that I had
ſpoke ill of her, I was ſtrangely
ſurpriz'd to ſee her enter my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
one Morning; and having
ask'd her the Occaſion, <hi>I come,
Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, after having
taken off her Veil, <hi>to know why
you ruine my Reputation: and I
wonder very much that you, whom
I ever thought a worthy Perſon, ſhould
do Actions ſo unworthy of a Man of
Honour. You was ſuffer'd,</hi> added
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42899:92"/>
ſhe, <hi>to go your ways, as you did,
without your taking leave of me: I
never made you any great Reproaches
for breach of Faith: and you ſhould
never have heard talk of me, if you
had not oblig'd me to it by your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>Lidiana</hi> appear'd ſo beauteous
to me in holding this Diſcourſe to
me; and ſhe was really ſo lovely,
that it is not to be wonder'd if I
perceiv'd thoſe Flames to revive
that had been formerly ſo ardent.
I was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd; I that
ſlighted her ſo much before, that
I ſhould have preferr'd the moſt
deſpicable of Creatures before her.
For this Cauſe did I ſeek to excuſe
my ſelf; or rather, I abſolutely
deny'd the ever having ſpoke ill of
her. <hi>It is very true, Madam,</hi> I
added, <hi>that I have great Reaſon to
be ſurpriz'd that you have ſo much
forgotten me after what paſs'd the
Night before my Departure; and
I can only attribute it to the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42899:92"/>
Levity ſo natural to thoſe of your
Sex.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I had no ſooner bolted the
Word but that I check'd my ſelf
tacitely for ſo doing. I ask'd my
ſelf what this meant: and if after
the imperfections ſhe had under her
Linnen, a Man muſt not be void
of Judgment to be ſtill ſenſible of
any Spark of a Flame that muſt
needs make me bluſh for ſhame.
But if I made this Reflection, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>
immediately free'd me from
it by a Tranſport of Anger which
ſhe could not moderate, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard me talk in this manner
<hi>What then has paſs'd between us,</hi> ſhe
ſaid to me? <hi>And impart it to me,
ſince that I do not remember it. Let's
leave that matter apart,</hi> I ſaid to her,
<hi>and let it never be mentioned, ſince
you have forgotten it ſo ſoon. I
have tenderly lov'd you, you know
it: but in ſhort, one is not born to
love eternally: And though this
ſhould not commonly happen, yet this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42899:93"/>
is what has befallen you, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
never to love any Man but
me.</hi> It will be a ſurprizing thing
to you, <hi>Sir,</hi> that I talk'd to her in
this manner; after the tacite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
I had newly made to my
ſelf: But the more I look'd upon
her, the more I found the Wounds
to open again that ſhe had made in
me. Wherefore all I could ſay to
my ſelf of the Condition I had
found her in, being not capable to
make me turn my Eyes from off
her, I grew more enflam'd than
ever; which will not ſeem ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
to you when I ſhall have told
you, that ſhe quickly juſtify'd her
ſelf to me of the Suſpicions I had
conceiv'd of her Vertue.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>As all I ſaid to her did ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
that ſomething very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
had paſs'd between us, ſhe
would by all means know it; and
thinking there was no great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in diſcovering a thing to her
which ſhe muſt needs know as well
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42899:93"/>
as I, I ſurpriz'd her extreamly,
when I told her what I told you
before. I perceiv'd ſhe bluſh'd at
this Relation, and I attributed it
to the Modeſty that is ſo natural to
Maidens; or to the Regret ſhe
had perchance for having granted
me this Favour now that ſhe no
longer lov'd me. But I remain'd
not long in this Opinion: <hi>What
you now tell me,</hi> ſhe ſaid to me, <hi>is
an Impoſture ſo enormous, that I
will die in Torments, or I will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.
You ſhall maintain before
the World what you have now ſaid
to me: It concerns your Honour and
mine ſo to do; and I perceive you
have been deceiv'd.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>Theſe Words open'd my Eyes
when it was too late; and no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
matter was it for me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that it was the</hi> Go-between
<hi>and her implement that had plaid
me this Prank. In the mean while,
if without having been inform'd of</hi>
Lidiana'<hi>s innocence, I had a-new
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42899:94"/>
conceiv'd for her Sentiments all full
of tenderneſs, it was quite another
thing, when I was perſwaded of
it.</hi> Ah! Madam, <hi>I ſaid to her,</hi>
what can I ever do to repair my
Fault? It was the loſs of the Eſteem
I had for you that has been the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of all this Diſorder. But
now that I know your Virtue, I ſhall
ſo well repair what has paſs'd, that you
ſhall ſee that it is not without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Regret that I ſee my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to leave you. But I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<hi>I added,</hi> that my Repentance
ſhould exempt me to you wards from
the Satisfaction I owe you: You
need only impoſe a Puniſhment upon
me, and I ſhall not appeal from it,
however rigorous it may be: and on
the contrary I will ſay, that you are
too good, ſince I own my Fault does
not merit any Pardon.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If ſhe would have liſten'd to
me, I ſhould have ſaid much more
to her, ſo penetrated I was with
Love: But her Head being only
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42899:94"/>
poſſeſs'd with her own Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhe went directly to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whom ſhe gave a faithful
account of all I have newly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
As that Lady could not act
all alone in this Concern, ſhe gave
her Husband intimation of the
Matter, who preſented a Requeſt
to the Magiſtracy, that he might
be permitted to take up all thoſe
he ſuſpected of this intrigue. The
Magiſtracy having upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
given way to Juſtice, the <hi>Go-between</hi>
and her imp were put into
Priſon; and I was confronted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them after they had deny'd
the Points upon which they were
examined. As the Truth was eaſie
to be made out, notwithſtanding
all their little Tricks and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
the Judges condemn'd
them to be put to the Rack. This
ſtruck a Terror into them; and
preferring a ſpeedy Death to Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
that are very often worſe
than the loſs of Life; they own'd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42899:95"/>
their Crime, without ſtanding to
be put to Torment. After this
they were condemn'd to the Whip
and to Baniſhment; a Puniſhment
too mild for a Crime of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This Affair did not thus occur
in <hi>Venice,</hi> without furniſhing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Talk to a World of People:
And as Detraction finds occaſion
to bite upon all things, People
there were that would needs have
it, that theſe Wretches had been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie'd
to recover <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
This Rumour was quickly
buzz'd about the Town; which
the Father having notice of, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
a Concern at it to his
Friends, who advis'd him to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her out of hand. They told
him, as it was true, That it was
the means to put an end to all theſe
Diſcourſes: Whereas-as long as ſhe
ſhould remain a Maiden, People
would be ever talking of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
He found their Reaſons
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42899:95"/>
very pertinent: and as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him at the ſame time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me before all the Matches that
could be offer'd, it ſo fell out, that
his intereſt made him forget the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
he had conceived againſt
me. One of our mutual Friends
propos'd the thing to me, which
fill'd me ſo with joy as was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for me to expreſs it. I went
immediately to find out <hi>Lidiana</hi>'s
Father; and after having thank'd
him for his kind thoughts to me, I
told him that he might make the
Contract of Marriage as he pleas'd:
That I pretended to give all I had
to his Daughter: wherefore that
it could not be ſo advantageous to
her but that I ſhould ſtill wiſh to
do more for her. He receiv'd my
Complement with abundance of
Civility; and after having made
ſome Excuſe to me for what wa
paſs'd, he bid me go ſee his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
and tell her this News<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
found her alone in her Chamber
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42899:96"/>
and having thrown my ſelf at her
Feet: <hi>Your Father beſtows you upon
me,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>Beauteous</hi> Lidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.
<hi>But as this Preſent, however
incomparable it may be, cannot pleaſe
me unleſs it comes from your own
hand: Tell me, I beſeech you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Regret I have for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
you, has made you forget the
hatred you had for me.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Lidiana <hi>gave me not time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
theſe laſt Words; or at leaſt
did not give her ſelf the Patience
to hear them. And indeed, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
me with a Diſturbance of
mind not eaſily to be obſerv'd:</hi> My
Father beſtow me upon you! <hi>ſhe ſaid
to me:</hi> And is he ſo poor ſpirited
after the Reaſons we have to hate
you? Does he not remember the ill
Opinion you had of me? And in
ſhort, after the moſt ſenſible Affront
that a Man can offer to a Virgin, is
it poſſible that he can pitch his Choice
upon you? How, Madam! <hi>I ſaid
to her,</hi> is it poſſible that you your
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42899:96"/>
ſelf do remember my Offence, rather
than the Regret I have for having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
you? I ſhall ſay nothing to ye
of my Love: yet if you have the leaſt
Memory, you muſt know that I have
lov'd you with all the Paſſion and
all the Honeſty imaginable. This is
ſufficiently juſtify'd by the Esteem I
have forborn having for you from
the very moment that I thought you
leſs honeſt than I imagin'd; but now
that nothing more hinders me from
entertaining that Esteem a-new, I
may tell you, that I ſhall render ſo
much Juſtice to your Merit and
Vertue, that never Husband ſet ſo
great a Value upon a Wife as I pretend
to have for you. If you never eſteem
me but in that Quality, <hi>ſhe anſwer'd
me,</hi> you will never have other than
an ill Opinion of me. Though I
know the Obedience that I owe to my
Father, yet I would have you know
that I ſhall diſpence my ſelf from it
in this Occaſion: Wherefore if you
have the leaſt Conſideration for me, I
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42899:97"/>
beſeech you to lay aſide all thoughts of
courting me; otherwiſe you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me to things which will not be
to the advantage of either of us
both.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>You may think, Sir, I could
not be otherwiſe than afflicted at
theſe Words.</hi> Ah! Madam, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how the Caſe ſtands, <hi>I anſwer'd
her:</hi> I now experience a Calumny that
is common to me with many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Wretches. I have a Rival; and
you do not hate me ſo much on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what I have done to you, as
becauſe that you love an other. <hi>I
was ſtruck with Jealouſie at the
ſame moment: and after having
cudgelled my Head with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
deſires of revenge, I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all in a Fury, and fully reſolv'd
not to let things reſt ſo. In this
Deſign I went to find out my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
whom I let know, that one of
us muſt die. He was a brave Man,
and not of an Humour to be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at ſuch a Complement: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42899:97"/>
without being in any manner
heated;</hi> Very willingly, <hi>he ſaid to
me;</hi> but perhaps there will be no need
of that, if you will but acquaint me
what animates you ſo much againſt
me. Can you be ignorant of that,
<hi>I anſwer'd him?</hi> And when you rob
me of my Miſtreſſes Heart, can I be
without Reſentment? I have not
ſo much Preſumption, <hi>he reply'd to
me:</hi> but though it were ſo, I ſwear
to you, that things ſhall never go
farther on my ſide. I have lov'd
<hi>Lidiana,</hi> I own it; nay and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to marry her; but ſince the
News you imparted to me, I am ſo
thoroughly pawl'd, that I no longer
remember that I have lov'd her. If
ever I happen to marry, <hi>added he,</hi> it
ſhall not be a Chronicle-Wife, at leaſt
in my knowledge.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This Diſcourſe made me appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that he was one of thoſe that
had an ill Opinion of <hi>Lidiana:</hi>
And though I had a ſufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
for her, as to be very glad
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42899:98"/>
that every one ſhould do her Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
the leaſt of my Cares was to
undeceive him. Having no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
any Occaſion to quarrel with
him, after ſuch a Declaration, I ſet
my Mind a little more at reſt; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that ſince I had not a tender
and paſſionate Lover to combate
withal in her Boſom, in time I
might with eaſe recover the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of her good Opinion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſſeſs'd with theſe Sentiments,
what did I not do for Two whole
Years together? I quitted my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
that I might be the more
aſſiduous with her; and declining
to make uſe of her Father's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who ſtill favour'd my Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
I plac'd my hopes only in the
Exceſs of my Repentance, and in
the Violence of my Love. What
did I not do, Sir, during ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a time, and which ſeem'd
ſo much the longer to me as that I
was in Torment? But what need is
there of ſpinning out this Diſcourſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42899:98"/>
any further? You muſt know, that
I only loſt my Pains; which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me into the utmoſt Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
I departed from <hi>Venice</hi>
with a Reſolution to go ſeek in
Forreign Countries the Cure I
could not hope for as long as I
ſtaid in a Place where I ſhould be
continually expos'd to the ſeeing of
<hi>Lidiana.</hi> I had much a-do to form
this Reſolution, and much more to
execute it; ſo great is the Feeble
when one is in Love. But what
much help'd to make me gain this
over my Mind is, that <hi>Lidiana</hi> had
no longer any Quiet with her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſince ſhe had ſo formally
thwarted his Will. Thus believing
my Abſence would skreen her from
all theſe Perſecutions, I went to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and thence into <hi>France,</hi>
where I ſerv'd in the Forces that
were appointed againſt <hi>Flanders.</hi>
But though War be capable of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
one's Mind entirely; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
when a Man has a little Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42899:99"/>
it is nevertheleſs certain,
that wherever I went I carry'd <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>'s
image along with me: She
every where came to torment me;
inſomuch that having no more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in that Countrey than I had
at <hi>Venice,</hi> I return'd thither <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi>
to have at leaſt the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſeeing her. I found ſhe
was gone thence on her return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our own Countrey; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Journey thither my ſelf, I
was told the ſaddeſt News that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could have befallen me. It is
not neceſſary that I tell it you; you
know it, Sir, as well as I; I mean
the ſtealing away of <hi>Lidiana</hi> by
the <hi>Aga.</hi> Any other that had been
leſs in Love, would have content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf with venting of Sighs,
and with accuſing Fate of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
But as my Love was of a
different Nature from that of all
Men, I alſo took a Reſolution,
which no other Man but I would
have taken; it was to come ſnatch
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42899:99"/>
                              <hi>Lidiana</hi> out of the <hi>Aga</hi>'s Hands;
wherein though I ſaw an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable
Difficulty, my Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
was, that either I ſhould die
in pain, or that I ſhould ſpeed in my
Deſign. Whereupon I came hither
only as courting Death, as I may
ſay: but Deſtiny ſeeking ſtill more
and more to oppreſs me, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that your <hi>Celſitude</hi> had had
the ſame Eyes as I: That is to ſay,
that you had found <hi>Lidiana</hi> ſo
Beauteous that you had put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your <hi>Serraglio.</hi> It would be
impertinent for me to tell you my
Deſpondency at this News: it is
eaſie for you to judge of it by the
Reſolution I took to paſs over the
Walls of the <hi>Serraglio:</hi> And I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to do ſo, ſo much the more
willingly, in that I hop'd that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>
being there againſt her Will,
ſhe would concur with me to free
her ſelf out of Slavery; ſuppoſing
that I was ſo happy as to get to the
Speech of her. There is no need
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42899:100"/>
of my telling you any thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
You know how you found
me; and I ſhall only add, that your
<hi>Celſitude</hi> is concern'd to puniſh me
out of hand, ſince that as long as I
ſhall be alive, I ſhall not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
againſt you, but alſo againſt
the whole Earth together; for a
heart without which I cannot
hope to live.</q>

            <p>This Man having thus related his
Concerns, the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who
had hearkened to him without one's
being able to ſay whether he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
with Revenge or Hatred,
went out of the Chamber, and ſo to
that of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who was inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
in this Diſcourſe. There,
without telling her what this Man
had related to him, he would needs
be acquainted with her Hiſtory from
her own Mouth, to ſee whether he
had not impos'd upon him. But her
Account having been altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to his, he wanted much of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42899:100"/>
being in that Anger he would have
been in had he perceiv'd they had
prevaricated with him. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he was ſtill uncertain what he
was to do: For on the one ſide he
judg'd this Man worthy of Death
for the Love he dar'd to harbour for
the <hi>Sultana:</hi> He conſider'd on the
other, That he was ſufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
in the manner he was treated.
In fine, Mildneſs having prevail'd
over all other Conſiderations, he
granted him his Pardon at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of <hi>Sultana Zelinda;</hi> not that
ſhe did honeſtly eſpouſe his intereſt,
but becauſe ſhe thought that by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
his Life, it would be for her
an inſtrument ready at hand that
would ſerve to render the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> jealous of her Rival. Now
indeed her Policy had been good,
ſuppoſing that his <hi>Celſitude</hi> had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him to ſtay in his Dominions;
but having had the Pre-caution to
ſend him away thence; nay end to
cauſe him to be accompany'd to the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42899:101"/>
very Frontier; that ſo he might
not be impoſed upon by this means,
her Malice prov'd all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>While that all this paſs'd <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
was ſtill in the ſame place, whence
he imagined he might eaſily eſcape,
having engag'd the Husband and
Wife in his intereſts. But as People
often reckon without their Hoſt, it
happen'd that in the very time that
he thought himſelf in the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
it wanted little but that he
had been diſcovered in the manner
I am going to relate: After all the
Busſle that I have newly re-counted,
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> went down into
the Garden with the Two <hi>Sultana</hi>'s;
and as he was walking there fell a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Rain that oblig'd him to ſeek
out ſome Place where he might be
under ſhelter. There being none
nearer than the Gardiner's Houſe,
he ran thither with his Company;
and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had but juſt time to
hide himſelf. In the mean while
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42899:101"/>
the Gardiner's Wife was ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> eaſily
perceiv'd that ſomething ail'd her.
The <hi>Sultana</hi>'s paſſed alſo the ſame
Judgment. But they all having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
it to the ſurpriſe ſhe was in
to ſee Perſons of their Rank, the
lowneſs of her Extraction ſav'd her.
The Rain being over, the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> return'd into the Garden;
and there it was that <hi>Sultana Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
was ſurprized with a ſtrong Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.
For while ſhe was amuſing
her time, in contemplating ſome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
that were upon their <hi>Pedeſtal,</hi>
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſtruck aſide with
her Rival; and kindling his Flames
a-new that had only been interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by her Malady, he entred into an
Arbour that was at the end of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
the Door of which he ſhut af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, for fear <hi>Zelinda</hi> ſhould
come and diſturb his Converſation.
<hi>Zelinda</hi> no ſooner perceiv'd that he
went off, but that being vex'd for
having given Occaſion to the Affront
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42899:102"/>
that was done her, ſhe walk'd apace
to overtake him. She was almoſt
as ſoon as he at the Arbour, which
ſhe ſaw him direct his ſteps to;
and when ſhe was juſt got up
to it, ſhe ſaw her ſelf ſhut out.</p>
            <p>This was ſo terrible a Vexation to
her, that ſhe had never had the
like. Perhaps ſhe did not love the
<hi>Sultan;</hi> and the Love ſhe had for
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> is a good inſtance of the
contrary, ſince Two great Paſſions
are incompatible with one another.
But in her Ambition ſupplying the
Room of Love, ſhe was for all the
World as jealous as if ſhe had real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lov'd him. I ſhall not however
loſe time in relating all that her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
made her ſay: and indeed it
would be needleſs, ſince there is no
body but may imagine, that in ſuch
Circumſtances one is capable of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many things. It is more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
that I proceed to her Actions,
by which it will be made more
manifeſt than by her Words, with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42899:102"/>
what Spirit ſhe was animated.</p>
            <p>All the World agrees, That Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have infinitely more Wit than
we Men, when the Matter in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is Love. The Reaſon for this
is eaſie to be given: As it is of an
extream Conſequence for them to
conceal their Concerns, they make
it their ſtudy, as I may ſay, from
their Infancy, to foreſee all that may
befall them. From hence it comes,
that ſome of 'em are ſo expert at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
their Gallants and Husbands.
But this is not my Buſineſs; and I
ſhall only ſay, that as they excel us
in the Art of making Love, it is the
like in Jealouſie, to which they are
ſo naturally prone, that it makes
them often commit a thouſand Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
If I ſought for the Reaſon of
it, I ſhould quickly find it. As Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
is a Companion of Love, it
follows, that he that is the moſt
wedded to this laſt Paſſion, is the
more ſmartly ſenſible of the other.
Now <hi>Zelinda</hi> making this fatal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42899:103"/>
it is not to be thought
ſtrange if ſhe ſtudy'd the means to
ruine her Rival, to which ſhe was ſo
much the more powerfully excited,
in that ſhe daily ſaw her Favour
augment, and that her own, on
the contrary, did viſibly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
            <p>After having fram'd this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhe was not long before ſhe
contented her ſelf; and in this
manner went ſhe to work: She
made reflection, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> only
paſs'd for her Rival's Brother, on
the ſcore of what her Mother had
ſaid of him: That the <hi>Sultan</hi> was to
be made believe, that it was a thing
invented on purpoſe to conceal the
ſecret Flames he had for her. That
if he was ſufficiently jealous after
this, to be hurry'd to the utmoſt
Extremities againſt him, ſhe would
ſee to preſerve him from danger, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Aſcendant ſhe had over
him, or by the Credit of others that
had the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Ear, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42899:103"/>
who would be over-joy'd to employ
their intereſt in her behalf. That
at the worſt, if <hi>Ibrahim</hi> periſh'd in
this Occaſion, ſhe ſhould have, at
leaſt, the Conſolation of having
involv'd her Rival in his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Such a Reſolution was no great
Proof that ſhe lov'd <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with
over-much Affection: But without
troubling my Head, in going about
to juſtifie her, I ſhall only ſay, that
ſhe is not the only Perſon that has
thus ſacrific'd her Love to her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
Be it as it will, being dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more and more perſwaded, that
ſhe could not take more juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
than theſe, to re-eſtabliſh her
ſelf in the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Favour, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
her Rival from it, ſhe caus'd
Notes to be dropp'd in the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi>'s Chamber, by which he had
intimation given him, that People
frequented the <hi>Serraglio</hi> for the Love
of the other <hi>Sultana.</hi> One of theſe
Notes falling into his Hands, he was
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42899:104"/>
ſtruck with ſo terrible a Paſſion, that
nothing was capable of cooling it,
but a thought that came into his
Head, that it might perchance be an
Artifice of <hi>Zelinda.</hi> That he might
ſhrift into the Truth, he went to this
laſt <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Apartment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to conſult her upon this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair:
<hi>Is it poſſible, Madam,</hi> he ſaid
to her, <hi>that I am deceiv'd? And you
that have ſo much intereſt to make
the Truth known to me, how can you
be at rest in a thing that concerns you
as well as I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He conſider'd her attentively, to
ſee if he could diſcover upon her
Face, with what Motions ſhe was
ſeiz'd. But</hi> Zelinda <hi>being Miſtreſs
of her Movements, and beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
in the Art of Diſſembling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all thoſe of her Sex:</hi> It is true,
Sir, <hi>ſhe ſaid to him,</hi> that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
concerns me as well as you, ſince
it would be the means to recover the
Honour of your Favour, which you
have bereav'd me of, without my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42899:104"/>
render'd my ſelf unworthy of
it. But to what purpoſe would it be
for me to intermeddle with a matter,
ſince that your <hi>Celſitude</hi> is ſo pre-poſſeſs'd,
that though I ſhould let you
ſee things with your own Eyes, yet
would you not believe them. <hi>She ſaid
theſe Words with ſuch an Air of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
that the</hi> Sultan <hi>fell into the
Trepan.</hi> How will you let me ſee
things with my own Eyes, <hi>he anſwer'd
her?</hi> And having it in your power to
procure my Repoſe, you have hitherto
had the Cruelty to be ſilent. Ah! Sir,
<hi>the</hi> Sultana <hi>ſaid to him,</hi> is this still
the means to get out my Secret? And
theſe Tranſports of Love that ſtart
from you in ſpight of your Anger, do
they not acquaint me, that the greateſt
harm that can be done you, is to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
you. Continue, Sir, <hi>ſhe added,</hi>
to love thoſe that deceive you, and on
the contrary, hate thoſe that love you.
This is the Fate I have of late under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:42899:105"/>
               <hi>This augmented the</hi> Sultan'<hi>s Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
to ſuch a point, that he would
needs at the ſame inſtant give order
for the ſtrangling of</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>which</hi>
Zelinda <hi>being mightily ſurpriz'd at:</hi>
Moderate your Paſſion, <hi>ſhe ſaid to
him,</hi> unleſs you would have me believe
that I am now the moſt unfortunate of
all Women. How can you have the
leaſt kindneſs left for me at a time when
you are ſo ſenſible for an other. But
if my intereſt does not affect you, do,
at leaſt, for your own ſake what you
will not do for mine. Suſpend your
Revenge, till you know whether you are
really jealous. Perhaps you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon, and would you not be very
glad to be ſo inform'd, that you may
not have any Scruple left.</p>
            <p>Tho theſe words were not capable
of appeaſing his Anger; yet at leaſt he
gave bounds thereunto, till ſuch time
as that he had ſhrifted into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In the mean while the <hi>Sultana</hi>
was very much perplex'd how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the Jealouſie ſhe had againſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42899:105"/>
her Rival, and the Love ſhe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of for <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> She had in her
Mind invented an infallible means to
confirm the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in his Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions:
But at the ſame time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to her ſelf, that it would
be the loſs of her Lover, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
her a little more reſerv'd in
her Revenge. At length, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prevail'd over Love, and to the
hazard of all that could happen, ſhe
reſolv'd to ruine her Siſter. What
farther oblig'd her to take this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
is, that after having promis'd,
as ſhe had done the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
to make him ſee clear into her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val's
infidelity, he earneſtly preſs'd
her daily, to which it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for her to reſiſt, at leaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
letting him ſee, that all that ſhe
had done, was only an impoſture:
Wherefore being preſs'd by ſuch
powerful Conſiderations, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to the <hi>Sultan</hi> the Promiſes ſhe
had made to him; and to acquit her
ſelf of them, ſhe told him that it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42899:106"/>
was neceſſary he ſhould diſſemble
both to the <hi>Sultana</hi> and to <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi>
That ſhe would make him
hear with his own Ears, his amorous
Cajolleries to her: That ſhe did not
think he required more of her, ſince
that to ſpeak on one ſide, and to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
on the other, was a Proof ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
great, that ſhe had told him
nothing but the Truth. That ſhe
ask'd him but Two or Three Days
for that purpoſe; that is to ſay, till
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> went to pay a Viſit to his
pretended Siſter, according to the
Permiſſion he himſelf had given
him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> agreed to all,
as alſo to put himſelf in a Woman's
Cloaths that day, that ſo in Quality
of <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s Maid, he might ſlip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Apartment,
without being known. Things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been concerted in this manner,
they were accordingly executed. <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
knowing that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was at
her Rival's Lodgings, carry'd the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42899:106"/>
               <hi>Sultan</hi> thither, and letting him into
a Cloſet that was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beyond the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
Chamber, ſhe bid him ſtay
there. Before ſhe left him, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him, that ſhe was going to
bring them both near him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
there being only a Partition of Deal
Boards, he might hear all that they
ſaid to one another: For ſhe inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to him at the ſame time, that
ſhe would withdraw immediately,
to afford them the means of ſaying
kind things to one another.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> fell into this Trap, and
<hi>Zelinda</hi> being gone out, ſhe pull'd
to the Door, ſhutting it to with a
Hook, without the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it. After this ſhe went to find
out <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and his Siſter, who were
in a place pretty remote from that
where the <hi>Sultan</hi> was, and there
making ſemblance of having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to deſire the Wife of one of
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
ſhe told her Rival, ſhe knew
not how to go about it, for that there
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42899:107"/>
had been ſome Bickering between
them: that if ſhe pleas'd, ſhe could
free her from that Trouble, ſhe that
was a Friend of this Officers Wife:
That ſhe entreated her to write to
her, as if the thing came from her,
and ſhe offer'd to do her the ſame
Service in the like Occaſion. By
this means ſhe engag'd her in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
And as ſhe had made it a long
tedious Buſineſs, a Tale of a Tub,
and that it was neceſſary ſhe ſhould
be a long while a writing, ſhe took
that time to go to the Place whither
ſhe had promis'd to bring the other
<hi>Sultana.</hi> She us'd their not diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her as a Pretence, and <hi>Ibrahim,</hi>
who was very glad of it, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to improve that Occaſion to
the diſcourſing her: Wherefore he
follow'd her at the ſame time; and
had no ſooner overtaken her, but
that taking her by the Hand, <hi>How
much am I oblig'd to you, Madam,</hi>
ſaid he to her, <hi>for having found the
means to ſend away the other</hi> Sultana?
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42899:107"/>
               <hi>And how happy ſhould I be if it was
for my ſake? Pardon me for my
boldneſs, in ſaying ſuch things to
you. It is perhaps ſhewing a little too
much Preſumption: but after all the
indulgence you have had for me, it is
pardonable in me, though I believe
that you prefer me even before the</hi>
Sultan.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who heard
all theſe Words as diſtinctly as if he
had been in the very place where
they were, not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Reſentment; <hi>Ah! Wretch,</hi>
cry'd he, with an inconceivable Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>ſtay one moment, and I will make
thee throw off that Criminal Love that
dares attack me, who am thy Maſter
and Benefactor.</hi> At theſe Words he
would have ruſh'd out of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet;
but finding reſiſtance at the
Door, his Reſentment augmented
in ſuch a manner, that all that I
might ſay of it, would fall much
ſhort of it. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
when he heard the <hi>Sultan</hi> talk
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42899:108"/>
in this manner; and <hi>Zelinda</hi> making
ſemblance of being the like, <hi>Ah! you
are ruin'd, my Dear,</hi> ſhe ſaid to him,
after having got at ſome diſtance
from that Place, for fear the <hi>Sultan</hi>
ſhould know her Voice: <hi>Make your
Eſcape preſently, and for my part, I
will ſee to come off as well as I can.</hi>
The Neceſſity was too urgent to
ſtay long in conſulting what Courſe
to take. Thus <hi>Ibrahim</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any more ſafe Retreat than
the Gardiner's Houſe, where he had
already been, leapt out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
without being perceiv'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
body. <hi>Zelinda</hi> having ſhut it
after him, went to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who
us'd his utmoſt endeavours to break
the Door open.</p>
            <p>He was in a terrible Fury, and
without ſaying one word to <hi>Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
he ran with his Sword in his
Hand, where he expected to have
found <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and the other <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana.</hi>
He was not ſurpriz'd that he
found no body there, and he had
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42899:108"/>
made noiſe ſufficient, as to imagine
that they had made their Eſcape:
but thinking that they could not be
far off, he fell to ſearching, having
ſtill his Sword in his Hand, an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
Mark that he had no mind
to ſtand ſhilly ſhallying. It will
doubtleſs be wonder'd that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
did not go to meet him, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
her ſelf: but you will forbear
doing ſo, when you ſhall know, that
her Cloſet was remote from the place
where this Scene was acted, and that
ſhe was there ſedately finiſhing her
Letter, and without ſuſpecting in
the leaſt the Misfortune that was
grapling her. In the mean while,
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> after having ſought her
every where in vain, directed his
ſteps towards this Cloſet; and as he
hurry'd along, ſhe turn'd her Head
that ways, to ſee what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
She was much ſurpriz'd to ſee
him thus with Sword in Hand, and
all tranſported with Anger, which
was eaſie to be gueſs'd by his Eyes,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42899:109"/>
as well as by his Carriage. Thus
without thinking of what ſhe did,
ſhe threw her ſelf at his Feet, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, <hi>Ah! Sir, do not let your
Reſentment fall upon your poor</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana.
Theſe Words confirm'd him
ſtill more, that ſhe was culpable; ſo
that he lift up his Arm to plunge his
Sword into her Boſome; but having
by chance caſt his Eyes upon the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>See here-still doubtleſs,</hi> ſaid he
to her, <hi>Marks of thy infidelity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
as thou art;</hi> and Curioſity
ſuſpending his Reſentment, he went
to take that Letter, wherein he was
very much amaz'd to ſee quite an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing than he expected. This
diſarm'd him in ſome manner, not
being able to apprehend how the
<hi>Sultana,</hi> having ſuch reaſon as ſhe
had to tremble, could amuze her
ſelf, in writing ſuch indifferent
things. Thus not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his Aſtoniſhment, <hi>Ah! this is
too much, ungrateful Woman,</hi> he ſaid
to her, <hi>to join inſenſibility to the moſt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42899:109"/>
mortal Offence that can befal me; and
tell me how thou canſt be ſo in Cold
Blood, when that I ſurprize thee
with</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>and dallying away the
time with him in Amorous Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Sultana <hi>was ſo far from
dreaming of the malicious Prank
that had been plaid her, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
caſting the Fault upon her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val:</hi>
If I have ſeen <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> Sir, <hi>ſhe
ſaid to him,</hi> it is only with your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
and you must have taken for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Diſcourſes the brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
that have paſs'd between us, but
which never went beyond the bounds of
Honesty. <hi>At theſe Words ſhe fell
into a Swoon; and her Fright ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made her Malady return at that
very inſtant, ſhe vented in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo great a Quantity of Blood,
that the</hi> Sultan <hi>imagin'd, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being oblig'd to revenge himſelf,
he ſhould preſently be revenged by
this Accident. This made him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his ſteps another way, to ſeek
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42899:110"/>
out</hi> Ibrahim: <hi>but he was far from
finding him, ſince that he had made
his Eſcape, as is before related. All
theſe Diſappointments did a little
cool his Fury, infomuch, that</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda
<hi>ſeeing her ſelf reveng'd on her
Rival, without there being any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to ſhed all her Blood, took
that time to endeavour to ſave</hi> Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.
Sir, <hi>ſhe ſaid to the</hi> Sultan, I
may perchance be mistaken, and the
Tranquility you found the <hi>Sultana</hi> in,
is a certain ſign that ſhe never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
any fineneſs in all the Careſſes ſhe
has made to <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> You know there
are Brothers and Siſters that love one
another tenderly, and diſcourſe one
another accordingly. Wherefore I am
vex'd that I have animated your <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude</hi>
by falſe Accounts, which will be
the Occaſion of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Death.
If you would take my Advice, <hi>added
ſhe,</hi> you ſhould ſeek to inform your
ſelf, before that you proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And you ought to take my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
mine, that notwithstanding the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42899:110"/>
interest I have to rid my ſelf of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that ſhares your Heart, do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
love Justice, as not to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
you ſhould ſully your Hand with
a Blood that you would perhaps unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Grand Signior, <hi>who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
judged favourably of the</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,
<hi>being ſtill pre-poſſeſs'd in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of her by</hi> Zelinda'<hi>s Words:</hi>
Yes, Madam, <hi>he ſaid to her,</hi> I will
follow your Advice, ſince you judge
it convenient. But be ſhe innocent or
not, I cannot but, after the Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
you have had to ſave her, when that
one bare Word of yours would have
ruin'd her, I give you for a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the whole Empire, which your
Virtue merits o're my Heart. Yes, my
lovely <hi>Zelinda,</hi> You need not fear that
your Rival ſhall ſhare it with you; nay
I am ſorry that I have given you any
matter for Vexation in that point:
but I will ſo behave my ſelf hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as that you ſhall never have any
Occaſion to be diſcontented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:42899:111"/>
Such Words as theſe were a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
matter of Triumph to <hi>Zelinda;</hi>
and her Wile could not have a more
advantageous Succeſs. Thus, all
haughty at this Event, ſhe ſignify'd
to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> after what manner ſhe
had turned things, and how that he
had nothing more to fear. As there
is nothing that touches us more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than our ſelves, <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who at
another time would have been ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
afflicted at his Siſter's Misfortune,
was eaſily comforted. Nevertheleſs
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was not ſo well
cured of his Suſpicions, but that he
forbid him expreſly ever more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
diſpleas'd <hi>Zelinda,</hi> who had
been ſo well ſatisfy'd with the Viſits
he paid his Siſter, that if the <hi>Sultan</hi>
had taken her Advice, matters
ſhould have gone otherwiſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſhe was too cunning to deſire
him to revoke that Order. When
People know themſelves culpable,
they are ever afraid, that the leaſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42899:111"/>
thing ſhould be capable of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, as indeed this daily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
when that it is the leaſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Beſides <hi>Zelinda</hi> having judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough, as not to commit a
Fault of that Nature, ſhe ſtudy'd
how to find in ſecret interviews, the
Occaſions of ſeeing <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and
of not making her Fidelity to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was abſolutely impoſſible, at
leaſt without engaging an Eunuch,
who might facilitate the entrance of
the <hi>Serraglio</hi> to her Lover: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſurmount this Difficulty, ſhe
careſſed one of them, call'd <hi>Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack,</hi>
a Perſon of Wit, and whom
ſhe had already done ſome Service,
though at that time ſhe did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any Returns. Now you muſt
know, that Jealouſie prevails as
much among Eunuchs as among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
they would all be Favourites
of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s: and at the moment
that any one of them is ſo, he has as
many Enemies as he has Comrades.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42899:112"/>
This befel <hi>Almonac,</hi> and one call'd
<hi>Moro,</hi> who had at leaſt as much
Wit as he, having got a Fancy to
dive into the Reaſons that made him
ſo gracious with <hi>Zelinda,</hi> was not
long without diſcovering the whole
Myſtery. He one day perceiv'd that
he let <hi>Ibrahim</hi> into the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> and
that he conducted him into <hi>Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s
Apartment. There needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more for him to judge how
matters went: But he was in a great
Perplexity, when it came to the
puſh, what Courſe he was to take
upon this Diſcovery. For in ſhort,
he was no ſtranger to <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant,
and her Artifices, inſomuch
that he was afraid, that the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> being inform'd of it, he
might have ſo much Weakneſs as to
believe her, to his Prejudice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſſeſs'd with this Apprehenſion,
he reſolv'd to go warily to work in
this Concern: That is to ſay, not to
intimate <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s infidelity all at a
Clap to the <hi>Sultan;</hi> but that <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:42899:112"/>
had a ſecret Commerce in the
<hi>Serraglio</hi> by <hi>Almonac</hi>'s means. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
having given this Account to the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> his <hi>Celſitude</hi> fancy'd it to
be for the love of the other <hi>Sultana,</hi>
inſomuch that being vex'd at his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pardon'd her, he went to find
out <hi>Zelinda,</hi> to whom he imparted
the News he had been juſt then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
withal. <hi>Zelinda</hi> gave Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thanks, for that he came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſome
himſelf to her, ſeeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſhe had been abſolutely ruin'd,
as well as <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> Nevertheleſs,
not judging it convenient to oppoſe
the impreſſion this News had made
upon his Mind, ſhe told him on the
contrary, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> merited a
moſt extraordinary Puniſhment, and
that if he would take her Advice,
he ſhould endeavour to nab him in
the Fact, ſo to make him afterwards
ſuffer the Puniſhment ſuch a Fault
did deſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:42899:113"/>
The <hi>Sultan</hi> reliſh'd this Advice,
and commanded <hi>Moro</hi> to be ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
upon the watch, as that he
might ſurprize him: And <hi>Moro</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
this to be no difficult Province,
becauſe that in one Week only he
had ſeen him enter four times into
the <hi>Serraglio.</hi> But <hi>Zelinda</hi> being
none of thoſe that ſleep upon an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of ſuch great Conſequence, gave
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> intimation of all that paſs'd,
inſomuch that <hi>Moro</hi> lay all in vain
perdue. The <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> whom
he had promis'd, that Three Days
ſhould not be over before that he
put him into his Hands, ſeeing Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ſpent, ask'd him, if he jeaſted
with him. To which, <hi>Moro</hi> not
knowing what Anſwer to make, he
gave him but one Week more,
threatning him, that if in that time
he did not ſee the Effects of what he
had promis'd him, he would treat
him as a Calumniator. There paſs'd
a Week more without his being able
to keep his Word: Whereupon the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42899:113"/>
               <hi>Sultan</hi> being animated againſt him
by <hi>Zelinda,</hi> commanded the <hi>Mutes</hi>
to ſtrangle him. <hi>Moro</hi> knowing
that he dy'd unjuſtly, he demanded
permiſſion to ſign his Laſt Will and
Teſtament, to which he had Anſwer
made him, that he might not only do
it, but alſo that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
had ſo order'd it.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he began to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that what he ſaid of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
was true; after which, he that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as Clerk, bid him ſign it; but
he made Anſwer, that it was not
yet time, and that he had many
other things to ſay. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he would have talk'd of <hi>Zelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi>
but this Clerk being oblig'd to
her for his Fortune, would not liſten
to his Depoſition, but made Signs to
the <hi>Mutes</hi> to do their duty, inſomuch
that he was ſtrangled at the time he
was going to conceive ſome Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
in knowing that the <hi>Sultan</hi>
would revenge his innocence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:42899:114"/>
Moro <hi>periſhing in this manner, it
was eaſie for the Clerk to ſerve</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda
<hi>thoroughly; and he needed
only to ſuppreſs the Depoſition that
concerned</hi> Ibrahim: <hi>but as he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much of having the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for him, as he had for her; and
that on the contrary, he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
at this occaſion to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for an injury he had receiv'd
from him, he carry'd the Laſt Will
to the</hi> Grand Signior; <hi>and it made
upon his Mind all imaginable impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
Zelinda <hi>was not long without
taking notice of it; for after he had
diſmiſs'd this Man, and caſt his Eyes
twice or thrice over what he had left
him,</hi> Ibrahim is culpable, <hi>he cry'd,</hi>
and I muſt not ſuffer him to live any
longer. <hi>At theſe Words he gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the</hi> Mutes <hi>ſhould be bid to
go ſtrangle him: Whereat,</hi> Zelinda
<hi>being ſtrangely ſurpriz'd, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to endeavour the fencing off ſo
great a Misfortune.</hi> What is your
<hi>Celſitude</hi> going to do, <hi>ſhe ſaid to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42899:114"/>
him?</hi> And muſt you, upon the Tale of
ſuch a Wretch, put to Death one of
the greateſt Generals of your Empire,
and who is the moſt capable of doing
you ſervice. <hi>The</hi> Eunuch, <hi>who had
Order to go warn the</hi> Mutes, <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd
his Departure at theſe Words,
being very glad to oblige the</hi> Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
<hi>in giving the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>time
to make Reflection on what he did.
The</hi> Sultan <hi>appear'd uncertain in
this, and tenderly viewing</hi> Zelinda,
You are too generous, Madam, <hi>ſaid
he to her,</hi> for a Rival; and if you
did well, far from interceding for
them, as you do, you would animate
me to put them both to death. Far
be I from that, <hi>ſhe anſwer'd,</hi> Sir;
if I aim at your Heart, it is not by
ſullying my ſelf with a Crime which I
ſhould be eternally upbraiding my ſelf
withal. But alas! I perceive, that
I ſhall never poſſeſs it, that Heart
that makes all my Joy. It is much
more my Rival's than mine; and if
it were not ſo, you would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42899:115"/>
that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſhould be put to
Death upon a bare Suſpicion. But
what do I ſay! rather upon the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of an Enemy, ſince he that had
promis'd you ſo many things, is dead,
without being able to acquit himſelf of
his Word; ſo great a Jealouſie, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe,</hi> I very much ſuſpect; and it
is perhaps the Cauſe I concern my ſelf
ſo much in <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s ſafety, ſince that
if you grant me this, it is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mark that you love me more than
her.</p>
            <p>Zelinda <hi>having turn'd matters
thus dexterouſly, the</hi> Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<hi>was far from diving into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of her Interceſſions; and that
he might not give her Occaſion to
believe, that he entertain'd any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
for her Rival, to her Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</hi>
You confound Delicacy and
Love, Madam, <hi>he ſaid to her:</hi> if I
am jealous, it is not of your Rival,
but rather of my Glory, which ſuffers
by <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Audaciouſneſs. If I put
him to Death, it is only to learn thoſe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42899:115"/>
that might reſemble him, that it is
Temerity for them to addreſs their
Vows to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s. Thus if I am
jealous, it is only of you; and I do
not pretend, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Action
had the Confidence to entertain you
with his Love. How ſhould I be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
<hi>Zelinda anſwer'd,</hi> ever to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
to any Body, to the prejudice of
what I owe to my Lord! I ſay this,
<hi>the</hi> Sultan <hi>reply'd,</hi> only to render
others wiſe. It is expedient that one
or other die. <hi>At theſe Words he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
the Order he had given for
the ſtrangling of</hi> Ibrahim; <hi>inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that</hi> Zelinda <hi>being no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
able to parry ſo Unhappy a Blow,
ſhe could not retain her Tears; which
ſhe nevertheleſs cover'd with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pretext:</hi> If you ſee me weep,
Sir, <hi>ſhe ſaid to him,</hi> it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reaſon: The whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
is going to impute <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s
Death to your Jealouſie: And, as I
told you, this Paſſion never proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but from a violent Love, who will
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42899:116"/>
not believe, but that I am the leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;
I, for whom your Celſitude has
ever appeared ſo indifferent, as never
to have any ſuſpicion of my Fidelity.
How! <hi>the</hi> Sultan <hi>retorted,</hi> would
you have me jealous of you? No, Sir,
Zelinda <hi>anſwer'd;</hi> And whatever I
ſay, I will never give you occaſion for
it: But I could wiſh, that you were
not ſo much of others, or at leaſt, that
you would not let it be ſo manifeſt. If
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> is ſo unhappy as to rob you
of your Repoſe, you may remedy it,
without ſuffering the thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
upon me: You need only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
him, under the Pretence of the
Good of your State; after that, you
need not fear his returning into the
<hi>Serraglio,</hi> to ſee my Rival; But to
put him thus to Death on her ſcore, I
tell it you once again, is clearly to
ſhew to all the World, that I am the
wretched ſhe, and that it is ſhe only
for whom you have an inclination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:42899:116"/>
The <hi>Sultan</hi> was ſtrangely amaz'd
to ſee her take things by this Byaſs;
and as he did not penetrate into the
ſource of her Tears, that ſtill trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down more and more, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very much mollify'd. Thus,
to ſhew him, that he had more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
for her, than ſhe ſaid, he
diſpatch'd away an Eunuch, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Mutes</hi> from doing their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
The Eunuch made haſte, for
fear of coming too late; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was neceſſary he did ſo, ſince
that all <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
was, that he might bathe, and
ſay his Prayers, before they execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Sentence that was paſt upon
him. Nevertheleſs, as the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s
Deſign was not to pardon him to all
Intents, he ask'd the <hi>Sultana,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſhould ſend him, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda,</hi>
chooſing rather to deprive her
ſelf of him, than ſee him die, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to confer the
Government of <hi>Buda</hi> on him, an
Employ that requir'd a Man of a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42899:117"/>
conſummated Experience in War,
and which, by Conſequence, he was
as capable of as any body.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how <hi>Ibrahim</hi> came
to be made Governour of ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a Place, and why in the
firſt Convention that was held of
the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, he was not ſent for with
the reſt. But at length, the Good
of the State prevailing over all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conſiderations, he came to
Court, and <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> having
ever a great influence over the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> made uſe of that
Occaſion to ſee him; Abſence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not been capable to make her
forget him, though it had been of
ſome Years duration. It was not
ſo with <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> not that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into any other Engagement,
but he had made uſe of his Reaſon,
to cure himſelf of an Amour that
had like to have been fatal to him,
and wherein he could not perſevere,
at leaſt, without being expos'd to
the ſame Dangers he had run. Thus
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42899:117"/>
the Returns he made to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
ſhe gave him of her Paſſion,
ſpoke but little fondneſs; nay, and
he excus'd himſelf from accepting
of an appointment ſhe made <hi>Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac</hi>
propoſe to him, who on his
part did not allow <hi>Zelinda</hi> his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
but with trembling, after
what had happen'd. The <hi>Sultana</hi>
was ſtartled, and alſo picqu'd at this
Refuſal; and though he had us'd,
as a Pretext, that if he did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Offers ſhe made him, it
was rather out of fear of engaging
her in ſome ill Buſineſs, than for his
own ſake; yet was ſhe of a quite
different Opinion. She entertain'd
a Fancy, that his denying of her
thus, was becauſe he had got an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miſtreſs; and this thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
her with a Deſign to ruine
him, ſhe only ſuſpended this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
till ſuch time as that ſhe
could be truly inform'd, how this
Matter ſtood. To effect this, ſhe
brib'd one of his Principal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42899:118"/>
imagining, that if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Intrigue, there muſt be ſome one
or other to whom he muſt have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
it: But not one having been
able to give her any ſuch Account,
becauſe that effectually her Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were ill grounded, ſhe laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
above half her Anger, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to believe, that it was only
Fear that had hinder'd him from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of her Rendezvouze.</p>
            <p>After ſhe had thus juſtify'd him
in her Mind, ſhe was but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while before ſhe reſtor'd him her
Affection: So true it is, that in the
Hearts of Lovers, the Paſſions that
ſeem the moſt contrary, ſucceed one
another. Far am I from ſaying,
that they be effectually ſo: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, whatever Hatred a Lover,
or a Miſtreſs may think they have
for each other, we are too blame, to
call by that Name the Sentiments
with which they are animated. So
far it is from being Hatred, that it
is an Exceſs of Love, inſomuch,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42899:118"/>
that the greateſt Miſchiefs that can
befall them, would be, if that
ſhould happen which they deſire
againſt the Beloved Perſon. <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana
Zelinda</hi> did quickly give proofs
of what I now ſay; for inſtead of
continuing in the revenge ſhe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
a moment before, ſhe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that ſhe lov'd him
more than ever, inſomuch, that ſhe
could live no longer, if he refus'd
her the ſatisfaction of entertaining
him in private.</p>
            <p>It would not have been well in
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> to have perſiſted any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in his Denials: Cruelty does ill
become a Man; and after all, ſince
it was only fear that detain'd him, it
was in ſome manner ſhameful for
him, that a Woman ſhould have
more Courage than he. I know
not, whether it was for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or others, that he chang'd his
Mind; for in ſhort, he ſaw <hi>Sultana
Zelinda,</hi> and ſhe took ſo much
pleaſure in his Converſe, that ſhe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42899:119"/>
would have been very glad if the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> would have conceiv'd
a Fancy to have detain'd him at
Court. Nevertheleſs, as this was a
thing rather to be deſired than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for, ſhe fell to contriving ſome
other expedient, for the giving her
ſelf content, and found none better
than this.</p>
            <p>As ſhe knew not the Secrets of
State, ſhe innocently thought that
<hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and the other <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, had
been ſent for, only with a Deſign of
making War, and imagining, that
there would be a thouſand Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
for her to ſee her Lover, if
ſhe could oblige the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
to go himſelf at the Head of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
She us'd all manner of means
to perſwade him, that it concern'd
his Honour not to leave any other
than himſelf to make the Conqueſt
of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The <hi>Sultan,</hi> who to
ſpeak frankly, loves a Camp leſs
than the <hi>Serraglio</hi> and Hunting, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not anſwer'd her upon this
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42899:119"/>
Point, as ſhe deſired him, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd
her ſelf to the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi>
who, in Quality of Prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
might do much for her ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
She was very loath to do it
however; For this Miniſter had
been in Love with her for ſome
Years; but he, far from ſeeming to
her, amiable enough to create the
like Sentiments in her, he was diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to her, to a Degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
ſufferance. But being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of doing all things for the Love
of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſhe ſent to tell the
<hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> that ſhe had a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſire to ſpeak with him, and
entreated him, that it might be the
ſame Day. <hi>Almonac</hi> was the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of this good News, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
the <hi>Vizier</hi> ſo much Joy, that
he made him a Preſent of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
of great Value. You may
be ſure, he did not fail the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze:
He threw himſelf at the
<hi>Sultana</hi>'s Feet; he ask'd her, what
he could do for her Service, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42899:120"/>
her, that ſhe would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
him. <hi>Zelinda</hi> receiv'd him
with a Countenance, which ſhe
knew how to compoſe as Occaſion
ſerv'd. Thus having appear'd all
Sweetneſs, contrary to her Cuſtom,
the <hi>Vizier</hi> was ſo enflam'd, that he
vow'd to her, that what ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him, muſt not be in his
power, or that he would inſtantly
grant it her. <hi>We ſhall ſee that,</hi> the
<hi>Sultana</hi> made Anſwer; <hi>and what I
deſire of you, is, that in the War we
are going to make in</hi> Hungary, <hi>you
would induce the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>to go
thither in Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was ſurpriz'd
at this Requeſt, and ſeeing that the
<hi>Sultana</hi> had ſuffered her ſelf to be
abuſed by the Rumours that ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
of an approaching Rupture
between the Two Empires, he
thought it convenient to undeceive
her, that ſo ſhe might convert her
Demand into an other, wherein
there might be means of doing her
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42899:120"/>
Service. Whereupon he inform'd
her, how the Reports that run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
of the War, were only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Emperor ſtill to augment
the Offers he had made to the
<hi>Grand Signior:</hi> That there were
not the leaſt thoughts of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Rupture with him, and
how far from that the State ſtood
in need of Peace. Though ſuch
an Anſwer ought to have ſtopp'd
the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Mouth, ſhe did not
reſt ſatisfy'd therewithal: She told
the <hi>Vizier,</hi> That it was very true,
that ſhe had thought, as well as
others, that the War was juſt
breaking out; but that by being
miſtaken, ſhe did not ſee why he
refus'd her her Requeſt: That
Peace and War being equally in his
Hands, he might chuſe either:
That if he did it not, it was for
that he had no Deſign to oblige
her: That ſhe was very glad ſhe
knew it, that ſo ſhe might accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
regulate her Sence upon his
Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:42899:121"/>
               <hi>Theſe Reproaches were ſenſible
to the</hi> Grand Vizier, <hi>proportionably
to the Love he had for her; and as
it proceeded even to Exceſs, I ſhall
not undertake to expreſs his Grief:
Nevertheleſs, being very willing to
mollifie her Spirit:</hi> Ah! Madam,
<hi>he ſaid to her,</hi> would you, that for
my own ſake, I ſhould plunge the
Empire into the Diſorder that is
an inevitable Conſequence of War.
Should not I remain reſponſable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and towards his
People? And for having confided
his Authority in me, muſt I be the
Author of ſo many Miſchiefs? Tell
me, <hi>he added,</hi> what can oblige you to
make ſuch a Requeſt, and perhaps I
may find ſome other Expedient for
your ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> was not ſo mad as
to do it. And indeed, if there
are Women that impart to their
Lovers what paſſes ſecretly in their
Hearts, it is only to their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;
but to believe they do ſo to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42899:121"/>
others, is what never happen'd,
and never will. Thus the <hi>Sultana</hi>
guiding her ſelf by theſe Rules, far
from owning things to him as they
were, us'd, as a Pretext, That the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſhar'd his Favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and her Rival, ſhe fancy'd
ſhe could not better remove her
from his Heart, than by removing
her from his Preſence. That as ſhe
did not enjoy her perfect Health,
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> would never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her to Fatigues, ſuch as were
thoſe of War: That this was the
Service ſhe expected from him: if
not, that he might expect ſhe would
never look upon him with a good
Eye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Grand Vizier <hi>believ'd ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
what ſhe ſaid: Wherefore,
imagining, that provided he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
ſome Expedient that could
produce the ſame Effect, ſhe ſhould
like one as well as an other:</hi> It is
not neceſſary, Madam, <hi>he ſaid to
her,</hi> that we proceed to that Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42899:122"/>
for the giving of you ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and though in the ſentiments
I have for you, it is very grievous
to me to underſtand, that all your
Vows aim only at poſſeſſing the <hi>Grand
Signior;</hi> Yet will I ſerve you in it,
to ſhew you, that your Content will
ever be dearer to me than my own:
Suffer us only to finiſh, <hi>he added,</hi>
the Treaty that is now negotiating
with the Emperor; and after, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you to engage the <hi>Sultan</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
ſuch a Progreſs as ſhall be the
ſame thing for you, as if he had been
engag'd in War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Expedient was ſuch as
would have</hi> non-plus'd <hi>a Perſon
that had leſs Addreſs than the</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana:
<hi>But beſides her being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
crafty, and that beſides, Love
whetted her Wit:</hi> What you ſay,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> would be ſomething,
if I did not ſee an inconvenience in
it. If you thus cauſe the Emperor to
take a Progreſs, this will be ſo far
from quieting my Mind, that it is on
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42899:122"/>
the contrary a Courting in me of new
Diſgraces. For one Rival that I
ſhall rid my ſelf of, there will thence
ariſe an hundred others. How many
People are there that have not the
leaſt thoughts, by reaſon of the length
of the way, of preſenting a Beauty to
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who ſeeing him upon the
ſpot, will be proud of the Occaſion of
bringing him all that they ſhall find
handſome. I ſhall be every where
afraid of meeting with one or other,
to ſupplant me, and only in War can I
find my ſafety.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Reaſons the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
urg'd, to deſtroy the Expedient
the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> had ſtarted: And
as they had ſome Face, he bent his
Thoughts to effect her purpoſe by
ſome other means. In the mean
while, as it was not his Opinion to
make War with the Emperor, he
propos'd that of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he made appear much more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
but which the <hi>Sultana</hi> thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Reaſons I ſhall ſuppreſs.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42899:123"/>
In fine, the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> in no
wiſe prevailing to get her approve
of it: <hi>Well, Madam,</hi> he ſaid to
her, '<hi>tis done, ſince you will have
it ſo, and we will have War with the
Emperor. But at leaſt remember,
that it is only to oblige you; and
that if this makes me loſe the</hi> Sultan'<hi>s
Favour, you are bound to treat me a
little more favourably than hitherto
you have done.</hi> The <hi>Sultana</hi> being
over-joy'd at her having obtain'd
what ſhe deſired, gave him ſome
good Words, which render'd him
ſo fervent to oblige her, that he
ſent for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> that very day, by
whom he expected to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
than by any other, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he was acquainted with the
Countrey, and knew the means how
to carry on the War ſucceſsfully in
<hi>Hungary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibrahim</hi> repairing to the Houſe
of this Prime Miniſter, came at a
time when he was buſie: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there being no means of ſeeing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42899:123"/>
him in half an Hours time, the
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi> ſent Directions to his
Wife, to introduce him into her
Lodgings, and to entertain him till
ſuch time as he had diſpatch'd an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
he had then in hand. This was
a ſignal Favour for <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and
which the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> ſeldom did
to any Body: But the neceſſity he
had of him, was the Occaſion of
ſo great a Diſtinction. Be it as it
will, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> no ſooner ſaw this
Lady, but that he remain'd, as it
were, charmed with her Beauty.
The Lady, on her ſide, found him
perfectly handſome; and if they
had dar'd to interchange their
thoughts upon this Caſe, they would
have mightily gratify'd their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
ſince there is nothing that
more abridges the pains of Lovers,
than the knowledg they give one
another of a Reciprocal Love. But
in ſhort, both of them were cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of ſo freely declaring their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> was detain'd by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42899:124"/>
the Reſpect that People commonly
have for the Perſon beloved, and
the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Wife, by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum</hi>
of her Sex. I do not ſay, by
the Obligations of her Duty, ſince
it is certain they ſeldom ſtick to fail
in that, from the time they amuſe
themſelves thus in ogling ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
any other than their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
            <p>Thus this Interview only termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in a great deal of Civility on
both ſides: But though the <hi>Grand
Vizier</hi> remain'd full an Hour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
coming, the Converſation did
not languiſh, as commonly happens
when there is nothing that animates
it. They ſaid a Thouſand pretty
things to one another: and they
had ſtill abundance more to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
if he had not come ſo
ſoon. In the mean while, the
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi> being to diſcourſe
him in private, took him along in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Garden, where he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
fell to the matter, asking him,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42899:124"/>
what he thought of the Emperor's
Forces. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> told him what he
knew of them; and as he required
nothing more than Occaſions to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize
himſelf, he made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſo eaſie to him,
that the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was the more
excited to keep his Word with <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda.</hi>
Wherefore this Miniſter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been very much ſatisfy'd with
him in this firſt Interview, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſecond of him, and after that,
ſeveral others, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> took
care to lengthen as much as he
could, becauſe that in thoſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
he took his meaſures ſo
well, that he ſaw his Wife ſeveral
times, with whom he fell ſo in Love,
that he abſolutely forgot <hi>Sultana
Zelinda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What made him proceed ſo far in
ſo ſhort a time, is, that he found in
her all the Acknowledgment he
could deſire. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Zelinda</hi> was ſufficiently jealous,
as to take notice of it; but by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42899:125"/>
good luck for him, as ſhe knew
that he had Buſineſs in that Houſe,
ſhe was far from believing that he
went thither on any other account.
After all theſe Conferences, the
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi> ſpoke to the <hi>Sultan</hi> of
making War upon the Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
at which his <hi>Gelſitude</hi> ſeem'd amaz'd,
having heard him ſay ſeveral times,
that it was not for the Good of his
Empire to break with him. He
ask'd him the Reaſon of ſo ſudden
a Change: And as the <hi>Vizier</hi> was
prepared for this Queſtion, and
that beſides, the <hi>Sultan</hi> was none of
thoſe penetrating Wits, that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves againſt the Artifices
of a Crafty Miniſter, he made him
believe all he was minded. The
War being thus reſolv'd on in the
Council, was proclaim'd forthwith
throughout the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
with this Circumſtance, That
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> would go himſelf
in Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:42899:125"/>
               <hi>Sultana Zelinda,</hi> after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
her Acknowledgment to the
<hi>Vizier,</hi> thought that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more wanting to her Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
than to intimate to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi>
that ſhe was the Cauſe of it, and
why ſhe had done it. <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
thought himſelf bound to thank
her for it; but he did it with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Fondneſs, that the <hi>Sultana</hi> was
not ſatisfy'd. Still leſs ſatisfy'd was
ſhe with ſeveral Reaſons he urg'd to
divert her from this Voyage: He
told her, among other things, that
if ſhe ſuffer'd the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to
make War, he would ceaſe perhaps
making of Love. That tho theſe
Two Paſſions be not incompatible,
it nevertheleſs often happens, that
the one is neglected for the other:
That her Intereſt was to keep him
with her, and not to ſuffer his Flames
to evaporate by Occupations that
were of ſufficient Conſequence to
make him lay all other Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:42899:126"/>
The <hi>Sultana</hi> vouchſaf'd to hear
him out; but he having done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe was ſo ſcandaliz'd at his
Diſcourſe, that ſhe was ſeiz'd with a
furious anger: <hi>It ill becomes thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
wretch,</hi> ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>to give
me Leſſons how to keep the</hi> Sultan's
<hi>Heart: And when I only aſpire to
thine, ſhould it not be thy Province
to make me forget him, inſtead of
ſpeaking to me in his behalf. Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
ſaw plainly he was in the
wrong; and meaning to repair it,
he endeavour'd to excuſe himſelf
upon the Care he had of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
But the <hi>Sultana</hi> made him
Anſwer, That as he only faggotted
ſorry Reaſons upon each other, he
muſt needs do a great many things
to make her forget ſuch an Offence.
This was frankly telling him to be
more tender for the future: But as
this did not depend on him, and
that beſides, the Love he had for
the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Wife, was an
Obſtacle to the return of his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42899:126"/>
he ſo little ſatisfy'd her, that
ſhe was ſtill more angry than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
However, it had been a
Thouſand times worſe, had ſhe
known the Cauſe of her Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
but by good luck for her,
ſhe was a ſtranger to it; and as
wretched as ſhe thought ſhe might
reckon her ſelf, ſhe had, at leaſt, the
comfort of flattering her ſelf, that
ſhe had not any Rival.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> made all the neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
for his Journey; and <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
judging that he ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
if <hi>Sultana Zelinda</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
us'd his utmoſt endeavours to
have it put off, or at leaſt, that ſhe
might not be of the Number. But
the <hi>Sultan</hi> having formally declared
his Mind, That he meant ſhe ſhould
accompany him every where, he
had no other means left than to ſet
the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> to work. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he told him, that if he was
minded to Husband his own Glory,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42899:127"/>
it was not expedient he ſhould let
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> march to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition:
That though he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
experience, and by Conſequence
oblig'd to rely in all things upon
him, Fame would nevertheleſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
the Praiſe of all his Conqueſts
to the <hi>Sultan:</hi> That ſince He it was,
that muſt undergo the whole trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it was but Juſtice that he ſhould
have all the Glory: Wherefore he
thought himſelf oblig'd, as a real
Friend, to give him this Advice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> having weigh'd
this Diſcourſe, found it to be of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good ſenſe, and ſeeking the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſpeaking to the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> he urg'd to him Four Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
as to his Journey, inſomuch,
that this Prince, who was more a
Lover of Repoſe than of Trouble,
promis'd him to make reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter. Thus People began
from that very day to forbear talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Journey, as of a thing
very certain: And this being told
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42899:127"/>
again to <hi>Zelinda,</hi> ſhe ask'd the
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi> the meaning of it. He
had only ſorry Excuſes to give her,
which made her ſtill the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.
Nevertheleſs, not ſatisfy'd with
telling him, that ſhe took it very ill
that he chang'd things in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
after having concluded them
with her, ſhe declared to him ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively,
that ſhe expected they
ſhould be executed according to
their Project, that the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>
durſt not thwart her. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the point of being broken
off, was ſet on foot again, ſo as left
no room for doubt.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ibrahim</hi> firſt heard this
News, he thought every body mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
and that he alone was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
That he might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aſſured, he enquir'd of the <hi>Grand
Vizier</hi> about the matter; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing to let him ſee that it was
none of his fault, own'd ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to him, how the Caſe ſtood, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42899:128"/>
at the ſame time, that he was forced
to it by the <hi>Sultana. Ibrahim</hi> did
all he could to repreſent to him, that
in his Poſt he needed only to ſlight
all ſuch Menaces: but he knowing
the Influence ſhe had over the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> not judging it convenient
to incur her Diſpleaſure, he made
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> Anſwer, That he lov'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a little leſs Glory, and to be
what more aſſured of living the
longer.</p>
            <p>After this Anſwer, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> judg'd
that it would be a difficult matter for
him to prevail with him to take an
other Reſolution, ſo much the more
as that his Paſſion ſolicited him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
not to abſent himſelf from the
<hi>Sultana;</hi> and as that he had taken,
was very contrary to the Love he
began to be ſenſible of for his Wife,
he invented all manner of means to
abſent himſelf from the Eyes of a
jealous Woman, whoſe detection he
judg'd it would be impoſſible for
him to eſcape, if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:42899:128"/>
went the Journey. Being poſſeſs'd
wth theſe Sentiments, he whirl'd his
Head with a Thouſand ſuch things
as I may well call <hi>Chimaeras,</hi> ſince
that he himſelf gave them this Name,
when that after having troll'd them
in his Mind, he had found their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy.
Nevertheleſs, after
long muſing, he paws'd upon one
that he thought certain, but which
being extraordinarily dangerous for
him, did well merit he ſhould take
it into his ſerious Conſideration.
This was to intimate to the <hi>Grand
Vizier,</hi> that the <hi>Sultana</hi> was only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of this Journey, that ſhe might
have the Opportunities of ſeeing
him, and that what ſhe had ſaid to
him, was only a thing invented to
conceal her Concerns.</p>
            <p>The ſtep was very ſlippery, as I
have ſaid, and he was not ſo unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of underſtanding, but that
he plainly ſaw, that he ſtak'd his
Life. But as <hi>Inamorato</hi>'s are half
mad, whatever Reflections they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42899:129"/>
may make, he caus'd this Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be given under Hand to the
<hi>Grand Vizier;</hi> but to leſſen the Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
he might entertain upon this
account, he ſignify'd to him at the
ſame time, that far from making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to her Paſſion, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was more inſupportable
to him. That he might not doubt
of this Truth, ſeveral Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were related to him, which he
himſelf might remember. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
nothing perſwaded him more
than that invincible deſire the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
had to cauſe the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
to undertake this Voyage, and <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>'s
Requeſt to hinder him from ſo
doing.</p>
            <p>Without this Circumſtance he
would a thouſand times have dy'd
of grief, to ſee, that before him ſhe
preferr'd a Rival, whom he eſteem'd
ſo much below him. But being in
ſome manner comforted, by making
reflection, that the <hi>Sultana</hi> was
made to endure the ſame Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42899:129"/>
he endured, he went to the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> whom he told, That
he had maturely weigh'd the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that were <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and that all well conſidered, he
ought to think of it no more, at
leaſt, without expoſing himſelf to
Perils, to which, whatever Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution
he might uſe, there was no
Remedy. There needed no more
to make him break it a ſecond time:
But the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> not content
with what he had newly done, he
ſent <hi>Ibrahim</hi> away Poſt, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him one moments delay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour, that in the then Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
the Frontier ſtood in need of
ſuch a Man as he.</p>
            <p>This was to his great Regret, that
he ſaw himſelf oblig'd to go thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Poſt, and he could have wiſh'd
he might have bid <hi>Adieu</hi> to the
<hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Wife, with whom he
had been ſo happy as to come to a
right underſtanding. Nevertheleſs,
his Vexation was much leſs than that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42899:130"/>
of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> when that ſhe knew
he was gone. She knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe ought to impute the Fault
to him, or to the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi>
whom ſhe had heard, had only given
him a Quarter of an Hours time to
take his leave; of which, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
willing to be inform'd, ſhe ſent to
require a private Converſation, with
him, which he was far from
refuſing her, out of the deſire he
had to reproach her. Coming both
with ſuch Sentiments, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
their Interview ſhould paſs
without ſome noiſe; and indeed the
<hi>Sultana</hi> having farther learnt, that
the <hi>Vizier</hi> had diſſwaded the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> from going into <hi>Hungary,</hi>
which ſhe knew not before, She
was no ſooner in his Preſence, but
that without making him any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
ſhe ask'd him why, after
having promis'd her, that the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſhould be undertaken, he had
broken it, to the prejudice of his
Word. <hi>The Reaſon is, Madam,</hi> the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42899:130"/>
               <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> ſaid, without being
ſtartled, <hi>that I knew not you was in
Love with</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>and as I have a
Care of my Maſter's Honour, I am
very glad that a pitiful Slave ſhould
not ſhare what is deſtined for him.</hi>
The <hi>Sultana</hi> was very much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at theſe Words.; but not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fit to agree to what he ſaid; <hi>I
excuſe this want of Reſpect,</hi> ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<hi>becauſe I know very well, that
it proceeds from your Jealouſie; but
know you, that you muſt not relapſe;
otherwiſe I ſhall not ever be of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to take things ſo mildly. Thus
it is to your Love,</hi> ſhe added, <hi>that
you are now indebted, that I do not
puniſh you, as you deſerve; and it is
further in its Favour, that I conſent
that there be not any Journey, to let
you ſee whether I love</hi> Ibrahim <hi>or
no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was an extraordinary thing to
hear the <hi>Sultana</hi> talk in this manner,
who naturally was violent, and who
beſides, according to all appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42899:131"/>
ought not to have taken the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi>'s
Complement ſo mildly. But
you muſt know, that ſhe had the
knack of diſſembling when ſhe
pleas'd, and that when her Heart
was ſeiz'd with a ſtrong Anger, that
was the time when ſhe affected the
greateſt Mildneſs. And indeed, far
from doing what ſhe ſaid for the
Love of him, her whole Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
was, how to know who had
revealed her Secret to him, that ſhe
might afterwards accordingly make
her Reſentment fall upon them both.
The <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> not knowing her
to be ſo great a Miſtreſs of Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
having taken in good part
ſo ſudden a Reſignation, inſtead of
perſiſting in jealous Motions, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Exceſs of Tenderneſs. He
ask'd her Pardon for having unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuſpected her; and the <hi>Sultana</hi>
ſeeing him at the Point ſhe deſired,
preſs'd him to tell her the Author of
ſuch an Allarum. The <hi>Grand Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
imparted all things to her, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42899:131"/>
having not omitted to tell her, that
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> had himſelf entreated him
to break off the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Journey,
ſhe chang'd Colour, and call'd him
a Thouſand times Ungrateful and
Perfidious in the bottom of her Soul.
But this plung'd her into a greater
Deſpondency; the <hi>Vizier</hi> aſſuring
her, that either he was miſtaken, or
that the Intimation came from the
ſame Hand.</p>
            <p>They parted pretty good Friends
in appearance, which muſt needs
caſt a diffidence in the Mind of a
ſuſpicious Man. But as much as Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are ſuſpicious in Points of their
Misfortunes, they are on the other
hand as full of Confidence in Point
of their good Fortune.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> having
fallen into the Trap, went to the
Army the moſt ſatisfy'd Man living,
and was no ſooner come thither, but
that the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who was very
glad that he appeared in theſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for fear that out of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42899:132"/>
he ſhould reveal her Concerns to
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> had it buzz'd in
his Ears, that what had been ſaid: to
him of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> was not only true,
but alſo, that he lov'd her beyond
expreſſion. He had much a do to
believe this News; but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him to give him ſuch convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Proofs of it, that he ſhould no
longer doubt of it. He had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay after this, till ſuch time
as that it was made clear out to him,
as was promis'd, he faſten'd upon
the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> after having laid
waſte the open Countrey by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
Slaughter, and Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If this Famous Siege related to
my Subject, I ſhould have fine things
to inſert in this place; but as it is
not ſeaſonable, I ſhall only ſay, that
the <hi>Vizier</hi> was ſo jealous of <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
that he did all he could to have
him cut off. It was a Miracle how
he eſcap'd, at which the <hi>Vizier</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrangely amaz'd himſelf, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42899:132"/>
to ruine him after an other
manner, charging him with the
length of the Siege. The <hi>Sultan</hi>
ſetting a Value upon <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to ſee that the <hi>Vizier</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of him; and having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
his Letters to one of his
Principal Officers; This Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Friend of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s, told
him, that he needed not to wonder,
and that the <hi>Vizier</hi> had Cauſe to
hate him. The <hi>Sultan</hi> ask'd him,
why? <hi>Becauſe, Sir,</hi> he ſaid to him,
<hi>that</hi> Ibrahim <hi>loves his Wife.</hi> At theſe
words he took out of his Pocket a
Letter that was written from the
Camp, in which ſeveral Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this Amour were ſignify'd to
him. The <hi>Sultan,</hi> who delighted
in diverting himſelf at an other's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
retain'd this Letter, and half
an Hour after imparted it to the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi>
who had taken a ſtrange courſe
to revenge her ſelf on <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> She
had caus'd a Letter to be put into
the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Hands, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:42899:133"/>
had written to her formerly, and
which, being without a Date, might
paſs for New. But ſeeing this, which
might produce the ſame effect, ſhe
was very ſorry ſhe had ſent the other,
yet kept it, however, that ſhe might
make farther uſe of it againſt <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi>
The <hi>Sultan</hi> left it with
her, without ſo much as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether ſhe kept it, or not;
but as ſoon as he was gone, ſhe ſent
it to the <hi>Vizier,</hi> by an expreſs
Courrier, with order to tell him by
Word of Mouth, That now it was
his part to revenge himſelf on a man
that made Love to his Wife, and to
his Miſtreſs: and this done, ſhe imagin'd
he would not ſuffer him to live long.</p>
            <p>This was all the Complement ſhe
made to him: for ſhe was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd,
to ſee that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> lov'd an
other, that ſhe only breath'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
And certainly, this is not
to be wonder'd at, ſince that ſome
few days before, ſhe was alſo
prompted by the ſame Sentiments,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42899:133"/>
though ſhe as then thought him but
iudifferent. The <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> at
the Reception of this Letter, had
much a-do to believe what he ſaw.
He had newly learnt by the other,
that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> lov'd the <hi>Sultana:</hi>
And by this: he ſaw plainly, that
it was his Wife of whom ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
were related, touching
ſome Beauties ſhe had under her
Linnen; which made known to
him, that thoſe that talk'd in that
manner, muſt needs have ſeen
them. I leave you to think,
what Two Injuries of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were capable of producing
in his Mind: To which, we ſhall
add a Third Affront, which was
as ſenſible to him as the other:
This was to ſee, that after his Wife
had had the Weakneſs to grant
him ſome Favours, he had been
capable of divulging them, which
he perceiv'd by the Character of
the Letter he had newly receiv'd.
So it is, that being ſeiz'd at the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42899:134"/>
ſame time with Shame, Rage and
Jealouſie, he ſent to ſeek out <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
and enquir'd of him about a
Mine, with which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
him. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> made him
an Anſwer ſuitable to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the matter: Where upon
the <hi>Vizier</hi> taking occaſion to fall
into a Rage: <hi>There's no need of
asking,</hi> he ſaid to him, <hi>why the
Siege is thus ſpan into a length;
no body does his duty; and</hi> Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,
<hi>whom I thought the braveſt of
our Officers, is the moſt a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
Ibrahim <hi>is no Coward,</hi> this
<hi>Baſſa</hi> made Anſwer; <hi>And he dares
ſay, that if every one had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his duty, as he has done, the
Town would long ſince have been
taken. Theſe are only Words,</hi> the
<hi>Vizier</hi> reply'd, <hi>and Words very
remote from Effects. But if you
are ſo brave, go now inſtantly and
attack ſuch a</hi> Baſtion, <hi>and either
be kill'd upon the ſpot, or return
victorious, when the Mine has been
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42899:134"/>
once ſprung. I conſent to it,</hi> was
<hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Anſwer: <hi>And if you
would your ſelf ſee how I go to
work, I would adviſe you to follow
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Vizier <hi>ſeeking a Quarrel,
was upon the Ferment at theſe
Words:</hi> You are a raſh, arrogant
fellow; <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> to go to
tell me what I have to do: March
where I command you, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reply: if not, I ſhall make
you ſenſible what it is to diſobey
me. I do not diſobey you, <hi>Ibrahim
reply'd:</hi> but once again, it is not
yet time to attack the <hi>Baſtion:</hi> And
if you do it, it is the way to ruine
your Army. I'le march thither,
however, ſince that you will have
it ſo; but I will have every one to
know, that I do it not without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.
I do not doubt that, <hi>the</hi> Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>reparty'd:</hi> And it is long ſince,
that I know, that the greateſt vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that can be done to ſuch a
Man as thee, is to ſend him to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42899:135"/>
ſuch an occaſion. I trouble my ſelf
little for this Reproach, <hi>Ibrahim
made Anſwer:</hi> My Comfort is,
there's none but thou of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
but thou muſt needs bear
me a Grudge upon other Accounts;
And the whole Army is my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that I ſpare my ſelf no more
than an other, when it concerns the
<hi>Sultan's</hi> Service. <hi>At theſe words,
out he went, and ſo to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
which was as unhappy
as it was ill digeſted. He caus'd
Three Thouſand Men to be kill'd
in this Action: and the</hi> Vizier <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the whole Army was
ready to revolt againſt him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
him of cauſing all theſe
Men to periſh without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
ſent him an Order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, though the
Siege thus ſpun into a length, as
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> dreaded, that at the
long run the Place would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42899:135"/>
haſten'd to its Relief, and,
among others, the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
All theſe Troops being come
within Two Leagues of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Camp, the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was
at a very great perplexity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Ill Will born him equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Officers and Soldiers.
This did not hinder him howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
from contriving to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and having ſent
for a Man in whom he confided,
he commanded him, that when
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was engag'd in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
he ſhould give him a Bullet
in his Back. This Order being
given, he detach'd <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to go
view the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were
advancing upon the Mountain of
<hi>Calemberg.</hi> The <hi>Aſſaſſinate</hi> follow'd
him; but before he had time to
do his Buſineſs, there came a ſhot
that kill'd him himſelf, and which
preſerved <hi>Ibrahim</hi> from danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:42899:136"/>
It is not my Province to give
the Particulars of that great Day,
a Day ſo glorious to the King of
<hi>Poland.</hi> It is ſufficient, I ſay that
after <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſaw that all was in
diſorder on his ſide, he march'd
towards the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>'s Wife's
Tent, which was already ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> inſomuch, that
ſhe ran a riſque of falling into their
Hands.</p>
            <p>He open'd his Paſſage to it with
his Sable: and having thus freed
her from danger, he conducted
her into the Body of his Army,
which fled before the King of
<hi>Poland.</hi> The <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> who
thought her a Priſoner, and who,
as is thought, would have been
glad ſomething worſe had befallen
her, which is juſtify'd by the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Care he had taken of ſaving
her timely, was in a Rage to ſee
that ſhe was endebted to <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
for her Safety. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
as he had too much Buſineſs
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42899:136"/>
upon his Hands, to think then on
that, his whole Thoughts were
how to get off with his Forces
and himſelf. But when this was
done, he openly complain'd, that
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> had abandoned the Poſts
he had confided to him, under
Colour of giving Succours to
Ladies, but in effect, to cloak his
Cowardize. He further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of ſome other Officers,
that ſo he might not be thought
to point at <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> out of any
particular Reſentment. Having
prepared Peoples Minds by theſe
Complaints, he ſent for them to
his Tent; and after having up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
them with their Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
he caus'd them to be ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Preſence of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Commanders of the Army;
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> only did he reſerve for
the laſt, and having made him
go into a By-Apartment, he
ſhew'd him the Two Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mention'd; after which he
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42899:137"/>
had the ſame Fate as the others had
had.</p>
            <p>His Execution ſurprized all the
Officers that knew that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
that had been us'd to put
him to Death, was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
ſince that he was not only
brave of his Perſon, but that he
had moreover, more Experience
in point of War than the <hi>Grand
Vizier</hi> himſelf. And indeed, this
Miniſter imagining, that after ſo
hardy a ſtroak, and done by his
ſingle Authority, he had many
meaſures to take, he ſent a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the Motives that
had oblig'd him thereunto. This
News being ſpread in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
the Two <hi>Sultana</hi>'s were
forthwith animated with different
Sentiments. <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Siſter being
extreamly afflicted, went to caſt her
ſelf at the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Feet,
and demand Juſtice of him againſt
the <hi>Vizier:</hi> And as for <hi>Zelinda,</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:42899:137"/>
ſhe did not think it became her
to concern her ſelf in this Affair,
that freed her from a Lover
blacken'd with Infidelity. Theſe
were her firſt Motions: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
quickly made room to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
more tender, ſhe look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her ſelf as the Cauſe of <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>'s
Death, which caſt her into
an Affliction much greater than that
of the other <hi>Sultana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus poſſeſs'd a-new with
Sentiments of Tenderneſs, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to apprehend, that far from
taking the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s part, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
her however, by a Letter,
that ſhe would grant him her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
with the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
ſhe did him all ſort of ill Offices,
but under-hand. Yet did ſhe not
think it expedient to uſe <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s
Death as a Pretext, for fear he
might accuſe her of revenging him,
as a Party concern'd, which he
might have juſtify'd by the Letter
he had in his Hands: but having
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42899:138"/>
had the Cunning to get it again, ſhe
no longer kept any meaſures, and
accus'd him of being the Cauſe of
all the ill ſucceſſes of the Army. Now
as theſe ill ſucceſſes had caſt the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Empire into a great Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> did no
longer look upon the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi>
with ſo good an Eye: and then <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
coming alſo to the Charge, it
was no difficult matter for her to
obtain of him, that he ſhould be
put to Death. The Order for that
purpoſe was diſpatched out of hand;
and for fear the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
ſhould revoke it, <hi>Zelinda</hi> ſent it to
the <hi>Mutes</hi> by one of her Servants,
with an Injunction to be himſelf
preſent at the Execution.</p>
            <p>Such an Order did extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
quite an other Treatment from
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> whom he had
done great Services in ſeveral Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
but ſeeing that it was brought
by a Confident of <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42899:138"/>
perceiv'd, that he was going to
dye, rather as a Victim of Love,
than as a Victim of State, which
was perform'd at that very inſtant;
and <hi>Zelinda</hi> had the Cruelty to go
ſee him ſtruck dead, as he was, as if
ſhe had been afraid they had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Orders.</p>
