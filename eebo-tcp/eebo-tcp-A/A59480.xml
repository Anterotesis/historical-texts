            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
SPEECH
Lately Made by a
Noble PEER
OF THE
REALM.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this great Debate concerning the King's
Speech, <hi>the sad State and Condition we are
in,</hi> and the Remedies thereof; I have Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
You my Opinion, and many Lords have
spoken admirable well to it, with great Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Plainness, as the Case requires.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to offer you some few words,
in answer to two or three of my Lords of the
Earls Bench, that have maintained the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Opinion.</p>
            <p>My Lord, near me, hath told your Lord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ships,
that the President of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4. that I
offered to you (who was a Wise and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Prince; and yet upon the Address of his
Parliament, <hi>put away a great part of his Family,
and Councils at one time,)</hi> is no proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
because he was an Usurper, had an ill
Title, and was bound to please the People.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I meddle not with his Title. I am
sure our King hath a very undoubted one; But
this My Lord must allow, that that wise Prince
having <hi>need of the People,</hi> knew no better way
to please them, and to create a good intelli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence
between them and him, than to put a
way those from Court and Council that were
unacceptable to them.</p>
            <p>If our King hath the same Necessity to please
the People, (though for other Reasons than
want of a Title;) Yet I am sure the President
holds, that a Wise Prince, when he hath need
of his People, will rather <hi>part with his Family
and Counsellors, than displease them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lords, This Noble Lord near me, hath
found fault with that President, that he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
I offered your Lordships concerning the
Chergeable Ladies at Court; But I remember
no such thing, I said; but if I must speak of
them, I shall say as the Prophet did to King
<hi>Saul, What means the bleating of this kind of
Cattel?</hi> And I hope the King will make me the
same answer, <hi>that he reserves them for Sacrifice,
and means to deliver them up to please his People,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For there must be, (<hi>in plain</hi> English) My
Lords, a <hi>change;</hi> We must neither have <hi>Popish</hi>
Wife, nor <hi>Popish</hi> Favourite, nor <hi>Popish</hi> Mistriss,
nor <hi>Popish</hi> Counsellor at Court, or any new
Convert. What I spoke was about another
Lady that belongs not to the Court, but like
<hi>Simpronia</hi> in <hi>Catalines</hi> Conspiracy, does more
Mischief than <hi>Cethegus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this time of Distress, I could humbly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
our Prince would take the same course
that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did, to suffer neither
Strangers nor Embassadors to stay above some
few weeks in his Country; for all the Strangers
and Embassadors here, have served the <hi>Plot,</hi>
and Design against us; I am sure they have no
tye to be for us.</p>
            <p>But my Lords, what I rose up to speak, was
more especially to my Lord of the <hi>Earls Bench,</hi>
that spoke last, and sits behind me: Who, as
he hath the greatest influence in our present
Councils, so he hath let fall to you the very
Root of the matter, and the hinges upon which
all turns; He tells you that the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
have lately made offers to the King, and
he wonders we do not expect the Kings An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to them, before we enter into so hot and
high Debates.</p>
            <p>He tells you, if the King be assured of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
we cannot doubt of his Complyance in
this and all we can ask; for otherwise the
King should fall into that that is the worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a Prince, to have his People have no
confidence in him. My Lords, This is that I
know they put the King upon, and this is that
<hi>we must be ruined by,</hi> if we may not with <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Plainness</hi> open our Case.</p>
            <p>My Lords, 'Tis a very hard thing <hi>to say that
we cannot trust the King;</hi> and that we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been deceived so often, that we see plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the apprehensions of <hi>Discontent</hi> in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is no Argument at Court. And though
our Prince be in himself an Excellent Person,
that the People have the greatest Inclinations
imaginable to Love; yet we must say he is
such an one, <hi>as no Story affords us a parallel of:</hi>
How plain and how many are the proofs of the
<hi>Design to murther him? How little is he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Transactions between him and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are Admirable, and Incomprehensible;
<pb facs="tcp:61935:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His Brother designs being early Known, to
aim at the Crown, before his Majesties <hi>Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
to this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This Match with a <hi>Portugal</hi> Lady, not like
to have Children, <hi>Contrived by the Dukes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law;</hi>
and no sooner effected but the
Duke and his Party make Proclamation to the
World, that we are like to have no Children,
that he must be the certain Heir.</p>
            <p>He takes his Seat in Parliament as Prince
of <hi>Wales,</hi> His Guards about him; The Princes
Lodgings at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> his Guards upon the
same Floor, without any Interposition between
him and the King; so that the King was in his
Hands, and in his Power every Night: All
Offices and Preferments being bestowed by
him, <hi>Not a Bishop made without him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince changes his Religion to make
himself a Party, and such a Party that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must be sure <hi>to dye</hi> and be <hi>made away,</hi> to
make room for Him, nothing could preserve
him, but that which I hope he will never do,
give greater earnest to that wicked Party than
his Brother could; and after all, <hi>this Plot</hi>
breaks out, plainly <hi>headed by the Duke,</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and his Design.</p>
            <p>How the King hath behaved himself ever
since the breaking ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of it, the World knows;
we have expected every hour that the Court
should joyn with the Duke against us: And it
is evident more hath been done to make the
<hi>Plot a Presbyterian Plot,</hi> than to discover it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prorogations,</hi> the <hi>Dissolutions,</hi> the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>short</hi> of <hi>parliaments,</hi> not suffering them to
have <hi>time</hi> or opportunity <hi>to lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k into any thing,</hi>
hath shew'd what reason we have to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in this <hi>Court.</hi> We are now come to
a <hi>Parliament</hi> again, by what <hi>Fate</hi> or what
<hi>Council,</hi> for my part I cannot <hi>guess;</hi> neither
do I understand the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ddle</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The Duke is quitted and sent away; the
House of Commons have brought up a Bill to
disable him of the Crown; and I think they
are so far <hi>extreamly</hi> in the <hi>right;</hi> but your
Lordships are  wiser than they, and have rejected
it; yet you have thought fit, and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath made the <hi>Proposition,</hi> to make such
<hi>Expedients</hi> as shall render him but a <hi>Nominal
Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while where's <hi>this Duke,</hi> that
the King and both Houses have declared unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
<hi>thus dangerous?</hi> Why he is in <hi>Scotland
raising of Forces</hi> upon the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> that can
enter dry foot upon us, without hazard of
Winds or Seas, the very place he should be in
to raise a party there, to be ready when from
hence he shall have notice: So that this being
the case, <hi>where is the trust?</hi> We all think the
business is <hi>so ripe,</hi> that they have the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,</hi>
the <hi>Arms,</hi> the <hi>Amunition,</hi> the <hi>Seas</hi> and
<hi>Souliery</hi> all in their <hi>hands;</hi> they want but one
good <hi>Summe of Money to set up,</hi> and <hi>Crown the
Work,</hi> and then they shall have <hi>no more need</hi> of
the <hi>People;</hi> and I believe whether they are
pleased or no will be no great trouble to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> I hear of a <hi>Bargain</hi> in the House
<hi>of Commons,</hi> and an <hi>Address</hi> made to the <hi>King</hi>
but this I know, and must <hi>boldly say it</hi> and <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that the Nation is <hi>Betray'd</hi> if upon any
Terms we part <hi>with our Money</hi> till we are <hi>sure
the King is ours;</hi> have what <hi>Laws</hi> you will,
and what Conditions you will, they will be of
<hi>no use</hi> but <hi>wast Paper</hi> before <hi>Easter,</hi> if the Court
have <hi>Money to set up for Popery and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
Designs</hi> in the mean while.</p>
            <p>On the other hand give me leave to tell you
my Lords, the King hath no reason to distrust
his People; no man can go home and say, that
if the King <hi>Comply</hi> with his <hi>People</hi> they will <hi>do
nothing for him,</hi> but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are all up from him; we
want a <hi>Government</hi> and we want a <hi>Prince</hi> that
we may <hi>trust,</hi> even with the <hi>spending</hi> of <hi>half</hi>
our <hi>Annual Revennues,</hi> for some time, for the
<hi>Preservation</hi> of these Nations.</p>
            <p>The growing Greatness of the <hi>French</hi> can
not be stopt with a little Expence, nor without
a real and hearty <hi>Vnion</hi> of the King and his
People. It was never known in <hi>England</hi> that
our Princes wanted Supplies either for their
Forreign designs, or for their Pleasures; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ever shut the <hi>English Purses</hi> but the fears
of having their <hi>Money</hi> used against them.</p>
            <p>The hour that the King shall <hi>satisfie the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
that what we give is not to make us <hi>Slaves</hi>
and <hi>Papists,</hi> he may have what he will, and
this your Lordships <hi>know</hi> and all mankind that
know us: Therefore let me plainly tell your
Lordships, the <hi>Arguments</hi> that the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
use, is <hi>to Destroy the King</hi> and not <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>
him: For if the King will first see what
we will do for him, it is impossible if we are
in our <hi>Sen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> we should <hi>do</hi> any thing.</p>
            <p>But if he will first shew that he is <hi>intirely
ours,</hi> that he <hi>Weds</hi> the <hi>Interest</hi> and the <hi>Religion</hi>
of the <hi>Nation,</hi> 'tis impossible he should <hi>want
any thing</hi> that we can <hi>give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I see how the Argument will be us'd:
Sir, they will <hi>do nothing</hi> for you, what should
you do with these men? But on the other hand
I am <hi>bold</hi> to say.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> You may have any thing of <hi>this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
put away these Men, change your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
change your Court, and be your self;</hi> for
the King himself may have any thing of us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> if I have been too <hi>plain,</hi> I beg
your Pardon; I thought it was the <hi>Duty</hi> of
an <hi>English Nobleman</hi> at this time to speak <hi>plain
or never.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sure I mean well: and if any man can
answer or oppose Reason to what I say, I beg
