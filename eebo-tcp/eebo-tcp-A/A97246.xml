         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Becauſe ſuch a party hath offended, thou wilt ſlander his religion, and all that profeſſe it.

Upon ſuch a mans perſon, and not upon his profeſſion: for it is not becauſe they are religious, but becauſe they are not religious enough, that men play the hypocrites. Their profeſſion, and purity, is not the cauſe of their wickedneſſe; but their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the cauſe of ſuch their counterfeiting profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For the more deformed any act is, the fairer vizard it ſtill ſeeketh, and the worſe any thing is, the better ſhew it deſires to make.</p>
               <p>It is a uſuall thing for Rebels, to make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations in the name of the King: And for Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates when they intend to robbe Marchants, to hang out the flags of other nations, both to ſcandall them, and conceale themſelves.</p>

And good reaſon have they ſo to Cloake their Villany: for hereby the thief paſſes unſuſpected, while the honeſt man is hanged in his ſteed.

But little doſt thou know or conſider who ſets thee on work: and what this thy flouting at purity and holineſſe will one day coſt thee; In the mean time know, that ſuch have no good conſciences, who dare gratifie Satan in committing the leaſt ſin, or neglect <hi>God</hi> in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt precept.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods</hi> people make conſcience of the leaſt ſinne, becauſe ſmall ſins, like little wedges make

               <p>Neither is it any praiſe to be ſparing of a vicious delight, for the very laſt is deadly: the leaſt ſinne ſerving in ſome meaſure, to <hi>harden our hearts, defile our conſciences,</hi> and <hi>blind our minds,</hi> aſwell as greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Thirdly, They ſcruple whatſoever is ſinfull: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no ſin can be light or ſmall in him, whom God hath ſo much obliged &amp; honoured, as of a bondſlave to Satan, and firebrand of hell; to adopt him his ſon, and aſſure him of an immortall kingdom: for ſuch know, that ſin is Gods mortall enemy: whence he argues thus; The great and holy God will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,

that any ſhall make leagues of amity with the meaneſt of his enemies: much leſſe that his owne endeered child, for whom he hath done ſo much, ſhould make the temple of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that gueſt he hates ſo deadly.

As how hainouſly did the Lord take, that ſeeming ſmall ſin in <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> when he did but ſhew the Babiloniſh Ambaſſadors all his treaſures, and what puniſhment did he threaten for the ſame: which was accordingly accompliſhed: 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 15. 17. 18. What ſin would a man think could be ſmaller then that of the Prophet? when he but turned into the other Prophets houſe to eate bread: being hungry, and alſo preſuming that he had a warrant from <hi>God</hi> ſo to do. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. yet he loſt his life for it. And we ſee how <hi>Vzza,</hi> for onely put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand to the <hi>Arke</hi> to ſtay it, when the oxen did ſhake it, a ſmall ſin will a carnall heart ſay; And yet the Lord for this ſmall ſinne, in great wroth ſmore him that he dyed in the ſame place. 2 Sam. 6. 7. The <hi>Philiſtims</hi> handled it far more rudely, and irreverently: and yet moſt of them eſcaped with far leſſe puniſhment, if any at all. 1 Sam. 5. 1. 2, Yea, read we not of more then <hi>fifty thouſand Bethſhemites, ſtroke dead in the place? For</hi> only <hi>looking into the Ark.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19. to teach us, that no ſin is light or ſmall ſo long as it is forbidden.</p>
               <p>The Church is to God, as a <hi>Houſe,</hi> a <hi>Garden,</hi> a <hi>Spouſe:</hi> And wee know that men who will abide durt in the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> will not endure it in their <hi>Houſes:</hi> they that will ſuffer weeds in the field, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

And when they ly ſick, <hi>O pray for me:</hi> (As <hi>Pharoah</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> to <hi>Simon Peter)</hi> you that I have ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided: rather then any of my ſcoffing companions. Nor can the moſt cauterized conſcience deny, but he deſires with <hi>Balaam,</hi> to have his laſt end like a beleevers, and his ſoul go where ſuch a deſpiſed puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſoule goeth: rather then with any mans that hath lived ſo careleſſely as himſelfe, and ſcoff at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for being more conſcionable.</p>
               <p>But that a good conſcience, may beare us out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the croſſe gales of their malicious cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: take another evidence of ſincerity to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: which can never faile, namely, when wee are as conſcientious alone, and in private, as if all the world ſaw us: and when we keep a narrower watch over our very <hi>thoughts,</hi> then any other can do of our <hi>actions:</hi> and no mans cenſure troubles us, more then our own.</p>
               <p>And yet if we do not ſoe wee are very fooles: for we can do nothing without a million of witneſſes; the Conſcience being as a <hi>thouſand witneſſes</hi> and God as a thouſand conſciences.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not if they are ſo perſwaded, and their conſciences ſatisfied touching their indifferency: Neither are they ſo ſimple as naturall men; who think themſelves as faſt (if not faſter) tyed by a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, as by a Commandment. As the foole thinks himſelfe as faſt bound with a ruſh, as with a Rope.</p>
               <p>But when things are of a doubtfull, and queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature: they hold it good to take the ſureſt ſide, and which draws neereſt to probability: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peradventure, it is good to forbeare the doing of that, which we are not ſure is lawfull to bee done.</p>
               <p>Many things are ſo queſtionable, that much may be ſaid on either ſide: but if I chooſe that ſide on which I am ſure I ſhall not ſinne, I deſerve to bee excuſed rather then cenſured. If I uſe them, it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I may ſinne: it may bee they are not ſinnefull, yet I am not ſo ſure of it, that I ſhall not ſinne if I uſe them, as I am ſure I ſhall not ſinne, nor break any of Gods commandments if I do not uſe them.</p>
               <p>Even actions of indifferency, when once they are felt to trench upon the conſcience: lay deepe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations upon the ſoule, even whiles they are moſt ſleighted by carnall hearts, there being no leſſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in conſciences, then ſtomacks: of which ſome will diſgeſt the hardeſt meats, and turne over ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances not in their nature edible; whiles others ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet of the lighteſt foode, and complain even of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But I have ſworne to doe that, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to be done: ſo that I muſt either breake my Oath, or do worſe, which is to ſinne one way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſinned in making ſuch an Oath, and are bound to bewaile and repent of it: but you ſhall not ſinne in breaking that Oath.

               <p>Yea, when any thing is granted generally, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is implyed this exception (if it be not againſt right and juſtice:) Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> brake his promiſe to his <hi>Mother</hi> touching <hi>Adonijah</hi> 1 Kings 2. 20. 23.

               <p>Indeed if the <hi>Law written</hi> do ceaſe, we muſt obſerve that which is allowed by the practice, and cuſtome of the Godly, and religious: and if in any thing this ſhall be defective, then that which is neereſt, and moſt agreeable to that: but if it may be drawn from

the written word, either directly or by conſequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is the more warrantable and ſatisfactory. Alwaies provided, that we expound ſcripture by ſcripture, which is the beſt and ſureſt way of expounding,</p>
               <p>But our ſcoffing adverſaries, deſire not ſo much ſatisfaction from us, as colourable pretences of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt us: which makes them give out, that we ſcruple ſmall matters, either out of pride and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: or we are more tender then they, out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſimplycity. As I have heard every one in a religious family, condemned for fooles and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low braines: becauſe they would notly, nor diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but ſpeak the naked truth. And no marvel; for firſt <hi>the wiſdom of God, is fooliſhnes with the world</hi> as <hi>the wiſdome of the World, is fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi> 1 Cor. 1, 18. 23. and 2. 14. &amp; 3. 19. ſecond <hi>A Fool</hi> (that is the naturall man) <hi>is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeven men that can render a reaſon.</hi> Proverb. 26. 16.</p>
               <p>Neither is it ſtrange, that they and the Godly ſo differ in judgement and practice: ſince they walke by rules, that are directly oppſite: for the naturall man either ſquares his life by other mens lives, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to Chriſts life: like ſome fooliſh <hi>Sexton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If Chriſt caſt out <hi>Divels, it is but through Belzebub the Prince of Divels.</hi> If his Apoſtles preach the Goſpel, it is but <hi>a new Doctrine to pervert the people.</hi> If <hi>Paule preach not himſelf, nor in the inticing words of mans wiſdom, he is but a babler.</hi> When <hi>Luther</hi> dealt againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> by and by, they cry out, hee could not come to that preferment hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: which was the <hi>Prelats</hi> plea, when any Zealous Miniſter ſpake againſt <hi>Pluralities,</hi> ſuperſtitious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and other vices and abuſes in the Clergie. Yea, though they loſt their livings, it was but to augment their maintainance by lying in a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, you cannot admoniſh them of their ſwearing, drinking, ſabbath breaking &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being called Puritane: which in their language is an hypocrite or diſembler: yea worſe, as being of a larger extent as I ſhall after ſhew: I grant moſt that uſe the Name, know not what it ſignifies; yea ask what themſelves mean by it, they are not able to tell you.</p>
               <p>And no marvell, they ſhould take admonition the chief office of friendſhip ſo ill: for poore ſoules they

think <hi>we take too much upon us:</hi> as <hi>Korah, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> twitted <hi>Moſes Numb.</hi> 16. 3.

Whence, as the chief Prieſts anſwered <hi>Judas, What is that to us?</hi> ſo theſe prophane perſons, will blaſpheme God, tear Chriſt in peeces, and more then betray, even ſhed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood; digging into his ſide with oaths, and ſay when told of it, what is that to us? They might as well ſay, what is Chriſt to us? what is heaven to us, or what is ſalvation to us? For to us the one cannot be, without the other: we ſhall never inherit part of his glory in Heaven, if wee doe not take his glories part upon Earth. And with God it is much about one, whether we be a doer of evill, or no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. For if we muſt <hi>not ſee our Neighbours Ox, nor his ſheep go aſtray, or fal into a pit, but we muſt reduce him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and help him out of it. Deut.</hi> 22. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are much more bound, to keep our neighobur himſelf from droping into the bottomleſſe pit of hell. And what know we, but <hi>we may win our Brother,</hi> and ſo ſave his ſoul? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. like <hi>Eugenia</hi> who being the naturall daughter of <hi>Philippus:</hi> became ſpiritually the mother of her owne Father, and begat him a new to the grace of Chriſt, he being an Infidel before, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> notes. And no man but ſtands in need e of admonition: for graces like good hearbs, will not grow of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: where as vices like weeds need no ſowing.</p>
               <p>Or in caſe wee prevaile nothing, yet wee are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. and hee who requires it at our hands, will returne the ſame into our owne boſomes <hi>Jſa.</hi> 49. 4. 5. <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 18. and 25. 22. And yet we are

But never conſult with <hi>Gods word</hi> about the matter:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119739:59"/>
yea <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> for elſe they would know firſt, that naturall men, and oppoſers of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation are no more fit to judge what things are indifferent, then blind men are fit to judge of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there is a civill, and a religious peace: the firſt whereof we would gladly accept of, as in a treaty of pacification both parties muſt yeeld ſomewhat, but nothing is to be yeelded to, that may prejudice the truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as <hi>our lawes</hi> are, or ought to bee grounded upon, and agreeable to <hi>the law of God,</hi> ſet downe. Levit. 19. 15. Deut. 19. 19. 20. 21. So <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> ought, and therefore are ſworne; to judge men and caſes according to the law written, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out favour or partiality. Imitating <hi>Zeleucus King of the Locrians,</hi> who rather then the law ſhould be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in favour of his ſons two eyes: would looſe one of his own. Or that godly, and impartiall <hi>Biſhop</hi> who excommunicated <hi>Marcian</hi> his own ſon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed whoredome. Nor can we pleaſure a brother or ſon (if an obſtinate offender) more then in yeelding him up to the law: for this is the moſt probable way and meanes, to ſave his ſoule. 1 Cor. 5. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> as for inſtance the <hi>Homicide</hi> through a killing favour is pardoned, and granted his life: <hi>God</hi> drawes his ſword, and by his plague ſpils a thouſand lives for it.

               <p>It is the ruine of Enmity, that is the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of peace, and unleſſe <hi>ſeverity</hi> be ſhewed to our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>ſecurity</hi> cannot dwell in our ſtreets.

               <p>I know it is a truth, which cannot be beaten into their braines: but there cannot be a more pleaſing ſacrifice to <hi>God,</hi> then the blood of malefactors ſhed by the hands of authority: as appeares in that caſe of <hi>Phineas,</hi> in killing <hi>Zimry</hi> and <hi>Cozby.</hi> Numb. 25. 7. to 14. For the ſhedding of their blood, was the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableſt ſacrifice, that ever he offered.

               </p>
               <p>Fooliſh men would be ready to ſay, this was a cruell act: but wiſe Chriſtians that aske counſell of <hi>God</hi> know: that the mild juſtice, is no leſſe perillous to the Common Wealth, then the moſt cruell. And that governours make themſelves guilty of thoſe ſinnes, they puniſh not. Whence <hi>Moſes</hi> (he that was ſo good, and loving, that he would rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh himſelfe, then <hi>Jſrael</hi> ſhould) not only pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth this ſentence of death, on ſo many thouſands, but rejoyceth thereat, and bleſſeth the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,</p>
               <p>And what but his charity and mercy, as well as his juſtice, made him thus cruell? for all <hi>Iſrael</hi> might have curſed him, if ſome had not ſmarted by him.

               <p>But let them ſeriouſly conſider the reaſons why they doe ſo? as that they are as blind as beatles, in matters of religion. Or elſe they doe it in policie, or out of ſome naturall aptitude, or out of baſeneſſe, or out of guiltineſſe, or out of pride or out of prejudice, or out of miſpriſion, or out of envie, or out of ſelfe love, or that they may be upon even ground with the godly, or out of partiallity: or out of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of diſpoſition: the one being the <hi>ſerpents,</hi> the other the <hi>Womans ſeed,</hi> or becauſe ſatan who is their god and king will have them doe it, or becauſe they cannot doe them more miſchiefe, their hands being manacled by the law, or that they may incite, and ſtir up others to doe the like, or becauſe the <hi>World</hi> looſeth a <hi>limb</hi> or <hi>member:</hi> and <hi>ſatan</hi> a <hi>ſubject</hi> or <hi>priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> in every one that repenteth.

Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 20.</p>
               <p>Yea, let the conſideration of theſe particulars; move men to vindicate the religious, when they are called to it: as every one is that heares them ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.

               <p>I know their cunning ſophiſtry is ſuch, and their colourable pretences ſo many: having ſuch a ſubtle prompter as ſatan is: that they are able to foreſtall the ſimple, with ſtrange conceits, and baſe thoughts of the beſt men: for it hath alwayes beene their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, witneſſe <hi>Hamans</hi> words to <hi>Ahaſuerous:</hi> and thoſe other of <hi>Rehum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shimſhay,</hi> and their companions to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> Ezra 4.

               <p>But certainly, if men would weigh things as they are: and as I have made good: they would be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſſe; that it fares with our malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as it did with <hi>Pentheus,</hi> in <hi>Eripedes:</hi> who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he ſaw <hi>two ſunnes, two Thebes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>It was the bloody practice, of the <hi>French Prelates:</hi> againſt the <hi>Waldenſes:</hi> whom they accuſed to <hi>Lewis the</hi> 12. of many ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but forged crimes: barring them all acceſſe to the <hi>King,</hi> whereby they might cleere themſelves: till at length the King, (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that repentance uſually attended upon raſh judgement) told thoſe foxes: that if he were to condemn the Divell; he would give him an hearing. Where upon he ſent his confeſſors, and Secretary of State to try the matter: who returning to the King, cleered their innocency; and commended ſo their piety and integritie: that the King affirmed by his ordinary oath that they were better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or the Prelates that accuſed them. And did not our <hi>Prelates</hi> deale juſt ſo with the Puritans, in their reports to the <hi>King?</hi> were they not alwayes, as a black cloud between his Majeſties pious ſubjects, and the Princes favour? and might they not be fitly compared, to the <hi>watching Dragon:</hi> that kept the <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fleece?</hi> Yes, their owne conſciences beare me witneſſe: only I wiſh his Majeſtie, and ſo many as ſide with the Prelates, would as truly imitate that <hi>French</hi> King, as they did that Dragon.</p>

Thirdly, for a word of advice to the godly: If all naturall men are ſo apt to cenſure the religious; cauſe or no cauſe: And that they have ſo many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to induce them to it: Let us for our <hi>Makers,</hi> and for our bleſſed <hi>Redeemers</hi> ſake, take heed what we doe: leaſt we ſhame our profeſſion, and make the way of truth evill ſpoken off. 2 Pet. 2. 2.

               <p n="4">4. Fourthly and laſtly, As we all grant that there are ſuch hypocrites: who have a forme of Godlines, and deny the power of it: that ſeeme religious, are vicious; or not at all vertuous. So wee willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them, the moſt ſeleſtique miſcreants, that ever hell was beholding to. For the hypocrite, ſhames religion by profeſſing it &amp; makes the way of truth evil ſpoken of. As 2 Pet. 2. 2. Yea for his ſake, <hi>the name of goodnes is blaſphemed all the day long;</hi> and an ill report raiſed upon them, that ſerve God in truth, So that for the deceivers fault, the true man is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And what the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> once ſpoke to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 5. 21. We may more juſtly apply to the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite: <hi>Yee have made our Saviour to ſtinke,</hi> in the eyes of all the people: <hi>and put a ſword into the hands</hi> of prophane men, <hi>to ſlay us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Yea the Saints are not onely reproached, the truth diſgraced, and religion it ſelfe ſcandalized: but this gives occaſion to others to blaſpheme God, and to doubt whether all divinity, be not meer policie; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he ſcriptures a fable. As of old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>the people abhorred the ſervice of God; and became deſpiſers of his worſhip:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe prophane <hi>ſonnes of Ely,</hi> were ſo wicked and ſcandalous. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. So between hypocrites, and the openly prophane: (home bred enemies, and forraign foes; both Heirs apparant to Satan) the righteous ſuffer: like <hi>Ieremiah</hi> between the Princes and falſe Prophets.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe the miſchief an hypocrite does, to thoſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119739:72"/>
that are within: is nothing to what he does to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and them that are without: For firſt, his ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life ſo hardens carnall men; that it makes many of them proteſt againſt their owne converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea his ill life ſingle; pulls downe more: then many good tongues are able to build up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though he grievouſly wrongs both the good and bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet none ſo much as himſelfe. For beſides, that when hypocrites have acted their parts of diſſimulation here: they ſhall be bid, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi> Which is the portion of all wicked men. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 41. They above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinners; ſhall have a double weight, or portion of vengeance: the loweſt, and deepeſt place in Hell. As is plaine Matth. 23. Where our ſaviour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounceth. <hi>Woe to you hypocrites:</hi> but repeats it eight times in one Chapter: ſaying, <hi>Woe, Woe, Woe, to you hypocrites: for you ſhall receive greater damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> verſ. 14. The hypocrite, ſtrives to loade Chriſt with man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſinnes: therefore Chriſt loads him with many woes and curſes. Though the maine ground is, from the nature of this ſinne. For nothing more greatens any ſinne, then ſimulation of holineſſe. Nor is any miſchiefe ſo diveliſh, as that which is cloaked with piety. The better vice ſhews, the worſe it is, and the worſe it is: the better it deſires to ſhew. Yea the better colour is put upon any vice, the more odious it is: both in the ſight of God &amp; man. For as every ſimilitude adds to an evil; ſo the beſt adds moſt evil. The face of goodneſſe, without a body: is the worſt wickedneſſe. Cloath an Ape in Tiſſue: and both the beauty of the Robe, and the reſemblance which hee carrieth of a man;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119739:73"/>
does but add more ſcorne to the beaſt. And without contradiction; an ill man is the worſt of all creatures, ſave the Divel himſelfe: an ill Chriſtian, the worſt of all men and an ill profeſſor the worſt of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Profeſſed Curtizans, if they bee any way good: it is becauſe they are openly bad. And <hi>it ſhall be eaſier for theeves, and Adulterers, at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then for hypocrites.</hi> Mat. 21. 31.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou beeſt unſound within: ſoil not the glorious Robe of truth, by putting it upon thy beaſtlines. To bid thee repent, and ſtrive for Sincerity; were to ſmall purpoſe: for (which is ſtrange) in all the Scriptures, wee never reade of an hypocrites repentance. And a notable reaſon may be given: Wickedneſſe doth moſt rankle the heart, when it is kept in and diſſembled.</p>

               <p>I know the aſſertion will ſeeme ſtrange; Yea the groſſeſt hypocrite of them all, will preſume that hee can <hi>Herod</hi> like, waſh his hands of this ſin.

But I ſhall make it appear, that there are no greater hypocrites, nor Puritans under Heaven; then they who rail, and cry out ſo much; againſt hypocriſie, and Puritaniſme.

               <p n="1">1. And firſt, let me examine ſuch of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; who altogether in their ſermons enveigh againſt puritans; for being one in their profeſſion, and ſhew to the world; and another, yea cleane contrary in their life and practice, their conſciences ſhall give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt them; if they be not cauterized, with continuall, handling of holy things without feeling: That whereas they call themſelves by the generall name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by the ſpeciall, and particular name of Chriſts Miniſters, and Ambaſſadors: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they repreſent his perſon, ſpend their whole times in reading, and preaching Gods word, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and adminiſtring the Sacraments: in praying, and viſiting the ſick; get their whole livings, under a ſhew of ſervice done to Chriſt: Yea their very gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments forſooth, muſt pretend holineſſe and purity; then which there can be no greater profeſſion: yet theſe men, theſe great pretenders, are the leaſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obedient to his lawes. Yea none greater enemies to Chriſt, and his kingdome then they, for either in their preaching; they doe what they can to draw from Chriſt to the world, his mortall enemy: by diſcouraging the good, and incouraging the evil: by <hi>turning the truth of God, into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly.</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 25. A thing more frequent with Prelaticall preachers, then moſt men have wit to obſerve. I wiſh their admirers would reade their ſeverall Characters, in a late <hi>abſtract:</hi> and be better informed: or that ſuch
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119739:74"/>
unpreaching miniſters, were marked in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads: that their people might the better know, and take heed of them.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe it is ſtrange, that theſe <hi>Gehazies:</hi> who receive in ſo much truth at their eares, ſhould not have one word of truth in their mouths. Yea to an ordinary capacity, it ſounds above beleefe: that they who are Gods mouth to the people, ſhould bee ſo wicked; and falſe; as out of the mouth of God, to give not the judgement of God; but of their owne wicked hearts, ſtifned with the ſerpents enmity.</p>
               <p>But conſider the reaſon, and the caſe is plain: The hypocrite is a ſecret <hi>Athieſt, ſaying in his heart there is no God.</hi> Pſal. 14. 1 and without controverſie, Thou art an Athieſt: for if thou didſt beleeve there is a God; thou durſt not bee ſo bold, as to withſtand him to his face: and with his word to wound his own people.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, if they doe preach the truth, yet by their lives they confute their owne doctrine: as their <hi>Rhetorick</hi> may bee prittie, and their <hi>Lodgick,</hi> wittie; when their <hi>practice</hi> is naughtie. Yea, are there not many hundreds in this land? (ſome whereof the Parliament have ſound out, and caſt out) like <hi>Balaam?</hi> then whom never Prophet ſpake better, nor reprobate did worſe. It faring with them as with one of a ſurfetted ſtomack: the more good meat he eates; the more he increaſeth his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>Perhaps he is not ſo much noted for hypocriſie, as others that make leſſe uſe of diſſembling: but his owne conſcience tells him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he hates Religion in his heart: at leaſt that <hi>Liſander</hi> like, he makes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or reckoning of it, but when it may prove profitable: but though he will not admit it in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet to further his own ends, he will ſometimes put it on, and adorn himſelf therewith. Religion ſhall ſerve him as a canopy, to ſhroud the putrifaction of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſh plots; being like one that <hi>lookes a ſquint,</hi> for while he ſeems to caſt his eye on goodnes: his ſight is fixed on wickednes, and may fitly be reſembled to thoſe women divels, who employ holy and ſacred words about witchcraft, and magicall effects.</p>
               <p>Yea, it is grown the higheſt maxime, in mundane policy, to ſeem (not be) religious.

               <p>Indeed, profeſſion may be without grace, as leaves may be without fruit: but grace cannot be without profeſſion; as fruit cannot be without leaves.

Secondly, they do it, that God may have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by it: <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes and gloriſie your Father which is in heaven. Matth.</hi> 5. 16. A father gains much honour by the vertuous and good demeanour of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

               <p>So that to be good, and not to appear: or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear good, and not to be: is not the way to glorifie God, or for him to glorifie us.</p>

St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth the Philippians; to <hi>ſhine as lights in the midſt of a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and crooked Nation:</hi> by a blameleſſe and pure life: thereby to winne others, amongſt whom they lived. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15.

A godly man by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous example: though he otherwiſe be ſilent, yet by that dumb Oratory: he preacheth to the world, and doth not ſeldom win others to imitate the ſame. We read that many infidels were won to the Chriſtian

faith: by ſeeing the vertous lives of the Chriſtians. Yea <hi>Zozomen</hi> reports, that the devout life; of a poor Captive, Chriſtian maid: made a King, and all his Family imbrace the faith of Chriſt. And the like me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable preſident, we have in St. <hi>Alborn:</hi> who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a poore perſecuted Chriſtian into his houſe; and ſeeing his holy devotion, and unblameable life: was ſo much affected therewith; that hee became both an earneſt profeſſor of the faith, and in the end a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious martyr for the Faith.</p>
               <p>And what ſaith our Saviour? <hi>No man lighteth a Candle, and putteth it in a privy place; neither under a buſhell; but on a Candle ſtick: that they which come in, may ſee the light. Luke</hi> 11 33. Yea a Candle in the houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gives light not only to them that are within; but alſo to paſſengers in the ſtreet.</p>
               <p>No matter how cloſe evils bee, nor how publique good is, Yea to conceale goodneſſe is a vice, and vertue is better by being imparted. Yea ſo much the better, by how much the more it is communicated: and to keep it private is the only way to be deprived of it.</p>

Let us not cloſely diſſemble, or conceale that grace which we have; either for feare of danger, as <hi>Peter</hi> did his zeale and affection to Chriſt; or for ſhame of being taken notice of; like <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> when he ſtole to Chriſt by night; untill his love and fervour brake forth; and could no longer bee ſuppreſſed.
