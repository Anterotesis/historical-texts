            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>BEing desirous to furnish my self with sufficient knowledg in things of either use or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to man, I considered the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Inquiry would be of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose knowledge was compleat in those things which I purposed to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to which end, being desirous, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, to understand as much of the nature, use, and right managing of Clocks as was possible for one that was not a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97744:10"/>
in that kind, I thought it best to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my self to you; who, being an able Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist in that profession, may therefore be the more likely to satisfie my curiosity in this particular, provided you are as willing, as God and education hath made you able.</p>

                           <p> Sir, the most noble and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous productions of Nature and Art (I have observed) are alwaies of more value and esteem among men, when their vertues and qualities are throughly understood and truly discovered, then they are so long as the same lyeth hidden and concealed; which Consideration is to me a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motive to ingage my self to serve you in this your request as far as my weak capacity will permit me, especially in those things that are absolutely necessary to be known by those that intend to make use of any sort of Clocks whatsoever, hoping thereby to whet the edge of your esteem of so ingenious an art. Propound therefore those things you would be satisfied in and I shall indeavour to give you an answer.</p>

                           <p>A Clock is a certain instrument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and contrived, to give the true hour, either of the day or night, (by the Circuler moving or certain wheels and pinions artificially disposed within the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Instrument) without the help of either Sun, Moon, or Stars, or any other of those elemental assistances, which the Antients did in former ages make use of to divide their time by.</p>

                           <p>Clocks in that perfection, in which this age enjoys them, excel all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in its officiousness at all times, and in all places, as well in the nights, as in the day, as well in cloudy skies as in clear weather, as well in close roomes as in the open Air, which no other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rological Instrument besides this is able to perform, many being defective, where the Sun giveth a perpendicular shaddow, and in cloudy weather, in close roomes, and in the night, most are likewise of no

use; whereas on the contrary, let the time be when it will, the weather what it will, or the place where it will, all is one to a Clock, it shall give the time as certain in one as in another, provided it be in perfect order, and well adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                           <p>From whence are all those vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous names, and denominations of Clocks derived.</p>

                           <p>They are derived, first, from that which is the principal and prime cause of their motion, being either weight or Spring.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, from that, which retards and regulates the violent motion of the wheels, being either, ballance or pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, from the time they continue in motion at once winding up, some going 16 houres, some 30 hours, some 8 days, some 5 weeks, some 3 moneths, some 6 moneths, and some a year.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, from the offices which they perform, some giving the hour onely by the pointing of the needle, others express
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97744:11"/>
the same by the sound of a bell. Some strike quarters, some repeat the hour, and some chime tunes.</p>
                           <p>So that from the permiscuous intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of these four foregoing heads, are derived all these various and manifold distinctions, and denominations, under which they have been exhibited unto the world, of which be pleased in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Scheam to take a view of.</p>

their Wheels and pinions differently indented in their perypheris (according to the judgment of him that composeth it.) do by vertue received from either Weights or Springs, successively move each other in a circular manner, having the rapidity of their motion, so retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and regulated, by either Ballance or Pendulum, that the needle, who also is moved with the rest of the work performs its revolution in twelve hours (or parts of time) thereby dividing at twice going round, the day and night into twenty four equal parts, which are commonly expressed by the pointing of the needle to a Circle equally divided into twelve parts, which are called hours, whereunto are annexed figures, sufficient to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the successive divisions thereof, so that by the pointing of the needle, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those divisions, or their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate parts, you have the true hour given, whensoever you make inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereon.</p>

that strike on bells, of which the Clock is one, being composed of two parts, a watch part, and a striking part, the watch being the same as was spoken of before, I shall pass here: as for the strikeing part, it is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Clock is made by art to give intelligence of its divisions of time, by strikeing several successive blows on a bell, sufficient to express the number of hours, that have passed, since the last meridian altitude, or depression of the Sun, which is thus performed.</p>
                           <p>The wheels contained in the striking part being at the end of every hour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked by certain detents for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose appointed, continue the rapidity of their motion which is the cause of the hammers striking until the locking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which is appointed to stop them, fall into the next successive notch of a moving wheel, called the count wheel, for that purpose indented concentrick at severall distances according to the number of strokes at each time to be strucken.</p>

                           <p>First for its durableness the first thing required is that the chief parts of which it is composed, be of metal answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in hardness to the extremity of its performance.</p>

                           <p>You speak well in my opinion as to the first of these, for I am certainly perswaded that those german movements and others, formerly made, were far more lasting and dureable then those which these latter ages have produced for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97744:15"/>
them whose wheels and other parts were made of the purest steel must needs outlast those who are made in brass, it being a much softer metal and so consequently more subject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</p>

                        <sp>

                           <p>Your not right understanding the first thing required in my first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postion hath been the cause of this your great mistake. I confess indeed that some part of those antient movements you speak of do in our days seem many of them to be very little worn: Yet I will prove to you by plain and evident reasons, that those Clocks and Watches, which we make now a dayes (though the wheels and other parts are composed of brass the softer metal) shall in the general out last all others whatsoever, provided it be truly and religiously wrought: to prove which consider first that the service of all pinions are in such proportion to the wheels that moveth them (or are moved by them) as their numbers are one to another so that if a wheel contain sixty teeth and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97744:16"/>
pinion which it moveth about contain but six, the service of this pinion must needs be ten times as much as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of that wheel, because it maketh ten revolutions to the wheeles one, and so by consequence every tooth (or leaf) of that pinion must be worn ten times as much as every tooth in that wheel, to make therefore these wheels and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to wear a like, and continue the one as long as the other, tis requisite that the substance of the pinion should be so many degrees more hard and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (as its proportion of wearing is) then the substance of the wheel which moveth it, by which means they will wear better and continue longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reparation then otherwise tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them to do; for if you observe those german movements you speak of (whose wheels and pinions and other parts are all of steel) you shall find the pinions irrepairably decaied, when the wheels are never the worse, for since that almost all the wearing to which those parts are liable be laid one the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97744:16"/>
we may reasonably conclude that they are sooner worn out (by just halfe the time) then they otherwise would have been, if the wheel had been made of such a metal, whose proportion of hardness or softness would have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an equal share of wearing with it, which ill conveniencies are all avoyded by that method of working now a days us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in framing of these movements: there fore in this sort of work take this for a general rule (where there is no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that what proportion of wearing one part beareth unto another such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of hardness should the metal of the one have above the other to make them wear equal, and Continue long in that placide estate of motion which is requisite in things of this nature.</p>

                           <p>I am now in part convinced of my error, but yet, I think, your general rule holds not good in all parts of a Clock, for then how comes it to pass that in Clocks, you make their pevets which are of steel, to move in frames of brass this according to your general rule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97744:17"/>
wear equally, because they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of unequal hardness, yet perform both the same taske; whence we may conclude that the more soft must needs be more sensiable of the wearing then that which is more hard, therfore how can your method of working, be good in these parts.</p>

                           <p>The rule and method holds good still (with our exception) for though it be an ill convenience in other parts, yet in pevets and their receptacles it is not so, for reason requires if 'twear possible, that all the wearing to which those parts are subject should be in the pevet holes, and not in the pevets themselves; for when pevets, are worn and decayed theres no repairing them without new pinions (which is exceeding chargeable) whereas pevet-holes are more easily reduced and with far smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler cost, thus of two evils we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the least.</p>

                           <p>In its officiousness two things are required, first continuance in motion; secondly regularity in the same: as to the first of these 'tis certain, that those Clocks, that have true proportion in their parts and uniformity of figure also, must needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

from air and dust; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to rust the steel work, which may happen to put a stop to its motion, and the other, by clogging the teeth, and choaking the pevets, will be apt to produce the same effect.</p>
                           <p>As to their regularity I shall say only thus much, that those Clocks, who have their motion regulated by a Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, are more excellent then those who are regulated by a Ballance, and those, that are regulated by a long Pendulum, are far more excellent than those that are regulated by a short one; to all which I shall add this one general rule, that those Clocks are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted best, that perform most with least work.</p>

and substantial you must observe these three rules.</p>
                           <p>First that you apply your self to a work-man who is of reputed ability: he that is master of his Art is the only person in nature from whom you can in reason expect either Clocks or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other movements whatsoever that are perfect, sound, and good work.</p>

                           <p>Not by the populer applause of light and vain petsons: but by the commendation of the more sober and soled sort of men.</p>
                           <p>Not by the fame of unexperienced relations; as by the testimony of his own labours.</p>
                           <p>Not by his fair and beautiful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97744:21"/>
but by his plain down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and solid reasons.</p>
                           <p>So that if his reputation be derived from gravity: if his work have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to the expectaion of those that have used it: and he be able to give a reason of any thing that falls in his business, you may in a large manner put confidence in his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                           <p>But some Clocks that have been made by persons of good repute have failed exceedingly in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance (as might be instanced in several) though they indeed at last were perfected, but it was with a great deal of trouble.</p>

                           <p>This might be for several other reasons, and not from any deficience in the work-man; as first, it might be some accidental injury in the convei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from one place to another, as sometimes happens by jogs or Squats which loosen either pins, wedges or screws which many waies may impede its motion.</p>

                              <pb n="25" facs="tcp:97744:21"/>Secondly there may be some small matter not freed in the finishing, which many times escapes the care of the best work-man, and may happen not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it self till sold, all which may occasion some defect in its perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and this defect may occasion some trouble to find its cause, for if the cause be once found tis then ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily cured, only the hardest thing is to find the cause, but however the work of a reputed Artist, may thus fail by chance, yet this can be no cause for you to distrust his ability, for the best work-man being but a man may be subject to error, and if in the general he prove a sound work-man once failing is not to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>

                           <p>My second rule is that your work-man be not onely a person of reputed ability, but also of known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, for though a found work-man be able to furnish you with good
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97744:22"/>
work; yet the safest dealing will be with him that is both able and honest, an able work-man can furnish you with good work, if he will, and an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est man will furnish you with good work, therefore he that is both able and honest, both can and will furnish you with good work if you observe.</p>
                           <p>My third rule, that you resolve to give a price valuable to the work you purchase, there is a saying which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Clock-makers is aparently true, that he that sels a Clock for a small price cheats either himself or his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomer, for if he sels good work at a low rate, he cheats himself; but if he sels bad work at a low value then he cheats his Customer, who expects (commonly) that it should be good though he buy it at an inconsiderable price; therefore if you are minded to furnish your self with a good Clock be as willing to give a good price as you are to have good work.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97744:22"/>
of that is both of repute, ability, and known integrity, and one that for a good price hath made good work; yet, I fear, I may here be cheated, for when I come into his shop with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to give a good price for that which is good; I may have chance to pitch upon one that is not of his own make, for <hi>I</hi> have observed that they all keep servants, who seldome prove so careful as they ought, especially if their masters eye is not alwaies one them.</p>

                           <p>He that is honest and faithful in his dealing will certainly inform you of the difference if he finds you thus resolved valuably to purchase the best, but however considering temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons your best way not to be deceived is to be speak it a fore hand agreeing with the work-man both for price, time of going, performance, and shape; this is the surest way, for a work man that knoweth his price knows also what time he can afford to spend in makeing it good.</p>

                           <p>Tis very hard, yet to satisfie your desire I will give you two or three rules that may possibly stand you in some stead.</p>
                           <p>First be satisfied if possibly, whether the teeth of the wheels be cut down by an ingine or not, for there is no man can cut them down by hand so true and equal as an ingine doth,</p>
                           <p>Secondly let the vibrative traine of the Pendulum or Ballance be brisk and lively, continuing its motion some time after the tooth hath ingaged with its pallets, and not check or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn so soon as they have beaten thereon, tis alwaies commendable to to see Clock or Watch-work, move thus brisk and lively, and a great sign it hath passed a good hand.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Observe whether every particular part of it be true and square whether it be clean, smooth, and well polished, whether the needle or hand be true siled, and of a neat order whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97744:23"/>
the hammer strike one the Bell so true as may cause it to give its sound clear and ful without intermixture of harshness and Jurgelling, and whether the work be generally in all its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lively, brisk and pleasant, if you find all these in a Clock you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it was made by the hand of a good work-man, and consequently that it is good work, which is alwaies best cheap though it cost dear.</p>

                           <p>If you have occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey any Clock of worth from one place to another you must do thus: provide for it a coffin or box of deal boards or other wood, let it be strong enough, provided it be not too heavy and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome, let this box be of bigness sufficient to contain your Clock (with case or without) having besides space enough left both at bottom, top, and sides, to thrust in Straw, or Hay, (or any other matter that is soft and yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) in such quantity as may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keep it free from the sides of the coffin: when you have thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided your coffin or box let your Clock (whether in case or otherwise) be carefully wraped up in paper or Cloths (according to its bigness) to keep it from dust and fowlness having before fastened every thing in it that may receive prejudice by being loose as the pendent of a Clock, or a Clock in the case, or the like: when you have thus wraped it up safe, then in the bottom of the coffin or box, place a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97744:24"/>
lay of Straw, upon which lay in your Clock, then with Straw or Hay let it be so close packed up both at bottom, top, and sides, as the Clock may not-be able to stir therein (alwaies observe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to be careful of glases or ornaments that they be free from compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) then fasten on the cover by nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Cording it; so is your Clock sufficiently packed up, and may he safely conveyed to any place whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever without harm or prejudice.</p>

                           <p>When you have gotten it home, the first thing you have to do is gently to open the box, pull out the packing and take out the Clock then take off that with which it is covered, loosen those things that are fastened in it, so is it ready to set up for going.</p>
                           <p>If it be a Ballance Clock of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sort, the trouble is not much but onely to drive in an hook into either

                           <p>The chief use of the pocket watch is, with the pointing of the needle to the circle of hours, to give the true hour of the day or night; the watch and Larrum not only giveth the hour by the point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the needle, but is also by Art contrived to ring on a bell, at any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hour you shall appoint, being chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97744:28"/>
designed to awaken people at any certain hour of the night, according as they shall have occasion to raise themselves; the Clock not onely giveth the hour by the direction of the hand to the Dial figures, but doth also (as I have said before) give intelligence of its divisions of time, by the sound of a Bell, strikeing thereon so many stroaks as are sufficient to give an account of the hour it expresseth.</p>

                           <p>In the managing of the pocket watch, you must first wind it up right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which you must do by turning the Key of it contrary to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sun, or from your right hand upwards (or from you) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your self, which ought also to be done not too hastily, least you force the stop, and break the string; and commonly those, that strive to wind them up the contrary way, bow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the teeth, or break the pinions;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97744:28"/>
like unto this is the manner of winding up either Watch and Larrum, or Clock; but the Watch and Larrum, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ring at any certain hour must thus be set to perform its task; they have commonly two circles wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ingraven the twelve hours, one in large or capital figures, the other in small figures, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to set the Larrum by, within which is a small hand; now, what hour soever you would have your Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums to ring at, to that figure, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost circle, set your Larrum hand; as if you would have it ring at five in the Morning, then set the little hand within the small circle (which I call the Larrum hand) to the figure of five contained in that small circle; then winde up the Larrum, and the next morning you willl see the effects.</p>

                           <p>The Clock, in the winding up of its several parts, must be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the watch, but in other respects
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97744:29"/>
requireth a different ordering, for if the hand be not at the true hour, it must be set thereunto gradually from one hour to an other, letting the Clock strike out betwixt each hour, for if you should turn the hand forward hastily two or three figures together, you will indanger the breaking of the detents, if they should happen to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the warning pin.</p>
                           <p>If the hand and the striking are not together, that is, if it strikes more or less then the figure, which the hand points at, you must bring them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus, by lifting up continually the locking detent, so often as occasion serves, till by striking of it round you bring it to strike so many as the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure signifies, to which the needle points.</p>

by the same rule, if therefore a Watch go too fast, the spring must be let down to make it go slower, if it go too slow the spring must be taken up to make it go faster.</p>

of its thus going too fast when foul, is the choaking of the pevets with dust, which hinder the motion of the Pendulum, and restraineth it from fetching its wonted compass, so that the Arch of its recursion being shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened it must needs pass it in lesser time, and so by consequence gain as to its wonted course; of which more may be understood when the Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum is treated of.</p>

                           <p>The use of Quarter Clocks is, not onely to strike the full hour on a bell, but also to strike at the end of every Quarter of an hour, so many blows on a smaller bell as are sufficient to express the number of Quarters that have passed since the hour last struck.</p>

                           <p>They not only strike the hour and quarter, but also, immediately after the striking of each quarter, it repeats or strikes over again, on a different bell, the last hour that was strucken, by which you are given to understand, that it is 1, 2, or 3 quarters past that hour which was repeated; this Clock is of excellent use for the night.</p>
                           <p>There is another sort of repeating Clocks, which differs much from this before spoken of, the quarters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating, being both performed at the same time, and on the same bells; it strikes the quarters on three bells, and the hour bell never strikes above six: to understand the striking of this Clock you must observe this rule. Look on how many quarter bells it strikes whether on 1, 2, or 3, for so
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97744:34"/>
many quarters are passed since the strikeing of the last hour, as if it strike on one bell, then one quarter is passed; if on two bells, then two quarters are passed, if on three bells, three quarters are passed: then again, look how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times it strikes on any number of the aforesaid three bells, that is the hour that was strucken last; as suppose it strike five times on two bells, this signifies its two quarters past five or eleven as the time is, again sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it strike six times one three bells, this signifies its three quarters past fix or twelve, according to the time.</p>

                           <p>When you set your pocket watches to the hour your best way is to move your hand backward (or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the succession of the figures) but if your movement be a Clock then you must not turn it thus backward as you do a watch, because it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the spoiling of it, but strike it forward from hour to hour, till you come to the time you would set it at, then when you have so done put it som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing past the time you would set it to, and then bring it back again to the true time: as if your Clock were down, and your and stood at eight, and you were to set it at a quarter past eleven; to do this strike your Clock gradually from eight to nine, and from nine to ten, and from ten to eleven; then, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97744:37"/>
set it at a quarter past eleven, turn it to half an hour past, and then bring it back to a quarter or the true time. The reason of this advise is, because, if you put it forward when you set the hand, it will stand still, for as long time as the shaking or playing thereof contains in time on the dial ring. I have known the hand of some Clocks and Watches, that have played forward and backward above a quarter of an hour, and so long will they stand still, and not move the needle, when they are newly set, by turning the hand forward, whereas, if according to this direction, you put it backward, it will move immediately with the rest of the work: the not understanding of this hath bread great mistakes between many a gentleman and his Watch.</p>
                           <p>Observe also to set your Watch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by one Sun-dial, because 'tis sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome known that two Sun-dials go true together; so that, if you set it sometimes by one, and sometimes by another, you will never know when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97744:37"/>
your Watch or Clock goeth right. Also observe further to set it (if po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible) always to one hour on the same dial; because many times the hour-lines give not true time alike, which, if it should thus happen, yet setting it always at one hour, will prevent all mistakes, or at least all those that are sensible.</p>

true position, which having done, let a Pendulum Clock, that keepeth true time, be (about twelve of the Clock) set exactly to it; the next morning, if the Sun shine, observe how they agree, and you shall find that at the first rising of the Sun there will be much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which will by little and little diminish, according as the Sun gets above the strength of those vapours, till at last they come exactly together, which could not be, if her altitude were not by these refractions, made apparently higher than her true place.</p>

                           <p>Since it is so that those vapors make the Sun at his rising or setting to appear higher to us than naturally she is, this must by consequence give a false shaddow on all Sun-dials, both at its rising and setting, because the hour lines drawn on Sun-dials, are designed to receive the shaddow of the Sun from its true place, and not from his appatient; and so by consequence all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97744:45"/>
Dials whatsoever cannot at those times give the true hour, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not their shaddow from the Suns true place, but from his apparient; therefore if your Watches and Clocks agree not with your Dial, you are not to conclude the fault to be in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if they have gone well before) but in the refracted shining of the Sun.</p>

                           <p>The spring is always strongest when first wound up, and weakest when returned to its natural posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from whence it happeneth that

the fuzey (by which the spring draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the work about) is made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the shape of a Counical screw, by which means this unequal draught is regulated and made alike equal; for when the spring is first wound up, and its draught strongest, there the fuzey is least, and so as the strength of the spring decreaseth, so the bigness of the fuzey increaseth, by which means the wheels move most commonly with a pretty equal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                           <p>The answer to this your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is a thing of great consequence, and deserves diligently to be enquired into: my opinion is, that the spring like a wise Master-fencer, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to himself some certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky tricks (which it's most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent observers cannot attain to the knowledge of) that so it may be able
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97744:49"/>
on occasion to give a foil to those that think themselves sufficiently able to overcome all its difficulties: Certain it is that those occult defects, which are yet remaining in the spring, are the very scourge and disgrace of Clock-makers, working those effects in the motion of Watches, which the most sound workman is not able to remedy, it being equally as unpossible to make a Watch go always true, as to have light and darkness both in the same place at the same time.</p>
                           <p>Some Watches there are that for 6 or 8 days will go indifferent right, and after that it may be check and go too slow, and another time too fast, and seldom continue in one estate of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although it have always one bent offspring; this is often remedied with a new spring, but never with the same.</p>
                           <p>Others there are that shall never go well 24 hours together, but shall either gain or lose in spite of Art.</p>
                           <p>Springs many times draw well for a time, and then faulter at last, as is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97744:49"/>
seen in many new Watches, who go well when first sold, but afterward upon settling of the spring; have moved very irregularly, which may be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by another new spring; however the Work-man is commonly on such occasions blamed, though the fault be none of his, but is rather (if in any) the fault of the spring-maker.</p>

                           <p>Either he worketh them not truly to an equal thickness, or giveth them not a true temper in all places alike, or it may be leaveth them too high, or taketh them down too low, all which may be the cause of their unpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent motion; for if they compress themselves more in one place than in another, it cannot in its extension move so free from jerking or twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as those that are compressed alike in all its parts, which illconveniencies though they many times are caused through the Spring-makers neglect, yet I date not affirm it to be always his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97744:50"/>
fault; for I believe, let them take all the care that possibly they can, yet the nature of steel is such, that it will not in all places take temper alike, which how the best work-man in this way will be able to remedy, I know not; however it is certain, that where a spring is wrought with care, let it be what steel it will, yet it must needs prove better than those that are wrought with neglect.</p>

                           <p>No, all are not, in so high a measure, for then 'twere unpossible any Watches should go true. Some are far better than others, and by chance a man may light on some that are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, but this is very rare, but for the most part, they are either more or less defective, and so by consequence those Watches that are moved by them, keep either a certain or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, according as the springs are in goodness that move them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways having consideration to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97744:50"/>
goodness of the work; from all which we may conclude that the pains and care of Watch-makers ought to be very great that bring those Movements to any true performance, and if those that buy them, were as careful to pay them for their trouble, it would in this Art produce great effects.</p>
                           <p>Let me advise all Gentlemen (and others) whose fortune it hath been to light on those Watches, that by the care of a good Workman, are brought to perform well, that they value them accordingly, and take great care that they do not by violence put them into disorder, it's possible that a Watch may go near the true time, though not set in many days, this account ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; but if it go so well as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire setting but in two or three days, this is very considerable; and where you have one that goes better you may have two that go worse; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prise these also, and account that work that performs thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be good work, and carefully finished.</p>

                           <p>As for the vibration of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulums suspended at any length, 'tis certain that the times of it, vibrations natural to any Pendulums length, are so limited and prefixed, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to make it move under any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97744:51"/>
other period than that only one, which is natural unto it, let any one try all the ways he can to encrease or decrease the frequency of its vibrations, and he shall find his labour all in vain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he encrease or decrease not the arch of its recursions; that is, that he remove it not farther or lesser from its Center of gravity, than such a certain number of degrees.</p>

                           <p>You need not have made any exception, for tis well demonstrated by one of the Ancients, that if it be removed from the Center of gravity, any number of degrees whatsoever from one to ninety, yet the number of vibrations in the same Pendulum shall not encrease or decrease: His words are these,
<q>That the Moveables that should descend along the Cords, that are Subtenses to any Arch, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily pass them all in equal times, as well the subtense under an hundred an eighty degrees (that is the whole Diameter) as the subtenses of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, sixty, ten, two, or half a degree,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97744:52"/>
four minutes: still supposing that they all determine in the lowest point touching the Horizontal plain.</q>
An effect which hath in it so much of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by how much at the first appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension one would think the contrary would follow; for the term of the beginning and end of the motion being common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the right line being the shortest that can be comprehended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the said terms, it seemeth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that the motion made by it should be finished in the shortest time, which yet is not so, but the shortest time, and consequently the swiftest motion, is that made by the Arch, of which the said right line is Cord.</p>

                           <p>But if this ancient Writer had had the same opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing these things as we have now, he would have been of another opinion: For to confute this, tryal was made by a Pendulum about seven foot long, which vibrated (by a Clock shewing secants) 41 times in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, at which time it swong or moved
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97744:52"/>
in an Arch of four inches, the same Pendulum, at 12 inches Arch vibrated but 40 ¼ the same at 10 foot Arch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated but 39 times, the same Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum at the whole Semi-arch vibrated but 37 times, so that here was four blows difference in the same Pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, when vibrating in different arches, which clearly prove that Pendulums cannot perform all its vibrations great, lesser, and least, under times precisely equal.</p>
                           <p>Besides, 'tis clearly apparent that ordinary pendulum Clocks and others, whose pendants are but short, that when through foulness or natural wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they fetch not so large a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass as when they are clean, and in order 'tis then I say apparent that their motion is swifter than at other times.</p>

From whence doth follow, that the length of the verges have to each other the the same proportion as the squares of the number of vibrations that are made in the same times have.</p>

                           <p>Then if I have rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood you, I may easily know the length of a pendulum hanging at never so great heighth, although the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime term of suspension were invisible to me, and I only saw the lower ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, for if it should be set on vibrating too and again, and a friend telling some of its recursions, and I at the same time tell the recursions of another pendulum suspended, on a verge precisely a yard long, by the numbers of the vibrations of these pendulums made in the same time: I will find the length of the pendulum whose term of suspension I know not, as for example, suppose in the time that my friend hath counted twenty recursions of the long pendulum, and I had told two hundred and forty of mine that is a yard long: squaring the two numbers of 20 and 240. which are 400 and 57600. I will say that the long string containeth 57600 of those measures of which my string containeth 400.</p>

                           <p>You are in the right, nor will you be mistaken one inch, especially if you take a great number of vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: by the same rule also you may (having the length of any one pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum from its upmost suspension to the Center of the bob, and the number of its vibrations in a minute) find out the length of a pendulum that shall vibrate any number of blows in the same time; suppose I had a pendent three foot long that vibrated 62 times in a minute, and I have occasion for to find out the length of a pendulum that shall vibrate but 20 in a minute. Do thus, square the two numbers 62 and 20, which produce 3844 and 400, now divide 3844 by 400, the quotient is 9 61/100 therefore I say that this pendulum to vibrat 20 in one minute, must be 9 61/100 times as long as my standard pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, which being 3 foot, the other will be 28 foot 8 inches long from the term of suspension to the center of the bob, and thus you may do for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatsoever, by observing what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97744:54"/>
hath been here delivered. For so often as the square of any number of vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is contained in the square of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother made in the same time, so many times must the length of that pendulum (which made the greatest square) be contained in the length of the other which made the smaller square.</p>
                           <p>By the same rule inverted, you may, by having the lengths of two pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, and the vibrations that one of them makes in a minute, find out also the times that the other shall vibrate in the same time: for if you have a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum whose number of vibrations in a minute you know already, and would know the vibrations that another pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum, which is longer, shall make in the same time: Consider how often the length of your short pendulum is contained in that longer pendulum, and so often shall the squares of that long pendulums vibrations be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the squares of those vibrations made by the short pendulum in the same time: So likewise if you have a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97744:55"/>
long pendulum whose vibrations you know, and you would know how many vibrations a pendulum that is shorter, shall make in the same time, look how much your first pendulum is longer than your short one: so many times greater must the square of your short pendulums vibrations be above those made by your longer pendulum in the same time.</p>
                           <p>Note, that great care ought to be had in taking the true length of your pendulum, from the utmost term of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension to the center of the bob, and likewise that your pendulums bobs be of an equal weight, or reduced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by rules of proportion.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97744:56"/>
which will be effected, if tortured by most quick and subtile motions; hence it happeneth that Bells, having by means of the percussion of the hammer, a trembling wrought in the minute parts, which by its quick and subtile working upon the air in the concavity of the Bell, produceth a tone or sound.</p>

                           <p>The trebbleness or baseness of tones in Bells, is from two causes; First, from the quantity of air that is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rcused or contained in the concavity of the Ball Secondly, from the quickness or slowness of the percu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. To prove this, take Bells of different greatness, but the same thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in metal, and you shall find them to produce different tones, according to the quantity of air contained in their concavities Again, take Bells of the same bredth and depth, but differing in their metal, and you shall find that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97744:56"/>
Bell whose metal is thinnest, to give the most base sound, and those that are thickest in metal, shall produce the most treble sound; for the thicker the Bell is, the more quick and sharp is the percusion of the air within it, which produceth the treble tone, but the thinner the Bell, the more weak and slow is the percusion, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its nature, produceth a more base or flat tone.</p>
                           <p>Tones are the same in Bells of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral weights, but differently majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated according to the magnitude of their bodies that produce it, for you shall have a Bell of a pound weight carry the same tone as a Bell of two or three hundred, but not in the same strength to be heard so far; so likewise it's possible that a Bell of ten pound weight may produce the same tone as a Bell of four or five thousand weight, but yet their different majoration will be according to the proportion of their metals.</p>

                           <p>Yes, 'tis certain they may; for always observe, the sharper the tone is, the farther the sound is heard, being more active and sprightly than those tones that have a more dull and solitary note; from Bells of the same weight.</p>
                           <p>From what hath been delivered, it will be worth the while to draw some heads of enquity.</p>
                           <p>First, what just proportion of air in the concavity of a Bell, shall be sufficient to produce a whole Musical tone, and what proportion will hold in every tone.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, what diminution of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in a bell of any weight, will be sufficient to make that Bell a tone more bas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe method following was many years since Compiled by Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> for the use of some Ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen his friends, who for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation at the University, studied to find out the reason and knowledge of Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, which seemed also to be a thing with which
<pb facs="tcp:97744:60"/>
Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> himself was much affected, as may in part appear by his putting out of his own Son to the same Trade, for whose use (as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) he did compile a larger tract, but what became of it cannot be known.</p>
                     <p>As for this work it self, I need not commend it, because it hath in the front Mr. <hi>Ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>'s Name, which alone is sufficient to bespeak its worth; nay, it would in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be an Injury to the fame of that excellent Author, thus to seem to argue a distrust, as if any thing that were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by him should be in it self so deficient as to borrow
<pb facs="tcp:97744:60"/>
a supply of its own praise from another's Pen.</p>
                     <p>It sufficeth me therefore to let you know 'tis his, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by himself for the same use for which it is now Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and is without doubt a work of that worthiness, that whatsoever Artist shall truly and rightly understand it, shall also gain most excellent benefit by it.</p>
                     <p>The Method it self indeed as it is by him delivered, relates only to Watches, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding may be as aptly applyed to any other number whatsoever required in the Art of Clock-work, as every ingenuous man will soon find.</p>
