            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Formerly Printed a Book of the Use of the Globes, Intituled <hi>A Tutor to Astronomy and Geography:</hi> The Book was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>William Blaew,</hi> but the Title was mine own; and therefore I hope I may be the bolder to use it when and where I list. The sale of that Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had almost perswaded me to have Printed it again: But when I considered it wanted many necessary Problemes, both in <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, Navigation. Astrology, Dyalling,</hi> and the whole <hi>Doctrine of Triangles</hi> by the Globe; And also that the Examples through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Book were made for the Citty of <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> which by the general sale of the Book I found rendred it less acceptable then it would have been if they had been made for <hi>London;</hi> And when I considered that to add so many Problemes, and alter all the Examples would both Metamorphose that Book, and be as Laborious a work to me as if I should write a new one; Then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take this Task upon me; which at length with Gods Assistance I have finished; And now expose it to thy acceptance.</p>
            <p>The Globes is the first Studie a Learner ought to undertake: for without a competent knowledge therein he will never be able to understand any Author either in <hi>Astronomy, Astrology, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> or <hi>Trigonometry:</hi> Therefore my aim hath been to make the Use of then very plain and easie to the meanest Capacities: In prosecution of which Designe, I doubt the Learneder sort may be apt to Censure me guilty of Prolixity, if not Tautology: Because the Precepts being plain, they may account some of the Examples Useless. But I desire them to consider that I write not to expert Practitioners, but to Learners; to whom Examples may prove more Instructive then Precepts. Besides, I hope to encourage those by an ample liberal plainness to fall in love with these Studies, that formerly have been disheartned by the Crabbed brevity of those Authors that have (in Characters as it were) rather writ Notes for their own Memories, then sufficient Documents for their Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Instructions.</p>

The Globes for which this Book is written are the Globes I set forth about four years ago: which as I told you in my Epistle to the Reader of <hi>Blaew's</hi> Book differs somewhat from other Globes, and that both the <hi>Coelestial</hi> and the <hi>Terrestrial;</hi> mine being the latest done of any, and to the accomplishing of which, I have not only had the help of all or most of the best of other Globes, Maps, Plats; and Sea-drafts, of New Discoveries that were then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, for the <hi>Terrestrial Globe,</hi> but also the Advice and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of divers learned and able Mathematicians both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> for Tables and Calculations both of Lines and Stars for the <hi>Coelestial:</hi> upon which Globe I have placed every Star that was observed by <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> one degree of Longitude far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Ecliptick then they are on any other Globes: So that whereas on other Globes the places of the Stars were correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with their places in Heaven 58. Years ago, when <hi>Tycho</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them, and therefore according to his Rule want about 47. minutes of their true places in Heaven at this Time: I have set every Star one degree farther in the Ecliptick, and Rectified them on the Globe according to the true place they will have in Heaven in the Year 1671.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Terrestrial Globe</hi> I have inserted all the New Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that have been made, either by our own or Forraigne Navigators, and that both in the East, West, North, and South, parts of the Earth. In the <hi>East Indies</hi> we have by these later Times many spacious Places discovered, many Ilands inserted, and generally the whole Draft of the Country rectified and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, even to the Coast of <hi>China, Japan, Giloli,</hi> &amp;c. In the <hi>South Sea</hi> between the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies</hi> are scattered many Ilands, which for the uncertain knowledge former Times had of them are either wholely left out of other Globes, or else laid down so erroneously that little of credit can be attributed unto them: <hi>California</hi> is found to be an Iland, though formerly supposed to be part of the main Continent, whose North West shoar was imagined to thrust it self forth close to the Coasts of <hi>Cathaio,</hi> and so make the supposed <hi>Straits of Anian.</hi> The Western Shoars of the <hi>West Indies</hi> are more accurately discribed then formerly, as you may see if you compare my Terrestrial Globe with the Journals of the latest Navigators: And if you compare them with other Globes you will find 5, 6, yea 7, degrees difference in Longitude, in most Places of these Coasts. <hi>Magellanica</hi> which heretofore was thought
<pb facs="tcp:62439:3"/>
to be part of the South Continent called <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so found to be an Iland. All that Track of Land called <hi>Terra In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita</hi> I have purposely omitted, because as yet we have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty whether it be Sea or Land, unless it be of some parts lately found out by the Dutch; who having a convenient Port at <hi>Bantam</hi> in <hi>Java,</hi> have from thence sent forth Ships Southwards, where they have found several very large Countries; one whereof they have called <hi>Hollandia Nova,</hi> another <hi>Zelandia Nova,</hi> another <hi>Anthoni van Diemans</hi> Land; and divers others; some whereof lies near our <hi>Antipodes;</hi> as you may see by my Terrestrial Globe. Again, Far to the Northwards there are some New Discoveries, even within 6. degrees of the Pole: The Drafts to the <hi>North Eastwards</hi> I have laid down even as they were discribed by the Searchers of these Parts, for a Passage into the <hi>East Indies.</hi> And also the Discoveries of <hi>Baffin,</hi> Capt. <hi>James,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Fox,</hi> (our own Country men that attempted the finding a passage that way into the South Sea.</p>
            <p>I also told you what difference there is in several Authors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout placing their first Meridian, which is the beginning of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude; that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> placed it at the <hi>Fortunate Ilands,</hi> which Mr <hi>Hues pag. 4. chap 1.</hi> in his Treatise of Globes proves to be the Ilands of <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> and not those now called the <hi>Canary Ilands;</hi> because in his Time they were the furthest Places of the Discovered World towards the Setting of the Sun: Others placed it at <hi>Pico</hi> in <hi>Teneriffa;</hi> Others at <hi>Corvus</hi> and <hi>Flora;</hi> because under that Meridian the Compass had no <hi>Variation,</hi> but did then duely respect the North and South; Others for the same Reason began their Longitude at St <hi>Michaels;</hi> and others between the Ilands of <hi>Flores</hi> and <hi>Fayal:</hi> And the Spaniards of late by reason of their great Negotiation in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> have begun their Longitude at <hi>Toledo</hi> there, and contrary to all others account it Westwards.</p>
            <p>Therefore I seeing such diversity among all Nations, and as yet a Uniformity at home, chose with our own Country men to place my First Meridian at the Ile <hi>Gratiosa,</hi> one of the Iles of the <hi>Azores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the different placing of this first Meridian it comes to pass that the Longitude of places are diversly set down in different Tables: For those Globes or Maps that have their first Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an placed to the Eastwards of <hi>Gratiosa</hi> have all places counted Eastward between the first Mertdian and the Meridian of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosa</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62439:4"/>
in fewer degrees of Longitude: And those Globes and Maps that have their first Meridian placed to the Westwards, have all Places counted Eastwards from the Meridian of <hi>Gratiosa</hi> and their first Meridian in a greater number of degrees of Longitude, and that according as the Arch of Difference is.</p>
            <p>I have annexed a smal Collection out of Dr <hi>Hood,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Re son why such strange Figures and Forms are pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Caelestial Globe: and withall the Poetical Stories of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every Constellation.</p>
            <p>I also thought good to add at the latter end of this Book a smal Treatise, intituled <hi>The Antiquity, Progress, and Augmentation of Astronomy.</hi> I may without Partiallity give it the Encomium of a Pithy, Pleasant, and Methodical peece: It was written by a Learned Author; and is worthy the Perusal of all Ingenuous Lovers of these Studies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THe Students of all Arts and Sciences have ever proposed a Maxime, whereon (as on an allowed Truth) the whole Science hath dependance: and by so much the more demonstrable that Maxime is, so much the more of Excellency the Science may claim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This of</hi> Astronomy <hi>and</hi> Geography <hi>comes not behind any; for herein we shall only admit (with the Ancients) that the Form of the visible World is</hi> Spherical: <hi>Neither shall we beg our Ascertion any farther then</hi> Occular <hi>Appearance will demonstrate: every Mans Ey being his Judge, if he be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a Plain field, or at Sea, where nothing can hinder a free inspection of the</hi> Horizon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon good grounds therefore they ascerted the Spherical form of the Whole: and also concluded the Parts to be Round: I meane, very intire Subsistence, as the</hi> Stars, Planets, <hi>and the</hi> Earth. <hi>In the</hi> Celestial Bodies <hi>(as the</hi> Stars <hi>and</hi> Planets) <hi>this is also visible; and therefore un-controullable: But that the Earth is Round proves with the unskilfull matter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62439:9"/>
they frequently objecting with S.</hi> Austine <hi>the words of the Scripture, which say,</hi> He hath stretched forth the corners of the Earth; <hi>not considering whether those words were spoken as alluding to the amplitude of Gods Omnipotence; or that the Corners were meant</hi> Capes <hi>of</hi> Land, <hi>which indeed are stretched forth into the Sea. But that the Earth is Round is proved by divers certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Reasons,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As first, By the Navigations of our Age, Divers able and honest Mariners having Sailed and continued an Easterly Course, have at length arrived (without turning back) to the same place from whence they set forth: witness</hi> Magellani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, <hi>Sr.</hi> Francis Drake, Tho. Cavendish, Oliver van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Noort, W. Schouten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, By the length of degrees in every Parallel; for it is found by Dayly observation that the degrees of every Parallel upon the Earth, hold the same proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Equinoctial, as the degrees of the same Parallel upon an Artificial Globe or Sphear do to the degrees of the greatest Circle of the same: This Argument alone is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: yet take one more from Visible Appearance: And that is this: The shadow which the Earth and Water together make in the Eclipse of the Moon is alwaies a part of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; therefore the Earth and Water which is the Body sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing must also be a Circular or round Body; for if it were three square, four square, or any other form, then would the shadow which it makes in the Moon be of the same fashion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides, Of all figures the Sphear or Globe is most perfect, most Capacious, and most intire of it self, without either joynts or Angles; which form we may also perceive the</hi> Sun, Moon, <hi>and</hi> Stars <hi>to have, and all other things that are bounded by themselves, as Drops of Water, and other liquid things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is another frequent Argument against the Globulus form of the Earth; and that is, That it seems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible

that the Earth should be round, and yet also Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all Places: For though we that inhabite on the top of the Earth go with our heads upwards; yet those that inhabite underneath us must needs go with their Heads downwards, like Flyes on a Wall or Ceeling; and so be in danger of falling into the</hi> Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Answer hereunto, first, You must understand that in the Center of the Earth there is an Attractive and drawing power, which draws all heavy substances to it: by vertue of which Attractive power, things though loosed from the Earth will again incline and cling to the Earth, and so much the more forcibly, by how much the heavier they are; as a bullet of Lead let fall out of the Air, inclines towards the Earth far more violently and swiftly then a bullet of the same bigness of Wood, or Cork.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, you must understand that in respect of the whole Vniverse there is no part either upper or under, but all parts of the Earth are alike incompast with Heaven; yet in respect of the Earth, it is Heaven, which we take for the upper part; and therefore we are said to go with our heads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, because our head (of all the parts of our body) is nearest to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now that this Attractive power lies in the Center of the Earth, is proved by this Argument: If the Attractive power were not in the Center, a Plumb-line let fall would not make Right Angles with the Superficies of the Earth; but would eb Attracted that way the Attractive vertue lies, and so make unequal Angles with the Superficies: But by so many Experiments as hath yet been made, we find that a Plumb-line continued, though never so deep, yet it alters no Angles with the Superficies of the Earth; and therefore undoubtedly the Attractive power lies in the very Center, and no where else.</hi>

                  <p>Every Globe is hung by the <hi>Axis</hi> at both the Poles in a Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Meridian, which is divided into 360, degrees; (or which is all one) into 4 Nineties: the first beginning at the North Pole, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from the left hand towards the right till the termination of 90 degrees, and is marked with 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. to 90. from whence the degrees are numbred with 80, 70, 60, &amp;c. to 0. which is in the South Pole: from whence again the degrees are numbred

                  <p>This Brasen Meridian is of great use; for by help of it you may find the Latitude of all Places, the Declination of all the Stars, &amp;c, and rectifie the Globe to any Latitude.</p>

                  <p>The Horizon is a broad wooden Circle, encompassing the Globe; having two notches in it; the one in the North the other in the South point: The notches are made just fit to contain the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Meridian that the Globe is hung in: In the bottom or under Plane of the Horizon there stands up a rop or (as it is called) a <hi>Bed,</hi> in which there is also a notch, into which notch the Brasen Meridian is also let, so lo, as that both it and the Globe may be divided into two equal halfs by the upper Plane of the wooden Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon. These Notches are as gages to keep the Globe from inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more to the one side of the wooden Horizon then the other.</p>
                  <p>Upon the upper Plane of the Horizon is several Circles delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as first, the inner Circle, which is a Circle divided into twelve equal parts, <hi>viz.</hi> into twelve <hi>Signes;</hi> every Signe having its name prefixed to it; as to the Signe of ♈ is the word <hi>Aries;</hi> to ♉ the word <hi>Taurus,</hi> &amp;c. every Signe is again divided into 30 equal parts, which are called Degrees, and every tenth degree is marked with 10, 20, 30.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Circle of Signes is a Kalender or Almanack, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Old stile used by us here in <hi>England,</hi> each Moneth being noted with its proper Name; as <hi>January, February, March, &amp;c.</hi> and every day distinguished with Arithmetical figures, as 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. to the end of the Moneth.</p>
                  <p>The other Calender is a Calender of the New stile; which is in a manner all one with the Old; only in this Calender the moneth begins ten daies sooner then they do in the other: and to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender (because it was instituted by the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> there is annexed the Festival daies Celebrated by the Romish Church.</p>
                  <p>The two other Circles are the Circles of the Winds; the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most having their Greek and Latine names; which by them were but twelve; and the outermost having the English Nanes, which for more preciseness are two and thirty.</p>
                  <p>The use of the upper Plane of the Horizon is to distinguish the Day from the Night; the Rising and Setting of the Sun, Moon, or

Upon this Circle the Longitude is numbred, from East to West: and from this Circle both waies, <hi>viz.</hi> North and South the Latitude is reckoned. It is called the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, because when the Sun comes to this line (which is twice in one year, to wit, on the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> and the eleventh

                  <p>There are infinite of Meridians, for all places lying East or West from one another have several Meridians; but the Meridians deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated upon the Terrestrial Globe are in number 36. so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Meridians is contained ten degrees of the Equator.

                  <p>They are called Meridians, because they divide the Day into two equal parts: for when the Sun comes to the Meridian of any Place, it is then Midday, or full Noon.</p>

                  <p>As the Meridians are infinite, so are the Parallels; and as the Meridian lines delineated upon the Globe are drawn through no more then every tenth degree of the Equator, so are the Parallels also delineated but upon every tenth degree of the Meridian; lest the Globe should be too much filled with superfluity of lines, which might obscure the smal names of Places. The Parallel Circles run East and West round about the Globe, even as the Equator; only the Equator is a great Circle; and these are every one less then other, diminishing gradually till they end in the Pole. The Parallels are numbred upon the Meridian with 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. to 90. beginning in the Equator, and ending in the Pole.</p>
                  <p>They are called Parallels; because they are Parallel to the Equator.</p>

They represent the 32 winds of the Compass.</p>
                  <p>Their use is to shew the bearing of any two places one from another: that is to say, upon what point of the Compass any shoar or Land lies from another.</p>
                  <p>There are many of them described upon the Globe, for the better directing the ey from one shoar to the other, when you seek after the bearing of any two Lands.

                  <p>There hath bin attributed to the eighth Sphear a twofold mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the one called its <hi>Diurnal Motion,</hi> which is made from East to West upon the Poles and Axis of the World: And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called its <hi>Second motion;</hi> which is made from West to East upon the Poles and Axis of the Ecliptick.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diurnal motion</hi> is caused by the violent Motion of the

It is called the <hi>Diurnal Motion</hi> because it is finished in one Day.</p>
                  <p>The second Motion is unproperly attributed to the eighth Sphear; it being indeed the Motion of the Equinoctiall; tho Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors sometimes carelesly mention the one insteed of the other. Therefore in the next Section, where I treat of the Equinoctial, I shall at large explain unto you the nature of this mis-called <hi>Second Motion.</hi>

                  <p>The Equinoctial upon the Celestial Globe, is the same line formerly called the Equator upon the Terrestrial; only with this difference, that the Equator remains fixt upon the Terrestrial Globe, but the Equinoctial upon the Celestial Globe is moveable; (or at least must be imagined to move) contrary to the <hi>Diurnal motion</hi> from West to East, upon the Poles of the Ecliptick: I say imagined to move, because in the Heavens it doth really move, tho on a material Globe it would be inconvenient to make a moveable Equinoctial, and therefore it hath one fixed: which for this and the next age will sufficiently serve, without much devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the truth it self.</p>
                  <p>Now that the difference between the Equator upon the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe, and the Equinoctial upon the Celestial, may be proved; and the motion of the Equinoctial be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; I shall only bring this example,</p>
                  <p>All places that were formerly under the Equator, do and will keep the same Longitude, and remain still under the Equator: as may be proved by comparing the Ancient and modern <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> together: but those Stars that were formerly under the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial, do not keep the same Longitude, nor remain under the Equinoctial: because the Equinoctial (as aforesaid) hath a motion from West to East, upon the Poles of the Ecliptick. But the Stars being fixed in their one Sphear, like knots in wood, and therefore move not, are by the Precession of the Equinox left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Equinoctial Colure, and so are caused to alter their Longitude; as by comparing the Observations of ancient and modern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

years before Christ, the first Star in the <hi>Rams horn</hi> was by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Astronomers observed to be in the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Colure: and 57 years ago, when <hi>Tycho</hi> observed, it was found to be in 27 degrees 37 minutes of ♈.

                     <hi>X</hi> Of the <hi>Images</hi> called <hi>Constellations,</hi> drawn upon the Celestial Globe.</head>
                  <p>Here I think fit to be beholding to Dr. <hi>Hood.</hi> for the paines he hath taken in his comment upon the <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Constelations.</hi> He saith, The stars are brought into Constellations, for instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake: things cannot be taught without names, to give a name to every star had been troublesome to the Master, and for the Scholler; for the Master to devise, and for the Scholler to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: and therefore the Astronomers have reduced many stars into one Constellation, that thereby they may tell the better where to seek them; and being sought, how to express them.</p>
                  <p>All the Constellations formerly notified by the Antients were in number 48. twelve whereof we call the twelve Signes of the Zodiack, <hi>viz. 1 Aries, ♈. 2 Taurus, ♉. 3 Gemini, ♊. 4 Cancer, ♋. 5 Leo, ♌. 6 Uirgo, ♍. 7 Libra, ♎. 8 Scorpio, ♏. 9 Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius, ♐. 10 Capricorn, ♑. 11 Aquarius, ♒. 12 Pisces.</hi> ♓. One and twenty more are Placed in the North Hemisphear, and are called 1 <hi>Ursa minor, 2 Ursa Major, 3 Draco, 4 Cepheus, 5 Bootes, 6 Corona Septentri, 7 Hercules, 8 Lyra, 9 Cygnus, 10 Cassiopeia, 11 Perseus, 12 Auriga, 13 Serpentarius, 14 Serpens Ophiuchi, 15 Sagitta, 16 Aquila, 17 Delphinus, 18 Equiculus, 19 Pegasus, 20 Andromeda, 21 Triangulum.</hi> The other 15 are scituated in the South Hemisphear, and called 1 <hi>Cetus, 2 Orion, 3 Eridanus, 4 Lepus, 5 Canis Major, 6 Canicula, 7 Argo Navis, 8 Hydra, 9 Crater, 10 Corvus, 11 Centaurus, 12 Lupus, 13 Ara, 14 Corona Austrina, 15 Pisces Austrina.</hi> Besides there are 2 other Constellations in the North Hemisphear, <hi>viz. Antinous,</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62439:17"/>
and <hi>Coma Berenices:</hi> which because they were not specified by the Ancients are here inserted apart.</p>
                  <p>Now the Astronomers did bring them into these figures, and not into other, being moved therto by these three reasons: first these Figures express some properties of the stars that are in them; as those of the <hi>Ram</hi> to bee hot and dry; <hi>Andromeda</hi> chained, betokeneth imprisonment: the head of <hi>Medusa</hi> cut off, signifieth the loss of that part: <hi>Orion</hi> with his terrible and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gesture, importeth tempest, and terrible effects: The <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> signifie poyson: The <hi>Bull,</hi> insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth a melancholy passion: The <hi>Bear</hi> inferreth cruelty, &amp;c. Secondly, the stars, (if not precisely yet after a sort) do represent such a Figure, and therefore that Figure was assigned them: as for example, the <hi>Crown,</hi> both North, and South; the <hi>Scorpion</hi> and the <hi>Triangle,</hi> represent the Figure which they have. The third cause, was the continuance of the memorie of some notable men, who either in regard of their singular paines taken in Astronomy, or in regard of some other notable deed, had well deserved of man kind.</p>
                  <p>The first Author of every particular Constellation is uncertain; yet are they of great antiquity; we receive them from <hi>Ptolomte,</hi> and he followed the <hi>Platonicks;</hi> so that their antiquity is great. Moreover we may perceive them to be ancient by the Sciptures; and by the Poets. In the 38 Chapter of <hi>Job</hi> there is mention made of the <hi>Pleiades, Orion,</hi> and <hi>Arcturus,</hi> and <hi>Mazzaroth,</hi> which some interpret the 12 Signes: <hi>Job</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Syderocrates</hi> maketh mention in his Book <hi>de Commensurandis locorum distantiis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now besides all this, touching the reason of the invention of these Constellations, the Poets had this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to make men fall in love with Astronomy: And to that intent have to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Costellation invented strange conceited stories, (as you may read at the latter end of this Book) therein imitating <hi>Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi> who when he could not get the people of <hi>Athens</hi> to hear him in a matter of great moment, and profitable for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom-wealth, he began to tell them a tale of a fellow that sold an Ass; by the which tale, he so brought on the Athenians, that they were both willing to hear his whole Oration, and to put in practice that whereto he exhorted them. The like intent had the Poets in of those Stories: They saw that Astronomy being for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62439:17"/>
commodity singular in the life of man, was almost of all men ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglected: Hereupon they began to set forth that Art under Fictions; that thereby, such as could not be perswaded by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, might by the pleasure be induced to take a view of these matters: and thereby at length fall in love with them. For commonly you shall note this, that he that is ready to read the Stories, cannot content himself therewith, but desireth also to know the Constellation, or at leastwise some principal Star therein.</p>

                  <p>Although in Heaven there be a very great number of visible Stars, which for their multitude seem innumerable; yet no wise man will from thence infer that they are impossible to be counted: for there is no Star in Heaven that may be seen, but its Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Latitude may with meet Instruments for that purpose be exactly found; and being once found, it may have a name allotted it, which with its Longitude and Latitude may be Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized either for the memory of the Observer, or the knowledge of Posterity. Now therefore if any one Star may be observed, they may all be observed; and then may they all have Names given them; which tho to the ignorant it seem uncredible, yet to the sons of God, (as <hi>Josephus</hi> call Astronomers) who herein participate of their fathers knowledge, it is easie to <hi>number the Stars, and call them all by their Names Psal.</hi> 97, 4.</p>
                  <p>But tho all the Stars in Heaven may be numbred and named, yet have not the Ancient Astronomers thought fit to take notice of more then 1025 of the chiefest that are visible in our Horizon, they being sufficient for any purpose that we shall have occasion to apply them unto. Yet of late the industry of <hi>Frederick Hout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

aforesaid, hath added to the Catalogue 136 Stars, with their Longitude Latitude and Magnitude, and given Names unto them: which upon my New Globes I have also ascerted, as may be seen about the South Pole thereof. So that with these 1025, observed by the Ancients, and these 136, the whole number of the Catalogue is 1161.</p>

So the Longitude of any Star upon the Celestial Globe is an Arch of the Ecliptick, contained between the first point of ♈ and the Star inquired after. But yet because the Ecliptick is divided into twelve Signes, the Longitude of a Star is therefore (in the most Customary account) an Arch of the Ecliptick comprehended between the Semi-circle of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude passing through the beginning of the Signe the Star is in, and the Semi-circle of Longitude passing through the Center of the Star.</p>
                  <p>The Latitude of a Star is either North or South: North, if on <note place="margin">Latitude of the Stars</note> the North side of the Ecliptick; South, if on the South side of the Ecliptick.

                  <p>This subject because it is already so fully handled by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hood,</hi> that more then he hath written cannot well be said, either of his own oppinion or other mens, I think fit therefore to give you his own words: which are as follow.</p>
                  <p>VIA LACTEA<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>Circulus Lacteus;</hi> by the Latines so called; and by the Greekes, <hi>Galaxia;</hi> and by the English, the <hi>Milky way.</hi> It is a broad white Circle that is seen in the Heaven: In the North Hemisphear, it beginneth at <hi>Cancer,</hi> on each side the head thereof, and passeth by <hi>Auriga,</hi> by <hi>Perseus,</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62439:20"/>
and <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> and the head of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the tayl of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and the feet of <hi>Centaur, Argo</hi> the <hi>Ship,</hi> and so unto the head of <hi>Cancer.</hi> Some in a sporting manner, do call it <hi>Watling street;</hi> but why they call it so, I cannot tell; except it be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the narrowness that it seemeth to have, or else in respect of that great High way that lieth between <hi>Dover</hi> and S. <hi>Albons,</hi> which is called by our men <hi>Watling street.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning this Circle there are sundry opinions: for there is great difference among some writers, both touching the place, matter, and efficient cause thereof. <hi>Aristotle</hi> dissenteth from all other, both Philosophers and Poets, in the place, matter, and cause of this Circle; saying, that it is a Meteor ingendred in the Air, made of the vapors of the earth, drawn up thither by the heat of the Sun, and there set on fire. But his opinion is of all men confuted.</p>
                  <p>First, touching the place, it cannot be in the Air; for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in the Air, is not seen of all men, at all times, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one and the same part of Heaven. If we see it in the South, they that are in the West shall see it under the East side of the Heaven; and they that are in the East, shall see it in the West part of the Heaven; but this Circle is of all men seen alwaies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same part of Heaven, and to be joyned with the same Stars; therefore it cannot be in the Air.</p>
                  <p>Again, for the matter, it cannot be made of that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> nameth <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the vapours of the earth, because of the long continuance of the thing, and that without any alteration: for it is impossible that any Meteor made of vapours drawn up from the water, or exhalations from the earth, should last so long; as may be seen in blazing Stars; which though they have continued long, as namely, 16. moneths, some more, some less; yet at the length they have vanished away: whereas this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle hath continued from the beginning unto this day. Besides, put case it were made of these exhalations, Whence will they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the uniformity thereof? The Comets do alter diversly, both in the fashion of their blazing, and also in their several quantities; whereas in this Circle, there is nothing but the same part, alwaies of one form and of one bigness. In the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cient cause therefore he must needs err: for if it be neither in the Air, nor made of the exhalations of the earth, it cannot be caused by the Sun; for the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62439:20"/>
one is the place and the other the matter, wherein, and whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sun sheweth his power.</p>
                  <p>All other, (besides <hi>Aristotle)</hi> agree in the place, but dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er in the efficient cause thereof: and they are either Philosophers, or Poets. Both these affirm that it is in the Firmament <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the eight Sphear; but they disagree in the cause thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Philosophers (and chiefely <hi>Demecritus)</hi> affirm the cause of the thing, to be the exceeding great number of Stars in that part of Heaven, whose beams meeting together so confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not coming distinctly to the ey, causeth us to imagine such a whiteness as is seen. But the best opinion is this, that this <hi>Milky way</hi> is a part of the Firmament, neither so thin as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts thereof are, not yet so thick as the Stars themselves. If it were as thin as the other parts of the Heaven besides the Stars, then could it not retain the light, but the light would pass through it and not be seen: If it were as thick as the Stars, then would the light be so doubled in it, that it would glister and shine, as the Stars themselves do: but being neither so thin as the one, nor so thick as the other, it becommeth of that whiteness we see.</p>

                        </gap>u</hi> saith, This <hi>Lactean</hi> whiteness and clearness ariseth from a great number of little Stars, constipated in that part of Heaven: flying so swiftly from the sight of our eyes, that we can perceive nothing but a confused light: this the <hi>Tubus Diopticus</hi> (more lately found out) doth evidently demonstrate to us: by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which little Stars (otherwise inconspicuous to our eyes) are there clearly discerned.</p>
                  <p>About the Southern Pole are seen two white spots, like little clouds, colured like the <hi>via Lactea.</hi> One of which is trebble the Latitude of the other; some Mariners call them <hi>Nubecula Magellani.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Milkie way</hi> is discribed on the Globe between two tracks of smal Pricks, running through the Images mentioned in the beginning of this Section.</p>
                  <p>Thus have you the definition of the Globes; with the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the lines, Circles, &amp;c. described thereon. I shall now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain unto you the meaning of Several words of Art, which in the use of them you will meet with, and then come to the Use it self.</p>
                  <p>And first, what is meant by the word <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62439:21"/>
When I spake of the <hi>Horizon</hi> before, I only mentioned the wooden <hi>Horizon</hi> or frame about the Globe; which because it represents the <hi>Mathematical Horizon,</hi> is therefore called the <hi>Horizon:</hi> but the word <hi>Horizon</hi> is to be considered more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, two manner of waies: as</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>Natural Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Mathematical Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Natural Horizon</hi> is that Appearent Circle which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Visible part of Heaven from the invissible; it extends it self in a straight line from the Superficies of the Earth, every way round about the place you stand upon, even into the very Circumference of the Heavens. It is onley discerned at Sea, or on plaine ground, that is free from all hinderances of the sight as Hills, Trees, Houses, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mathematical Horizon</hi> (which indeed is meant in this Treatise, so oft as I shall have occasion to name the word <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon)</hi> is a great Circle which divides that part of Heaven which is above us, from that which is under us, precisely into two equal parts: whose <hi>Poles</hi> are the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir.</hi> In this Circle the <hi>Azimuths</hi> or <hi>Verticle Circles</hi> are numbred: and by this Circle our Daies and Nights are measured out unto us: for while the Sun is above the <hi>Horizon</hi> it is day; and when it is under the <hi>Horizon</hi> it is Night.</p>
                  <p>This Circle is represented unto us by the upper Plain of the wooden <hi>Horizon:</hi> Therefore so oft as you are directed to bring any degree or Star &amp;c. to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> it must be understood that you must turn the Globe till the degree or Star come just to the upper inner edge of the wooden <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Zenith,</hi> and <hi>Nadir,</hi> are two points opposite to one another. The <hi>Zenith</hi> is that point in Heaven which is directly over our <note place="margin">Zenith.</note> Heads: and the <hi>Nadir</hi> is that point in Heaven which is directly <note place="margin">Nadir.</note> under our feet.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Azimuths</hi> or <hi>Verticle Circles</hi> are great Circles passing through the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and <hi>Nadir,</hi> whose <hi>Poles</hi> are the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <note place="margin">Azimuths, <hi>or</hi> Verticle Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> 
                     <hi>Nadir.</hi> And as the <hi>Meridians</hi> cut the <hi>Equator,</hi> and all <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels</hi> to the <hi>Equator</hi> at Right Angles, so the <hi>Azimuths</hi> cut the <hi>Horizon</hi> and all <hi>Almicanthars</hi> at Right Angles also. The <hi>Azimuths</hi> (as the <hi>Meridians)</hi> are infinite; and are numbred by degrees from the East and West point towards the North and South in the Horizon: as also is the <hi>Amplitude.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62439:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The <hi>Almicanthars</hi> are Circles Parallel to the Horizon, <note place="margin">Almicanthars, <hi>or</hi> Circles of Altitude.</note> whose Poles are the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir.</hi> They are also called <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Altitude,</hi> because when the Sun Moon or any Star, is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny number of degrees above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> it is said to have so many degrees of <hi>Altitude,</hi> which degrees of <hi>Altitude</hi> are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred upon the <hi>Verticle Circle</hi> from the <hi>Horizon</hi> upwards, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Zenith.</hi> The <hi>Almicanthars</hi> are also infinite: as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels, Meridians</hi> and <hi>Azimuths</hi> are.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Amplitude</hi> is the number of degrees contained between <note place="margin">Amplitude.</note> the true East or West point in the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and the rising or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sun, Moon, or Stars. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Declination</hi> is the number of degrees that the Sun, Moon, <note place="margin">Declination.</note> or any Star, is distant from the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> towards either <hi>Pole:</hi> and hath a double Denomination, <hi>viz. North Declination,</hi> and <hi>South Declination:</hi> for if the Sun Moon or Star swarve towards the North <hi>Pole,</hi> they are said to have <hi>North Declination;</hi> if to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South Pole, <hi>South Declination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Right Ascension</hi> is the number of degrees of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> (accounted from the first point of <hi>Aries)</hi> which comes <note place="margin">Right Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> to the <hi>Meridian</hi> with the Sun Moon or Star, or any other point in <hi>Heaven</hi> proposed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Oblique Ascension</hi> is the number of degrees of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Zone</hi> is a space of Earth contained between two Parrallels. <note place="margin">Zone.</note> The ancient <hi>Geographers</hi> made five <hi>Zones</hi> in the <hi>Earth.</hi> Two <hi>Frozen,</hi> Two <hi>Temperate,</hi> and one <hi>Burnt Zone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62439:22"/>
The two <hi>Frozen Zones</hi> are those parts of the <hi>Globe,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <note place="margin">Frozen Zones.</note> between the North Pole and the <hi>Arctick Circle,</hi> and the South Pole and the <hi>Antarctick Circle;</hi> by the Ancients called inhabitable; because the Sun being alwaies far remote from them, shoots its beams <hi>Obliquely</hi> upon them, which <hi>Oblique</hi> beams are so very weak, that all their Summer is but a continued Winter, and the Winter (as they thought impossible to be at all indured.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Temperate Zones</hi> are the space of <hi>Earth</hi> contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Arctick Circle</hi> and the <hi>Tropick</hi> of ♋, and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarctick</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Temperate Zones.</note> 
                     <hi>Circle</hi> and the <hi>Tropick</hi> of ♑: by the Ancients called <hi>Temperate</hi> and Habitable; because they are composed of a sweet Mediocrity, between outragious Heat and extremity of Cold.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Burnt Zone</hi> is the space of <hi>Earth</hi> contained between the <hi>Tropick</hi> of ♋, and the <hi>Tropick</hi> of ♑, called by the Ancients <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Burnt Zone.</note> because in regard the Sun never moves out of this <hi>Zone</hi> but darts its Beames perpendicularly upon it, they imagined the <hi>Air</hi> was so unsufferable <hi>Hot,</hi> that it was impossible for any to inhabite in this <hi>Zone.</hi> So that as you see they held the two <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Zones</hi> only habitable; and the two <hi>Frozen Zones</hi> and one <hi>Burnt Zone,</hi> altogether unpossible to be inhabited. But their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors either animated by industry, or compeld by necessity, have apparently confuted that Assertion; for at this time many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands can witness that their bloods are not so greasie as to be melted in the Scortching heat of the one, or so watry as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed in the Icy frosts of the other.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients have yet otherwise divided the <hi>Earth</hi> into four and twenty <hi>Northern Climates,</hi> and four and twenty <hi>Southern</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Climates.</note> 
                     <hi>Climates:</hi> so that in all there is eight and forty <hi>Climates.</hi> The <hi>Climates</hi> are altered according to the half hourly increasing of the longest daies; for in the Latitude where the longest daies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased half an hour longer then they are at the Equator <hi>(viz.</hi> longer then 12 hours) the first <hi>Climate</hi> begins; and in the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude where they are increased an whole hour longer then in the Equator, the second <hi>Climate</hi> begins; where the daies are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed three half hours longer then in the Equator, the third <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> begins; and so onwards, the <hi>Climates</hi> alter according as the longest day increases half an hour, till you come to find the longest day 24 hours long</p>
                  <p>Now the Ancients (in those times) knowing no more then nine Habitable <hi>Climates,</hi> gave names only to nine. The first
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62439:22"/>
they called <hi>Dia Meroes,</hi> after the name of a famous <hi>Inland Iland,</hi> which is scituate about the middle of that <hi>Climate,</hi> and is now called <hi>Gueguere.</hi> The second <hi>Climate</hi> they called <hi>Dia Syenes,</hi> after the name of an eminent <hi>Citty in Egypt,</hi> lying about the midst of that <hi>Climate.</hi> The third <hi>Dia Alexanderas,</hi> after the name of the <hi>Metropolitan Citty</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The fourth <hi>Dia Rhodes.</hi> The fifth <hi>Dia Romes.</hi> The sixth <hi>Dia Ponton.</hi> The seventh <hi>Dia Boristheneos,</hi> The eighth <hi>Dia Ripheos.</hi> The ninth <hi>Dia Daniam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These names belong only to the <hi>Climates</hi> on the North side of the Equator. But those on the South side (in regard of the smal Discoveries those Ages had on that side the Equator) were distinguisht only by the addition of the word <hi>Anti,</hi> to the same <hi>Southerly Climate:</hi> as the first <hi>Southern Climate</hi> (which is that <hi>Climate</hi> that lies as many degrees to the South-ward as the first doth to the North-ward) they called <hi>Anti Meroes.</hi> The second <hi>Anti Syenes.</hi> The third <hi>Anti Alexanderas:</hi> and so on to the ninth.</p>
                  <p>In every <hi>Climate</hi> is included two Parallels, which are of the <note place="margin">Parallels.</note> same nature with the <hi>Climates,</hi> save only that as the <hi>Climates</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the half hourly increasing of the longest day, the <hi>Parallels</hi> alter by the quarter hourly increasing of the longest day.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in respect of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> we find the <hi>Sphear</hi> constituted into a threefold Position: as first, into a <hi>Direct Sphear,</hi> Secondly, a <hi>Parallel Sphear,</hi> Thirdly, an <hi>Oblique Sphear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Direct Sphear</hi> hath both the Poles of the World in the <note place="margin">Direct Sphear.</note> 
                     <hi>Horizon,</hi> and the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> transiting the <hi>Zenith.</hi> In a <hi>Direct Sphear</hi> all the <hi>Circles Parallel</hi> to the Equator make right angles with the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and are also divided into two equal parts by the <hi>Horizon:</hi> and in a <hi>Direct Sphear</hi> the Sun Moon and Stars are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies twelve hours above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and twelve hours under the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and consequently make twelve hours <hi>Day,</hi> and twelve hours <hi>Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is called a <hi>Direct Sphear</hi> because all the <hi>Celestial Bodies,</hi> as Sun Moon and Stars &amp;c. by the <hi>Diurnal Motion</hi> of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> ascend directly above, and descend directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that inhabite under the Equator have the <hi>Sphear</hi> thus posited; as in the <hi>Iland Borneo, Sumaira, Celebes,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> a great part of <hi>Africk, Peru</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies:</hi> &amp;c. as you may

                  <p>In a <hi>Parallel Sphear</hi> all the <hi>Circles Parallel</hi> to the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> are also <hi>Parallel</hi> to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and in a <hi>Parallel Sphear</hi> from the 10th of <hi>March</hi> to the 11th of <hi>September</hi> (the Sun being then in the <hi>Northorly Signes</hi> and consequently on the North side the <hi>Horizon)</hi> there is six Moneths Day in the North, and six Moneths Night in the South: and contrarily from the 11th of <hi>September</hi> to the 10th of <hi>March,</hi> (the Sun being then in the <hi>Southerly Signes,</hi> and therefore on the South side the <hi>Horizon)</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62439:23"/>
there is six Moneths Day in the South, and six Moneths Night in the North.</p>
                  <p>It is called a <hi>Parallel Sphear,</hi> because the Sun Moon or Stars in a <hi>Diurnal Revolution</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> neither ascend higher or descend lower, but alwaies move <hi>Parallel</hi> to the <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> is thus Posited under both the Poles, <hi>viz.</hi> in 90 degrees of Latitude; as may be seen by the <hi>Globe,</hi> if you turn the <hi>Brasen Meridian</hi> till either of the Poles be elevated 90 degrees above the <hi>Horizon.</hi> As in this figure.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>An <hi>Oblique Sphear</hi> hath the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> neither <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Oblique Sphear.</note> nor <hi>Parallel</hi> to the <hi>Horizon,</hi> but lies aslope from it.</p>
                  <p>In an <hi>Oblique Sphear</hi> all the <hi>Celestial Bodies,</hi> as Sun Moon or Stars &amp;c. have (in respect of the <hi>Horizon)</hi> Oblique and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Ascensions and Descensions, and all the lines Parallel to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62439:24"/>
Equator make unequal Angles with the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and are cut by the <hi>Horizon</hi> into unequal parts; for those lines towards the elevated Pole, have a greater portion of a Circle under the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi> then above it: only the Equator because it hath the same Center with the <hi>Horizon,</hi> doth divide the <hi>Horizon</hi> into two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts, and is also divided into two equal parts by the <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence is follows that when the Sun is in any part of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick</hi> that declines towards the elevated Pole, the Daies in the elevated <hi>Hemisphear</hi> shall be longer then the Nights: and when the Sun is in any part of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> that declines towards the Depressed Pole, the Nights shall be longer then the Daies. But when the Sun is in the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> (because whether the Pole be either Raised or Depressed) equal portions remain both above and under the <hi>Horizon,</hi> therefore the Daies are of the same length with the Nights, and the Nights with the Daies.</p>
                  <p>Also in an <hi>Oblique Sphear,</hi> all those Stars that have as great or greater number of degrees of Declination then is the elevated Poles Complement of Latitude to 90, never set or come under the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and those Stars that have the same Declination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Depressed Pole never rise.</p>
                  <p>It is called an <hi>Oblique Sphear,</hi> because all the Circles of the <hi>Sphear</hi> move <hi>Obliquely</hi> about the <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> is thus <hi>Obliquely</hi> posited to all those <hi>Nations</hi> that inhabite under any degree of Latitude either North or South-wards between the Equator and either Pole: as may variously be seen by the Globe, when the Axis lies not on the <hi>Horizon,</hi> nor the Equator is Parallel to the <hi>Horizon.</hi> As in this following Figure.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>TWilight is that promiscuous and doubtfull light which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears before the Rising of the Sun in the Morning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues after the setting of the Sun in the Evening: It is made by the extension of the Suns beams into the Vapours of the Air, when the Sun is less then 18. deg. below the Horizon: for the Sun ere it Rises, and after it Sets, shoots forth its Beams through the Air, and so illuminates the Vapours of the Air; which il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination does by degrees enlighten the Horizon, and spreads through the <hi>Zenith,</hi> even into the West, ere the Sun Rises; and also continues above the Horizon, afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now though it be Twilight when the Sun is 18. degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Horizon; yet the duration of Twilight (is alterable both in respect of <hi>Time)</hi> and <hi>Place:</hi> for at such Time at the Sun is farthest distant from any Place, the Twilight shall be greater, then when it is neerest. And in respect of <hi>Place,</hi> All Places that have great Latitude from the Equator, have longer Twilight than those that are neerer to the Equator: for as Authors say, under the Equator there is no Twilight; when again in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Climes both Northward and Southward, the Nights are indeed no Nights but only (as it were) a little over-spread with a cloudy Shade; and is either increased or diminished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore to know the beginning of Twilight in the Morning here at <hi>London, May</hi> 10; you must (having the Globe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified) turn the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> which is opposite to the Place of the Sun till it be elevated 18. degrees in the Quadrant of Altitude above the Horizon in the <hi>West;</hi> So shall the Index of the Hour-Circle point at the Hour that Twilight begins: Then subtract the Hour and Minute that Twilight begins from the Hour and Minute of Sun Rising, if in the Morning, or substract the Hour of Sun sett from the Hour of Twilight, if at Night; and the remainder is the length of Twilight.</p>

Having found the opposite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I bring it into the <hi>West,</hi> and also the Quadrant of Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and joyn ♏ 29. to 18. degrees (accounted upwards on the Quadrant) so shall ♉ 29. be depressed 18. degrees in the <hi>East</hi> Side the Horizon: Then looking what Hour the Hour-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex points at in the Hour-Circle, I find it to be, 1. Hor. 8. Min. which shews that Twilight begins at 8. Minutes past 1. a clock in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>And if you substract 1. Hour 8. Minutes, from 4. Hours 11. Minutes, the time of Sun Rising, found by the 7th. Probleme, it leaves 3. Hours 3. Minutes for the length of Twilight: And if you double 1. Hour 8. Minutes, the beginning of Twilight, it makes 2. Hours 16.

                  </p>
                  <p>The reason why you bring the degree opposite to the Suns Place to the <hi>West,</hi> is, because the Quadrant containing but 90. degrees will reach no lower then the Horizon; but this Probleme requires it to reach 18. degrees beneath it: therefore by this help, you have the Proposition Answered, as well as if the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant did actually reach 18. degrees below the Horizon. This shift you may have occasion to make in some other Problemes.</p>
                  <p>If you would know when Twilight ends after Sun set; you shall find it by bringing the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> opposite to the Place of the Sun to 18. degrees of the Quadrant of Altitude, on the <hi>East</hi> side the Horizon; for then shall the Index of the Hour-Circle point at 10.

               </argument>
               <p>BEtween the <hi>Zenith</hi> and the Horizon is comprehended an Arch of a Circle containing 90. degrees; so that if you see any Star in or neer the <hi>Zenith,</hi> you may know that Star is 90. or neer 90. degrees high; and by so much as you may conceive it wants of the <hi>Zenith,</hi> so much you may guess it wants of 90. degrees above the Horizon. By this Rule you may guess at an Arch of Heaven containing 90. degrees, or at an Arch of Heaven containing 45. degrees; if by your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination you divide the whole Arch into two equal parts, for then shall each of them contain 45. degrees; And if by your imagination you divide the Arch of 90. into 3. equal parts, each division shall contain an Arch of 30. degrees, &amp;c. But this way is a little too rude for guessing at Stars elevated but few degrees, or for Stars distant but few degrees from one another. Therefore that you may learn to guess more precisely at Distances in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you may either with a <hi>Quadrant, Astrolabe,</hi> or the <hi>Globe;</hi> find the exact distance of any two known Stars that are but few degrees asunder, and by a little revolving the distance of those Stars in your fancy, you may at length so imprint their distance in your memory, that you may readily guess the distance of other Stars by the distance of them.</p>

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating upon that distance, you may imprint it in your fancy for 3. degrees, and so make it applicable to other Stars, either of the same distance, or more, or less: And the <hi>Pointers</hi> (by the last Probleme) are distant from one another 5. degrees and almost an half: These are alwaies above our Horizon, and therefore may alwaies stand as a Scale for five and an half degrees; So that by these for 5½ degrees, and those in <hi>Orions Girdle</hi> for 3. degrees, and others observed, either of greater or lesser distance, you may according to your own Judgement shape a guess, if not exactly, yet pretty neer the matter of Truth, when you come to other Stars. Thus you may exercise your fancy upon Stars found to be 10. or 15. degrees asunder, or more, or less; and with a few experiments of this nature enure your Judgement to guess di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and enable your memory to retain your Judgement.</p>
                  <p>This way of guessing will be exact enough for finding the Hour of the Night by the Stars, for most common Uses; or the Hour of the Day, by guessing at the Altitude of the Sun; if after you have guessed at the Altitude, you shall work as was taught by Prob. 12. for the Hour of the Day: and as shall be taught in the next Probleme, for the Hour of the Night.</p>

                  </gap> at one and the same moment of Time; as shall be shewed hereafter: so that hereby it comes to pass, that when with us here in <hi>England</hi> it is 6. a clock in the Morning, with those that have 90. degrees of Longitude to the Westward of us, it is yet Midnight: with those that have 180. degrees of Longitude from us, it is Evening; And with those that have 90. degrees of Longitude to the <hi>Eastwards,</hi> it is Noon. So that those to the <hi>Eastward</hi> have their Day begin sooner then ours: But to the <hi>Westward</hi> their Day begins after ours. Therefore that you may know what Hour it is in any Place of the Earth, of what distance soever it be, you must first Bring the Place of your own Habitation to the Meridian, and the Index of the Hour Circle to 12. on the Hour Circle; Then bring the other Place to the Meridian, and the Arch of the Hour Circle comprehended between the hour 12. and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, is the difference in Time between the two Places.</p>

their Day begins so much before ours: So that when here at <hi>London</hi> it is 6. a clock in the Morning, at <hi>Surat</hi> it will be 11. a clock 54. minutes; when with us it is 12. a clock, with them it will be 5 a clock 54. minutes afternoon.</p>
                  <p>If you would know the difference of Time between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Jamaica;</hi> Working as before, you may find 5. hor. 15. min. But <hi>Jamaica</hi> is to the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> therefore their Day begins 5. hor. 15. min. after ours: so that when with us it is Noon, with them it will be but three quarters of an hour past 6. a clock in the Morning: and when with them it is Noon, with us it will be one quarter past 5. a clock after Noon, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Or you may yet otherwise know the difference of Time, if you divide the number of Degrees of the Equinoctial that pass through the Meridian while the Globe is moved from the first Place to the second, by 15. so shall the product give you the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of hours and minutes between the two Places: as you will find if you try either of these Examples, or any other.</p>

                  <p>Though this Rule serves for finding the Difference of Right Ascension of any Star; Yet it will not serve for finding the Difference of any Stars Declination.

                  <p>The most Northerly Star in the <hi>Girdle of Orion</hi> doth yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in Declination. But I would know how long it shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; Therefore by the 32. Probleme, I find the Longitude of that Star to be for the Year 1670. 77. deg. 51. min. which subducted out of 90, (the distance of the Solsticial Colure from the Equinoctial,) leaves 12. 9, for the distance of that Star from the Solsticial Colure. Therefore by the Table aforesaid, I find what number of Years answers to the motion of 12. deg. 9. min. And because I cannot find exactly the same number of degrees and minutes in the Table, I take the number neerest to it; which is 14. degrees 10. minutes, and that is the motion of the Ecliptick in 1000. Years. But because this 14. degrees 10. minutes is 2. degrees 1. minute too much, I seek 2. degrees, 1. min. in the Table, and the number of Years against it I would subduct from the number of Years against 14, deg, 10. min. and the remainder would be the number of Years required: But 2. deg. 1. min. I cannot find neither, therefore I must take the number of degrees and minutes neerest to it, which is 2. deg. 50. min. and that yeelds 200. Years; which subducted out of 1000. leaves 800. Years. But because this is also too much by the motion of 49. min. Therefore I seek for 49. min. in the Table, and subduct the number of Years against it from 800, and the remainder would be the number of Years required. But 49. min. is not in the Table neither, Therefore I take the neerest to it, which is 51. min. and that yeelds 60. Years; which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted out of 800. leaves 740. But this is likewise too much by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62439:43"/>
the motion of two min. Therefore I seek 2. min. in the Table, but cannot find it neerer then 2½, and against it I find 3. Years, which 3. Years I subduct out of 740, and the Remainder is 737. the number in Years required. You may if you please for exactness, subduct for the ½ min. 8. Moneths; so have you 736, Years 4. Moneths, for the Time that the most Northerly Star in the <hi>Girdle of Orion</hi> will decrease in Declination after the Year 1670. which will be till <hi>An. Dom.</hi>

                     <hi>December</hi> 10. at half an hour past 9. a clock at Night, here at <hi>London,</hi> I see two bright Stars at a pretty distance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the South; I desire to know the Names of them; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having the Globe rectified to the Latitude of <hi>London,</hi> and the Quadrant of Altitude screwed to the <hi>Zenith,</hi> the Hour-Index also Rectified, and the Horizon posited Horizontally, as by Prob. 2. I observe the Altitude of those Stars in Heaven, (either with a Quadrant, Astrolabe, Cross-staff, or the Globe it self, as hath been shewed Prob. 13, 16.) to be, the one 78. degrees, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 42, degrees above the Horizon. Therefore having their Altitudes, I count the same number of degrees as for the first 78. upon the Quadrant of Altitude upwards, and turn it into the South, under the Meridian, and see what Star is under 78. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, for that is the same Star on the Globe which I saw in Heaven. Now at the first examination of the Globe you may see that that Star is placed in the Ey of that After time which is called <hi>Caput Medusa,</hi> and indeed, that being the only Star of Note in that Constellation, bears the Name of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation. The other Stars about it you may easily know by their Scituation. As, Seeing two little Stars to the Westwards of that Star in Heaven, you may see on the Globe that the hithermost is in the other Ey of <hi>Caput Medusa,</hi> and the furthermost in the <hi>Hair</hi> or <hi>Snakes</hi> of the same Asterisme. Looking a little to the Southwards of those Stars in Heaven, you may see two other smal Stars a little below those in the <hi>Eyes;</hi> Therefore to know those also, you may look on the Globe, and see that there is one on the

                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner for the second Star in the Meridian, which is 42 degrees above the Horizon: If you move the Quadrant of Altitude (as before) to the South or Meridian, and count 42 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees upon the Quadrant of Altitude, you will find a Star of the second Magnitude in the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Whale:</hi> Therefore you may say, that Star in Heaven is in the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Whale:</hi> and because close to it on the Globe is written <hi>Menkar,</hi> Therefore you may know the name of that Star in Heaven is <hi>Menkar.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the South East in Heaven you may see three bright Stars ly directly in a straight line from one another, the middlemost whereof is 25. degrees or thereabouts above the Horizon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bring the Quadrant of Altitude to the South East point of the Horizon, and about 25 degrees above the Horizon you will see the same great Stars on the Globe, in the <hi>Girdle</hi> of <hi>Orion:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those Stars are called <hi>Orions Girdle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time South East and by East you have about 10 degrees above the Horizon the brightest Star in Heaven, called <hi>Sirius,</hi> in the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Great Dog; Canicula</hi> a bright Star in the <hi>Little Dog</hi> East and by South, about 25 degrees above the Horizon: <hi>Cor Leonis</hi> just Rising East North East: you have also at the same time on the East side the Horizon, the <hi>Twins, Auriga,</hi> the <hi>Great Bear;</hi> and divers other Stars, eminent both for their splendor and Magnitude.</p>
                  <p>In the West side the Horizon you have South West and by West about 4 degrees above the Horizon a bright Star in the <hi>Right Leg</hi> of <hi>Aquarius:</hi> and all along to the Southwards in <hi>Cetus</hi> the <hi>Whale,</hi> you have other eminent bright Stars: More upwards towards the <hi>Zenith</hi> you have a bright Star in the <hi>Line</hi> of the two <hi>Fishes:</hi> Higher yet, you have the first Star in ♈, an eminent Star, because the first in all Catalogues that we have cognizance of; and therefore probably in the Equinoctial Colure when the Stars were first reduced into Constellations: yet more

neer the <hi>Zenith</hi> you have a bright Star in the <hi>Left Leg</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda:</hi> From thence towards the North, you find other very eminent bright Stars in <hi>Cassiopea, Cepheus, Ursa Minor,</hi> in the Tail whereof is the <hi>Pole Star:</hi> and <hi>Draco: Hecules:</hi> where you turn back, to <hi>Lyra, Cygnus, Pegasus,</hi> the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> &amp;c. all which, or any other, you may easily know by their Altitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon, and the point of the Compass they bear upon.</p>
                  <p>Thus knowing some of the most eminent Fixed Stars, you may by the Figure of the rest come to the knowledge of them also. For Example, Looking towards the North North East in Heaven, you may see seven bright Stars constituted in this Figure; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looking towards the same Quarter on the Globe, you may (without taking their Altitude) see the same Stars lying in the same Figure in the hinder parts of the <hi>Great Bear;</hi> from whence you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that those Stars in Heaven are scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the hinder parts of the Asterisme called <hi>Ursa Major.</hi>

                  <figure/>
                  <p>Yet nevertheless you may see some Stars of Note in Heaven, which you shall not find on the Globe, and those in or neer about the Ecliptick: They are called <hi>Planets,</hi> and cannot be placed on the Globe, unless it be for a particular Time, with Black Lead, or some such thing that may be rubbed out again: Because they having a continual motion alwaies alter their Places. Of those there are five in number, besides the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> which are also Planets, though they shew not like Stars. These five are called <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury;</hi> yet <hi>Mecury</hi> is very rarely seen: because he never Rising above an Hour before the Sun, or Setting above a Hour after, for the most part hath his light so overspread with the dazelling Beams of the glittering Sun, that sometimes when he is seen he seems rather to be a More in the Suns Beams, then a Body en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with so much brightness as Stars and Planets seem to be.</p>
                  <p>Now there are divers waies (by some of which you may at all times) know those Planets from the Fixed Stars: as first, Their not twinkling, for therein they differ from fixed Stars; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they most commonly do twinkle, but Planets never; unless it be ♂ <hi>Mars;</hi> and yet he twinkles but very seldom neither.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They appear of a considerable Magnitude, as ♃
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62439:52"/>
sometimes appears greater ly far then a Star of the first Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and ☿ many times bigger then he. They are both glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stars, of a bright Silver collure; but ♀ most radient, especially when she is in her <hi>Perigeon.</hi> ♂ appears like a Star of the second Magnitude; and is of a Copperish colloure. ♄ shewes like a Star of the third Magnitude, and is of a Leaden Collour; and he (of all the others,) is most difficult to be known from a fixed Star; partly because of his minority, and partly because of the slowness of his motion. ☿ is very seldom seen (as aforesaid) unless it be in a Morning when he Rises before the Sun, or in an Evening when he Sets after the Sun: He is of a Pale Whitish Collour, like Quick silver, and appears like a Star of the third Magnitude. He may be known by the Company he keeps, for he is never above 29. degrees distant from the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Planets may be known from fixed Stars by their Azimuths and Altitudes observed: (as hath been taught before) for if when you have taken the Azimuth and Altitude of the Star in Heaven you doubt to be a Planet, and you find not on the Globe in the same Azimuth and Altitude a Star appearing to be of the same Magnitude that that in Heaven appears to be, you may conclude that that in Heaven is a Planet. Yet notwithstanding it may happen that a Planet may be in the same degree of Longitude and Latitude in the Zodiack that some eminent fixed Star is in; as in the degree and minute of Longitude and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that <hi>Cor Leonis,</hi> or the <hi>Bulls Ey,</hi> or <hi>Scorpions heart</hi> is in, and so may eclipse that Star, by being placed between us and it: But that happens very seldom and rarely; but if you doubt it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may apply your self to some other of the precedent and subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Rules here set down for knowing Planets from fixed Stars.</p>
                  <p>The fourth way is by shifting their Places; for the Planets having a continual motion, do continually alter their Places: as ♂ moves about half a degree in a day: ♀ a whole degree; but ♃ and ♄ move very slowly; ♃ not moving above 5. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and ♄ seldom above 2. minutes. Yet by their motions alone the Planets may be known to be Planets, if you will precisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their distance from any known fixed Star in or near the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick as on this Night, and the next Night after observe whether they retain the same distance they had the Night before; which if they do, then are they fixed Stars; but if they do not then are they Planets: yet this Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on is to be given you in this Rule also,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62439:52"/>
That the Planets sometimes are said to be <hi>Stationary,</hi> as not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering 1. minute in Place, forwards, or backwards in 6. or 7. daies together. Therefore, if you find cause to doubt whether your Star be a Planet, or a fixed Star, you may for the help of your understanding confer with some of the former Rules, unless you are willing to wait 8 or 9 daies longer, and so by observation of its motion resolve your self, Or,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, you may apply your self to an <hi>Ephemeris</hi> for that Year, and see if on that day you find any Planet in the degree and minute of the Zodiack you see the Star you question in Heaven; and if there be no Planet in that degree of the Zodiack, you may conclude it is no Planet, but a fixed Star.</p>

By the shining Hemisphear you may see that it is Day in all Places that are scituate under it; for on them the Sun doth shine; and that it is Night at the same time in those Places
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62439:53"/>
that are situate in the shadowed Hemisphear; for on them the Sun doth not shine; and therefore they remain in darkness.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Thus in those Countries that are above the Horizon it is Day-light, and in those but 18 degrees below the Horizon, it is Twilight: But in those Countries further below the Horizon it is at that time dark Night: And those Countries within the Parallel of the same number of degrees from the Elevated Pole that the Suns Declination is from the Equinoctial, have the Sun alwaies above the Horizon, till the Sun have less Respective Declination then the Elevated Pole; and those within the same Parallel of the Depressed Pole have the Sun alwayes below their Horizon, till the Sun inclines more towards the Depressed Pole; As you may see by turning about the Globe; for in this position, that portion of the Globe intercepted between the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Pole, and the Parallel Circle of 20. degrees 5. minutes from the Pole doth not descend below the Horizon: neither doth that portion of the Globe intercepted between the Depressed Pole and the Parallel Circle within 20. degrees 5. minutes of that Pole, ascend above the Horizon.</p>

So that you may see, when the Sun is in the <hi>Zenith</hi> of any Place, All the Countries or Cities in any <hi>Almicantar</hi> have the Sun in one heighth at the same time above their Horizon. But to find in what different Places the Sun hath the same heighth at the same time, as well Before or After Noon, as at Full Noon; and that in Countries that have greater Latitude then the Suns greatest Declination, (and therefore cannot have the Sun in their <hi>Zenith,)</hi> requires another Operation.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Elevate its respective Pole according to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Latitude; and let the Degree of the Brazen Meridian which is in the <hi>Zenith</hi> represent your Habitation, and the degree of the Ecliptick the Sun is in represent the Sun: Then bring the Sun to the Meridian, and the Index of the Hour-Circle to 12, and turn the Globe Eastwards, if Before Noon, or Westwards, if After Noon, till the Index point to the Hour of the Day: Then place the lower end of the Quadrant of Altitude to the East point of the Horizon, and move the upper end (by sliding the Nut over the Meridian) till the edge of the Quadrant touch the place of the Sun: Then see at what degree of the Meridian the upper end of the Quadrant of Altitude touches the Meridian and substract that number of Degrees from the Latitude of your Place, and count the number of remaining degrees on the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, on the contrary side the degree of the Meridian where the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the Quadrant of Altitude touches the Meridian, and where that number of degrees ends on the Meridian, in that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and your Habitations Longitude, hath the Sun the same heighth at the same time.</p>

would know in what Place the Sun shall have the same Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude it shall have at <hi>London, London's</hi> Latitude found by <hi>Prob.</hi> 1. is 51½ degrees Northwards: And because the Elevation of the Pole is equal to the Latitude of the Place (as was shewed Prob. 15.) Therefore I Elevate the North Pole 51½ degrees, so shall 51½ degrees on the Meridian be in the <hi>Zenith:</hi> This 51½ degrees on the Meridian represents <hi>London.</hi> The Suns Place found by <hi>Prob.</hi> 3. is ♉ 29. Therefore I bring ♉ 29 to the Meridian, and the Hour Index to 12. on the Hour Circle: Then I turn the Globe Eastwards (because it is before Noon) till the Index point at 8. hours 53 minutes on the Hour-Circle, and place the lower end of the Quadrant of Altitude to the East point in the Horizon, and slide the upper end either North or Southwards on the Meridian till the graduated edge cut the degree of the Ecliptick the Sun is in: Then I examine on the Meridian what degree the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the Quadrant of Altitude touches; which in this example, I find is 38½ degrees. Therefore I substract 38½ from 51½ <hi>Londons</hi> Latitude, and there remains 13. Then counting on the Meridian 13. degrees backwards, from the Place where the Quadrant of Altitude touched the Meridian, I come to 25½ on the Meridian, Northwards.

                  <p>The Quadrant of Altitude thus applyed to the East point of the Horizon makes right angles with all points on the Meridian, even as all the Meridians proceeding from the Pole, do with the Equator: therefore the Quadrant being applyed both to the East point, and the Suns Place, projects a line to intersect the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Perpendicularly in equal degrees; from which intersection the Sun hath at the same time equal Heighth, be the degrees few or many; for those 5. degrees to the Northwards of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection, have the Sun in the same heighth that they 5 degrees to the Southwards have it: and those 10, 20, 30. degrees, more, or less, to the Northwards, have the Sun in the same heighth that they have that are 10, 20. 30. degrees more or less to the Southwards: So that this <hi>Prob.</hi> may be performed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way more easily, with your Compasses, Thus: Having first rectified the Globe, and Hour Index, Turn about the Globe till

                     <hi>Blaew</hi> commenting upon this Probleme, takes notice how grosly they ere that think they can find the heighth of the Pole at any Hour of the Day, by the Suns height: because they do not consider that it is impossible to find the Hour of the Day, unless they first know the height of the Pole.</p>

they lengthen, till 7½ degrees of the Equator pass through the Meridian, and where the Horizon intersects the same Colure, make another prick in the Colure: Afterwards bring the Colure to the Meridian, and count the number of degrees between the two pricks, for so many degrees must the Suns Declination alter to lengthen or shorten the Day an Hour.</p>

                  <head>Example.</head>
                  <p>The Suns Place is ♉ 10. I would know how much he must alter his Declination before the Day is an Hour longer here at <hi>London.</hi> Therefore I rectifie the Globe to the Latitude of <hi>London,</hi> and bring ♉ 10. to the East side the Horizon, and find it against 24½ degrees from the East point: therefore I bring one of the Colures to this 24½ degrees, and close by the edge of the Horizon I make a prick with black lead, in the Colure: then keeping the Globe in this position, I look what degree of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator is then at the Meridian, and find 250¼, and because the Daies lengthen, I turn the Globe Eastwards, till 7½ degrees from the foresaid 250¼ pass through the Meridian: then keeping the Globe in this position I make another prick in the Colure, and bringing this Colure to the Meridian, I find a little more then 5 degrees of the Meridian contained between the two pricks: therefore I say, when the Sun is in ♉ 10. degrees, he must alter his Declination a little more then 5 degrees, to make the Day an Hour longer.</p>
                  <p>Now to know in what number of Daies he shall alter this Declination, you must find the Declination of the two pricks on the Colure as you found the Suns Declination by Prob. 5. and the Arch of the Ecliptick that passes through the Meridian while the Globe is turned from the first pricks Declination to the second pricks Declination, is the number of Ecliptical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that the Sun is to pass while he alters this Declination: and the degree of the Ecliptick then at the Meridian is (with respect had to the Quarter of the Year) the place the Sun shall have when its Declination shall be altered so much as to make the Day an Hour longer</p>
                  <p>Thushaving the Suns first place given, and its second place found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may by finding those two places on the Plain of the Horizon, also find the number of Daies comprehended between them, as you are taught by the fourth Probleme.</p>

This Probleme thus wrought for different Times of the Year, will shew the falacy of that Vulgar Rule which makes the Day to be lengthned or shortned an Hour in every Fifteen Daies: when as the lengthning or shortning of Daies keeps no such equality of proportion: for when the Sun is neer the Equinoctial points the Daies lengthen or shorten very fast: but when he is neer the Tropical points, very slowly.</p>

                  <p>Of the Difference of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Natural Daies,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Equation</hi> of <hi>Civil Daies.</hi> And how it may be found by the <hi>Globe.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Civil Day is that space of Time containing just 24. Hours, reckoned from 12 a clock on one Day to 12 a clock the next Day; in which space of Time the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial makes upon the Poles of the World a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal Revolution. The Natural Day is that space of Time wherein the Sun moveth from the Meridian of any Place to the same Meridian again. These Daies are at one time of the Year longer then at another; and at all Times longer then the Civil Daies. There is but smal discrepancy between them, yet some there is, made by a two-fold Cause. For first, The Suns Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent motion is different from his true motion; He being much slower in his <hi>Apogeum</hi> then he is in his <hi>Perigeum:</hi> For when the Sun is in his <hi>Apogeum</hi> he scarce moves 58 minutes from West to East in a Civil Day, but when he is in his <hi>Perigeum</hi> he moves above 61 minutes in a Civil Day: and therefore increases his Right Ascension more in equal Time.</p>
               <p>The second Cause is the difference of Right Ascensions answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to equal parts of the Ecliptick: for about ♋ and ♑ the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Right Ascensions are far greater then about ♈ and ♎: for about ♈ and ♎ the Right Ascension of 10. degrees is but 9. degrees 11. minutes; but about ♋ and ♑ the Right Ascension of 10 degrees will be found to be 10. degrees 53. minutes, as by the Globe will appear.</p>
               <p>But because of the smalness of the Globes graduation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actually distinguish to parts neer enough for the solution of this Probleme, if you should enquire the difference in length of two single Daies; it will be requisite to take some number of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62439:58"/>
Daies together; Suppose 20. Therefore find by Prob. 3. the Places of the Sun for the beginning and ending of those Daies you would compare; and find the Right Ascensions answerable to each place in the Ecliptick; and also the differences of Right Ascensions answerable to the Suns motion in each number of Daies: Then compare the differences of Right Ascensions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by substracting the lesser from the greater, you will have the number of degrees and minutes of the Equator that have passed through the Meridian more in one number of Daies then in the other number of Daies: which degrees of the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor converted into Time, is the number of minutes that the one number of Daies is longer then the other number of Daies.</p>

               <p>PLanets and Comets cannot be placed on the Globe so as their places will long retain correspondence with their places in Heaven; Because as was said <hi>Chap.</hi> 44. they have a continual motion from West to East upon the Poles of the <hi>Ecliptick:</hi> yet never-the-less you may by having their Longitude and Latitude, or Right Ascension and Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for any set Time, place a Mark for them on the Globe, either with Ink if your Globe be Varnisht, for then you may with a wet finger wipe it off again; or with Black-lead, if it be not Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht, and then you may rub it out again with a little White
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62439:61"/>
Bread: which Mark for that Time, will as effectually serve you to work by, as any of the Fixed Stars placed on the Globe will do.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the Longitude and Latitude of any Planet, or Comet, be given; Do thus, Elevate the North Pole, if the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude given be North; but if the Latitude given be South, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate the South Pole 66 ½ degrees; and place the Pole of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and over it screw the Quadrant of Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: so shall the <hi>Ecliptickly</hi> in the Horizon; and the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of Altitude being turned about the Horizon shall pass through all the Degrees of Longitude: Then find the point of given Longitude in the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> and bring it to the Quadrant of Altitude, and hold it there: Then count upwards on the Quadrant of Altitude the number of degrees and minutes of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Latitude, and at the point where the number ends, close to the Quadrant of Altitude, make a smal Prick, and that Prick shall represent the Planet or Comet you were to place on the Globe.</p>
               <p>If it be the Right Ascension and Declination of a Planet or Comet that is given; you must find the degree and minute of Right Ascension on the Equinoctial, and bring it to the Meridian, and keep the Globe there steddy; then find the degree and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of Declination on the Meridian, and under that degree and minute on the Globe make a Prick, and that Prick shall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Planet, or Comet, as aforesaid,</p>
               <p>If it be ♄ or ♃ that this Prick is to represent, it may stand on the Globe sometimes a Week or a Fortnight, without much difference from the Planets place in Heaven. But if the Prick were to represent the other Planets, you must (in regard of their swift motion) alter it very often, especially for the Moon; for so swift is her motion, that in every two Hours she alters about a degree in Longitude.</p>
               <p>Having thus placed this Mark on the Globe, you may find out the Time of its several Positions, and Aspects, if you work by it as you are directed to work by the Sun, in the several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Problemes throughout this Book.</p>

Then I turn the Globe again through the Meridian, till the same Rhumb cut the Meridian in the second Latitude. <hi>viz</hi> in 30 degrees 40 minutes, and directly under those 30 degrees 40 minutes upon the same Rhumb, I make another prick, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Place I am arrived to: I examine the Longitude of this prick, as before, and find it 32 degrees 10 minutes.

                  <p>Then for examining the Distance I open my Compasses to 1. degree on the Equinoctial and measure upon the Rhumb how oft that Distance is contained between the two pricks, and find 29¼, that is, 29 degrees 15 minutes, which multiplyed by 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The reason why I open the Compasses no wider then to 1 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is because the Rhumbs being Circular or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I should not have had above 583 Leagues for the distance between the two Places: neither is there indeed more great Circle distance between them; But I sailed upon a Rhumb, that is, I follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Note, If you be not very curious in opening your Compasses to this smal distance, you may in oft turning them about upon the Rhumb commit error in your measuring: therefore when you have taken the Distance of one degree, try if you neither gain or loose any thing in measuring 10, or 20. degrees of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial by them: for then your Compasses are opened to a width exact enough for your purpose.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The second is, how to judge of the events of things by the Figure erected: and this is indeed the only</hi> Astrological <hi>part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first of these I shall briefly handle; because what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is proposed may be performed by the Globe, both with speed, ease, delight, and demonstration. The second I shall not meddle with, but refer you to the whole Volumnes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy written upon that Subject.</hi>

                  <p>To Erect a Figure of the 12 <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore you erect a Figure of the 12 Houses of Heaven it will be requisite you place the Planets, ☊, and ☋, according to their Longitude and Latitude upon the Globe, as was directed in Prob. 55. of the second Book: for then, as you divide the Houses of your Figure by the Circle of Position, you may by inspection behold in what Houses the Planets are scituated, and also see what fixed Stars they are applying to, or separating from. But to the matter.</p>
               <p>There is disagreement between the Ancient and Modern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologers, about erecting a Figure of Heaven. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Palmer</hi> in his Book of <hi>Spherical Problemes</hi> Chap. 48. mentions four seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies, and the Authors that used them; whereof one of them is called <hi>the Rational way</hi> used by <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>giomontanus;</hi> and now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally practised by all the Astrologers of this Age. This way the face of Heaven is divided into twelve parts, which are called the twelve Houses of Heaven numbered from the Ascendent or angle at East downwards, with 1, 2, 3, &amp;c, As in the following Figure.</p>
               <p>In a Direct Sphear, <hi>viz.</hi> under the Equator these twelve Houses are twelve equal parts: but in an Oblique Sphear they are unequal parts, and that more or less according to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sphears obliquity.</p>
               <p>These twelve Houses are divided by 12. Semi-Circles of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; which are Semi-Circles passing from the two intersections of the Horizon and Meridian through any Star, degree, or point in the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Four of these Houses are named Cardinals. The first and most eminent of these Cardinals is the first House, or the Angle of East, called the Ascendent; where the Semi-Circle of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sition is the same with the Eastern Semi-Circle of the Horizon. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cardinal is the tenth House, or the Angle of South; called <hi>Medium Caeli,</hi> or <hi>Culmen Caeli;</hi> where the Semi-Circle of Position is the same with the Semi-Circle of the Meridian above the Horizon. The third Cardinal is the seventh House, or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of West; called the Descende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; where the Semi-Circle of Position is the same with the Western Semi-Circle of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62439:70"/>
                  <figure/>
The fourth Cardinal is the fourth House, or Angle of North; called <hi>Imum Caeli;</hi> where the Semi Circle of Position is the same with the Semi-Circle of the Meridian under the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
               <p>The degrees and minutes of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> upon the Cusps of these four Houses (that is, upon the beginning of these Houses) are found all at once only by bringing the Rising degree of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick</hi> to the Horizon: (for the Horizon represents the Cusp of the Ascendent:) and then shall the Meridian cut the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> on the Cusp of the tenth House. The Western Semi-Circle of the Horizon shall cut the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> on the Cusp of the Seventh House: and the Semi-Circle of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian under the Horizon shall cut the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> on the Cusp of the fourth House.</p>
               <p>If you have the day of the Moneth, you may by Prob. 3. of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62439:70"/>
the second Book find the Suns Place; and if you have the Hour of the Day you may by first rectifying the Globe, as by Prob. 2. of the same Book, turn about the Globe till the Index of the Hour-Circle point to the same Hour in the Hour-Circle, and you will then at the Eastern Semi-Circle of the Horizon have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> that is Rising, and by Consequence (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) all the Cardinal points in their respective places.</p>
               <p>Now to find what degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> occupies the Cusps of the other eight Houses of Heaven; Do thus, The Globe rectified, as aforesaid, Move the Semi-Circle of Position up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards till 30 degrees of the Equator shall be contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Eastern Semi-Circle of the Horizon; so shall the Semi-Circle of Position cut in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> the degree and minute of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> on the Cusp of the twelfth House; and its opposite degree and minute in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> shall be the Cusp of <note place="margin">Opposite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the <hi>Cusps</hi> of opposite <hi>Houses.</hi>
                  </note> the sixth House, (for you must note that if you have but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and minute of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> upon the Cusps of six of the Houses, the opposite degrees and minutes of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> shall immediately possess the Cusp of every opposite House.)</p>
               <p>Then move the Circle of Position over 30. degrees more of the Equinoctial, so shall the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> cut by the Circle of Position be the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> upon the Cusp of the eleventh House; and its opposite degree in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> shall be upon the Cusp of the fifth House. The degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> upon the Cusp of the tenth and fourth Houses was found as before. Then remove the Circle of Position to the Western side of the Meridian, and let it fall towards the Horizon till 30. degrees of the Equator are contained between the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and it, so shall the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> cut by the Semi-Circle of Position be the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> on the Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let the Semi-Circle of Position fall yet lower, till it pass over 30. degrees more of the Equator, so shall the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> cut by the Semi-Circle of Position be the degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> on the Cusp of the eighth House; and the opposite degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> shall be upon the Cusp of the second House.

                  <p>I first place the Planets, ☊, and ☋, on the Globe, as by Prob. 55. of the Second Book was directed: yet not exactly as I find them in the <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> for that shews only their place in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick</hi> at Noon: Therefore I consider how many degrees or minutes each Planets motion is in a whole Day or 24.

               <head>Of the several Kinds of Dyal Plains: and how you may know them.</head>
               <p>A Plain in Dyalling is that flat whereon a Dyal is discribed.</p>
               <p>There is some disagreement among Older and Later Authors in the naming of Plains: for some name them according to the Great Circle in Heaven they ly in: and others according to the scituation of the Poles of the Plains. Thus they which name them according to the Great Circle in Heaven their Plains ly in, call that an Horizontal Plain, which others call a Vertical Plain; those Vertical, which others will call Horizontal; and those Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which others call Equinoctial.</p>
               <p>However they be called it matters not, so you can but distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish their kinds, which with a little consideration you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily learn to do: For remembring but upon what grounds either the Order or Later Authors gave the Plains their Names, upon the same grounds you may also learn to know them. I confess both waies admit of some just exception against for in the Older Rule a Plain about the Pole, is called an Equinoctial Plain; when as to a sudden apprehension it would sound more significant to call it a Polar Plain, as Later Authors do: Again, Later Authors call an Horizontall Plain a Vertical Plain; when as it sounds more significant to call it an Horizontal Plain, as Older Authors do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it lie flat upon the Horizon: But I shall give you the names according to both Rules, and leave you to your liberty to accept of which you please.</p>
               <p>First therefore, you have an Equinoctial Plain otherwise called a Polar Plain. This Plain hath two Faces, upper, and under: These two Faces ly in the Plain of the Equinoctial: the upper Face beholding the Elevated Pole, the under Face the depressed Pole.</p>

               <p>All these kinds of Plains have two Faces; the one beholding the North Pole with the same respect that the other beholds the South Pole; except the Equinoctial Plain, which, because neither Pole is Elevated, hath but one Face: yet that one contains as many Hour lines as two other Faces.</p>
               <p>These two Faces or Plains will receive just 24. hour lines, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Every Dyal Plain is Parallel to the Horizon of some Country or other in the World: therefore a Dyal made for any Horizon in the World may be set to such a Position that it will shew you the Hour of the Day in your own Habitation: At least for so long as the Sun continues upon that Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All Plains may be aptly demonstrated by the Globe, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it correspondent to all the Circles in Heaven, as by Prob. 2. of the second B ok: for if you imagine the Globe in that Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were prest flat into the Plain of any Circle, that Flat shall
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62439:77"/>
represent a Dyal plain, which shall be called after the name of that Circle it is prest into.</p>
               <p>Thus if the Quadrant of Altitude be applyed to any degree of <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and you imagine the Globe were prest flat to the edge of the Quadrant of Altitude, so much as that <hi>Azimuth</hi> Declines from the East, West, North, or South, in the Horizon, so much shall that flat on the Globe be said to Decline either from the East, West, North, or South. Or if you imagine the Globe were prest flat down even with the Plain of the Horizon, that flat shall represent an Horizontal Plain; because as was said before, the Plain lies in that Circle cal'd the Horizon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Style</hi> or <hi>Gnomon</hi> is that straight wyre that casts the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow upon the Hour of the Day: it is alwaies placed Parallel to the Axis of the World.</p>
               <p>There are several waies to find the scituation of all Plains; but the readiest and speediest is by a Clinatory. The Clinatory is made of a square board, as A B C D, of a good thickness, and the larger the better; between two of the sides is discribed on the Center A a Quadrant as E F divided into 90 equal parts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which are figured with 10, 20, 30, to 90; and then back again with the Complements of the same numbers to 90: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Limb</hi> and the two Semidiameters is made a Round Box, into which a Magnetical Needle is fitted; and a Card of the Sea Compass, divided into 4 Nineties, beginning their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at the East, West, North, and South points of the Compass, from which points the opposite sides of the Clinatory receives their Names of East, West, North, or South. Upon the Center A whereon the Quadrant was discribed is fastned a Plumb-line, having a Plumbet of Lead or Brass fastned to the end of it, which Plumb-line is of such length that the Plumbet may fall just into the Grove G H below the Quadrant, which is for that purpose made of such a depth that the Plumbet may ride freely within it, without stopping at the sides of it. See the Figure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
               <p>With this Clinatory you may examine the scituation of Plains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As if your Plain be Horizontal; it is Direct: and then for the true scituating your Dyal you have only the true North and South line to find: which is done only with setting the Clinatory flat down upon the Plain, and turning it towards the right or left hand, till you can bring the North point of the Needle to hang
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62439:78"/>
                  <figure/>
just over the Flower-de-luce: for then if you draw a line by either of the sides Parallel to the Needle, that line shall be a North and South line. Put herein respect must be had to the Variation of the Compass in the Place you make your Dyal: for if the North point of the Needle swerves from the North point of the World, then have you not a true North and South line. But if in your Place there be no Variation of the North point of the Needle from the North point of the World (as now it happens here at <hi>London)</hi> then the line drawn by the side of the Clinatory (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid) shall be a true North and South line.</p>
               <p>But admit there be Variation, Having by Prob. 19. of the third Book found the number of degrees of this Variation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East, or West, count the same number of degrees from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62439:78"/>
the North point in the Card either to the Eastwards or West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and note the degree in the Card terminating at that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for that degree shall be the North point; and its opposite degree the South point: 90. degrees from it either way shall be the East and West points.</p>

In the Center of this Plain erect a straight wyer prependicularly: when you would find a Meridian line examine by the tenth Prob. of the second Book the Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Suns Rising or Setting from the East or West points, and waiting the just Rising or Setting that Day, turn the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about till the shadow of the wyer falls upon the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from the East or West the Amplitude is of, for then the North and South line in the Instrument will be the same with the North and South line in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly by the Suns <hi>Azimuth:</hi> Find the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Sun by Prob. 22. of the second Book: and at the same instant turn the Instrument till the shadow of the wyer fall upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree on the Instrument opposite to the degree of the Suns <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> so shall the Meridional line of the Instrument agree with the Meridional line in Heaven.</p>
               <p>You may the same way work by the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of any Star. Only, whereas the shadow of the wyer should fall upon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite degree aforesaid: Now you must place a Sight or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular upon that opposite degree, and turn the Instrument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62439:79"/>
till the wyer at the Center, the Sight in the opposite degree of the Stars <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and the Star in Heaven, come into one straight line, so shall the Meridian line of the Instrument agree with the Meridional line in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly It may be found by any Star observed in the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, if two Perpendiculars be erected in the Meridian line of your Instrument; for then by turning the Instrument till the two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars and the Star come into a straight line, the Meridian line of your Instrument will be the same with the Meridian line in Heaven.

on the Wall where I intend to make my Dyal, and wait till it hangs quietly before the Wall: then if the line be rub'd with Chalk (like a Carpenters line) I may by holding the Plumber end close to the Wall, and straining it pretty stif, strike with it a

This line shall be a Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as E F: I chuse a convenient point in this Perpendicular, as at G, for a Center; whereon I discribe an occult Arch as H I: this Arch must contain the number of degrees of the Elevation of the Equinoctial counted between H and I, (which in our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is 38½,) Therefore in a Quadrant of the same Radius with the occult Arch I measure 38½ degrees, and set them off in the Plane from H in the Perpendicular to I: Then from I to the Center G in the Perpendicular, I draw the prickt line I G, and this line shall represent the Axis of the World: I cross this Axis at Right Angles with the line G K and draw it from G. to K, so long as I possibly can: this line shall be the Contingent-line.

                     </hi> may ly just upon VI in the Contingent line; And having a thred fastned in the Center of the Semi-Circle of Position, I draw that thred straight over the first 15. degrees of the Circle of Position, numbred from 0 towards <hi>h,</hi> and where the thred cuts the Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent line I make a mark, for that mark shall be the mark for the 7 a clock line. From thence I remove the thred to 30. degrees of the Semi-Circle, and draw it through the Contingent line, and where it cuts the Contingent line, there shall be the mark for the 8 a clock line, From thence I remove the thred to 45. degrees of the Semi-Circle and draw it through the Contingent line, and where it cuts the Contingent line there shall be the mark for the 9 a clock line. From thence in like manner I remove the thred to 60. and 75. and where the thred cuts the Contingent line shall be the mark for 10 and 11 a clock lines: The 12 a clock line cannot be drawn on this Plane, as you may see, if you apply the thred to 90 degrees, for though you should draw it out never so far yet would it never touch the Contingent line: because it is Parallel to the line <hi>g h,</hi> and lines Parallel never meet.</p>
                  <p>But because in our Latitude the Sun Rises before 4. in the Morning, therefore two Hour-lines are yet wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> 5, and 4, which I may find either by applying the thred first to 15, and next to 30 degrees from 0 towards <hi>g</hi> in the Semi-Circle, and so marking where it cuts the Contingent line, as before: Or else by transfering the distance of the same number of Hour lines from the 6 a clock line already drawn on the side <hi>e <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Having thus marked out on the Contingent line the distances of each Hour; I draw a line Parallel to the Contingent line, and draw lines from every Hour markt on the Contingent to cross the Contingent line at Right Angles and continue each line to the line Parallel to the Contingent; and these lines shall be the Hour lines of an East Plane. To these Hour-lines I set Figures as in the Scheam may be seen.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Style</hi> D K of this Dyal (as well as of others) must stand Parallel to the Axis of the World: it must be also Parallel to all the Hour lines, and stand directly over the 6 a clock line, and that so high as is the distance between the Center of the Semi-Circle of Position and the point where the 6 a clock line cuts the Contingent line: Or (which is all one) at such a height as when it is laid flat down upon the Plane it may just reach the 3 a clock line,</p>

                  <p>Now herein is a difference between Declining Dyals, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Dyals: For having found the distances of the Hour lines for one half of the Day, be it either for Before Noon or After Noon in a Direct Dyal, you have also found the distances for the other half Day; because, as was said Prob. 3. Equal number of Hours have equal distance from the Noon line: But in Declining Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als it is not so: Because the Sun remaining longer upon that side of the Plane which it declines to, then it doth upon the contrary side, there will be a greater number of Hour lines upon it, and by consequence the distance of the Hour lines less then on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side of the Plane.</p>
                  <p>Therefore for finding the After Noon Hour lines, I turn about the Quadrant of Altitude upon the <hi>Zenith</hi> point till the lower end of it come to the degree of the Horizon opposite to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Declination that the Quadrant of Altitude was placed at when I sought the Fore Noon Hour lines, <hi>viz,</hi> to 27. degrees

               <p>Thus, if you draw upon Glass, Horn, or an Oyled Paper, the South Dyal Declining Eastwards, as in the foregoing Probleme,

               <p>The Globe, Quadrant of Altitude, Colure, and Hour Index, Rectified; as by Prob. 4.

where it becomes an Horizontal Plane; and that by so many Hours or minutes as the degrees of the difference of Longitude between the two Places converted into Time amounts to.

South; and Longitude from the Colure 33. degrees, which is the difference of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude between <hi>London</hi> and the Horizontal Place: which being converted into Time by allowing for every 15. degrees 1. hour of Time, gives 2 hours 12. minutes that the Sun comes sooner to the Meridian of the Horizontal Place, then to the Meridian of the Plane at <hi>London:</hi> so that when it is 12 a clock there, it will be but 9. a clock 48. minutes here; when 12 a clock here, it will be 2 a clock 12. minutes There, &amp;c.</p>

                  </gap>d a Plumb line to the Ceeling, over that end of the Meridian line next the Window; If the Plumbet hang not exactly on the Meridian line on the Floor, remove your hand on the Ceeling one way or other, as you see cause till it do hang quietly just o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it: and at the point where the Plumb line touches the Ceel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing make a mark, as at B; that mark B shall be directly over the Meridian line on the Floor: then remove your Plumb line to the other end of the Meridian line on the Floor, and find a point on the Ceeling directly over it, as you, did the former point, as at C, and through those two points B and C on the Ceeling strain and strike a line blackt with Smal Cole or any other Culler (as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters</hi> do,) and that line B C on the Ceeling shall be a Meridian line, as well as that on the Floor: Then examine the Altitude of the Equinoctial, as by Prob. 6. of the Second Book you did the Meridian Altitude of the Sun; and fasten a string just on the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and remove that string in the Meridian line on the Ceeling till it have the same Elevation in a Quadrant, that the Equinoctial hath in your Habitation; and through the point where the string touches the Meridian line in the Ceeling shall a line be drawn at right Angles with the Meridian, to represent the Equinoctial line. Thus in our Latitude the Elevation of the Equator being 38½ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; I remove the string fastned to the <hi>Nodus</hi> forwards or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Meridian line of the Ceeling, till the Plumb line of a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62439:96"/>
Quadrant, when one of the sides are applyed to the string, falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 38½ degrees: and then I find it touch the Meridian line at D in the Ceeling: therefore at D I make a mark and through this mark strike the line D E (as before I did the Meridian line) to cut the Meridian line at Right Angles: This line shall be the Equinoctial line.</p>
               <p>Then I place the Center of the Semi-Circle of Position upon <hi>Nodus,</hi> and under-prop it so that the flat side of it may ly Parallel to the string when it is strained between the <hi>Nodus</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial, and also so as the string may ly on the division of the Semi-Circle marked o, when it is help up to the Meridian line in the Ceeling: Then removing the string the space of 15. degrees in the Circle of Position to the Eastwards, and extending it to the Equator on the Ceeling, where the string touches the Equator there shall be a point through which the 1 a clock Hour-line shall be drawn: and Removing the string yet 15. degrees further to the Eastwards in the Semi-Circle of Position, and extending it also to the Equator, where it touches the Equator there shall be a point through which the 2 a clock Hour-line shall be drawn: Removing the string yet 15. degrees further to the Eastwards in the Semi-Circle of Position, and extending it to the Equator, there shall be a point through which the 3 a clock Hour-line shall be drawn: The like for all the other After-Noon Hour lines; so oft as the string is removed through 15. degrees on the Semi-Circle of Position, so oft shall it point out the After-Noon distances in the Meridian line on the Ceeling.</p>
               <p>The scituation of the Semi-Circle of Position cannot conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be shewn in this Figure, unless it be drawn by the Rules of Perspective; Neither if it were would it suit with the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, expect they were drawn by the same Rules also; which to do would be hard for young Learners to understand: Therefore I have left out the Semi-Circle of Position in this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and refer you for a demonstration thereof to the sixth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme; For even as the lines drawn through every 15, degrees of the Semi-Circle there, denote in a Contingent line the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of any Hour line from the Meridian line, even so a line drawn through every 15. degrees of the Semi-Circle of Position posited (as aforesaid) point out in the Equinoctial line on the Ceeling the distance of each respective Hour line from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian line,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:62439:96"/>
Having thus found out the points in the Equator through which the After-Noon Hour-lines are to be drawn, I may find the Fore-Noon Hour distances also the same way, <hi>viz.</hi> by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the string to the several 15. degrees on the West side the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-Circle of Position; or else I need only measure the distances of each Hour distance found in the Equator from the Meridian line on the Ceeling; for the same number of Hours from 12 have the same distance in the Equinoctial line on the other side the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian both Before and Afternoon: The 11 a clock Hour distance is the same from the Meridian line with the 1 a clock distance on the other side the Meridian, the 10 a clock distance the same with the 2 a clock distance, the 9 with the 3, &amp;c. And thus the distances of all the Hour lines are found out on the Equator.</p>
               <p>Now if the Center of this Dyal lay within doores, you might draw lines from the Center through these pricks in the Equator, and those lines should be the Hour lines, as in other Dyals: But the Center of this Dyal lies without doores in the <hi>Air,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not convenient for this purpose: So that for drawing the
<figure/>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:62439:97"/>
Hour lines you must consider what angle every Hour line in an Horizontal Dyal makes with the Meridian; that is, at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in degrees and minutes the Hour lines of an Horizontal Dyal cut the Meridian; which you may examine as by Prob. 3. for an Angle equal to the Complement of the same Angle must each respective Hour-line make with the Equator on the Ceeling.</p>
               <p>Thus upon the point markt for each Hour distance in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial line on the Ceeling, I discribe the Arches I, II, III, IIII, as in the Figure, and finding the distance from the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the Hour-lines of an Horizontal Dyal to be according to the third Probleme.

               <head>Of the Parts and Kindes of <hi>Spherical Triangles.</hi> THEOREMS.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL Spherical Triangles are made of six parts; Three Sides, and three Angles. The Sides are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Angles, and measured by degrees of a Great Circle, from one end to the other. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles are the distance of the two joyned sides: and they are also measured by an Arch of a Circle, discribed on the Angular point. If any three of these parts be known, the rest may be found.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All Spherical Triangles are either Right Angled, or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Angled. A Right Angle contains 90. degrees: An Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Angle either more, or less.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a Spherical Triangle have one or more Right Angles; it is called a Right Angled Spherical Triangle. But if it have no Right Angle; it is called an Oblique Angled Spherical Triangle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If an Oblique Spherical Triangle have one Angle greater then a Right Angle: it is called an Obtuse Angled Spherical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle: But if it have no Angle greater, it is called an Accute Angled Spherical Triangle.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In Right Angled Triangles the sides including the Right Angle are called Legs: And the side opposite to the Right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62439:100"/>
is called Hypothenusa. Thus the sides A B and A C in the following Triangle are called Legs; and the side B C is called Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothenusa.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="6">6. In a Right Angled Spherical Triangle one of the Legs are called Base; the other Perpendicular: Thus the Leg B A is Base; and the Leg C A Perpendicular. But the Terms may be varied: for the Base may be made Perpendicular, and the Perpendicular Base. Also One of the adjacent Angles is called the Angle at the Base; the other the Angle at the Perpendicular: Thus the Angle B is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Angle at the Base: the Angle C the Angle at the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.</p>

               <p>THe Base of a Right Angled Spherical Triangle shall in this following Treatise be alwayes placed on a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, the Perpendicular on the Equator, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothenusa on the Quadrant of Altitude, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle at the Base shall be measured in an Arch of the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Elevate the Equinoctial into the <hi>Zenith,</hi> so shall the Poles of the Globe ly in the North and South points of the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Then count from the Equinoctial on the first Meridian, if you use the <hi>Terrestrial Globe;</hi> or on the Vernal Colure, if you use the <hi>Celestial,</hi> because they are divided from the Equinoctial either way into 90. degrees; and because from thence the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Equinoctial are begun to be numbred: Count (I say) from the Equinoctial the number of degrees the Base con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and there make a prick: Then count in the Equinoctial from the first Meridian the number of degrees the Perpendicular contains, and make there a second Prick: Bring that second Prick to the Brasen Meridian, so shall the first Meridian be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Brasen Meridian by the quantity of an Arch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the measure of the Perpendicular: Then having the Quadrant of Altitude screwed in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> turn it about till the side of it cut the Prick made in the first Meridian; so shall the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62439:100"/>
Triangle be represented on the Globe. The Base shall ly on the first Meridian between the Equinoctial and the Quadrant of Altitude, the Perpendicular in the Equinoctial between the first Meridian and the Brasen Meridian; and the Hypothenusa on the Quadrant of Altitude between the <hi>Zenith</hi> and the first Meridian: and the number of degrees between each of these respective Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches shall be the measure of each respective Side. For the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles; The Right angle is known to be 90. degrees, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Theorem in the Preface. The measure of the Angle at the Perpendicular is numbred between the East point in the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon and the graduated edge of the Quadrant of Altitude: But to find the Angle at the Base you must turn the Triangle, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perpendicular Base, and the Base Perpendicular.</p>

                  <head>Example.</head>
                  <p>Having the two Legs given A B 79. degreee 15. minutes, and C A 23. degrees 8 minutes, I would find the measure of the Hypothenusa C B, and the Angles B C.</p>
                  <p>The Equinoctial Elevated, as before, I make A B Base, and C A Perpendicular, counting in the first Meridian from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial 79. degrees 15. minutes, and there I make a prick: Then I number in the Equinoctial from the first Meridian 23. degrees 8. minutes, the length of the Perpendicular, and there I make a second Prick: This prick I bring to the Brasen Meridian, so is the first Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian separated from the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Meridian so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes as is the length of the Perpendicular C A; Then I screw the Quadrant of Altitude to the <hi>Zenith, viz.</hi> directly over the Equinoctial, and move it about till the edge of it touch the Prick made in the first Meridian: So is the Triangle made on the Globe: And the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of degrees and minutes of the Quadrant of Altitude compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended between the first Meridian and the <hi>Zenith</hi> is the measure of the Hypothenusa C B; which in this Example is 80. degrees 8. minutes: The number of degrees in the Horizon compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<figure/>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62439:101"/>
between the Equinoctial and the Quadrant of Altitude is the measure of the Angle C, 85. degrees 44. minutes: the Angle A is a Right Angle, 90. degrees: And to find the Angle B, turn the Triangle, (all but the Letters;) Thus: As before A C was Base, so now I make B A Base; and as before A B was Perpendicular, so now C A shall be Perpendicular: so is your Triangle turned.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Now, as before I counted 79. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 15. minutes from the Equinoctial on the first Meridian, which was the length of that Base, so now I count 23. degrees 8. minutes on the first Meridian, which is the length of this Base, and there (as before) I make a Prick: and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I counted 23. degrees 8. minutes on the Equinoctial from the first Meridian, which was the length of that Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; so now I count 79. degrees 15. minutes on the Equinoctial, which is the length of this Perpendicular; and there I make a prick on the Equinoctial: Then I bring this Prick (as before) to the Brasen Meridian, so shall the first Meridian be distant (as before) from the Brasen Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian so many degrees and minutes as is the length of this Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, <hi>viz.</hi> 79. degrees 15. minutes: Then Having the Quadrant of Altitude screwed to the <hi>Zenith,</hi> I turn it about till the edge of it touch the Prick made in the first Meridian at 23. degrees 8. minutes distant from the Equinoctial; so is the Triangle Turned: And so shall the Arch of the Horizon comprehended between the Equinoctial and the Quadrant of Altitude be the measure of the Angle C in the former Triangle, (but now made B) 23. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 30. minutes: you also see again the measure of the Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusa B C 80. degrees 8. minutes on the Quadrant of Altitude, counted between the <hi>Zenith</hi> and the first Meridian.</p>

Yet because letting fall a Perperdicular is so frequent in all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that treat of <hi>Trigonometry,</hi> I have inserted this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme also.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In the Oblique Triangle of the fromer Problemes there is given the sides A B 38½ degrees, and B C 25. degrees, and the Angle C 25. degrees 24. minutes; It is required to let fall a Perpendicular as B <hi>a</hi> from the Angle B. upon the Base A C; and to know both the measure of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, and the parts it divides the Base into.</p>
               <p>Therefore Elevate the Pole of the Globe above the Horizon so much as is the measure of the Angle C, which in this Example is 25. degrees 24. minutes, and bring the intersection of the first Meridian with the Equinoctial to the East point of the Horizon; so shall the Angle at the East point of the Horizon comprehended between the Horizon and the first Meridian be equal to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle C: then count in the first Meridian from the East point of the Horizon the measure of the side B C 25. degrees, and having the Quadrant of Altitude screwed to the <hi>Zenith</hi> bring the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated edge of it to these 25. degrees, so shall the Arch of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon comprehended between the East point and the lower end of the Quadrant of Altitude be the number of degrees that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular falls upon the Base, counted from the Angle C to <hi>a,</hi> which in this Example is 21¾ degrees, and the Arch of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of Altitude comprehended between the Horizon and the first Meridian is the measure of the Perpendicular B <hi>a</hi> 11. degrees.</p>
               <p>And thus by letting fall this Perpendicular you have two Right angled Spherical Triangles made, the one B <hi>a</hi> C, wherein is found C <hi>a,</hi> 21¾ degrees, B C 25. degrees B <hi>a</hi> 11. degrees C 25. degrees 24. minutes, and <hi>a</hi> the Right Angle: There remains only the angle B unknown; which you must find by turning the Triangle, as was taught Prob. 1. The other Right angled Spherical Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle made, is B <hi>a</hi> A, wherein is found A <hi>a</hi> (Complement of 21 2/4 degrees to 60 degrees (the whole Base before given) 38¼ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, A B 38. degrees 30. minutes, B <hi>a</hi> 11. degrees, and <hi>a</hi> the Right Angle; which is more then enough to find the Angl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> whereupon the Pole is called the Pole Arctick, for that it is neer unto that Constellation. It is also called <hi>Helice minor,</hi> because of the smal revolution which it maketh round about the Pole: or rather of <hi>Elice,</hi> a Town in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> wherein <hi>Calysto</hi> the great Bear, and mother to the less, was bred. It is called <hi>Cynosura,</hi> because this Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it carry the name of a Bear, yet it hath the taile of a Dog: Last of all, it is termed <hi>Phoenice,</hi> because that <hi>Thales,</hi> who first gave the name to this Constellation, was, a <hi>Phoenician:</hi> And therefore the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> being taught how to use it in their Navigations, did call it by the name of the Country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Thales</hi> was born. It consisteth of 7. stars, which the Latines call <hi>Septemtriones;</hi> because by their continual motion, those seven stars do as it were wear the Heavens. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> call them all <hi>Bosina,</hi> that is, an <hi>Horn;</hi> because they may be very well brought into that form; whereof that which is in the end of the tail, is called the <hi>Pole-star,</hi> by reason of the neareness thereof unto the Pole of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is distant (according to the opinion of most) from the true Pole, but 23. deg. 30. min. The Arabians

call it <hi>Alrukaba:</hi> And of the <hi>Scythians</hi> it is said to be an <hi>Iron nail,</hi> and is worshipped by them as a God. The two stars that are in the sholders of the <hi>Bear,</hi> are called <hi>Guards,</hi> of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish word <hi>Guardare,</hi> which is to behold; because they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be looked unto, in regard of the singular use which they have in Navigation.</p>
               <p>The reason why this Constellation was brought into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, is diversly set down, and first in this manner: <hi>Saturn</hi> having received of the Oracle that one of his Sons should banish him out of his kingdom, determined with himselfe to kill all the men children that he should beget: whereupon he gave command to <hi>Ops</hi> his wife, being then great, that she should shew him the child so soon as ever it was born: But she bringing forth <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and being greatly delighted with his hair, gave the child unto two Nymphs of <hi>Crete,</hi> dwelling in the mount <hi>Dicte;</hi> whereof this was one, and was called <hi>Cynosura;</hi> the other was <hi>Helice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jupter,</hi> after that (according to the Oracle) he had bereft his Father of the kingdom, in recompence of their paines and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, translated them both into the Heavens, and made of them two Constellations; the <hi>Lesser Bear,</hi> and the <hi>Greater Bear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Othersome say that it was <hi>Arcas,</hi> the son of <hi>Calysto;</hi> and they tell the tale on this manner. <hi>Calysto</hi> a Nimph of singular beauty, daughter to <hi>Lycaon</hi> King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> induced by the great desire she had of hunting, became a follower of the Goddess <hi>Diana.</hi> After this, <hi>Jupiter</hi> being enamored with her beauty and out of hope, by reason of her profession, to win her love in his own person, counterfeited the shape of <hi>Diana,</hi> lay with <hi>Calysto,</hi> and got her with child; of whom was born a son, which was called <hi>Arcas. Diana,</hi> or rather <hi>Juno,</hi> being very much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here-with, turned <hi>Calisto</hi> into a <hi>Bear. Arcas</hi> her son at the Age of fifteen, hunting in the woods by chance lighted upon his mother in the shape of a <hi>Bear:</hi> who knowing her son <hi>Arcas,</hi> stood stil, that he might come near unto her, and not be afraid: but he fearing the shape of so cruel a Beast, bent his bow of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to have slain her: Whereupon <hi>Jupiter</hi> to prevent the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, translated them both into Heaven, and of them made two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Constellations: unto the <hi>lesser Bear,</hi> there belongs but one star unformed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. URSA MAIOR, the <hi>Greater Bear,</hi> called also of the Greeks <hi>Arctos,</hi> and <hi>Helice,</hi> consisteth of 27. stars: Among the

The reason of the Translation of this Constellation into the Heaven, is at large set down in the other Constellation, and therefore needs not here to be repeated. This Constellation was first invented by <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Palamedes</hi> the Greek: and in great use among the Grecians; and this is to be noted both in this and the former Constellation, that <hi>they never set under the Horizon, in any part of Europe:</hi> which though it fall out by reason of their scituation in the Heavens; yet the Poets say, that it came to pass through the displeasure and hatred of <hi>Juno;</hi> who for that she was by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listo</hi> made a Cuckquean, and they notwithstanding (as she took it) in dispight of her, were translated into Heaven, requested her brother <hi>Neptune,</hi> that he should never suffer those Stars to set within his Kingdom: To which request <hi>Neptune</hi> condiscended; so that in all <hi>Europe</hi> they never come neer unto the Sea, or touch the Horizon. If any one marvel, that (seeing she hath the form of a <hi>Bear)</hi> she should have a tail so long; Imagine that <hi>Jupiter</hi> fearing to come too nigh unto her teeth, laid hold on her tail, and thereby drew her up into heaven; so that she of her selfe being very weighty, and the distance from the Earth to the Heaven very great, there was great likelyhood that her tail must stretch. The unformed stars belonging to this Constellation are eight.</p>

This was the Dragon that kept the Golden Apples in the Orchard of the Hesperides, (now thought to be the Islands of <hi>Cape de Virde)</hi> and for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and watchfulness, was afterwards translated into heaven: Yet others say that he came into Heaven by this occasion; when <hi>Minerva</hi> withstood the <hi>Gyants</hi> fighting against the <hi>Gods;</hi> they to terrifie her, threw at her a mighty <hi>Dragon;</hi> but she catching him in her hands, threw him presently up into Heaven, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him there, as a memorial of that her resistance.

The four stars which are in the Garnish of the <hi>Centaures</hi> Spear, are accounted by <hi>Proclus</hi> as a peculiar Constellation, and are called by him <hi>Thyrsilochus,</hi> which was a Spear compassed about with vine leaves: but they are called by <hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Clavius,</hi> and other Astronomers, the stars of his Target. It should seem that they were deceived by the old translation of <hi>Ptolome,</hi> wherein <hi>Scutum</hi> is put for <hi>Hasta, i. e.</hi> the Target, for the Spear, as it is well noted by our Countryman M. <hi>R.

The Figure of which Wheel was afterwards placed in Heaven, to teach men to take heed how they be so saucie to make such courteous proffers unto other men wives. The Greeks call this Constellation by the name of <hi>Uraniscus,</hi> because of the Figure thereof: For it representeth the palate or roof of the mouth, which they call <hi>Uraniscus.</hi>

herefore withdraw and hide her self, as being ashamed that she was not so fortunate in matching her self as her sisters were. Some say, that that star which is wanting is <hi>Electra,</hi> the eldest daughter of <hi>Atlas,</hi> and that therefore it is so dim, because she could not abide to behold the destruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> but at that time and ever since, she hid her face.

               <p>Others say, that it was <hi>Astraea,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Astraeus,</hi> one of the Gyants that were called <hi>Titans,</hi> who fighting against the Gods, <hi>Aftraea</hi> took their parts against her own Father, and was therefore after her death commended unto the Heavens, and made one of the 12.

               <p>Others say, that it was <hi>Erigone,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Icarius,</hi> who for that her father was slain by certain drunken men, for very grief thereof did hang her self: but <hi>Jupiter</hi> taking pitty of the <hi>Virgin</hi> for her natural affection, translated her into Heaven.</p>
               <p>In her right wing there is one Star of special note, which by the Astronomers is called <hi>Vindemeator (i. e.)</hi> the gatherer of Graps.

But <hi>Ampelos</hi> in Harvest gathering Graps, and taking little heed to his footing, fell down out of the Vine, and brake his neck. <hi>Bacchus</hi> in memorial of his former affection, translated him into Heaven, and made him one of the principal Stars in this Constellation.

This <hi>Crocus</hi> was so forward in learning of the liberal sciences, and in the practise of feats of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that the Muses entreated <hi>Jupiter</hi> that he might have a place in Heaven. To whose request <hi>Jupiter</hi> inclining, made him one of the 12. Signes: And to the end that he might express the excellent qualities of the Man, he made his hinder parts like unto a Horse, thereby to signify his singular knowledge in Horse-manship: and by his Bow and Arrow, he declared the sharpness of his Wit. Whereupon the Astrologers have this conceit, that he that is born under <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> shall attain to the knowledge of many Arts, and be of prompt wit, and great courage. <hi>Virgil</hi> affirmeth this to be <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaur, who for his singular learning and Justice,

was made the Master of <hi>Achilles.</hi> At which time <hi>Hercules</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to visit him (for he had heard both of the worthiness of the School-master, and of the great hopes of the Scholler) brought with him his quiver of Arrows dipped in the blood of the Serpent <hi>Hydra;</hi> but <hi>Chiron</hi> being desirous to see his shafts, and not taking heed of them, being in his hand, let one of them fall upon his foot, and being greatly tormented, not only by the anguish of the poyson working in the wound, but much more because he knew himself to be immortal, and his wound not to be recovered by medicine, he was enforced to make request unto the Gods, that he might be taken out of the World, who pittying his case, took him up into Heaven, and made him one of the 12. Signes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. CAPRICORNUS, the <hi>Goat,</hi> it consisteth of 28. Stars.

               <p>Others say; that <hi>Saturn</hi> being desirous to devour his children,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62439:119"/>
his wife <hi>Ops</hi> presented him with a stone wrapped in a clout, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of his child: This stone stuck so fast in <hi>Saturn</hi> his throat as he would have swallowed it, that without doubt he had there-withall been choaked, had he not been relived by his wife, who by pressing the milke out of her breasts saved his life: the milke that missed his mouth (whereof you must suppose some sufficient quantity) fell on the Heavens, and running along made this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>Dr HOOD <hi>Commenting upon Constellations, saith;</hi> The Stars are brought into Constellations, for Instruction sake, things cannot be taught without names: to give a name to every Star had been troublesome to the Master and for the Scholler; for the Master to devise, and for the Scholler; to remember: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Astronomers have reduced many Stars into one Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that thereby they may tell the better where to seek them; and being sought, how to express them. Now the Astonomers did bring them into these Figures, and not into other, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereto by these three reasons: first these Figures express some properties of the Stars that are in them; as those of the <hi>Ram</hi> to to be hot and dry; <hi>Andromeda</hi> chained betokeneth imprisonment, the head of <hi>Medusa</hi> cut off signifieth the loss of that part: <hi>Orion</hi> with his terrible and threatning gesture, importeth tempest and terrible effects: The <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify poyson: The <hi>Bull</hi> insinuateth a melancholy passion: The <hi>Bear</hi> inferreth cruelty, &amp;c. Secondly, the Stars, (if not precisely, yet after a sort) do represent such a Figure, and therefore that Figure was assigned them: as for example, the <hi>Crown,</hi> both North and South: the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and the Triangle, represent the Figures which they have. The third cause was the continuance of the memory of some notable men, who either in regard of their singular pains taken in Astronomy, or in regard of some other notable deed, had well deserved of Man-kind.</p>
               <p>The first author of every particular Constellation is uncertain; yet are they of great antiquity; we receive them from <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> and he followed the <hi>Platonick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like intent had the Poets in these Stories: They saw that Astronomy being for commodity singular in the life of man, was almost of all men utterly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Hereupon they began to set forth that Art under these Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; that thereby such as could not be perswaded by commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, might by the Pleasure be induced to take a view of these matters, and thereby at length fall in love them.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST</hi> it seems not to be doubted, but <note place="margin">Articl.

For, among other Apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they saw the Sun dayly to change the places of its rising and setting; at certain times of the Year: to approach neerer to the Earth in its Diurnal arch, and at others again to mount up to a height much more sublime and remote from it: and that his coming neerer to the Earth made <hi>Winter,</hi> and his remove higher made <hi>Summer:</hi> we say, when they beheld these things; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62439:121"/>
they could not but seriously remark and consider this vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, according to which they might expect the Season would be more hard, or mild, to them in this lower Region of the World. Again, so admirably various did the Moon appear, in her seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral shapes and dresses of light, that she could not but invite mens eyes, and engage them to frequent Speculations: specially when she assumed those various faces or apparences, at set and certain Times; in respect whereof it came to pass, that every Nation measured their times and Seasons, by those her constant and perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical circuits; and this, because those periods succeded much more frequently, than the Erections and Depressions of the Sun. To these, we may add that beautifull shew of the Nightly Stars, undergoing likewise their Variations, according the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Seasons; and more particularly that bright star of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> rising sometimes later, sometimes earlier, and sometimes not at all before the Sun, and the like. But, what we shall principally note, is only this; that though Mankind was long, before they came to make inquiries into the Causes of these Coelestial chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and variations, restrained to set periods: yet they observed them from the very first Age, and not only admired, but also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated what they observed, to the uses of their Lives and their Successors. Here it might not be fruitless, to remember, that PROMETHEUS, who was imagined to have framed the first Man, was also imagined to have given him an erected Figure, and sublime Countenance; to the end he might the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously advance his eyes to the Heavens, and contemplate the glory and motions of the Coelestial Lights. But, because this is too General, and rude a way of observation; and it is our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to look back into those times <hi>wherein men first made such Observations of Sydereral bodies, as gave hem the hint and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of reducing them to Method, and founding the principles of the Art, or science of Astronomy, thereupon:</hi> we must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the monuments in <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> for the understanding of that obscure matter.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the light we expect from <hi>Sacred Leaves,</hi> would <note place="margin">

            <p>Again, the business might be deduced from not long after the Flood, if in Scripture we could find but the least word from whence might be argued the truth of what the same Author writes; namely that the <hi>Egyptians were taught Astronomy, by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> Probable enough it is, we confess, that <hi>Berosus</hi> and others, quoted aswell by <hi>Josephus,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius,</hi> had read some such thing in some Books of the old Rabbins: but that the same should be fetched from Holy Writ, is most improbable, therein being no mention at all of any such thing. Besides, there are pious and learned Doctors, and among them <hi>Salianus,</hi> who will not allow it to be so much as probable, that <hi>Abraham</hi> should instruct the Egyptians in Astronomy: because of the very smal time of his stay among them in Egypt. It is written indeed, that <hi>Abraham came from Ur of the Chaldeans:</hi> but not that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> Astronomy from the Chaldeans, or that he delivered it from them to the Egyptians. And therefore they conclude, that what <hi>Josephus</hi> said of <hi>Abrahams</hi> reading Astronomy in Egypt, may with more probability be imputed to his Great-grand child, <hi>Joseph.</hi> Concerning Him, therefore, we read (in truth) that he was singularly favourable to the Priests in Egypt, at such time, as all the rest of the people mortgaged their lands to the King, for bread, during that wofull and long Famine. For, He excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62439:122"/>
the Lands belonging to the Priesthood, and (as the Text saith) assigned them certain portions out of the publick Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> so that from hence may be proved (what <hi>Aristotel</hi> tells us, from other Authority) that amongst the Egyptians, the most ancient Nation, the Priests were exempted from labour, and left to <note place="margin">1. Polit. cap. and 1 Metaph. cap. 1.</note> the easy imploiment of their minds: and that this gave them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to invent and constitute the Mathematiques: and yet for all this, it is not written, either that <hi>Joseph</hi> taught those Egyptian Priests the Mathematiques, or that they taught them to him. And, perhaps that Favour He shewed the Priests, was an argument not only of the Respect and Veneration, born them by the King and all his people; but also of his particular Gratitude toward them; in that He, who had been bred up only to Sheppardry and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try imployments, and was wholy ignorant of all Arts and Sciences, at his first comming among them being afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the height of a Courtier, and lustre of a Favorite, had bin instructed by them in something more noble and sublime. And truely, the Divine <hi>Moses,</hi> not long after admitted into the same Court, is not delivered so much to have erudited any others, as to have been himself <hi>learned in all the Wisdom of the Egyptians.</hi> Nevertheless, considering that this Wisedom of the Egyptians, <note place="margin">Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion of <hi>Moses</hi> seems to be the most Ancient monument of the Science of the Stars, that can be found in Holy Writ.</p>
            <p>Astronomy, you see, is of great Antiquity, even upon the Records of Divinity; and might be proved of much greater, could we but evince (what some alleage) that the History of <hi>Job</hi> was penn'd by <hi>Moses,</hi> as living a good while after him. Because <hi>Job</hi> there mentions <hi>Arcturus, Orion,</hi> and the <hi>Hyades,</hi> or watery Constellation: and therefore it must be, that before <note place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> that time the Stars had been ranged and dispossed into certain Asterisms according to some certain method or artificial Theory then in use. But, be the time of his life never so uncertain, yet we may certainly observe from the History thereof; that it seems <hi>Job,</hi> being an Alien to the Hebrews, derived his knowledge of God from that which in Scripture is called, <hi>Coelorum Exercitus,</hi> the <hi>Host of Heaven.</hi> Forasmuch, as the Invisible things of God are not so well learned from any visible things of Nature, or the effects of his Wisedom and Power, as from the Coelestial

            <p>Besides, it is in the Fiction, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> took his Father, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> bound him, and precipitated him into Hell.

            <p>As for <hi>Hyperion; Diodorus</hi> hath a tradition, that he being <note place="margin">3.

            <p>Last of all comes <hi>Japetus,</hi> who also was the Sonne of <hi>Coelus,</hi>

We shall not insist upon what follows in the same Author, namely that this <hi>Prometheus</hi> was the first, who introduced <hi>Astrology</hi> to the <hi>Assyrians</hi> (not far from <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus:)</hi> it being more usefull for us now to observe, that He was imagined to have stolen Fire from Heaven, for the inanimation of Man, for no other reason, but because he infused this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch't Knowledge into the breasts of men, and inflamed their souls with the desire and love thereof. For, as to the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for as much as <hi>Belus</hi> was the same with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> among the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> testifies: it is He rather, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted both the most sacred of their Dieties, and the Inventor <note place="margin">lib. 2. lib. 37, o. 10.</note> of this Sideral Science; as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms.</p>

               <note place="margin">Atreus <hi>and</hi> Thyestes.</note> and <hi>Thyestes</hi> about supreme dominion.

Aetherial Matters from <hi>Egypt.</hi> It being manifest therefore, that the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> or their Priests, are the only men, that ought to be admitted to a Dispute with the <hi>Assirians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians,</hi> or their Philosophers, concerning the Antiquity of Observations; and that their several Pleas seem equally reasonable.

But, what concerns aswell the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> their Observations are to be distinguisht (according to the division vulgarly received into (1.) <hi>Astronomical,</hi> and (2) <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical:</hi> the former relating to the Motions, Magnitudes, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and proportion of the Stars; the Latter to the Effects of them, which they conjectured were dependent on the Vertues
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62439:126"/>
and Influences of Heavenly Bodies, aswell in the affections of the Air, as in the actions and affairs of Mankind. For, both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being wonderfully prone to Supersttition, and surprised with excess of Admiration at the <hi>Eclipses</hi> of the Sun and Moon, when they first beheld them; and observing ever now and then some Stars that moved in Courses contrary to the <hi>West,</hi> they began presently to think, that those apparences hapned not without natural Causes; and that it remained only on Mans part, to Study how those events might come to be fore-known, which those apparences did portend. Hereupon, having attributed the most powerfull Vertue to the five wandering Stars (as <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">loc. citat.</note> testifieth particularly of the <hi>Chaldaeans)</hi> as understanding them to be the Proclaimers of the will and purposes of the Gods; because they sometimes arose, and sometimes set in various places of the Heavens; because they varied their magnitude and colour: therefore they conceived, that they ought to adress their Studies and Disquisitions principally to these varieties. And, because they imagined, that the higher the place was, from whence they should observe these Wandering Stars, the more clearly and distinctly might they be discerned; they builded Structures of vast altitude; and particularly that immense Tower at <hi>Babylon,</hi> described by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> from the highest area whereof (where <note place="margin">lib. 1.</note> stood also the Temple of <hi>Belus)</hi> they might exactly behold and observe the rising and setting of the Stars, and other Syderal occurrences They took notice likewise, that those five <hi>Planets</hi> did keep almost the same Course, as the Sun and Moon; and thereupon they pointed out the Zodiack, imagining that there must be some eminent vertue in that part of the Heavens, because all the <hi>Planets</hi> kept constantly to it. And this Zodiack they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 12. parts, or Signes; because the Moon run it over 12. times, and the Sun only once, in one Year: and according to the number of the Dayes, during which the Sun was in passing through one Signe, they distinguished each Signe again into 30. parts, which we call Degrees. I shall not recount to you, how they would have Twelve Principal Dieties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to these 12. Signes, whereof each had his particular regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over his proper Signe and Moneth dependent thereupon: nor how they substituted thirty of the fixt Stars, to assist the <hi>Planets,</hi> and called them <hi>Concelling Gods:</hi> nor how they placed 12. Stars always visible in the North, for government of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62439:127"/>
the Living; and as many more in the South, alwaies visible, for the government of the Dead, there gathered together; with many other the like dreams and ridiculous absurdities. But the thing I think most worthy your notice, is, <hi>by what rude kind of artifice they distinguished the Zodiack into 12. Signes;</hi> as we find it described, concerning the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> by <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ad Astrolog. 1. in Somn. 21.</note> and concerning the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by <hi>Macrobius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner this. They took a vessell with a small hole in the bottom, and filling it with Water, suffered the same to distill Drop by Drop into another Vessell, placed beneath to receive it; and this from the moment of the rising of some one Star or other, observed in one Night, untill the Moment of its rising again the next Night following. The Water fallen down into the Receiver, they divided into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2. equal parts, and having two other smaller vessells in readiness each of them fit to contain one twelfth part of the Water, they again poured all the Water into the upper Vessel, and strictly marking the rising of some one Star in the Zodiack, they at the same Moment gave the Water leave to distill into one of the smaller Vessells, and so soon as that was filled, observing likewise another rising Star, they put under another small Vessell; and so alternately shifting the small vessels, they noted, if not in one Night, yet in many, the twelve Stars, by which they might discriminate the whole Zodiack into twelve equal parts. Now with what Art and exactness these Ancients measured out the Heavens, may be conjectured from this one example. I might adferr another foppery of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> from the same <hi>Empiricus,</hi> who relates; that taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the future fortunes of Men did depend on their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Horoscope, or Signe rising at their Birth, when they had a mind to divine in this Kind; Two of their wise men agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the calculation of the Nativity of the Person proposed: the one stood by the Mother in Travell, the other on some high place neer at hand; and as he that was below gave the Signe, that the Infant was then newly come into the World, the other above took care to observe the Signe, that was just then newly risen. <note place="margin">ibid. cap. 20.</note> But, it will be of more use for us to hear what <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> They, when they would know the Diameter of the Sun, had in readiness a Vessell of Stone, hollowed to the form of an Hemisphere, exactly made, with a style or Gnomen erected in the middle, and twelve Horary Lines drawn within.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62439:127"/>
And on the very Day of the Equinox, observing the Moment, when the upper Limbus of the Sun first shewed it self above the Horizon; they marked that place on the brim of the Vessel, on which the Gnomen cast its shadow. Then again marking that place on which the shadow ended, when the lower Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus of the Suns body appeared just above the edge of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; they measured the space or distance betwixt the two marks of the Shadowes, and found it to be the ninth part of an hour, or the hundred and eight part of the Hemisphere, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the two hundred and sixteenth part of the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit: and from thence they deduced, that the Diameter of the Sun was the two hundredth and sixteenth part of its whole Orb; (which, in truth, is the 700th neer upon) or did contain one Degree and an hundred Minutes; which yet is no more than halfe a degree, or 31. Minutes, at most. To this we might su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-ad, that it was the practice of elder times, to commensurate the Diameter of the Sun by an Hydrologie, or Vessel of Water; collecting the same from part of the Water flowing down the whole Day, which had dropped until the Sun was wholly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen; as is insinuated by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and deduced from <hi>Capella:</hi> but <hi>Cleomedes</hi> hath at large declared, that this way of measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by Water falling slowly and equally from Vessel to Vessel, was an Invention of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Now the reason, why we touch upon these particulars, was only to satisfy, that (as we said afore) no great matter in Astronomy was ever observed either by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or by the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if you desire any further Argument thereof; Pray take this. They were very far from suspecting that the Fixt Stars had any motion proper to themselves; or that they had any Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity (excepting only that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thought <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> to move round about the Sun, as their center; as is affirmed by <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and some others) or that the Sun had any <hi>Apogaeum</hi> at all, with many other Particulars fully as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. Which doubtless must be the reason, why they invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> by which they might regulate themselves, in making their Caluclations of the various motions of the heavenly bodies. And <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> not long since complaind, that we have not our <hi>Astronomy</hi> free from the trouble of <hi>Hypotheses;</hi> such as the Interpreters of <hi>Aristotel</hi> themselves, and <hi>Proclus</hi> on <hi>Timaeus</hi> have recorded the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> to have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62439:128"/>
had amongst them: while, incroth, he complaind, that we had not our <hi>Astronomy</hi> as rude wild and imperfect, as theirs was. For, however some <hi>Hypotheses</hi> are more simple (and so more easy) than other-some: yet it is absolutely impossible, that <hi>Astronomy</hi> should consist without some or other. Hereupon, they could observe, indeed, that the Planets were one while Direct in their Progress, another while Retrogarde, and then again Stationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that they in their wanderings sometimes inclined towards the <hi>North,</hi> and sometimes deflected again toward the <hi>South:</hi> but all that while, they could neither comprehended the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of those various apparences, nor calculate them by numbers. The most they could doe, was darkly to represent those motions, by certain <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> as in particular by the windings and flexures of Serpents; and the motion of the Sun, by only a Beetle rowling his pill of dung backward: as we may read in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus:</hi> and then came <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who having learned that variety of motions among them, was the first who invented <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of various Orbs, for the Solution of the <hi>Phenomena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, they were very far from attaining the determinate places of the Fixt Stars, according to Longitude and Latitude; or according to their Right Ascension, and Declination: so that neither could they define the true places of the Planets, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Fixt Stars, nor (consequently) designe any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations with due exactness. And truely, this was the Cause why <hi>Hipparchus</hi> met with no Observations, either of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians,</hi> by which he could receive the least help or advantage, toward his composing either <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> or Tables, to represent the motions of the Five errant Stars: and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was the first, who partly by the benefit of Observations left him by <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> and partly by those he made himself, became able to attempt such a Work; as stands recorded in his <hi>Almagest.</hi> There were only the <hi>Eclypses,</hi> which both these Nations had set down: as observed in their Commentaries: and those only so, as that from Past, they might be able to conjecture somthing of what were to Come. Not from the motions of Sun and Mon, exactly calculated by the help of Tables; but having learnd from common experience, that every ninetneenth Year, <hi>Eclypses</hi> did return again upon the same Day, for the most part: thereupon they endeavoured to praedict what <hi>Eclipses</hi> would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and the time when; and this after they had perceived not any
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62439:128"/>
               <hi>Anomaly</hi> in the Sun, but some certain Inequality in the Moon, which reducing to a medium, they concluded that the Moon did every Day run throug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thirteen Degrees, and a little more than one sixth part of a degree; as <hi>Geminus</hi> delivers of the <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But in their predictions of <hi>Lunar Eclipses,</hi> they were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more confident; aswell because these <hi>Eclipses</hi> usually uturn, for the three Ages next succeding, within the compass of the same Dayes; as because it is very rare, in respect of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Earths shadow, but the Moon, either in the whole, or some part of her, more or less, falls into it: but, because (as to <hi>Solary Eclypses)</hi> the Moon is both so small, and hath so large a Parrallax, as that she doth not for the most part intercept the light of the Sun from the Earth; therefore was it (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> witnesseth specially of the <hi>Babylonians)</hi> that they durst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>Eclypses</hi> of the Sun to come, to any certaine time; but if they predicted any, with limitation of time, they alwayes (to save their credit, in case of failing) annexed this Condition, <hi>If the Gods be not prevailed upon, by Sacrifices and Praiers, to avert them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truth is, these <hi>Astronomers</hi> were also Priests, and it was their interest to cast in this Proviso. For, being ambitious to be reputed interpreters of the Will of the Gods to the People, and so both knowing in things to come, and skillfull in such Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherewith their respective Deities were most attoned and delighted: unwilling to be thought able to predict nothing, and as unwilling again to be found erring in their chief predictions, they wrapt up all in Misteries, and amused the vulgar with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious opinions and rites. The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in a great part of their sacred Worship, had recourse to the <hi>Astrological</hi> Books of their <hi>Mercurius</hi> (one of the Order of the Fixt Stars; a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of the Conjunction of Sun and Moon; a third and fourth, of their rising.) which with what ceremonious Pomp they used to carry about with them, in a kind of solemne Procession, you may find amply described by <hi>Clem. Alexandrinus.</hi> Nor is it <note place="margin">lib. 6. stromat.</note> strange that those Priests accounted so sacred and knowing, should also be estemed for Prophets. Further, you meet with no mention of the Five Errant Stars, all this while; and the reason seems to be, because they attributed an energie of them only as they were referrable to the Inerrant or Fixt, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as they possest this or that part of some Signe in the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62439:129"/>
and together with it had their rising, or setting. For, so much did they ascribe to the Zodiack, as that the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and (in imitation of them, the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Indians)</hi> thought, that each decimal of degrees, or thirds of the Signes, (and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> came as low as to each single degree) could not be varied in the rising, but some eminent variation most happen, especially in him, who should be borne at that time. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was it, that the <hi>Egptians</hi> made that great Circle of Gold (described in <hi>Diodorus)</hi> of a cubit in thickness, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sixty five cubits in circumference (plundred at last by <hi>Cambyses)</hi> that upon each cubits space might be inscribed each Day of the Year, 365. Dayes in the whole round, and also what Stars did rise, what set upon each Day, nay the very hour of their respective rising and setting, and what they did signifie: and whereas others used to assigne the form of some Animal or other, to each ten degrees; they assigned one to each single de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and so made their harsolations or conjectural predictions accordingly. For Example; to the first degree of <hi>Aries</hi> they assigned the figure of a Man, holding a Sicle or hook in his right hand, and a Sling in his left; to the second, a Man with a Dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, his right hand stretcht forth, and a staff in his left; and so of the rest; then annexing the signification to each, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that he, who should have the first degree of <hi>Aries</hi> for his Horoscope, should be some part of his life a Husbandman, and the rest of it a Soldier; that he, who should be born under the second, should be contentious, quarrelsom, and envious; and so of the rest, all which <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath fully deduced from <hi>Aben Ezra.</hi> In a Word; what ever knowledge either the <hi>Egyptians</hi> or <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> had of the Stars; certain it is, they referred it wholly to <hi>Astronomantie,</hi> or Divination by Stars: and therefore among them there flourisht, no true and genuine <hi>Astronomy,</hi> but a spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and false, one <hi>i. e.

            <p>But, to return back to the more primitive <hi>Greeks;</hi> I remember <note place="margin">
                  <hi>and next of</hi> Thales Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</note> I said, that <hi>Thales Melesius</hi> was accounted the First, who after old <hi>Hesiod</hi> and <hi>Homers</hi> Dayes, enquired into the Order of the Stars. And, certainly He was the Man, who among the <hi>Grecians</hi> may challenge the Palme; as to Antiquity; for, <hi>Apuleius</hi> calls him, <hi>ut antiquissimus, sic peritissimus Astrorum Contemplator,</hi> and <hi>Eudemus</hi> in <hi>Laertius</hi> attesteth, that this was <note place="margin">lib. 1.</note> the Opinion of most, adding moreover, that <hi>Xenophanes</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> highly admired him, for that he had first predicted the <hi>Eclypses</hi> and Conversions of the Sun; and that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> witnesseth as much. And whereas <hi>Apuleius</hi> further subjoyns, that he found out the motions and oblique tracts of the Syderal Lights: <hi>Pliny</hi> ascribes that to <hi>Auaximan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Thales Milesius,</hi> (whence he was said <hi>Rerum fores aperuisse,</hi> to have opened the Doors of Celestial matters) and <hi>Diodorus</hi> to one <hi>Oenopides Chius:</hi> which <hi>Thales</hi> could not yet be ignorant of the Obliquity of the Zodiack, when he had written of the <hi>Solstices,</hi> and <hi>Equinoxes,</hi> and had conversed a long time with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their own Country, as <hi>Laertius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members. Further, it is delivered to us, that among others, he predicted that notable <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the Sun, which hapned in the time of the warre betwixt the <hi>Meads</hi> and <hi>Lydians;</hi> which he could not doe by any other reason, but only because, coming
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62439:131"/>
newly out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had learned, that <hi>Eclipses</hi> generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon the same Day after the space of nineteen Years; and having taken notice of one, that fell out 19. Years before, he concluded that there would be one at such a time. Nor is there reason why any should think, that otherwise his whole life might be sufficient to observe all the motions of the Sun and Moon, as from thence to be able to invent all things necessary for the calculation of the times of their Several <hi>Eclipses.</hi> Moreover, it <note place="margin">in vit.

For truely, this was an eminent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Tenent in his School; as may be understood not only from <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the general, but also from <hi>Laertius</hi> in particular of <note place="margin">2. de coelo. 13. de Arenar, num.</note>

            <p>Furthermore, in the next Age after <hi>Thales,</hi> or neere upon, comes <hi>Cleostratus</hi> (the same who was beleeved to have depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. <note place="margin">After these suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus.</hi>

               </note> the New-Moons, and Full-Moons Eclyptical, that they did not return upon the same Dayes, till after full nineteen Years: and thereupon he became the Author of the <hi>Enneadecaeteris,</hi> or <hi>Period,</hi> or <hi>Cycle</hi> of 19. Years. In respect of which discovery, together with the Heliotrope, or Sun Diall he made at Athens, and some other the like Inventions, he was in eminent esteem among the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But as concerning that <hi>Period; Callip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> familarly acquainted with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> discovering it to be too long, by the fourth part of a Day; inferred, that from four Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods one whole Day ought to be detracted: and so erected a new Period, or Cycle of Sixty six Years, or four times nine, at the end of which one Day was to be cut off; and this was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Callippik Period,</hi> and remained in use for a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. After him succeeded <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> who detecting this <hi>Period,</hi> to be yet too long; demonstrateth that after four <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippik Periods,</hi> or three hundred and four Years, there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main one whole Day too much. And in truth, the experience of many succeding Ages declared, that to this detraction of <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> nine or ten Years over and above were to be expected.

However, it is worthy our notice, that the <hi>Period</hi> of <hi>Meton,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Conection of it, applied by <hi>Callippus,</hi> was of long use in the Church under the name of the <hi>Golden-Number:</hi> though wanting the Application of <hi>Hipparchus</hi> his Correction: also, a mistake of about four Dayes, relating to the New and Full Moons, crept into the account, even from the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel; which was one of the two main causes of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kalender in the eighty second Year of the last Age.</p>
            <p>And now we have an opportunity to speak more expresly of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Articl. 7. Eudoxus,</hi> who first discovered the necessitie of manifold <hi>Spheares.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> so frequently mentioned. This man, well understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after his return out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that not only the Sun and Moon, but also the five Errant Stars, did keep their courses round in the Zodiack; and so, as that aswell the Sun and Moon, as those wandering Stars did sometimes vary their latitude, or deviate from the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> Line in the midle of the Zodiack; (for, he thought that the Sun was also extravagant, as well as the rest; and again, that the other Planets did not only go forward, but were also some times upon their retreat backward; and somtimes made a hault or stood still: we say, pondering all these various motions in his mind, and casting about what might be the reasons thereof in nature; he at last imagined to himself, that besides the <hi>Aplanes</hi> or Sphear of Fixt Stars, which being supreme, carried all the rest toward the <hi>West,</hi> there ought also to be allowed three other Sphears, as well to the Sun, as to the Moon, and four to each one of the other Errant Stars; of which one, and that the highest, should follow the Impression of the Fixt Stars, or rather of the <hi>Primum Mobile;</hi> the next to that should move counter to the First, or toward the <hi>East;</hi> the third make the deviation from the <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> or midle of the Zodiack; and the fourth, or lowest, cause in the Stars their Direction, Station and Retrogradation, and that by a certain Vibration, or Waving to and agen. So that he supposed in all, twenty seven <hi>Sphears,</hi> and all those Concentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, that the Superior might carry on the Inferior, and these might be turned round within those. Afterwards, <hi>Callippus</hi> adjoyned two <hi>Sphears</hi> to the Sun, two to the Moon, and one a peece to <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> and so made thirty three. And <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to all the <hi>Sphears,</hi> which did not follow the motion of the <hi>Aplanes,</hi> or <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> (excepting only the Lunar <hi>Sphears)</hi> added as many more, which he called the Revolvent ones, to the end he might conform them to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62439:133"/>
of the Inerrant <hi>Sphear,</hi> or <hi>Primum Mobile:</hi> and so in the whole he constituted Fifty six <hi>Sphears;</hi> for as much, at least, as we can collect from his own context. Now all these, and even <hi>Plato</hi> himself likewise, thought that the Moon was the lowest of all the <hi>Planets;</hi> next to her, the Sun; and above the Sun the five wandering Stars: Nor indeed doth it appear, that <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> himself Living a whole Age or two after them, represented the <hi>Planets</hi> in any other, than this very order, in that so famous <hi>Sphear</hi> of his In which though <hi>Claudian</hi> tells us, that no more was represented, but only the motions of the Sun and Moon;

            </p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Cicero</hi> adds other motions, when speaking of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> he saith; <q>when he collected together the motions of the <note place="margin">2. de divinat.</note> Moon, Sun, and five wandering Stars; he did the same as that God, who in <hi>Platoes Timaeus</hi> framed the World, that one and the same Conversion might regulate sundry motions, most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent each from other in slowness and swiftness</q>. But, <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> afterwards finding, that aswell the Sun, as the Moon and the other five Stars did come somtimes neerer to the Earth, and sometimes again mounted up farther from it; and plainly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that that particular apparence could not possibly be explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by those <hi>Sphears,</hi> that were all Concentrical to the Earth: therefore, wholly rejecting them, he resolved, that the motions of the <hi>Planets</hi> were to be accounted Eccentrick; and though he could not himself determine each particular, he yet demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the way, in which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> afterwards insisting, accomplisht the Invention. But, before wee advance further, we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate two or three Persons of note, by whose Observations both <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> profited very much.

                  </gap>s,</hi> whose Observations of something about the Fixt Star; <hi>Ptolomy</hi> made great use of, in order to his demonstrating that the Fixt Stars never change their latitude. Afterwards (scarce
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62439:133"/>
in Age) succeded <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> who being <hi>Library-keeper</hi> to <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy Evergeta</hi> the fomer, perswaded him to set up the <hi>Armillae</hi> in the <hi>Porticus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> which <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prolom. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> afterwards made use of; and himself, among other things obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Obliquity of the Zodiack was of twenty three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and fifty one minutes; which account <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> constantly adhered to.</p>
            <p>Now that we may at length remember the great <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Articl. 8. Hipparchus,</hi> who first obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the places of the Fixt Stars, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Long. and Latitude.</note> who florish't neer upon an hundred and forty Years before Christ: truely, we find it no easy task to recount, how highly <hi>Astronomy</hi> was beholding to him. For, in the first place, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that foresaid Observation of <hi>Timocharis,</hi> with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; albeit he could not conceive them to be in all points exact, yet because himself had found that <hi>Spica Virginis</hi> did not ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Equinoctial point by more than six degrees, and the other Stars in the like Proportion: he thence understood, that the Fixt Stars also were moved Eastward according to the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack; and thereupon wrote a Book of the <hi>Transgression of the Solstices &amp; Equinoxes.</hi> And, being that in his time, as not long agoe in <hi>Tycho Brahes,</hi> there appeared a certain New Star, he therefore came to doubt (to speak the language of <hi>Pliny</hi> 
               <note place="margin">lib. 2. cap. 26.</note> concerning him)<q> whether the like happened often, or not; and whether those Stars, that were thought to be fixt, had also some certain motion peculiar to themselves. Wherefore (as the same <hi>Pliny</hi> goes on) he attempted a task of difficulty sufficient even for the Gods themselves, namely to number the Stars for Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and reduce the heavenly Lights to a rule, so that by the help of Instruments invented, the particular place of each one, together with its magnitude, might be exactly designed: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men might discern, not only whether they disappeared, or newly appeared, but also whether they removed their Stations; as likewise, whether their magnitude encreased, or diminished; Leaving Heaven for and Inheritance for the Witts of succeding Ages, if any were found acute and industrious enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the mysterious orders thereof.</q> And this was the first time when the places of the Fixt Stars were observed and markt out according to Longitude and Latitude: and that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Fixt Stars, which he composed, is the very same, which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> afterward inserted into his <hi>Almagest.</hi> In the <note place="margin">lib. 7. cap.</note> next place, he denoted was positions sundry Stars had in respect

each of other; whether they were posited in a right Line; or in a triangular form; or in quadrate or square, &amp;c. as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest even from <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himself. Further, though the motions of <note place="margin">ibid cap. 1.</note> Sun and Moon were already in some measure known; he yet made that knowledge much more exact.

Years together.</note> having collected a long Series of <hi>Eclipses</hi> (namely, from the time of those <hi>Babylonish</hi> ones, in the Dayes of <hi>Mardocem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pades,</hi> down to those observed by himself, for full six hundred Years together.) and remarking, that neither the like <hi>Eclipses</hi> did return on the same Dayes, after the space of every nineteen Years, nor that after some recurses of ten <hi>Novennales,</hi> or ten times nine Years, any such <hi>Eclipses</hi> happened at the times supposed; and that the cause thereof consisted both in the various Latitude of the Moon, and the anticipation of her <hi>Nodi,</hi> or Knotts, and her Eccentricicy, by reason whereof her motions to her <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogeium</hi> were found to be sometimes slower, and those to her <hi>Perigeium</hi> more speedy: therefore, we say, He comprehended and gave Reasons for all these difficulties, and composed certain Hypotheses, and according to them, certain Tables, by which he could safely and exactly calculate and predict what <hi>Eclipses</hi> were to follow, how great they were, and when. And this was it, which <hi>Pliny</hi> remembred, when having spoken of <hi>Thales,</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius Gallus,</hi> he comes to mention <hi>Hipparchus.</hi>
               <q> After these (saith He) <hi>Hipparchus</hi> foretold the courses of both Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, for six hundred Years to come; comprehending the months, Dayes and hours of Nations, and the Scituations of Places, and turns of People: his age testifying, that he did all these great things, only as he was partaker of Natures Councels.</q> For, it must be, that <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> besides the precise times, when such or such <hi>Eclipses</hi> were to be visible to the Horizon of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Again, it is well worthy our recital, that <hi>Hipparchus</hi> labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with long desire both to constitute <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> and reduce into Tables the motions of the other <hi>Planets,</hi> or five wandering Stars; and yet not being able to furnish himself either from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or from his Country men the <hi>Grecians,</hi> with any
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62439:134"/>
competent Observations respective to those <hi>Planets,</hi> (for while the places of the Fixt Stars remained unknown, it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any such could be made) and again those he had himself made, were of a much shorter time, than was requisite for the establishing any thing certain and permanent in that sort: He therefore only digested such Observations as he had recorded by him, into the best order and method he could devise; and so left them for their use and improvement, who should come after him, in case any were found capable of understanding and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing them. And at length, by good fortune, it so fell out, that those his Observations came into the hands of <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> who comparing them with his own, and finding them judicious and exact, thereupon first began to erect both <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> and Tables of Motions fit for those <hi>Planets:</hi> yet not without much timerousness and diffidence; because his Observations being but few, nor of sufficient time, he durst not promise himself any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his Tables for any considerable space, or number of Years. But, for more assurance let us hear his own ingenious Confession in that point.<q> The Time (saith He) from whence <note place="margin">Almagest. lib. 9 cap 2.</note> we have the Observations of the <hi>Planets</hi> set down, is so vastly short, in comparison of the greatness of Coelestial vicissitudes, as that it renders all predictions, that are for any great number of Years to come, infirm and uncertain. And therefore I judge that <hi>Hipparchus</hi> (that zealous lover of truth) considering this difficulty, and withall receiving not so many true Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Ancients, as he bequeath'd to us, undertook indeed the business of the Sun and Moon, and demonstrated that it might be performed, by equal and circular motions: yet, as for that of the <hi>Planets,</hi> those Commentaries of his, which have come into our hands, clearly shews, that he attempted it not: but collecting all his own Observations concerning them together, into one order and method, for their more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous use, resigned them to the industry of after times; having first demonstrated, that they were not congruous to those <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> which the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> of those Dayes made use of. And, for Others; sure I am, that either they demonstrated nothing at all, or else only attempted the business, and left it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finisht. But, <hi>Hipparchus</hi> being eminently knowing in all kinds of learning, conceived, that he ought not (as others had done before him) to attempt, what he should not be able to<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62439:135"/>
accomplish.</q>
 So that we see, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was the first, who from true Observations, reduced the Motions of the <hi>Planets</hi> into <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses</hi> and Tables correspondent.</p>
            <p>But before we speak more particularly of him, who lived <note place="margin">Articl. 9.</note> about an hundred and thirty Years after Christ; forasmuch as in the space of time betwixt <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> these studies <note place="margin">Betwixt <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> came <hi>Sosigenes,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by whose help <hi>Jul. Caesar</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Calendar.</note> so florisht at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as that <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> returning thence, brought along with him that <hi>Sosigenes,</hi> by whose assistance he endeavoured the restitution of the <hi>Calendar,</hi> and so may be thought to have propagated the Study of Astronomy among the <hi>Romans:</hi> let us reflect a little upon that time, and see what care they then had of Celestial matters. In the first place, we are to lay aside the Commemoration of <hi>Sulpitius Gallus</hi> (of whom more then once afore, as one that falls not under this account, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom we may not yet forget, what <hi>Cato</hi> is induced by <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> saying. While we saw that <hi>Gallus</hi> dye, that familiar friend of thy Father, <hi>O Scipio,</hi> who was restless in measuring Heaven and Earth; I say, while we saw him dying even in that Study. How often did Day oppress him, when he had set himself to observe and describe somthing in the Night? and how often did Night op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press him, when he had begun his Speculations in the Morn? How was he delighted, when he had a long time before predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to us <hi>Eclipses</hi> of the Sun and Moon? &amp;c. For he was a man clearly singular, and in an Age when so great ignorance and neglect of good Arts tyrannized over mens minds, being himself studious and inquisitive, could not but have borrowed his skill either from <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> where having obtained a <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Eclipses,</hi> and the way of deducing them through the circuit of of nineteen Years (as we said afore) he became able to calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them, so as <hi>Cicero</hi> relates For, as to the rest; how great doe you think was the ignorance and neglect, nay even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of studies of this nature among the <hi>Romans?</hi> Why, truely so great, as that <hi>Virgil</hi> could not dissemble it, in the Poesy attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Anchisa,</hi> according to which the <hi>Romans</hi> should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed come to rule the World; but yet should yeeld to others, in learning to know the Stars, and describe the Heavens.

For, He plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived, that most, if not all the Errors, which had bin found in <hi>Astronomy</hi> even from its first foundation or original, took their rise chiefly from hence, that the Fixt Stars really were not in those places, in which they were supposed to be, by Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; But some of them were much neerer, and others again as much farther off; and this, whether because <hi>Hipparchus</hi> in the beginning had not with due exactness consigned all the Fixt Stars
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62439:138"/>
to peculiar places, which indeed he had designed by the Sextant's of degrees (and truely it is very difficult at once to invent any thing of Moment, and perfect the invention) or whether because the Transcribers of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> out of carelesness, or ignorance, had corrupted the Original Text in many places; or whether the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions afterward made, in respect of the Stars progress to the following Signes, had occasioned any mistake and imperfection in that Theory; or whether by any other unhappy cause what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Now, in Order to this great Work, of rectifying those fundamental Errors, it pleased Fate, that about the very same time, that truely generous and never enough commendable Prince <hi>William Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hassia,</hi> had zealously devoted his mind and industry to the same care, of restoring the Fixt Stars to their true mansions: but yet the honour he aimed at, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed only for the incomparable <hi>Tycho;</hi> who in an Heriocal bravery of Soul, had now resolved with himself to enterpise no less than the Instauration of the whole Science of <hi>Astronomy</hi> from its very fundamentals; and so to spare neither labour, nor cost (especially while he was so happy, as to have good part of his expences defraied by the liberal contributions of that eminent <hi>Mecenas, Frederick</hi> the <hi>II.</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded his name in immortal Characters on the leaves of Fame) that should be necessary to the making all Sorts of Observations requisite. As soon therefore as he had furnished himself with that <hi>Astronomical</hi> Colledge, or Tower for Observations, built by him in the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Huenna,</hi> to that purpose assigned him by the King, and furnished that Heavenly Cittadel by him called <hi>Uraniburg,</hi> with store of exquisite and magnificent Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Mathematical, he begun (having provided himself of sundry learned and competent Coadjutors) exactly to observe the Altitude of the Pole, in that place, by the Circum-polary Stars. By which understanding likewise the Altitude of the <hi>Equator,</hi> he pointed out the Equinoctial points, by the passing of the Sun through them: and attending besides to the middle parts of <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> he found out the <hi>Apogeium</hi> of the Sun, and the Eccentricity of it, and deduced its Course from the point of the <hi>Vernal Equinox.</hi> Moreover, from <hi>Venus,</hi> in the Day time compared with the Sun, and in the Night with the Fixt Stars; he endeavoured to search out the right Ascensions, and Declinations of the Fixt Stars: which the Ancients had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62439:138"/>
but fallaciously, by using the Moon, not <hi>Venus,</hi> to that purpose. And his success was as exquisite as his care in this, that he constituted that bright Star which is in the top of <hi>Aries,</hi> and ranged the chief of those in order along the Zodiack: and then advancing to enquire or rather find out the distances of the rest aswell from them, as each from other, he defined both the right Ascensions and Declinations of all; prescribed their several Longitudes and Latitudes, and added to the Catalogue of the Ancients about 200. other Stars, wholly by them omitted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Ancients, Living in an Horizon much more Southern, had observed and set down neer upon 200. Stars, that are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the <hi>Danish</hi> Horizon, which is highly Northern: and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> again collected about 200. more than they could discern; and as being somwhat small, he intermixed them among others of greater magnitude. Further, having in the mean space, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies observed the passings of all the Planets through the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and their several distances from the cheif Fixt Stars neerest to them: he laid such sollid foundations, as by them might be exactly known not only the true places of each, but also their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Motions. So that he came very neer the heighth of his noble hopes of building the whole Theory of <hi>Astronomy</hi> a new from the very ground, and of erecting compleat and everlasting Tables for Calculation thereupon: but, alas! prevented by an immature death, He could not accomplish his designe. It was very much, however, that He went so far, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o have recorded and bequeathed to Posterity such excellent Observations, by which <hi>Kepler</hi> was soon after enabled to compose an intire Theory, and make the Tables called the <hi>Rudolphine;</hi> and by which, and others afterward contriveable, whatever can be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in these Tables, may be fully supplied and perfected. And this among the rest deserves singular commendations, that He left us the Fixt Stars re-installed in their true mansions: wherein He alone, in few Years practice, performed and finished that prodigiously great Work, which no man, from the Dayes of <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> had either attempted, or in any measure advanced.</p>
            <p>I pass by many other admirable discoveries of his; as that he was the first, who demonstrated all Comets to be carried freely through the Etherial Spaces; that Refractions ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully considered and allowed for, and how; that he perceived that the <hi>Latitude</hi> of the Moon ought to be augmented by more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62439:139"/>
than a Quadrant, or fourth part, than had been conceived; that He almost demonstrately convinced the Latitudes of the Fixt Stars to be varied; that he excogitated an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which all those, who cannot allow of the <hi>Ptolomaicall,</hi> or fear to allow the <hi>Copernican,</hi> may well adhere to and defend; with many other things, as difficult in their Invention, as excellent in their use. And observe only how vastly he transcended all that went before him, in point of exactness and certainty. As for <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Mathematicall,</hi> it is well known, He made such, as for the condition of their matter, for the Vastness of their magnitude, for the variety of forms, for the care of their elaboration, for the preciseness of their divisions, and for the facility in using; as the World had never the like before. Again, so prodigious was his and his Coadjutors subtility, diligence, industry; that whereas the Observations of <hi>Hipparchus, Ptolomy,</hi> and all others before him, had bin marked out only by the Sixth or at most by the twelfth parth of degrees; he designed all his by the sixtieth parts of degrees, called Minutes, or Scruples, and very often also by subdivisions of Minutes. So that we may well demand what comparison can be made betwixt that gross way found out by <hi>Erastothenes,</hi> and approved and followed afterward by <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> for the Observation of the Obliquity of the Zodiack; and that most fine and exact one invented by <hi>Tycho?</hi> His being, by a division of the Meridian into 83, parts, and the Interval of the Tropicks deprehended to take up 11. of them, it appeared that the distance of one Tropick from the <hi>Equator,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to 5. of thoseparts and an half, or, by a reduction of them again to degrees, of 23. degr. 51. Min. and ⅓: and theirs, being by an hollowed Hemispear of Stone, with a Gnomon erected in the middle, as we have formerly described it; and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of subtility and exactness this way of commensuration could arrive, the meanest Novice in <hi>Astronomy</hi> may soon judge. That <hi>Quadram</hi> likewise of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> so much admired by ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; Pray, How vastly short did it come of the perfection of the least that <hi>Tycho</hi> used? And the same may be said of his <hi>Rules;</hi> for, that those <hi>Armillae,</hi> set up by <hi>Pt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is not necessary, we should here again review those machinaments, or engines, which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62439:139"/>
the old <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> made use of, either in discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Signes of the Zodiack, or taking the Diameter of the Sun: or those, which <hi>Aristarchus</hi> and <hi>Archimedes</hi> used, for commensurating the same Diamater. Only we cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the by, how <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> having aimed so neer the white of truth, in the matter of the Suns Diameter, and determining it to be the 720th. part of the Circle, or half a degree; as is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <note place="margin">de Acenar. num.</note> by <hi>Archimed:</hi> should yet err so widely in his Book of <hi>Magnitudes</hi> and <hi>Distances,</hi> as to make the Diameter of the Moon (which in truth; is very neer as great as that of the Sun) to be the 180th. part of the Circle, or 2. degr. when he called it <hi>the Fifteenth part of a Signe;</hi> which mistake of his was long since taken notice of by <hi>Pappus.</hi> Nor is there any necessity, why we should survey those Instruments, that <hi>Albateginus, Peurbacchius, Regiomontanus, Copernicus,</hi> and other more moderne <hi>Astronomers</hi> used: considering, that besides the <hi>Rules</hi> made by <hi>Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (which <hi>Bernardus Waltherus,</hi> his disciple, preserved, and had recourse to, in his Observations of the Suns Altitude) they came so short of the least of <hi>Tychoes,</hi> in point of exact reasoning, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude, that they deserve rather to be perpetually forgotten, than remembred to competition. However it is seriously to be wished, that the Observations made by those incomparable Instruments of His, may ly no longer concealed from the World (for by singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Providence, they have been hitherto preserved, as <hi>Gassendus</hi> attesteth, <hi>ïn the Life of Tycho)</hi> but soon be brought to Light. And this aswell for sundry weighty Considerations there alleadged by <hi>Gassendus;</hi> as for this, that not all the Stars, of which <hi>Tyeho</hi> hath given a copious Catalogue, in his <hi>Progymnasmata,</hi> may be found reduced to congruous Calculation (in as much as they doe not exactly correspond with the Heavens) and that various Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues have been pretended from the same, which are very much different each from other: for all the difficulties hereupon depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may soon be removed, and all mistakes rectified, by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Fountain, or Original observations, which! will clearly declare, what hath bin already corruptly deduced, and what may be at length carefully and demonstratively deduced from them.</p>
            <p>And, in the mean while, if <hi>Hipparchus</hi> his memory be so highly and (indeed) justly precious among learned men, for his great merrits in excogitating and framing Instruments, whereby to take the dimensions, distances, motions &amp;c. of Heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62439:140"/>
certainly, that of our <hi>Tycho</hi> ought to be as highly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us and all Posterity; since he alone, for so many Ages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether was found, that durst not only imitate him in those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime inventions; but so imitate, as very much to exceed him. For my part, truely; since <hi>Hipparchus</hi> may rightfully be called <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las the Second:</hi> I shall doe but justice to name <hi>Tycho, Hercules the Second,</hi> who releived his Predecessor, long languishing and ready to faint under so prodigious a burden; which doubtless was the Reason, why <hi>Kepler</hi> called him, the <hi>Modern Hipparchus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have we in a short Relation, rehearsed to you, what we could gather together, concerning the Original, Progress, and Advance of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> from the highest of times, of which there remain any Authentick memorials, down to the decease of <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> the Noble and the Great. As for what <hi>Additions</hi> this excellent Science hath received, by the industry of <hi>Astronomers</hi> in this present Age, by the help of the <hi>Telescope,</hi> whose Invention may seem to have been unhappily deferred too long, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till some Years after <hi>Tychoes</hi> death: they may be easily summed up. For, all that our Dayes can justly challenge the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of discovering, is (1.) the spotts in the Sun: (2.) the inequality of the superficies of the Moon: (3.) <hi>Venus</hi> shifting her apparences, as doth the Moon: (4.) <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in some Proportion, doing the like: (5.) <hi>Jupiter</hi> with a kind of bound about him, and guarded with four lesser Stars, as Attendants: (6.) <hi>Saturn</hi> triple-bodied: (7.) the <hi>Gallaxy</hi> fully beset with small Stars: and (8.) divers pale assemblies of very small Stars, seeming to be only little white clouds in the <hi>Welkin;</hi> with some other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars lately remarked. Now, if you please to add this to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer summary: you have the whole (though brief) Story of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> from its very infancy to that augmented state it now hath attained to: I wish I might have said, to its <hi>Full growth and Perfection.</hi> But, alas! that is reserved for Posterity.</p>
