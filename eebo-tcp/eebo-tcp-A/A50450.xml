            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Do, like <hi>Moses</hi> trembling mother, leave this my first
born upon the banks of envies current, exposed to
the muddy and impetuous streams of merciless cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
wishing, that the fair hands of the meanest of
your number would vouchsafe to dandle it in the lapp of
your protection; It is but an abortive birth, posted to the
world before its time, by an unavoidable emergent, and
so I fear shall never prove strong, nor be able to go much
abroad: Yet if it be admitted to suck the breasts of your
favour, it may possibly prove strong enough (shielded by
your affection) to graple with malice, and all other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
Whilest my winged curiositie, pilgrimaged
through all the corners of my memory; desirous to know
wherewith it was fittest to adorn the porch of this mean
structure; duty at last pleaded, that it was lese-majesty
against your supremacy, even to doubt whether it was
fit to give you the precedency. For, since the best eyed fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
cannot observe any traite in your peerless faces,
wherein nature hath not prodigalled her charmes; so
perfection were imprudent, and so no perfection, if it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
not it self in such accomplisht creatures. And if
there be any Orthodox maxime in Phisognomy, we may
conclude, that such excellent faces are assorted with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
souls: Providence being like these prudent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
who bestow the choisest cases only upon the richest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33161:4"/>
pieces. And seing one look darted from your irresistible
eyes, is able to conquer, in a moment, these over whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason, nor courage, could never raise their trophies;
we may conclude that there is something in you, which
nothing in man (who seigneurises over all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and who can pretend to nothing stronger then cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and reason) can ever equal. It is to pleasure you
that wit is studied, and were it not that ye might be
pleased, certainly providence had placed wit beyond the
reach of our studies: it is to sooth your humor, that men
school themselves in patience; and by your miraculous
voice, the storms of their passions are calmed; from your
beauty, cowards borrow courage, and niggards liberality;
So that all these scattered colonies of vertues, which are
squandred amongst men, are all originated from your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
But as it was duty, so it is prudence in me to beg
your patronage; for how can the body of this Book be
abissed, and sink in the gulf of scorn, if its head be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by such admired beauties; neither think I, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
can be so malicious, as to along a thurst at the author,
who ensconces himself behinde such sacred persons; lest
the blow destinated for him should wound them who tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
him. I have chosen so many patronesses, to evidence
that there is none of your never enough admired sex, but
may lay claime to the patronage of all that drops from
my pen; as also, fearing that among such a number, I
should scarce finde one who would be so excessively hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall,
as to lodge in her Cabinet or Chamber such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged
Orphelin. The disappointment of my fears
in this, is rather th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <head>An Apologie for
ROMANCES.</head>
            <p>IT hath been rather the fate, then merit of
Romances in all ages, to be asperst with these
vices, whereof they were not only innocent,
but to whose ante-doting vertues they might
justly pretend: for whereas they are judged to
be both the fire, and faggots, wherby Lov'd
flames are both kindled and alimented; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
verily, that there is nothing can so easily
extinguish them, for as these who have at Court,
seen numbers of peerless and wel deckt beauties;
can hardly become enamoured of an ordinary
Country-maid; So these who have seen a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea,</hi>
or <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> depenciled by the curious
wits of <hi>Sidney,</hi> and <hi>Scuderie,</hi> will hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassalled
by the (to them scarce approaching)
treats of these, whom this age garlands for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
beauties. Others for sooth accuse them,
for robbing us of our precious time; but this
reproach is ill founded; for if the Romance be
abject, none will trisle away their time in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33161:5"/>
it, except these who would mispend it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and if they be excellent, then times is rather
spent then mispent in leafing them over. There
is also a third race of detracters, who condemn
them as lies; but since their Authors propose
them, not with an intention to deceive, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
properly be reputed such: And albeit they
seem but fables, yet who would unkernel them,
would finde budled up in them reall truthes;
and as naturalists observe, these kernels are best
where the shells are hardest; and these mettals
are noblest, which are mudded over wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

earth. But to leave such Phanaticks in the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lame
of their own fancies, who should blush to
trace in these paths, which the famous <hi>Sidney,
Scuderie, Barkley,</hi> and <hi>Broghill</hi> hath beaten for
them, besides thousands of Ancients, aud Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,
Ecclesiasticks, and Laicks, Spaniards,
French, and Italians, to remunerat whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
fame hath wreathed Garlands (to
be temple their ingenious and ingenuous heads)
which shall never fade whilest Learning flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes.
I shall speak nothing of that noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce,
writen by a Bishop, which the entreaty
of all the Eastern Churches could never prevail
with him to disown; and I am confident, that
where Romances are written by excellent wits,
and perused by intelligent Readers, that the
judgement may pick more sound information
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33161:5"/>
from them, then from History, for the one teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us onely what was done, and the other what
should be done; and whereas Romances presents
to us, vertue in its holy-day robes, History pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
her only to us in these ordinary, and spotted
sutes which she weares whilst she is busied in her
servile, and lucrative imployments: and as
many would be incited to vertue and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
by reading in Romances, how much it hath
been honoured; So contrary wise, many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
by historical experience from being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
knowing that it hath been oftner punished
then acknowledged. Romances are these vessels
which strain the christal streams of vertue
from the puddle of interest; whereas history
suffers the memory to quaff them of in their
mixt impuritie; by these likewise lazy Ladies
and luxurious Gallants, are allured to spend in
their Chambers some hours, which else, the one
would consecrat to the Bed, and the other to the
Bordell: and albeit essayes be the choicest
Pearls in the Iewel house of moral Philosophy,
yet I ever thought that they were set off to the
best advantage, and appeared with the greatest
lustre, when they were laced upon a Romance;
that so the curiosity might be satisfied, as well
as the judgement informed, especially in this age
wherein the appetit of mens judgements is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so queasie, that it can rellish nothing that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33161:6"/>
is not either vinegared with Satyres, or sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gared
with Eloquence.</p>
            <p>I know that these who have devanced us in
this imployment, will as our eldest brothers in
time, have a double portion of fame bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and no wonder, seing they had store both
of expression and invention to make choice of,
and if any of us use their expressions, albeit we
were only debtor to our own invention for them,
yet we should be thought to plagiarize: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he who writes now, should read what hath
been written formerly; not to the intent that
he may borrow, but least he should borrow any
thing that is theirs. I perceive there have been
two errours committed by the first writers of
Romances: the first was, that they stuffed their
Books with things impracticable, which because
they were above the reach of mans power, they
should never have fallen within the circle of his
observation: and such was <hi>Amadis de Gaule,
Palmeron de Oliva &amp;c.</hi> The other errour was
in the style, which because of its soaring pitch
was inimitable: and as the first hath been the
fault of the first writers, So the last hath been
the fault of the last writers, wherefore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Scuderie</hi> hath written so, as that his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may suit well with our practise, and his style
with our discourse, and especially in his <hi>Clelia,</hi>
wherein he professes that he hath adapted all to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33161:6"/>
the present converse of the French Nation
and that is really the mould wherein all tru
Romances should be casten. There are some who
embroider their discourse with Latin and Greek
termes, thinking, like these who are charmers,
that the charme loses its energie, if the words
be not used in Latine. But this is as rideculous,
as if one who desires to make his face seem plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
should enamble it with red, blew, green, and
other colours; which though they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
pleasant, yet are rediculous when placed
there. And this is an university style, which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
too much its pedant, and is at best but ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
oratory, seing the scope of all Orators is to
perswade, and there can be no perswasion where
the term is not understood; examples of this are
<hi>Brown, Charletoun, &amp;c.</hi> The second style, is that
of moral Philosophers, where the periods are
short, and the sense strong, and our experience
teacheth us, that the shorter any thing be, it
is the stronger: this style suits best with Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
whose it is to debit the grand misteries of
Faith and Religion; for, seing sentences there
should be weighty, if they were either many, or
long, they would burden too much the hearers.
The third style, is that of <hi>Barrasters,</hi> which is
flourished with similees, and where are used long
winded periods; and of all others, this is the most
preferable, for seing similitude is but a harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33161:7"/>
this style shews that excellent harmony, and
rapport, which God intended in the first Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and which the Philosophers of all ages have
ever since admired. This Lawyers have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the paucitie of all humane Lawes,
which makes them oft recurr to that topick,
which teaches them to argument from the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of reason. And in this they resemble Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
who, by applying a cord, whose length they
know, to any body whose length they ignore, do
thereby learn its measures also. And by this
way <hi>Nathan</hi> in the old Testament, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the new, repremands the errors of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and the self conceated Iewes. The fourth
style is where the cadence is sweet, and the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets
well adapted, without any other var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
whatsoever: and this is that style which is
used at Court, and is paterned to us by eloquent
<hi>Scuderie.</hi> I hear there is now a ridiculous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
of Ladies at <hi>Paris,</hi> who terme themselves
the precious, and who paraphrase every thing
they speak of, terming a mirrour, the conselour
of beauty, and a chair, the commoditie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
&amp;c. And thus they have progressed
from painting of faces to paint expressions.</p>
            <p>As for my self, since I expect no applause, I
need fear no censure; and if I satisfie not others,
I shall at least satisfie my self, for it was to form
to my self a style that I undertook this Piece,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33161:7"/>
whose defects I hope the sober readers will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
since their clemency will not be oft tempted
with crimes of this nature: only this I begg,
that these who will not do me the favour to read
the last part, will not do me the wrong to read
the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st part; for as the Lord <hi>Bakon</hi> very well
observes, our thoughts are like our years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the first are alwayes the worst; and it is no
wonder, for boyling youth customarly throws
the scum upmost. I have concealed my name
till I see how my undertaking is relished;
for which reason likewise, I have sent this

            <l>WE did admire what made the heavens tear,</l>

            <l>The season wep't in rain, and sigh'd in winde,</l>
            <l>Our mother earth did great distempers finde</l>
            <l>At her great loss, and with a pale wet face,</l>
            <l>Did her dear Son in her cold armes embrace.</l>

            <l>The leaves likewise, fell trembling from their trees</l>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ELANCHOLY having lodged it
self in the generous breast of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanthropus</hi>
(lately Chancellour
of <hi>Egypt)</hi> did, by the chain of its
Charms, so fetter the feet of his
Reason, that nothing pleased him now but that
whereby he might please that passion; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all time mispent which was not spent in its
service, frequenting more Woods than Men,
deeming them the only fit grove to sacrifice in,
the choicest of his thoughts to the worst of
passions. Wherefore, having one day wandred
abroad in a neighbouring Desert, he came at
last to a deep Valley, fruitfull of nothing but
Trees, and Trees fruitfull of nothing but Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
overlookt by Rocks, in whose wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

faces, aged Time had plowed thousands of
deep furrows, whose gloomy brows threatned
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33161:11"/>
perpetually to smother the subjacent Valleys;
a place fit only to be (as it was presently) the
hermitage of Melancholy and stage of Cruelty:
He had not long stayed, when his admiration
was arrested by a noise blown in his ears (as
he thought) by the bellows of Death, yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by a sight yet more horrid: for, he saw
at some distance two Ladies, loaded with Iron
sheckles, which chained them together, stript
of their cloaths above the middle, and strypt by
two cruel Rascals, who (albeit torture made
the Ladies run) yet equalled the number of
their lashes to that of their paces; and not far
from them, were ten Gentlemen (as they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their habits) fighting against two Knights
followed only by one Esquire; where courage
seemed to combat against number, valour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the ten seem but three, and fear making
the three seem ten; yet courage shew at last
that it might be resisted by number, but could
not be overcome by it; for, the death of six,
forewarned the other four, that it was not time
to stay: fear having left them only so much
reason as to conclude, that seing they could
not resist them, being ten, how could they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
when they were but four? wherefore,
leaving flouds of bloud to witnesse the gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of their conquering adversaries, they posted
away: The Knights willing to pursue these
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33161:11"/>
run-awayes (who had now added cowardis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to their former crimes) yet more willing
to rescue the miserable Ladies, left these Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals
to be punished by a torturing conscience,
and the just gods, and spurred after the Ladies,
who were presently abandoned by these Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
but Providence (which had borrowed
their swiftnesse to lend it to their adversar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es)
delivered these Villains into the hands of the
pursuing Knights, who brought them back
where the Ladies were, bathing themselves in
their own innocent bloud: who having fallen
on their feeble knees, the eldest of them weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
spoke thus; <hi>O noble Gentlemen, surely
Providence had never created such silly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as weak women, if they had not likewise
provided such noble Champions as ye are to be
guardians to their weak innocencie, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
weaknesse: We acknowledge we are yours
(if bloud be a price able to buy things of small
value) neither can those to whom we belonged
formerly pretend right any longer to us, no
more than the first owners can pretend right
to their goods, which being robbed from them
by unjust Pirats, are after some time and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
regained by other true Conquerours; or
Land taken by Vsurpers, is to be restored by a
third Conquerour to its first masters: Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
we, who cannot by any</hi> postliminius <hi>right,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33161:12"/>
return to our former liberty, seing to be slaves
to such masters is to be no slaves at all. But
seing our tears are no fit recompence, for those
tears of bloud which your bodies both have
shed, and yet do shed for us, we shall cease to
trouble you, whom we cannot requite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilest they were admiring what was
already spoken (wherein she shewed much
Learning from whom no Learning could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected)
and whilst she was about to add more,
<hi>Monanthropus,</hi> by his coming, interrupted, both
the admiration of the one, and the discourse
of the other, who, puzled whether to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
the good fortune of the Knights, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
the misery of the Ladies, or to accuse the
cruelty of those Rascals (with whom the
Knights had made them to exchange fetters)
who were now standing accused by their own
roguish looks, yet at last he accosted the Knights
thus: Gentlemen, albeit I might accuse you as
strangers, for exercing any jurisdiction, much
more the highest jurisdiction, in a stranger Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet your valour, your successe, and your
cause, obligeth me to believe, that ye are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated
by the immortal gods, to punish
these Rascals, and to liberate these noble Ladies:
for, seing such extraordinary feats as ye have
done, are above the reach of such ordinary
means as is mans strength, we must believe that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33161:12"/>
they are either perpetrated immediatly by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernal
or infernal powers; and seing the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
furies are not so much friends to innocency,
as to help it, or so much enemies to cruelty, as
to punish it, we must think, that ye have been
aided by some divine power; therefore I shall
rather admire than challenge you; for, to no
purpose is the admirative faculty bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
man, if it be not exercised in such cases as
this: therfore let me beg of you to lodge with
me this night, seing the condition of these La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
pleads for good accommodation, and there
is none to be had for persons of either your
or their quality, besides my house, whose best
accommodation is, its nearnesse to this place.
To which the tallest of these two Knights
(named <hi>Megistus)</hi> replyed thus; Courteous
Sir, neither ye, nor these Ladies, have reason
to extol so much our courage, as to admire
these fellows cowardishnesse, and to think that
their guiltinesse was their strongest enemy, and
that the veriest Coward could not but be stout
in such a quarrel: but as to your proffer, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
we thank you extreamly for it, yet we will
wait upon these Ladies to shelter them from
any future inconveniencie, and to see them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to return from the region of death,
wherein they seem now to enter; for, seing
providence hath given them us for attenders, it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33161:13"/>
were a breach of trust to desert them. But
the poor Ladies, (who were about not only to
accept the proffered accommodation, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to beg it before it was proffered) thanked
<hi>Monanthropus</hi> for his kindnesse, and intreated
the Knights to go alongst with them: which
when they had accorded to, after much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy,
he mounted the Ladies behind the
Knights, and whilst they paced slowly, both to
case the Ladies, and to keep company with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanthropus,</hi>
who refused to ride upon <hi>Kalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus</hi>
his horse (for so was he who served the
Knights named) both <hi>Monanthropus,</hi> and the
two Knights, joyned in a suit to the Ladies,
that they would inform them both of the rise
and tract of their so lamentable misfortune;
especially <hi>Monanthropus,</hi> whose Melancholy
appetite rellished nothing so well as what
was sauced with novelty, to which the sweet
Ladies easily condiscended; grief being like a
Mine, which the greater vent it gets is the
lesse noisome, as also knowing that the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
of their enemies would conciliat respect
to their innocency; so the Lady who spoke
formerly, broke off thus: Gentlemen, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(who was a Nobleman in <hi>Thracia)</hi> was
one, who lived rather to study, than studied
how to live; and who endeavoured more to
treasure up Learning in himself, than Money
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33161:13"/>
for his posterity, yet who never stained his
blotlesse fame with either negligence, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality;
yet it was rather his fortune, than
his merit, to be misconstrued by most of his
neighbours, and mainly for his retirednesse;
some thinking that he conversed not with them
because he thought them unworthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with; others thought his retirednesse
flowed from his being conscious to some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in himself, which made him unfit for
conversation; So that as the one hated him
for his supposed pride, so the other undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him for his supposed unworthinesse: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there a third sort wanting, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it was peavishnesse, which confined
him at home, fearing lest he should be induced
to spend when he came abroad: Thus he lived,
educating his children, me especially, in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Learning, scorning alwayes those who
thought knowledge rather a burden, than a
qualification to those of our sex, and that it
was enough to a woman to know how to
bring forth children: for, said he, seing nature
hath been more a step-mother to women, than
to men, giving them shallower judgments than
to men, It appears to have been natures mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and it should be their endeavours, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
by pains that natural imperfection: and
seing they are given as helpers to men, how
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33161:14"/>
can they help him, except they understand how
to do it? and also, seing they should recreate
man in his solitarinesse, how can they do that
without some knowledge? Having spent thus
his short life, he was at last invited by death, to
go and receive the reward of his vertue. After
his death, two Gentlemen (even those two,
who first assaulted these worthy Gentlemen)
whom conversation rather than affection (for
they were not capable of any such impression)
had made rather comrades than friends, and
who conversed together rather out of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
than choice, because others hated them so
as that they would not converse with them;
or else, they fearing to be checked for their
escapes, would converse with none but with
themselves, whose mutual escapes pleaded for
mutual pardon. These two came in suit of us
two, who were two sisters, the only daughters
of our father; but their spotted same before
they came, and their imperious carriage after,
made us not only not love their persons, but
even abhor their very names: which they, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some time, perceiving, intended to extort
by compulsion, what they could not willingly
obtain from us; whereupon, our only bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being sick, and hearing that our mother
resolved to consult a neighbouring Astrologer,
bribed so his corrupt judgement, as that he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33161:14"/>
promised to tell her, that nothing could ransom
our brothers life, but our pilgrimage to <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
there to sacrifice two Turtles for him to
<hi>Apollo.</hi> We, who thought nothing too dear
for us, when compared with our dear brother,
resolved to undertake the journey, and being
dismist, loaded both with our mothers tears
and jewels, we had not travelled twelve miles,
waited upon only by two Gentlemen, our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,
and two maids, when at the entry of a
Wood we were assaulted, or rather surprised,
by ten Gentlemen, masked, our cousins assoon
slain as seen, and poor we, taken captives by
those of whom we knew nothing, save only
that by their masks we might know that they
intended some villany which they durst not
avow; our maids being sent away we knew
not where, and our selves captives we knew
not to whom, amazement seized so on us, as
that we feared we knew not what: but to
screw up our misfortunes to the highest pin,
our two Lovers unmasked themselves, O what
torment was it to us, to behold our Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors!
and especially in a place where none could
either pity, or relieve us; and we became now
like fools and children, who think it a great
happinesse not to see the authors of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse,
which makes them, when they are
assaulted by any fear, cover their heads; but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33161:15"/>
they who hasted to enjoy that, which when
they had enjoyed, would doubtlesse have sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
began to unmask their minds aswell as
their faces, and told us plainly, that we behoved
either to love, or die; a word as strange as
cruel: For, how can the chill coldnesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
kindle the real flames of true love? And
seing force is able to make those who formerly
loved, thereafter hate, how can it make those
who once hated, therafter love? but they who
understood as little true love, as they practised
true modesty, did most impertinently impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
us to accept them for our husbands, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
when they could not perswade us by
threats, that we were the maddest women
breathing who refused to bewives to such gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Gentlemen, and Mistrisses of so large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
recounting to us sometime their valiant
acts, and sometime questioning their prepared
servants anent the state of their thriving af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
not forgetting to number hundreds of
Mistrisles whom they had slighted for us, and
how many sighed for them, albeit they sighed
for us. This discourse, albeit unpleasant in it
self, yet seemed more unpleasant because of the
discoursers gestures and antick modes, which
could have perswaded strangers, that they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
purposly to make us laugh; at last they led
us to a Cave in the bosome of a Rock, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33161:15"/>
seemed to be Deaths chamber of presence, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with mire, and tapistred with slime and
cobwebs: here we were welcomed by an old
Hag (the Nurse of my Lover) whose face I
thought at first, had been masked with some
terrible mask, but at last I perceived, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had conjoyned swarthy colours with ugly
shapes, to shew that Art could not outstrip her
in making an horrid face; her words, ecchoed
by the hiddeous Rock, seemed to be the cryes
of the damned spirits, when they are punished
in Hell for their misdemeanours.</p>
            <p>Our accommodation could only brag of its
suitablenesse for ugly things, so corresponded
with ugly things, as ye would have sworn, that
every thing contended which should be most
ugly: a sheep was eaten half alive, and sent
bleating to their bellies, and their bread which
seemed to be knead gravel, was eaten as gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
as if it had been the finest flowre; at sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
she began to accuse the Courtiers for nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y,
in imploying knives and napkins, and swore
by her black kirtle, that the reason why Ladies
did eat so little at Table, was, because they did
eat so largely in their Chambers. Thus having
spent the night lying on the ground (a Bed
never made since the Creation) we longed for
the morning, which came no sooner than we
wished it had been past, and thought that the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33161:16"/>
Sun by its slow motion, intended likewayes to
conspire with our other Tormentors: Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some four dayes stay, the immortal Gods,
who knew our innocency, decreed our delivery,
by a way as unexpected as the delivery it self:
for, the fore-named Mathematician, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now in his solitude to consult the Stars,
whereas he had formerly in his poverty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
his Purse, did one morning acquaint the
Lovers that he did read their ruine in the Face
of Heaven, if they dismist us not: this Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
from such a place, and such a person, did
so allarm their already frighted consciences,
that they resolved to quit us, meerly, because
they found they could not keep us: wherefore
fearing lest our return to our own Countrey,
should be a mean to banish them from theirs,
they resolved to bring us over here to <hi>Egypt</hi>
with our faces covered, that our punishment
might be the greater, and our return the more
uncertain: after that fashion did they lead us
three dayes (never considering that Heaven
saw us, albeit we saw not it) till at last, like
Serpents, who carry their sting in their tails,
they resolved to make the last act of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
the worst, making our Tragedy like all
other Tragedies, whose most deplorable event
is represented in the last Scene: Wherefore,
finding this Wood correspond with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33161:16"/>
they committed us to these cruel Tygres,
who had avenged their masters affronts, and
ended our miseries, if the arrival of those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
had not prevented both.</p>
            <p>This story and their journey ended both
equally, and they were as much solaced by the
one, as wearied by the other: and now they
began to descry the top of the much longed-for
Castle, and being entered in a sweet Alley,
which was guarded on both sides by Walnut,
Chesnut, and Cipress trees, which decored ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
the Avenues to the Castle, they were
saluted by four Gentlemen cloathed in blue
Sattin, who were attending <hi>Monanthropus's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
return, which was later that night than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
the Knights and Ladies finding their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
betrayed formerly, by the meannesse of
<hi>Monanthropus</hi> exteriour garb, did, in a most
submissive manner, crave him pardon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him now, with its interest, what
respects they had ignorantly detained from him
formerly, and the younger of the two Knights
(called <hi>Philarites)</hi> commissionated, by the
assenting looks of his Companions, spoke thus:</p>
            <p>My Lord, nature having levelled all men as
to what can be seen, and strangers knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more of one another, than what instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
nature bestows on them, their ignorance
deserves pardon, if they homologate not their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33161:17"/>
first errours, by their after continuance in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and we see Magistrates carry before them the
Ensigns of their Offices, Gentlemen followed
by their Liveries, and Knights of Orders carry
the Badges of their Honours, as beacons to
warn strangers not to split upon the rocks of
either disrespect, or incivility: which shews, by
the rule of contraries, that strangers may be
pardoned, albeit they deny respect to those
who wear not Honours Livery; and albeit we
might have seen in your Honours face and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
the impression of more than ordinary
majesty, yet the confusion wherein we were,
may plead our innocency. <hi>Monanthropus,</hi>
whose humour and age made him averse from
ceremony, told them, that their generous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
did oblige him too much, and that their
Apologie had prevented his; for albeit they
had cunningly vailed their Births, yet their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
did somewhat draw aside the curtain,
and did let the most undiscerning eye see some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more of Nobility, than their modesty did
discover by discourse.</p>
            <p>The Knights and he having skirmished a
little thus in complement, he intreated the
Knights to hand up stairs the weary Ladies;
for their age and pains had merited better their
hand, than he had done or could do. At the
top of the stairs, they entered an Antiparlour,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33161:17"/>
richly tapestred with hangings, representing
<hi>Paris</hi> choice when he bestowed the Apple up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fairest (which seemed to be not only a
relation of what was past, but also a prophecy
of what was to be acted shortly upon that
stage) there they were welcomed by a Lady,
rather grave than old, followed by a troup of
rare Beauties; where (notwithstanding the rest
seemed only to be black patches to set off with
the greater advantage the beauty of a young
Lady who was <hi>Monanthropus</hi> his daughter, a
Lady so accomplished, as if Nature in her, had
like that old Painter, borrowed a tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te from
the greatest Beauties in the world to adorn
one) <hi>Philarites,</hi> after <hi>Megistus</hi> and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
had saluted all, and after as he himself
had saluted the mother, coming to salute the
daughter, and bowing as low as the verge of her
garment, being deserted by strength, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
by admiration, did Fali dead at her
feet. The wounded Ladies, surprized by his
fall, did shout, and by that shout astonished
more than formerly, the already commiserating
by-standers, who began already to sacrifice
thousands of tears to his departed ghost, and
were sending their sad cryes to accompany to
the <hi>Elisian</hi> fields his lovely soul; mean while,
his admiration which had intimated to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
bloud and spirits the admirable beauty
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33161:18"/>
of ARETINA (so was the young Lady called)
sent his bloud gushing out at his veins, every
drop striving with its fellow which should first
see that hyerogliphick of comlinesse; but he,
poor Gentleman, lay as if his soul and body had
been divorced in the Court of Heaven, for it
refused to return to its old lodging, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the many invitations given it, both
by the skill of the Physician, and care of the
Ladies: at last some blushes began to appear as
the avantcurriers of life, which did somewhat
animate the company, whose faces reflected
formerly the paleness that appeared in his, each
being willing even to wear deaths livery for his
sake; at last he began by groans, to vomit up
his Melancholy, and to stretch his arms, which
when <hi>Megistus</hi> perceived, he caused carry him
to his chamber, where they put him in bed,
not fully yet recovered. Thereafter <hi>Monan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropus</hi>
and his Lady waited first upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Ladies, and thereafter upon <hi>Megistus</hi>
to their Chambers, where Supper was dressed
up for them, and two maids were allowed the
Ladies for attendants: but <hi>Megistus,</hi> fearing
that <hi>Philarites</hi> grief might prove desperate,
(great Spirits producing nothing which is not
great, and as the greatest fires have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
flames) resolved, by his wit to assist his
friends patience; wherefore calling for <hi>Kalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33161:18"/>
his servant, he commanded him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
himself secretly up to the Seiling of the
Chamber, and to take a hollow tree with him,
through which he should (after he found <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites</hi>
awake, and beginning to complain) cry
with a counterfeit voice, <hi>Philarites,</hi> the gods,
as a reward of thy vertue, have allowed thee
ARETINA for thy Wife; and, to confirm
thee in this truth, have desired thee to send to
morrow to that great Oak, which is sacred to
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> and there thou shalt find a Ring, with
this inscription, <hi>Believe the Gods</hi> (for <hi>Megi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
had gotten such a Ring from one of his
fathers Magicians, who had foretold him many
fortunat events, and at his departure had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
this Ring upon him) <hi>Kalodulus,</hi> whose
love to <hi>Philarites</hi> made him both willing to
undertake, and cunning in the accomplishment,
of this enterprise, did secretly climb up where
he was desired, and where he could not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
because of the darkness of the night;
and after half an hours stay, <hi>Philarites</hi> began
to groan, and to second his groans thus: O
unfortunate <hi>Philarites!</hi> hath passion cut the
throat of thy reason, or hast thou lost thy wit
with thy bloud? wilt thou willingly enter the
lists, where stronger spirits have been defeated
by weaker enemies, than that lovely object
thou saw this evening? wilt thou render thy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33161:19"/>
self uncapable to be <hi>Megistus</hi> friend, and thy
fathers heir, for a fancy which is unpracticable?
Yea, which is more, Wilt thou derogate from
that Ladies worth, by daring to stile thy self
her Lover? Either thou must conceal thy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and then why lovest thou? else thou must
vent it, and then declare thy self distracted.
<hi>Kalodulus,</hi> who waited this opportunity,
spoke as he was taught, and that so cunningly,
as that <hi>Kalodulus</hi> passed really for <hi>Mercury</hi>
(the trunche-man of the Gods) in <hi>Philarites</hi>
conceit: whereupon, falling in an extasie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Gods, and of joy for the message,
he gave <hi>Kalodulus</hi> leasure to retire himself to
his bed, where feigning that he was asleep,
<hi>Philarites</hi> called for him, asking if he heard
any thing? who answered, No, sure, for he
was asleep: but the other pressing an answer,
<hi>Kalodulus</hi> said, that it was only the effects of
his distemper. The night being past, <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
entreated <hi>Kalodulus,</hi> to go and dig under
the root of the sacred Oak, to see what he
could find. But <hi>Kalodulus,</hi> after some faint
disswasion, was at last willing to go: where
having gone, he seemed to dig, and at last found
the Ring (which he could not miss, seing it
was in his pocket) with which he returned to
his master, telling him, to aggrage the matter,
that he found it wrapt up in an Oaken Leaf.

This trick of <hi>Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rdemain</hi> was proven by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites,</hi>
his hope to be a vision, and did so ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
him, that he was in greater danger to

by too much Oyl, the soul in that resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the body, which is soonest surfeted by
the best of viands.</p>
            <p>Whilst they were canvassing this strange bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
<hi>Megistus</hi> (who being anxious of the
event, had risen timously) knocked at the door,
and being entered, he began to enquire how he
had rested. <hi>Philarites</hi> commanding <hi>Kalodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
to retire, imbracing <hi>Megistus,</hi> said, Dear
Comrade, since the soul of two friends seems
to be but one soul bilocated, and lodged in two
bodies, which is notwithstanding, not a whit
the lesse one soul, no more than the same soul
ceaseth to be the same, because it is altogether
in the arms, altogether in the head, and in
other distinct members: seing then we are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the same soul (whereof yours is the
nobler part) how can, or why should, we be
strangers to one anothers joyes or griefs? My
extasie yesternight told you all I can tell you
this morning; but albeit it had concealed it, yet
I would not. Ye saw how ARETINA'S
face disarmed my courage, and forced me to
render before I could put my self in a posture
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33161:20"/>
of defence; I am love and hers martyr, at
which word he trembled. <hi>Megistus,</hi> who
resolved to solace his friends Melancholy, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
It cannot be you love; for else loves
flames would never suffer you to tremble,
which is the ordinary effect of cold.</p>
            <p>Alas, said <hi>Philarites,</hi> seing none can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ARETINA, and not love her, I fear
we are Rivals. Truly, replyed <hi>Megistus,</hi> I
love her also; but the difference is, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
ye love her as your Mistris, and I love her
as a compleat Lady; and albeit I loved her as
my Mistris, yet the love I carried to her would
strike sail to the respect I bear to <hi>Philarites.</hi>
Alas, said <hi>Philarites,</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst part of your
discourse makes me think, that you have not
remarked ARETINA, and the second part
makes me think, that ye who knows every
thing else, knows not what it is to love. No,
no, replyed <hi>Megistus,</hi> as my eyes cannot be so
far mistaken, as to mistake the Case for the
Watch, so neither can my judgement be so
hallucinated as to love the Body in stead of the
Soul: it is not beauty that I admire either in
her or you (albeit both be lovely) no, it is your
vertue, which seing I know to be real in you,
whereas it is but presumptive in her, I cannot
chuse but love you better: But, <hi>Philarites,</hi> ye
jest, when ye say ye love; can it be that your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33161:20"/>
courage, which hath resisted so many men, is
not able to resist one woman? stain not your
wisdom by loving, before ye know the object
to be lovely: stain not your birth, by loving a
subject, ye who are born a Prince; stain not
your duty, by chusing a Wife before you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
your Father, take a Wife from his hands
from whom ye have received every thing else:
for, it is not just that he should not chuse her,
who is to be Princess of his Kingdoms, and
Mother to his Heirs; and seing by the Law of
Nations an Heir cannot marry without the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
consent, why shovld it be lawfull to
you to marry without the consent of your
Father, who being your Prince, is your Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarites</hi> was about to answer, but was
interrupted by <hi>Monanthropus,</hi> his Lady, and
his Daughter, who were entring the Chamber;
Salutations being mutually exchanged, and the
Ladies seated, <hi>Megistus</hi> craved the Lady par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for their yesternights trouble: for, said
he, Madam, if your modest looks, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
we have of your civilities, made us
not expect that your goodnesse would seal us a
pardon, we might think our selves as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
as now we have reason to extoll our
good fortune, which hath given us your Ladish.
to be our physitian, and your house to be our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33161:21"/>
hospital; the gods, whose service ye respect
principally, must be your paymasters: and as
for us, all we can do, is to imploy in your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
all that remnant of bloud which ye have
conserved in our veins. Sir, replyed the noble
Lady, the protection of these noble Ladies is a
debt which all our sex is not able to requite,
and it were an unpardonable sin against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
gods, to abandon two Gentlemen, whom
they look upon as their Minions; Gentlemen,
pardon ye your bad entertainment, and your
complementary guilt shall be easily pardoned.
Having thus ended, she asked how <hi>Philarites</hi>
rested, and what he needed? But <hi>Megistus</hi>
fearing lest ARETINA'S presence should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inflame
him, and knowing that they who were
in feavers should not sit so near the fire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
the Ladies and <hi>Monanthropus</hi> to leave
him to the care of Doctor Diet, and Doctor
Quiet, healths ordinary Physicians, which they
did, and went away, accompanied by <hi>Megistus,</hi>
to visit the unknown Ladies; where they
found them, entertaining themselves with two
Lutes, lent them by their attenders: their Lutes
and their Voices strove for preference, yet the
Voice carried the applause; and no wonder,
seing it is the instrument which the gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have fabricated. Their musick joyned to
the description <hi>Monanthrop.</hi> had made of them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33161:21"/>
to his Lady and Daughter, did so indear the
Ladies to them as that still thereafter during
their aboad it was hard to separate them, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthropus</hi>
desiring to satisfie his curiosity, and
curious to know a person he so much admired,
desired <hi>Megistus</hi> to fetch a walk, leaving the
Ladies to their private entertainments.</p>
            <p>So going abroad, he conducted him to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
all enamelled with Flowers, chequered all
alongst according to their several colours; and
thereafter to an Aviary, wherein grew many
fragrant odoriferous Trees, wherein Birds of
all Nations, and of all colours, nested, and
withall shadowed a Walk, wherein one would
hear their dissonant voices conspiring to make
one melodious harmony, which seemed to be
Natures Lute, and which shewed how hard it
is for Art to imitate Dame Natures perfection;
here <hi>Monanthropus</hi> used every morning and
evening to recreate both his ears and eyes, with
variety both of notes and colours, contrariety
here producing as pleasant effects, as it useth to
produce unpleasant elsewhere: from this they
went to a Mount, whose ascent was facilitated
by stairs of Marble, and whose stairs was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with Orange trees, budding continually,
betwixt each two whereof stood a Basin of
Marble, whence issued waters of divers colours,
receiving their tinctures from Minerals, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33161:22"/>
concealed; upon the top of this Mount
stood a house of pleasure, gilded above, and all
struck out in windows, the residue of the wall
being strong Cristal, whose reflections upon the
gilding, did cast a curious lustre; there stood a
pair of Organs, moved with a Water-work,
with which three cages of Birds, made a melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
consort; above this was a Closet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
with Mathematical Engins, whence <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanthropus</hi>
observed all the heavenly motions:
thence they were called to Dinner, where at
the entry of the Palace they perceived a young
Pedant, who was seating a Lady on horsback,
and would needs have the Gentleman who
was in the saddle turn the right side of the
horse; for, said he, the noblest side should be
given to a Lady: but so it is that the right
side is the noblest, <hi>Ergo.</hi> This forced <hi>Monan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropus</hi>
against his inclination to laugh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, <hi>Monanthropus</hi> and <hi>Megistus</hi>
walked to the Bibliothick, which was richly
tapestred with Books, each Science having its
own division, and the chief Authors, drawn by
a most exquisite Pencil, standing above; the
floor paved with Marble, cut out in the shapes
of Globes and Spheres: They had scarce fetcht
two or three turns here, when <hi>Monanthropus</hi>
(whose Melancholy hungred to be fed with the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33161:22"/>
Legend of <hi>Megistus</hi> Life) smiling, said; Sir,
it is somewhat unmannerly, yet most ordinary,
amongst strangers to inquire after one anothers
extraction, and the more it is concealed, the
more our curiosity is set on edge; men think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every thing that is hid, like to the hidden
Minerals, which the deeper they are concealed
in the bowels of the Earth, are so much the
more precious; and man hunting happiness (a
prey which he shall never catch in this world)
and not finding it in what he knows, concludes
that it lurks in that which is concealed from
him; and man concluding that each desires to
reserve for himself what he finds most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
imagines that every thing which his
neighbour conceals, must be excellent, because
he reserves that for himself; others enquire
after mens secrets, because they dream, that
once having known anothers secrets, they have
the revealer at their devotion; Yet, Sir, I
hope, that as your generosity will not jealouse
me, so your goodnesse will satisfie my enquiry.
<hi>Megistus</hi> who found it an obligation he owed
to <hi>Monanthropus's</hi> civilities, replyed thus:
My Lord, albeit my reason did at first, and my
experience hath since, taught me the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of masking my condition, yet your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
have prevailed against both; wherefore,
Sir, ye shall know that I am Son to the King
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33161:23"/>
of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and that whilst I lived at my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Court, I began to reflect upon the great
advantages that did accrue to Princes by their
travels; for these are the mirrours wherein
Princes may see their own blemishes, which
their own subjects may sometimes laugh at,
but will never discover to them: as also the
want of foreign languages (which they learn
in their travels) obliges them to reveal to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
the most mysterious affairs of State,
when they treat with strangers Ambassadors,
and makes them unfit to pry into their scope;
likewise their travels acquaints them with the
humours and interests of other Nations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
homebred Princes are sometimes cheated, and
often mistaken; by these Princes are obliged to
moderate their passions, to inure themselves to
hardship, and to converse with men of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
Another advantage they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
which is, that by travelling whilest they
are young, they conceal many imperfections,
which, to their great losse, their youth would
have discovered, if they had lived at home.
These and many such considerations, prompted
me to travel, and to disguise my name and
birth, which, as it forced me to spend lesse, so it
capacitated me to learn more than else I could
have done. So having come over to <hi>Athens,</hi>
the general rendezvous of all great Spirits, I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33161:23"/>
did there meet <hi>Philarites,</hi> whose fame and
excellent qualities made me cull him out for my
intimate Comrade: but, Sir, I will reserve this
story for his own narration, that so he may
have somewhat to gratifie your Lordship with,
his and my condition having robbed us of all
other opportunities of doing your Lordship
the least pleasure. <hi>Monanthropus</hi> glad of this
discovery, but sorry for his former mistake, did
intreat <hi>Megistus</hi> to remember the Apologie he
had made the other day, whereat <hi>Megistus</hi>
smiling, said, That all the reparation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which he required, was his Lordships se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie
in a matter of such importance, and that
he desired likewise, rather out of custom than
out of fear, and desired that his Lordsh. should
not think it detracted from the confidence he
placed on his ingenuity, seing the most intire,
and the least jealous friends will desire the like,
meerly to signifie that they look upon what is
related as a thing wherein they desire secresie,
which their friends would else take for matters
of no such moment; and withall he intreated,
That his Lordship would acquaint him with
the true state of affairs, as they stood for the
time in that Nation wherin he now sojourned,
Seing Intelligence was the soul of Policy, by
which it was animated, and without which
Statesmen could neither foresee nor shun in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33161:24"/>
and of all intelligence that was
to be preferred, which was had by one who had
been an actor, as his Lordship was; To which
<hi>Monanthropus</hi> courteously replyed, Your
Highness (which title <hi>Megistus</hi> conjured him
not to make use of, lest by it he should be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered)
by your command compells me to do
what none but ye could gain from me, for that
discourse will reflect upon and detract from
my native country, of whose honour I would
be as tender as of my Mothers (for seing I am
come out of its bowels, I do in a manner esteem
it my Mother) as also my narration may seem
to receive a false tincture from my discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neither is it fit to make such relations to
strangers, who may glean from it some of the
hidden Maximes of our State, the concealment
of which would make the discourse seem emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and would leave you, Sir, (seing I must
term you so) most unsatisfied; yet seing that
same providence which hath sent you thither,
perswades me that it hath singled you out, as a
Physician to cure our maladies, I shall conceal
none of our infirmities from you. Wherefore,
Sir, ye shall know, that this Kingdom, (which
is one of the first Lodgings given to poor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
by the immortal gods) was governed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
by Kings, and to abridge my story (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to history what may be learned from it)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33161:24"/>
               <hi>Plistus,</hi> father to our present Monarch, was a
good, but a simple Prince, whereof his Nobles
taking advantage, sought to settle the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
really in their persons, that they might
imploy the publick treasure, to repair the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which their profuse luxury had made in
their private fortunes, and the power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the State to satiate their unsatiable am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition:
wherupon, first, six, and then moe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
amongst themselves, and against their
Prince, which <hi>Plistus,</hi> simple in other things,
but witty in this, perceiving, became almost
distracted with fear, yet providence diverted
that blow, which doubtlesse else had murdered
both him and his Kingdom; for <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hus</hi> the
Mufty (for so they call our High-Priest) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating
all the Priests (whose number the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness
and superstition of our Nation hath made
infinit) to a solemn Assembly, went and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proffered his service and assistance to his
Prince, whose hatred to the Nobles, and whose
fear of the event, had made him willing, not
only to accept, but even to desire the aid of his
subjects; the King having first thanked, and
then condescended to imbrace his proffer, they
plotted the extirpation of the complotting
Noblemen, which was thus acted: The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and the Priests meeting in <hi>Alexandria</hi>
about the same time, <hi>Malchus</hi> having taken
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33161:25"/>
an oath both of secresie and obedience from all
of them, unfolded to them the complot of the
Noblemen, and how the King had none to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in besides them, whose courage might make
in one instant, their Countrey and their King
eternally happy; he likewise shewed them
proof of the Noblemens treason, and of the
Kings pleasure: Whereupon, all assenting, he
went by way of procession, carrying the Image
of <hi>Apollo</hi> streight to the Lodging where the
Noblemen were assembled, where having seized
upon them, and upon their papers, which had
been shewn him by one of their Secretaries,
whom he had bribed, he was presently rescued
by the King, who commanded the flocking
people to retire home: The King in requitall
of this courtesie, advanced presently <hi>Malchus</hi>
to be Chancellour of the Nation, wherein at
first he evidenced both so much wit and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as that the gods themselves seemed to
be his cabinet counsel; yet at last his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he had all this time keeped chained
by prudence, did at last break prison, and he
treated privately with some of the imprisoned
Nobles, to ransom themselves by marrying his
Neeces, which they willingly accorded to; he
likwise perswaded the King that it would blunt
extreamly the edge of the peoples envie, and
would strengthen extreamly the Kingdom,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33161:25"/>
whose noble parts the Nobles were, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
whose weaknesse would weaken the
body; and that wise Kings should be like
wise Physicians, who should never cut off a
diseased member, if there be any hopes to cure
it; he sent abroad upon foreign imployments
all the active Spirits, fomented all the old jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
and created new betwixt the Nobles,
so that the King by curing himself of one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
(as it hapneth in the usage of all nimious
and vehement cures) fell in another, as (if not
more) dangerous, <hi>Malchus,</hi> finding that one
of his own countrymen was unfit to be his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Successour after his death, did chuse
one <hi>Sophander</hi> a Grecian (who had been resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at the Court for the Athenian Senate)
to be his Favourite: for, he imagined that if
he had chosen a Nobleman of his own Nation,
he might have supplanted him; and if he had
chosen a base and low-born Gentleman, his
extraction being notorious to all the Nation,
might have rendred him despicable; and a
stranger uncertain of any assistance, behoved to
rely upon him: besides, wanting both friends
and foes in the Nation, he would impartially
without either connivance or revenge, execute
all his commands. This fellow, became his
creature (and he might well be called so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he made him of nothing a potent prince)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33161:26"/>
others alledged, that because the people did
belch out so many injuries against <hi>Malchus</hi>
for his avarice (making his private chests the
publick treasure) saying, that he was in the
politick body, like the spleen in the natural,
whose growth did proportionally occasion the
leannesse of the other members: therefore he
choosed this <hi>Sophander</hi> (whose avarice was his
greatest, if not his only vice) that they might
after his death by collationing their lives, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
his ambition by comparing it with his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
avarice.</p>
            <p>Now all the Court began to adore <hi>Malchus</hi>
in <hi>Sophanders</hi> person, each one foreseeing that
any imp, ingrafted on such a root, would one
day flourish extreamly, and that its shadow
should one day be able to shelter those who
retired under it, from either the cold chilnesse
of poverty, or the scorching flames of envie;
yea, the King himself caressed exceedingly this
Infant Minion, but so cautiously as that he
seemed rather to love him in obedience to <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his desire, than out of any secret inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Sophander,</hi> or aversion from <hi>Malchus,</hi>
albeit these two passions were really the legs
whereon his passion did walk. Thus <hi>Malchus</hi>
did by the hand of his pleasure sway the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Soveraignity, his fancy being the sole
and supream Judge, even in matters of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33161:26"/>
greatest importance, from whose sentence the
Royal Throne it self durst receive no appeal,
and whose smiles were the greatest reward
that the proudest Egyptian durst pretend to;
the office of Chancellour became too narrow
an orb for this great Planet to move in: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as an extraordinary person, he must have
an extraordinary imployment, and must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to be first Minister of State, a title not
understood by us, and never heard of by our
Ancestors, but which suited well with his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
both being boundless. None durst now
dispute his power, seing none could pretend to
know it; and seing the King himself was, who
could repine against the condition of a subject?
Nothing was presented to him now, but what
was confected with the sugar of flattery: not
a word dropped from his mouth, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
received in Fames most sacred vessels;
and the most erroneous of his actions, were
canonized as example for posterity; Yet fear
(the ordinary Lacquey of greatness) began to
tell his conscience in the ear, that he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adored than loved, by those who even lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him best, which made him resolve by the
news of his death, to try whether it was love
or fear that made the humours of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
so plyable; in order to this design, feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himself first sick, and then blazing abroad
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33161:27"/>
his death by the mouth of his Physicians, did
by the dissembled closure of his eyes, open the
fond mouthes of the unwary Courtiers, who
were glad to find an occasion to vomit up that
poysonous malice, which had even by its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
almost destroyed the vessels wherein it
was keeped; but the next morning the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
told that his soul had but lurked in, and
not fled from his apoplectick body, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being recovered, did deal death most libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
amongst those who were so liberall of
their characters of him, whilest they supposed
that he was dead. Yet at last death did show,
that the armour of greatness was not proof
against its darts, and did hurry him away, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by all, and lamented by none, the people
supposing they had buried him and their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in one tomb, did now coin thousands of
hopes in the mint-house of their expectation;
but their miseries which had begun to ebb by
<hi>Malchus</hi> death, did now begin to flow afresh
by the Succession of <hi>Sophander,</hi> whom the
Queen (fearing that the Nobles who did not
obey him who was both their Countryman and
their Prince, would far lesse obey her, whose
reign was but temporary, and whose sex was
but fragile) did after the death of her husband,
who survived not long <hi>Malchus,</hi> choose him
for her Confident. The young Kings name
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33161:27"/>
served them for a rampart against all oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and his infancy made the uproars of her
enemies be looked upon as a sin greater than
Treason, being committed both against the
Majesty of a King and the Infancy of a Childe,
and rendred them criminal both as men, and
subjects. Yet this same innocency which made
the opposers so guilty, did likewise give time
and life to the far more heinous crimes of the
defendants. <hi>Sophander</hi> having got the Tutory
of the young King, acquainted him with all the
pleasures which might alienate his mind from
affairs of greater importance, but keeped him
alwayes a stranger to the Mysteries of State, as
things which would certainly disquiet, and
might possibly break his spirit: telling him,
that it was too soon for him to have his Crown
lined with the black Sables of Care, and that
he might in his youth commit some Solicismes
of State, which might for ever stain his Royall
repute: he likewise retarded his Marriage, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
lest anothers worthiness should fill the
room, which he unworthily had gotten in his
Princes heart; till at last, overpowered by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
he matched him with a neighbouring
Princess, whose pliable humour might rather
be subservient than destructive to his greatness,
I (who had been promoted to be Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
immediatly after <hi>Malchus</hi> death) became
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33161:28"/>
now the eye-sore of <hi>Sophanders</hi> avarice, for
he thought my charge void, because it was not
filled with one of his Partisans, who might at
last like small rivers discharge themselves in the
ocean of his Treasures: whereupon I, who
scorned like those other Asses, to carry Gold to
his bottomless Coffers, did resolve rather to
shelter my self in the Sanctuary of a private
life, than to bow the top-sail of my integrity
to the flag of his ambition; wherefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to this place and condition, which I have
alwayes since found a harbour able to shelter
me from the most violent storms of pride and
avarice, wherewith those are shattered, who
sail in the ocean of Court-luxury. This dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
did extreamly satisfie <hi>Megistus</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and kindle his courage, and <hi>Monan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropus</hi>
perceiving the coals of his courage once
kindled, did by the bellows of wit and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
endeavour to adde heat to excite the flames
which he found already kindled; and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
at last that <hi>Eudoxa</hi> the elder of these
two Ladies should go to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where
she should stay till by <hi>Bonaria's</hi> intercession
(so was <hi>Monanthropus</hi> Lady called) she might
be admitted to be one of <hi>Agapeta</hi> (the Kings
daughters) Ladies of honour, where she might
be serviceable to their designs, and a stirrup
wherby <hi>Megistus</hi> might the more easily mount
the saddle of preferment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:33161:28"/>
Let us now return to visit <hi>Philarites,</hi> whose
love had plunged him in the ditch of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
irrecoverably, who loved nothing in
himself except the love he carried to ARETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA,
whose good fortune he notwithstanding
cursed a thousand times, because it had placed
her above the reach of his courtesies, the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pencile of his passion did draw ARETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA'S
portracture upon every object that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it self to his sight; and his noble heart,
which was formerly <hi>Mars</hi> his shop wherein he
forged thousands of heroick thoughts, became
now an Altar whereon he sacrificed daily his
dearest faculties to his lovely ARETINA, his
Reason, which had still been the steersman in
all his former courses, did in this tempest of
Melancholy abandon its charge, presumption
assured him, that providence and foresight in
this case, were but cowardishness; for, how
could one of his courage, especially engaged in
such a quarrel, fear Armies of inconveniences?
On the contrary, fear assured him that his hopes
were meer presumption; for, how could the
divine ARETINA be merited by a stranger,
destitute of friends and attenders? and how
could he think that she who knew the value of
every thing, would bestow her self upon one
who did not merit her? Thus passion warred
against passion, but all of them conspired against
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33161:29"/>
               <hi>Philarites,</hi> who, deserted by reason, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by passion, was brought to so low a
passe, as that neither the skill of the Physician
was able to recruit his body, nor the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Megistus</hi> able to settle his confused
spirits. But that which afflicted him most, was,
that occasion never propined him with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of meeting with ARETINA all
alone, till at last occasion repenting of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
it had used against him, brought at last
<hi>Bonaria</hi> and ARETINA to his Chamber,
whom charity had invited thither to assist by
their skill and care his natural strength, which
was not able for to combate all alone these
troups of diseases which did daily attaque him.
<hi>Bonaria,</hi> being instantly called away, left a
fair field for his passion to expatiate it self in
<hi>Philarites,</hi> who intended to be very frugal of
his time, insisted thus.</p>
            <p>Divine ARETINA, the least sparkle of
your acquaintance is able not only to thaw the
ice of indifferency, but even to kindle the flames
of love in a colder breast than mine. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
the great disproportion betwixt your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and my naughtiness, obliges me to smother
my affection, and yet I know that in smother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, I shall murther a person who might
otherwise live to do you service: My death
shall be honourable, if I be not buried in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33161:29"/>
tomb of your disdain, and yet my life (being
imployed in your service) might bud forth in
something worthy of your and the worlds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing:
but as for me, I esteem it not, if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it not as a donative from your clemency.
Fair Lady, I shall alwayes esteem my self more
or lesse fortunate, accordingly as ye frown or
smile upon me, and your thoughts are the only
stars whereby my horoscope may be casten. He
stopped here, perceiving that ARETINA had
covered her face with a blush, and fearing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
her whom he so much adored, he patiently
waited for this Answer.</p>
            <p>Noble <hi>Philarites,</hi> I know that such Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
as you, use, like skilfull Comedians, to
act still at home those personages which they
are to represent publickly upon the stage;
wherefore I am confident that ye are inuring
your self with such a Country-maid as I am,
to those Civilities and Court-modes, which
the Ladies at Courts will expect from you, I
know your wit sports it self by such genty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations;
and seing it may accomplish your
spirit, I pardon you f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eely. She spoke this
with so charming a grace, and with so much
indifferency, as that neither <hi>Philarites</hi> fear,
or hope, were able to glean any thing from it;
at last, rising to bid him adieu, she let a Scarlet
Ribband fall, which <hi>Philarites</hi> secretly (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33161:30"/>
to be perceived, and being perceived to be
frustrated) snatcht up immediately, and kept
alwayes afterwards as the <hi>Paladium</hi> of his
good fortune. After two or three weeks were
thus spent, <hi>Philarites</hi> came abroad, rather
seeking an opportunity to entertain ARETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA,
than out of a desire to meliorat his health,
and whilest they were walking after Dinner in
the next adjacent Garden, where all the Knights
and Ladies had gone to seek the Arbours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
against the heat of the Sun, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a Gentleman, who in all humility pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<hi>Monanthropus</hi> with Letters from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phander,</hi>
entreating his Lady and Daughters
presence at his Neeces Nuptials, who was to
be espoused to the Prince of <hi>Goshan. Monan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropus</hi>
alledged indisposition of health for
himself, but promised that his Lady and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
should wait upon his Eminence, and his
Neece. Telling him that he was sorry that the
distance was not greater, and the Solemnity
lesse, that their obedience to his Eminencies
commands might the better appear. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
told him, that seing that Complement
could hardly be requited by <hi>Sophander</hi> himself,
it were vanity in him to endeavour an answer.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Ladies, accompanied
by the unknown Knights, did by Coach begin
their journey to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33161:30"/>
hard to tell, whether <hi>Megistus</hi> grief in
leaving <hi>Monanthropus,</hi> or <hi>Philarites</hi> joy in
accompanying ARETINA was greatest. The
day being fair at their departure, continued not
long so, for the Heavens willing to cause the
Earth drink healths to their bon-voyage, did
by impetuous showers send it water enough
to drink: the Sky, which intended to look
chearfully at <hi>Eliza's</hi> Nuptials, did by wind
and rain purge it self of all its malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
Heavens bottles having at last emptied
themselves by these furious showers, the Sky
did cover its face by a vail of mist, whereby the
Coachmans horizon was abridged to the length
of two or three paces at most, Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
by the hand of this darknesse, to lead
them out of that naturall darknesse wherein
their ignorance had enveloped them; and now
the Coachman did flie fast from the angry face
of Heaven, but the faster he drove the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re
he strayed; which he never perceived, till time
had dissipated the mist, and then both he, and
the other attenders, found themselves in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
where they saw no path nor person to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them what rout to take: at last the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Knights, who were walking on foot,
<hi>(Megistus</hi> birth having allowed him <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's</hi>
hand, leaving ARETINA to now happy
<hi>Philarites)</hi> they perceived an old Hermite,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33161:31"/>
who appeared to have borrowed times beard
to cover his wrinkled face and naked breast,
who did accost them thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ladies, it appears
that rather errour than intention, hath drawn
you hither. The Ladies granted it was so, but
told him that they thought themselves most
fortunate, in having erred, seing their errour
had occasioned such a remarkable rancounter,
wherefore they entreated to know his aboade,
and the occasion of his solitude.</p>
            <p>I am, said he, an Hebrew, who have refuged
my self from being a sad witness of the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition of my Country, whose miseries
are mine by adoption. I live here in a Rock,
wherein there is nothing worthy of observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Ladies entreated they might see it;
for, sure (said they) there is nothing worthy
of your choice which is not worthy of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
Seeing their eagerness, and coveting
an opportunity to confer with him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
them to a Rock, elevate somewhat
above the circumjacent Valley: where Nature
had been the only Architecture, yet so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
arched and pended, that it might have
passed for one of Arts Master-pieces; within
there stood a Table, whereon were some old
Volumns, and some of his own Manuscripts;
over it hung some Walnut and Fig-trees, which
were his only granaries, and which reached
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33161:31"/>
him his food in at his window: two steps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the entry without, was a spring of christal
water; where the Rock seemed to gush out
tears because it could not afford him better li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor:
the neighbouring trees seemed to lay
their heads together, to skreen his open win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
from the scorching heat, and the weary
Wildernesse seemed by his dwelling there, to
be an house of pleasure. When they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and had seated themselves to recreate
their wearinesse, and admire his garb and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
he began to usher his discourse by some
tears (by whose continual streams it appeared
he had formerly whitened his snow-white
beard) he seconded his tears with this ensuing
discourse, in obedience to the Ladies, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to be satisfied anent the occasion of his
solitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> The omnipotent and omniscient
God (for I acknowledge but one; for, if there
be any God, he must be infinite, and if infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
he must be one; for, there cannot be moe
infinites than one: for else, the one is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
seing he wanteth the perfections of his
fellows, and so something may be added to
his perfection. And the diversity of your gods,
shewes not the plurality of the gods, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth
only the diversity of the true God his
Attributes: for, he is wife, and his wisdom is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33161:32"/>
represented by your <hi>Apollo;</hi> He is most irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible,
which is figured to you by your god
<hi>Mars, &amp;c.)</hi> I say, the omnipotent God hath
created innumerable creatures, whose greatest
use is meerly to shew the power of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
and in every creature there is a masse of
mysteries, and each of them is a Volumn too
large to be read during a mans whole life:
wherefore seing the Court and Conversation
sealeth that Book, and trifles away the time, I
should and might bestow upon it, I resolved
to divorce my self from these adulterating im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
and retire my self to solitude, which
is a hall, wherein through the prospect of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
a man may see a compleat muster of
all God's creatures; and seing it affordeth
a man opportunities to converse with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God, I think it much preferable to the
world wherein ye converse most (if not only)
with poor mortals, from whom nothing is to
be learned, and with whom much may be lost;
as also the loud cryes of worldly pleasures will
not suffer a man to hear the language of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
conscience; and the world being sins
element, sins seem not heavy whilest one is
there, no more than the above-running waters
burthens the swimming fishes: There men are
affrighted by poverty, and distracted by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
(which albeit it be alwayes mounting,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33161:32"/>
yet shall never climb to Heaven) every Age
seems a season wherein grows a distinct crop of
Vices; in infancy, ignorance; in youth, love
and vanity; in middle-age, ambition, revenge,
and prodigality; in old age, jealousie, dotage,
and avarice: yea, the vertues themselves which
are to be found there, cannot stand upon their
own legs, except they be underpropped by some
vice or other; If one love his friend, he will
think nothing sin which may gratifie him, and
another must maintain his liberality by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of his subjects and servants. But these
vices will not lodge with those who lodge in
Wildernesses, because they find themselves star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the indigency of their Landlords, and
barrennesse of the soil.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, these two Skulls, which lye
upon my Table (the one whereof is that of
<hi>Alexanders,</hi> and the other <hi>Plato's)</hi> albeit
they be dumb to others, yet they preach to me
the vanity of all things under the Sun, and as
skilfull Anatomists, discover to me the sillinesse
of crawling man; their Skuls shewn so appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitly,
did wring tears from the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
neither did the Hermite now weep
alone, and his tears seemed to be like a little
water imployed by the Mariners to pump up a
far greater quantity. Only <hi>Philarites</hi> (whose
breast was so repleat with other meditations,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33161:33"/>
that there was no room left for such celestiall
contemplations) did shed only some few, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to accompany those which came in rivers
from ARETINA'S eyes. Whilest they were
thus drowning the Hermites Cave with their
plentifull tears, the rude Coachman told them,
that albeit they were staying there, yet the Sun
would not stay for them, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
their hast. At which the Ladies start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, they were by the Hermite conducted
to their Coach, whence shewing them the way
to <hi>Alexandria</hi> he returned, promising to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
hundreds of prayers for their erring
souls. When he was gone, <hi>Philarites</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
ARETINA, said, he thought her fair
face, mantled with such incomparable colours
and charms, did speak as loudly mans excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
as the ugliest of those skuls spoke his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.
Alas, said <hi>Bonaria,</hi> fourty years
hence the disproportion will not be great, when
all these colours shall be hidden in the wrinkles
of an old face, and when the frost of age shall
have nipped all these flourishes, and the cold
wind of time shall have blown away these blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms
which now appear. Certainly, said <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites,</hi>
the soul must be an excellent creature,
which, as the Sun, produceth imaginary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
in optick prismes and doves necks, so it
in a more noble way doth produce really those
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33161:33"/>
admirable colours which appeareth in that and
other excellent faces; neither can it be thought
a disparagement to the soul, that it suffereth
these to fade in age, seing in exchange of these
it bestoweth upon the body then the real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of prudence and experience; which
cannot be said to be the least worth, because
they are the least beautifull: no more than the
Autumn can be called the worst season, because
in lieu of the Springs flourishes, it bestows upon
us the real fruits which have been knotted in it:
and, no doubt, the soul must be a noble Artist,
which makes all these veins, muscles, nerves, and
noble parts of mans body move so regularly,
whose number and varity, albeit they shew the
excellency of our fabrick, yet do infallibly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
our weaknesse; for any one of these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts can lodge death with all its train: and
the finger, or toe, albeit they are most of all
others, remote from the heart, yet can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up that citadel of life, the heart, into the
hands of death its mortal enemy. Sure, said
ARETINA, seing the body is in it self so frail,
they are much to blame who are so enamoured
with these colours which are so fading. I am
confident, replyed <hi>Philarites,</hi> that none is so
mad as to become enamoured of the body in
any other sence, but meerly as it is the shell
wherein such a rare pearl as the soul is keeped,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33161:34"/>
and as many love the son, because he is son to
such a father; even so many love these colours,
and that vivacity whereof it can only brag, as
they are the effects of the within residing soul;
and to confirm us in this, we may conceive that
no man is so distracted, as to love that which
cannot requite his love nor be sensible of it, and
consequently seing it is not the body which is
sensible, or which requites love, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that it is not the body, but the soul,
which men dote so much upon (if true vertue
may be called dotage) and both history and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
tels us, that men have continued to
love those whose beautie had thereafter been
murdered by accidents. <hi>Philarites</hi> was by
this discourse so lulled over in an extasie of
pleasure, as that he became insensible what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
was; or, as it happeneth in all other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
the fear of its short continuance, made
him dissatisfied with the present enjoyment;
and albeit he called oft to the Coachman to
drive slowly, alledging that the nimious moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Coach troubled the Ladies delicate
complexions, yet in spight of his wishes, and
of the bribed Coachmans obedience, they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Alexandria</hi> sooner than either he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or expected. The Ladies retired to their own
Lodgings, which were still furnished, expecting
them, but the Knights lodged as near as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33161:34"/>
could suffer them. After Supper came
<hi>Eudoxa,</hi> masked, to wait upon the Ladies (for
she had been now a fortnight at Court) and
acquainted them how all things went there.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Knights went to wait
upon <hi>Sophander,</hi> and finding his Secretary in
the outer Court, they entreated him to shew
his Eminency that there were two strangers
who desired to kiss his hands. <hi>Sophander</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that either they had some notable bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
to impart to him, or else, that they were
men of extraordinary extracts or endowments
(which is the happy lot of all confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
else they durst not so confidently address
themselves to one of his quality and humour,
desired they might advance. <hi>Philarites,</hi> after
mutual salutations, harrangued him after this
manner.</p>
            <p>Eminent Sir, Fame, who in obedience to the
gods decree, hath trumpeted your praises in all
Nations, especially in ours; hath invited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us to
come and serve the Apprentisage of our youth,
under the eye of such an expert Artist in all
humane policy, as your Eminency is; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Sir, seing ye are the tutelary Angel of all
other strangers, we expect a share in your
protection as well as others, and our lives shall
still be stages, whereon we shall act the person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of your humble servants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:33161:35"/>
               <hi>Sophander,</hi> who had by their equipage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
himself of their extraordinary birth,
and by their discourse did discover the prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their spirits, did caress them as persons
capable and worthy of the highest Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and proffered not only his protection,
but even his service to them. The Knights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
that he might path a way for them to
the Kings presence, and that their first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
might be under his conduct; which he
soon accorded to, desiring them to accompany
him, who was then going to salute his Majesty,
and to go a hunting with him. <hi>Sophander</hi>
asked their names and extractions; but they
craved him pardon for their disobedience in
that particular, seing their disobedience might
capacitate them the more to do his Eminency
service; they went thus discoursing till they
entered a Garden where the King was, seeing
his Huntsman prepare all things for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
sport. At <hi>Sophander's</hi> entrance, each strove
who might appear most submissive, and a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
would scarce have known which of the
two was the King; and Nature seemed to have
given each Courtier two eyes, that he might
by them observe both their motions, and two
ears, to receive both their commands. <hi>Sophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
presented the two Knights to his Majesty,
whose noble deportments, albeit they had not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33161:35"/>
been presented by <hi>Sophander,</hi> and whose being
presented by him, albeit they had not been
of so majestick a deportment, was sufficient to
recommend them highly to the Kings eye, but
both being joyned, made him confer double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
upon them. <hi>Megistus</hi> seemed the more
martial, but <hi>Philarites</hi> the more courtly, yet
so, as that neither <hi>Megistus</hi> warlikeness wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
courtiness, nor <hi>Philarites</hi> courtiness some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of a martial behaviour; and as, if <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
had not been present, <hi>Megistus</hi> would
have seemed the most courtly Gentleman that
eye could have lookt upon; so, if <hi>Megistus</hi>
had not been present, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would have thought
<hi>Philarites</hi> the most warlike Gallant that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
could have framed. <hi>Megistus</hi> was the
more learned, but <hi>Philarites</hi> was the more
eloquent; yet so, as <hi>Megistus</hi> learning sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
his small want of eloquence, and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
eloquence made his inequality in learning
with <hi>Megistus</hi> undiscernable. Thus Nature
seemed to teach mortals that she could cast
perfection in severall moulds, and that her
Grammar did admit two Superlatives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus,</hi> whose vice it was to be Master-speaker
(for they did all things by vices) after
he and <hi>Philarites</hi> both had kist his Majesties
hands upon their knees, spoke thus:</p>
            <p>Sir, it is not to be admired why we come,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33161:36"/>
but it is rather to be admired why all the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
in the world come not to spend their best
years in your Majesties Court, which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
the best of places; We are come, Sir,
to list our selves amongst your Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
not that we are so vain as to think that
your Majesty needs such servants, but because
we stand in need of such a Soveraign as your
Majesty, and of such breeding as your Court
can afford us; suffer us, like young plants, to
grow under the sunshine of your protection,
and challenge the fruits when they come to
maturity, as properly due to none but to your
Majesty. This discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se delivered so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishedly,
made all the hearers imagine that
the speaker was surely <hi>Mercury,</hi> come there
to make parade of his eloquence; and as their
deportment, so their personages and equipage
made them very conspicuous. <hi>Megistus</hi> was
cloathed in black, which was a pure scarlet dyed
black (and seemed to be as if a black curle had
been drawn over a cloath of gold) richly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered;
he carried on his cloak a crescent of
diamonds, on his hat he carried a hatband of
the same fashion, whose beams were reflected
by a plummach of black feathers. <hi>Philarites</hi>
was cloathed in white, his cloak doubled with
Mertricks furres, and all richly embroidered
with gold and scarlet, carrying a plummach of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33161:36"/>
white feathers, tipped with scarlet. That week
seemed to post away, that it might make way
for the next, wherein the Nuptials were to be
celebrated; and albeit all the three days seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to run in one, yet the Bridegroom was sorry
that <hi>Phebus</hi> coachman might not be bribed to
drive faster; desire, like all other bodies, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the faster the nearer it approacheth its
center. At last came that week and day so
much longed-for, whose bright morning omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
happinesse to the longing couple. At ten
a clock appeared the Bride, walking betwixt
<hi>Agapeta</hi> and <hi>Aretina,</hi> who were the two
poles of beauty whereon the sphear of love
moved: after them followed a company of
beautifull Virgins, all wearing the Brides live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which was white satin, enclining as it were
to change its colour, and which appeared, when
motion raised its pyle, that it hovered whether
it should appear white or not. As they passed
alongst a green Alley, to go to <hi>Apollo's</hi> stately
Temple, there stood Mount <hi>Parnassus</hi> beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with grasse and flowers; its top was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled
by nine Ladies, each wherof represented
one of the nine Muses, and who mingling their
voices with the notes of their harmonious,
though different instruments, did make the
hearers stand motionless, the spirits which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
moved their other members, having then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33161:37"/>
run all to their ears to recreat themselves with
the sweetnesse of that charming musick; the
whole Mount lurked a while in the clouds of
smoak, which the burning myrrhe, cinamon and
frankincense spred over it, which at last eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
shewed the by-standers <hi>Mercury,</hi>
who stood upon the top of the Mount, and
making a low reverence, delivered thus to the
Bride his eloquent Commission.</p>

            <p>The Bride surprized with joy, and joying in
the surprisal, took the one half which <hi>Mercury</hi>
had proffered her, and marched to the Temple,
followed by the Bridegroom, walking betwixt
<hi>Megestus</hi> and <hi>Philarites,</hi> whom <hi>Sophander</hi>
had placed there, both to gratifie them, and to
obviate the contests which precedency might
have occasioned amongst the native Nobles;
the Churches were so richly decked as if the
gods had lent all heavens furniture to decore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33161:37"/>
their Altars, and the magnificence of each thing
was such as if <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> had been the
persons to be married.</p>
            <p>After Dinner the Gentlemen (whose cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
seemed to them rusted whilst they rested)
invited one another (albeit none of them need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any invitation besides what they got from
the mouth of honour) to ride at a small Ring,
which was presented by the Bride; all rode,
but all had neither the same skill nor successe:
for as the address and skill of some made the
Ring seem greater to them than it was, So the
lourdnesse of others represented it to them lesse
than really it was; But whilst they were thus
busied, a Gentleman, ushered by two Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
diverted the Kings eye from being longer
the Arbiter of these martial games, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him with a Paper, sent by his Master the
Knight of <hi>Mars,</hi> which was read by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
(to whom the King indulged that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour)
and repeated by an Herald, whose te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
was as followeth.</p>
            <p>GEntlemen, when I perceived <hi>Venus</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
so much frequented, and the grasse
growing about the Altar of <hi>Mars,</hi> I could not
but count this amongst the other fits of the
worlds dotage; Neither need mortals dispute
any longer the preference betwixt Love and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33161:38"/>
Courage, seing the gods themselves had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it: for they, by chusing a man to be god
of Courage, and a woman only to be god of
Love, have in a mystical way shewn us, that
Courage is as much to be preferred to Love, as
man in excellency surpasseth woman; but if
Divinity cannot perswade you, consult moral
Philosophy, and it will tell you, That Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
is Captain of Vertues Life-guard: for,
who durst be just without Courage? and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Courage what a silly thing were Love?
which behoved to lye hidden in the womb of a
Lovers brain, if Courage as a skilfull Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
helped not to bring it to the world? as
also all vertues must be voluntary (for if they
were not voluntary, they were not vertues) and
consequently the more voluntary they be, they
must be the greater vertues; whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that seing nothing is so voluntary as
Courage (yea, Courage cannot be constrained)
and that Love is oft necessitated either by the
irresistiblenesse of the object, or the weaknesse
of the Lover, that Courage is the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
vertue. And how many miserable
creatures are there who would willingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Love, as a guest who neither carrieth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
nor bringeth advantage to his tortured
host, So seing they would willingly be rid of it,
surely it must be in it self an act altogether
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33161:38"/>
involuntary. Likewise we see, that seing every
good is diffusive of it self; surely the more
diffusive a vertue is, it must be esteemed so
much the more; and of all vertues, Courage
extends it self to the advantage of most (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being either atchieved or accomplished
without it) and of all vertues, Love extends
it self to fewest; that being the purest Love
which is fixt upon one, and the purest Courage
which defends all. But if Philosophy cannot
perswade, consult Policy, whereof Courage is
the darling, being the Army of Common-wealths,
and the Walls of Cities; but albeit
Love hath been oft their bane, yet it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their protector. But if neither of these
can perswade, then let him who is dissatisfied
appear to morrow, where my sword shall prove
what neither of these can, and let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that if none appear, Courage shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
conquerour; and if any appear, yet
Courage must still triumph above Love, to
whom it must owe its defence.</p>
            <p>After this Cartel was read, the Herald affixt
Copies of it upon the Palace gates, and upon a

his shield, which those who were to fight on

hors-back were to touch on the left side, and
those who were to fight on foot (which was
reputed the noblest way, as being subject to

manner of probation. <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
who never strove formerly, did now
strive who should accept the Challenge, which
controversie was at last, by the throw of a dye,
decided in <hi>Megistus</hi> favours; whereupon he
took pen and ink, and returned the Gentleman
this Answer.</p>
            <p>MArtial Knight, Love might have been
said never to have erred, if it had not
contributed to thy birth, who now like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
son spittest in the face of thy peerless
parent. Why fightest thou in defence of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33161:39"/>
is it not because thou lovest it? And if
so, thou can do nothing in defence of Courage
but what Love commands thee to do, whereby
thou shewest that Courage is but the arm, and
Love the head, and so Love is as far prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to Courage as the head is to the arm, or
the master to the slave; before the immortal
gods created the world, they loved one another,
but Courage was not then exerced by them,
neither could it be: for where there were no
wrongs, no miseries, there neither could nor
can be Courage, Courage being bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mortals either to punish wrongs, or endure
miseries; and since the world was created,
how should the gods be adored if they were not
loved? if Love were much imployed, there
would be no wrongs, no miseries, and so there
should be no need of Courage; And the blessed
souls shall no wayes stand in need of it, and yet
shall be perfect: which demonstrates that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in it self is no perfection. But, Sir,
seing ye have no Love, ye can have little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Wherefore, albeit I love extreamly, I
do not, notwithstanding, love to blot paper ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in perswading those who are incapable of
perswasion; but shall to morrow appear at the
place appointed, and (to retort your Epilogue)
if ye appear not, Love shall triumph; and if
ye appear, it is because ye love to defend Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33161:40"/>
and so Courage owes its defence to
Love.</p>
            <p>This Answer was delivered to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who delivered it to his Master; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
every person at Court longed to see the
event, yet their love to <hi>Megistus</hi> made them
fear to see even what they so much desired,
whose generous carriage had bragaded them
all on his side.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Philarites</hi> came to gird
on <hi>Megistus</hi> armour, and at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Martial Knight (who waited his hour)
appeared in the Lists of Honour, which was a
large and plain valley, a great part whereof was
in the middle pallizaded with stoups of Cipres
timber all gilded (as was the custom of old)
shewing to the world an emblem of what they
were appointed for, which was to be a field
where Death was gilded with the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretext of Honour and Valour: within
was a Tribunal erected for the Judges, upon
whose footstool did sit two Heralds, holding
in their hands two Swords crowned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
whom stood two Trumpets, from whom
the signal was to be expected, and by whom
the Conquerour was to be conducted home in
triumph: Without, were seats for the Ladies,
under whom were ranged the Noblemen and
Knights, in the midst of whom sat the King,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33161:40"/>
under a Pale of State, with a Crown lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his cushion, wherwith the Conquerour was
to be honoured, which, to differe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce it from
the Kings own Crown, was surmounted by a
Lyon rampant, holding in his fist a Sword
erected.</p>
            <p>After him entered (as the mode was) the
party challenged, who at his entry touched the
point sinistre of the Challenger's Sword, which
hung upon the Pillar, telling him in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of formality, that he was to fight on
hors-back. The Knight of <hi>Mars</hi> was mounted
on a white horse, whose flanks were stained
with red spots, as if they had been dyed with
the drops of bloud which seemed to trickle
down from the wounds, which an exquisite
pencile had made upon his armour, whereon
was represented a wounded Knight, crowned
with Lawrels. The bosses of his bridle were
two little <hi>Cupids,</hi> in whose faces his martial
horse seemed to spit his frothy foam; his shield
was decored with this device, <hi>Cupid</hi> throwing
a dart at <hi>Mars,</hi> which his hand meeting on the
way, did break in pieces; his Motto was,
<hi>NOT LOVE, BVT WEAKNES
CONQVERETH. Megistus</hi> armour
was all white, spangled here and there with
bleeding hearts; his shield for its device car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Paris</hi> giving the golden Apple to <hi>Venus;</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33161:41"/>
The word was, <hi>TO THE FAIREST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst they waited for the signal, the horses
did dance to the musick of their own courage,
and by champing on their own bits, seemed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
that their masters would not suffer them
to decide the quarrel. The Trumpets at last
summoning the Riders to begin their carreirs,
their horses, who whilst they stood were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up their speed, opening now the sluce, did
by a speat of speed carry their Masters to a
longed-for rencounter, where the Lances pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
forwards by their Masters strength, and
pressed backwards by their enemies resistance,
did, like weak boats, split in this co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntertide of
courage and resistance, resolving rather to
break than to be dyed with the valourous and
innocent bloud of such incomparable Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
The Knights finding themselves deserted
by their Lances, sought assistance from their
Swords, which had formerly been grave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>makers
to so many valourous Knights. Thus fortune
(thinking she had done the Martial Knight ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
enough in enabling him to resist so long)
inclined to favour <hi>Megistus,</hi> importuned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by the suits of all the bystanders, who would
have surely have favoured the Martial Knight,
because of his singular courage, if he had been
fighting against any else than against <hi>Megistus,</hi>
and in any other quarrel than that wherein he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33161:41"/>
was then engaged, the Ladies eying him as an
enemy to their sex; and the Gentlemen hating
him as an enemy to the Ladies. Whilst they
were trying how to conquer, the Martiall
Knight thinking that not to overcome instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
was to be overcome shamefully, lifted up his
arm as if he had been sending it to bring fresh
assistance from his patron <hi>Mars,</hi> (which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
albeit it was against the rules of the Art,
yet he thought <hi>Megistus</hi> tottering condition
might licentiate him to use, hoping to remit
himself in his old posture, before <hi>Megistus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
his saddle) intended to separate at one
blow <hi>Megistus</hi> from his saddle, and his soul
from his body, but he was mistaken; for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus</hi>
vaulting aside, suffered not the Sword
to fall upon his, but upon disappointments
shoulders; but that was not the only incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of that artless stroke: for the strength
imployed being great, and the disappointment
yet greater, he had almost been dragged by it
out of his saddle, and had almost by his Sword
cut the earth, seing he could meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
nearer to resist him; like a dog, who
bites the stone, because he cannot meet with
the caster; which <hi>Megistus</hi> perceiving, and
unwilling to slight such an opportunity (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by some Masters of that Art, a <hi>Tempo)</hi> did
by a contertemps blow send him posting to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33161:42"/>
earth, to which he formerly enclined, but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedly;
yet albeit he fell, his courage fell
not with him, for, in falling, he struck off one
of <hi>Megistus</hi>'s horse legs, who not being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to stand upon three feet, fell upon his
knees, as if he craved him pardon for the afront
his master had done him: The Martial Knight
like a ball rebounding by the same strength that
threw it to the earth, bolted up immediately.
<hi>Megistus,</hi> who had rid himself of his stirrups,
did the like, and now they coaped so furiously
as that what formerly they had done, seemed,
in respect of what they were now doing, to be
but like those essay thrusts, which learners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
in a Fencing-school before they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a posture, and seemed to be but the
earnest-peny of that great bargain they were
now making: At last the Martial Knight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the bloud which he spent in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<hi>Megistus,</hi> would be better imployed if
spent in his quarrel, recoyling three steps, called
to the Judges, that, for any thing he knew, it
was the god <hi>Mars</hi> against whom he was fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and so, to atone his guilt, he was willing
to break his sacrilegious Sword, This merry
conceit shewed a quaint wit in him, in whom
they had spied a strong courage formerly; and
now both of them, throwing away their
Swords, did imbrace each other, wrestling as it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33161:42"/>
were who should be kindest. The Judge asked
how the Crown should be bestowed? Give
me it, said the Martial Knight, and I will place
it on the head of this deserving Gentleman.
<hi>Megistus</hi> refused it, and said, that his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
was too great a prize to remunerate so
small a victory. Thus the King and Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home, expecting with a long desire the
afternoons tilting.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, the King, Court and Judges
being placed in their respective places, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
The first who entered these Lists of
death, was a Knight who seemed dead already:
his armour was all black, and made him appear
to be deaths armour-bearer: his horse, whose
counter was suitable to his masters armour,
seemed by his prancing to cut up a grave for
his dead master; he was discerned at last to
be the valiant <hi>Terez,</hi> who fought in honour of
the deceased Lady <hi>Tina,</hi> once his dear Mistris;
He told the Judges he came there, to beg a
pasport from some noble hand to post to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
after her; where seing he resolved to go,
he intended to go in the Chariot of Honour.
The Judges at first intended to deny him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
telling him, That as life, according to
the course of nature, preceded death; so in the
course of justice, lifes Champions were to be
preferred. At which Answer, the black Knight
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33161:43"/>
showed some dissatisfaction: Yet the Judges
considering that the Bloud Royal (whereof
<hi>Terez</hi> was one) were exempted by their birth,
from such trifling ceremonies, and judging it
an inhumane act to adde affliction to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
resolved to authorize his appearance.
He carried in his shield a Turtle Dove, sitting
upon a leafless Oak; his Motto was, ONLY
ONE. Against him appeared two or three
Knights successively, who being vanquished,
served as steps whereby <hi>Terez</hi> might the more
easily mount Fames theater: At last appeared
one Knight, whom the Sun had withered, and
seemed to resemble one of those dead bodies
whom the Egyptian Mummie had preserved
hundreds of years; his shield was beautified
with a Dying-man, all withered except one
hand, wherein he carried a Scarlet Ribbon:
the Motto was, LOVE WORKETH
CONTRARIES; meaning, that it could
make a fresh body become withered, and a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
hand become fresh; This was <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
and that was ARETINA'S Ribbon;
the bosses of his bridle were two Lilly Roots,
whose leafless stalks served for the reigns.</p>
            <p>These two seemed rather to court, than shun
death; and the desire they had to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
seemed not to proceed from any desires
they had to live (for providence could inflict
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33161:43"/>
no greater punishment as life upon them) but
rather, because they desired to have one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
company in the other world: thus they
spent many blows, and shed more bloud than
the by-standers imagined their bodies were
masters of. ARETINA was told by <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
heart (which he had depositated in her
custody) that the Combatant who wore the
Scarlet Ribbon, was <hi>Philarites,</hi> and that she
was the Sun, by whose beams his lovely body
had become so parched: whereat she blushed,
or rather her bloud, desiring to be judge and
witnesse of <hi>Philarites</hi> courage, came to her
cheeks, to try if thence they might descry that
noble courage, which it heard all the spectators
so much extoll: But <hi>Philarites</hi> beholding
ARETINA (as if her face had been an Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
from which he was to expect new armour)
did by an irresistible stroak, kill that heart,
which grief had formerly so sore wounded;
being thrown thus to the ground, he threw up
his eyes to heaven as if his soul intended from
thence to take its flight to paradise. <hi>Philari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
running to him, did by his tears wash those
bleeding wounds which his sword had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opened, to whom the black Knight gave a
Diamond Ring, as a memorial of his true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
which he had after that same manner
received from <hi>Pilades</hi> (ARETINA'S dear
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33161:44"/>
cousin and friend) whom he had killed the year
preceding in combat. Many regrated his losse,
and a witty Gentleman at Court dressed him
this Epitaph.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>It seems the gods to flit from earth intend,</l>
               <l>Seing their best furniture away they send</l>

               <l>Interred lyes embalm'd by <hi>Terez</hi> name.</l>
               <l>Let mortals then rear him a Tomb of Tears,</l>
               <l>Whilst their sad hearts a double mourning wears.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>After Supper, whilest <hi>Terez</hi> ghosts were
troubling all their quiet, there entred a fellow,
who told his Majesty that he was to shew him
a Monster. The King desired he might present
it upon a stage, whereon the Commedians used
to act, that it might be easily discerned, and
the whole Court the better satisfied. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the fellow mounting the stage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
the sheet that covered his promised
Monster, there appeared an old fellow, with a
pair of large Harts Horns; at which a merry
Gentlewoman snuffing, said, A strange Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
forsooth, whereof I have such another
lying in my bed at home. The fellow having
viewed him on all quarters, did thus begin his
description.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Acteon,</hi> is by his kind wife called her
Hart, and he is so; for she hath made him so.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33161:44"/>
He came to the world when <hi>Capricornus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
amongst the celestial signs, at which time
he received the name of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> the Man
in the Moon was Gossip, who, as a Donative,
bestowed upon him the fair Cap which he now
wears, which his wife fearing he should lose,
hath borrowed needls from her kind neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to sow it on faster; and where-ever he
enters (such is her pride) that she will have
five or six to follow him: at last, she did not
fancy the name of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> (saying
that it was not famous) but she would needs
have him called <hi>Cornelius Publicus</hi> (he being
the Publican, and she the Sinner) She having
one day offended him (as young women do oft
old men) he called her Whore; and she, fearing
that neighbours might thereafter upbraid him
with the name of a Lyar, hired some pretty
Gentlemen, who were her acquaintances, to
vindicat his name from that aspersion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the good old man (finding that he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken)
did, like the Snails when they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
shoot out his Horns.</p>
            <p>This description ended, they went all to bed,
and with that day they ended the solemnity of
these Nuptials.</p>

            <p>FOrgetfulnesse did now begin to claim
soveraignity over what past, and the
pleasures of that famous Solemnity,
which had not long since been in its
flourish, was now in the fall of its leaf; and
every man returned to his former imployment,
sorry that pleasure, which had only shewn them
a glimpse of the face, should have passed by so
quickly; and they resembled now poor Gally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaves,
who after some short recreation, are
called back to their former Oars. But <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
besides the common melancholy wherein
he shared with others, had likewise a private
stock of his displeasure, wherewith his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
soul traded continually: for, nothing
pleased him, seing he could not please ARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINA:
his dayes seemed nights, because not
illuminated by the sunshine of her smiles; and
his nights seemed death, because not quickned
by hopefull thoughts: and fearing that <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
should bring home her daughter with her,
he entreated <hi>Eudoxa</hi> to cause <hi>Agapeta</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for her stay at Court, which <hi>Agapeta</hi> did,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33161:45"/>
and prevailed so, that <hi>Bonaria</hi> returning home
left ARETINA with the Princess.</p>
            <p>Whilest all others went abroad to hunt,
<hi>Philarites</hi> stayed at home, hunting occasions
to meet ARETINA, but all in vain; for
<hi>Agapeta</hi> (whom vertue had glued to ARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINA)
thought alwayes she wanted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
when she wanted ARETINA; yet, one
afternoon ARETINA'S waiting-mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (with
whom he kept constant correspondency, and
whom his generous carriage, and rich dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
had gained) acquainted him, that she
was to stay at home retiredly till six a clock;
for she had alwayes endeavoured, since the last
Combat, to wash by her wishes that tauney
colour, which the armour and device represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and was divesting her self of that indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
towards <hi>Philarites</hi> which she had used
formerly, weighing all his qualities in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of love (which would have proven
weighty enough even in the ballance of truth)
and his very fame (which is but naturally a
thing very light) appeared heavie here.</p>
            <p>Whilest she was curiously recapitulating to
her self all his endowments, <hi>Philarites</hi> enters
the hall, asking if ARETINA was quiet? she
finding her mind in disorder, and accusing her
very thoughts, as if they had divulged her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
to <hi>Philarites,</hi> (for none knew them but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33161:46"/>
they) resolved not to admit him, yet that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
was presently re-called by a second,
which condemned the first of unmannerlinesse;
whereupon she desired that he might advance:
for love perswaded her, that the gods, who
were his favourites, and are mortals privie-counsellours,
had inspired him to choose so
favourable an opportunity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarites,</hi> at his entry, making a low reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(as if he would have kist the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she had once trod upon it) said, Madam,
I fear that as I am fortunate in finding you so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,
so I am unfortunate in having an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to disquiet your solitarinesse, but my
obedience in retiring, if commanded, shall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
that my errour streamed from ignorance.
Sir, (replied ARETINA) your company
would be preferred by the finest Wits at Court
to any else, and why should I refuse to accept
that favour which better than I would entreat
for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarites</hi> being seated in a chair near ARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINA,
did, like a ship newly entred the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
discharge a volley of sighs; but his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who had retired to assist his heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
wounded by a dart, short from ARETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA'S
eye, had left his tongue frozen by the
cold chilnesse of fear; yet she perceiving by
what he had spoken formerly what he would
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33161:46"/>
have spoken now, (her cunning supplied his
dumbnesse) to enter him in some discourse, and
fearing he should enter upon that subject,
asked what newes were currant at Court?
<hi>Philarites</hi> lifting his dejected eyes, said, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
why should one who hath no interest in
the world, such as I am, ask what the world is
doing? Truly, said ARETINA, if ye have as
much interest in the world, as ye have courage
to astonish the world, or had as much need of
the world, as it hath of you, I am confident
your interest would cede to none. Since my
courage cannot he serviceable to you, Madam,
(replied <hi>Philarites)</hi> I value it not; or, at least,
since you will not imploy it, for I shall never
use it but either in Vertues, or your quarrel;
and seing your goodnesse will never engender
enmity, my courage shall be uselesse: neither
vallue I Vertue so much for any reason, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a thing wherein ye take some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
I thought (quoth ARETINA) that
ye had swept away these cobwebs of folly (or
of love, as ye will term it) from the cabinet
of your generous soul; and I judged alwayes
formerly, that none but fools and mad-men
were taken in these cobwebs, which that crafty
spider, <hi>Cupid,</hi> weaves, to ensnare poor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
but that such strong Courages as yours
would easily break through them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:33161:47"/>
               <hi>Fair Lady, replyed</hi> Philarites, <hi>I am not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in follies cobwebs, but in those golden
chains which loves fair hands have twisted for
me. Alas, Madam, I would have thought my
self happy once this morning to have received
your commands, but now I think my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
seing when I have received, I cannot
obey them. Ye command me not to love: but
that is as unpossible as to command me to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
my reason and senses; for, love and they
seem now to be incorporated in one: and ye
would think him an unskilfull Physician who
would apply nothing to his patient, but would
intreat him only to convalesce. Wherefore,
Madam, apply the lenitives of clemency to cure
my wounded heart, which else is incurable.
If ye be really distempered with that passion
(said ARETINA) imploy your reason. Alas,
Madam, quoth</hi> Philarites, <hi>ye send me to the
wrong Physician; for my reason confirms my
passion, and perswades me it is reasonable to
love a person of your extraordinary qualities,
and that seing all your acquaintances adore
your perfections, it were vanity in me to be
singular, it imploys, as a guard for it, my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
to remember those excellent discourses
which I have heard from you; it imploys my
eyes to behold those ravishing looks, and my
judgment to ponder the singular effects of your
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33161:47"/>
rare prudence: So that (fair Lady) the only
sanctuary I can refuge my self in, is your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
But think ye (said ARETINA) that
I will prove so great a stranger to my parents,
as to choose without their advice? (for, to
chuse without ones consent, is to chuse against
his consent, seeing possibly his consent can
never be extorted from him, and so by chusing
before he consent, we care not whether he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or not) and especially being a woman,
whose reason is weaker, and whose passion is
stronger than that in a man, and so the one
hath more need to be directed, and the other
more need to be restrained than in men; and
thereupon she opened a book which lay upon
her table, wherein she made him read this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
discourse.</hi> Experience teacheth that
a womans miscarriage is more prejudicial to
her self, and more dishonourable to her parents
than a mans; and so where the wrong may be
greater, the consent of the party wronged seems
more requisite; seing the consent is required
to skreen the consenter from a future wrong:
Whereon hath been built that signal Law, that
a man may necessitate his daughter to marry,
but not his son: because, if the daughter not
marrying, tash her repute, her fathers repute
is irrepairably wronged, and her own being, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
black by immodesty, can never return, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33161:48"/>
to its own, nor any other colour. And
there is reason it should be so, because where
the crime is most to be feared, there the Law
should be most strict: And surely women are
more prone to imbrace what their passion prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
them than men are; as also, because there
is more modesty required in them, the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of modesty must surely in them be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vice. The reason why modesty is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in them than in men, are first, Because
seing that is the main vertue which Nature
hath bestowed upon them, they should therefore
endeavour to be rich in that; and as men
should exceed women in courage, because cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
is the vertue of their sex; So women
should exceed men in modesty, because modesty
is the vertue of theirs, nature having bestowed
something upon every species, wherein they are
to excel others, suffering them for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ornament, to monopolize the perfection of
some one quality. Whence every species is nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in the world, and adds some ornament to
it; But the politick reason why modesty is by
the Law thought more requisite, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
in the Law more punished in women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
immodesty in women can be more destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the Commonwealth, rendring herita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
uncertain, and fathers carelesse of their
posterity, not knowing if their supposed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

be come out of their own loyns; Which
was the cause likewise why Adultery was only
reputed such, when there was an unlawful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
betwixt a married woman and a
man, whether married or unmarried; but
familiarity betwixt a married man, and an
unmarried woman, was not reputed Adultery,
albeit now both be punished equally, as being
perjury against the immortal gods, whereas
then no vow was made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarites</hi> laying aside the book, ARETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA
continued thus; Sir, as it were absurd in
me to love without my parents consent, so it
were yet more absurd in me, without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to match with a stranger (for, whom I
love, him I intend to match with) for how can
I know his extraction whose person I know
not? and I will never love him whose extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I am ignorant of: For I have oft heard my
father say, that it was probable that mens spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

Whereupon she put in his hands the former
book of Essays, wherein she desired him to
read this subsequent discourse.</p>
            <p>It is certain that the gods who have chosen
Princes and Nobles to be their Vicegerents
upon earth, will replenish their souls with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
requisite for the discharge of so
weighty an imployment; and seing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33161:49"/>
unfit persons, is a folly scarce incident
to men, it were blasphemy to charge the gods
with it; for, albeit the gods sometimes shewes
their soveraignity in acting above the reach of
our reason, yet seing man is formed after the
image of the gods, and seing the rational soul
is this image, surely what reason teacheth us,
that the gods will do. It might be thought
likewise injustice in the gods, if they subjected
us to those who could not command; and as it
seems prejudicial to us, so it may prove dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
and destructive to their interest: for,
either the arrogant folly, or despicable simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Governors, are the nurseries of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
combustions and commotions; wherein
the very Temples are not exempted from the
edge of popular fury. But besides these, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
wants not its other advantages, as that
of breeding, which seems to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oul's soul,
and the cream of all humane perfections, and
that of confidence, their birth being a rock si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
above the reach of malices greatest shot.
The distance likewise which others must keep
with persons of quality, is no weak bulwork to
defend their honour, and to maintain their
respect: for, the best of men, having much of
naughtinesse in them, the retirednesse enjoyned
to them by their dignity, and the distance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

which vails over all these imperfections, and
conceals what is not worthy of the noticeing;
man being like bad merchandize, which looks
best when looked upon at a distance, or when
presented in a dark shop; so that oft-times
what is gilded by retirednesse, passes for the
real gold of prudence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarites</hi> laying aside the book, looked as
if his tongue had been with childe of somthing
which it wanted strength to bring into the
world, at last said, Madam, ye are loved by
one who is subject to none but to ARETINA,
and who albeit he be a Prince, yet accompts it
a greater happiness, and a more sublime honour
to be your Subject, than a Prince in his own
Nation. Here he stopped, as if he would have
accused himself for not stopping sooner. ARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINA
(glad to be now assured of what she
formerly conjectured) told him, that there was
yet one ingredient requisite to be infused in
loves potion, which was constancy; neither
resolve I (said she) to cast the anchor of my
love but upon some sure ground, which will
not suffer it to slip: for, constancy is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in a Lover, than Nobility in a Courtier;
and as the one will be required by my parents,
so the other will be required by my self, neither
will ever I marry but him in whose generous
person I see those accomplishments first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:33161:50"/>
Six a clock striking, advertised ARETINA
that she behoved to wait upon <hi>Agapeta,</hi> so
bidding <hi>Philarites</hi> adieu, she left him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
his own happinesse, who returned now as
deeply fraughted with joy, as he entred fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with grief; like a ship who had unloaded
her self of her pricelesse ballast, that she might
load her self with rich and precious commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>Now love did begin to kindle its flames in
the chimney of <hi>Megist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hed nothing so much as
ARETINA'S praises; but that chimney, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heated by the like fire formerly, suffered
these coals to kindle but slowly: In the end,
<hi>Cupid,</hi> who had long hovered whether to
shoot or not, fearing that <hi>Megistus</hi> heart,
(hardned by the continuall exercise of martial
imployments) should be unpenitrable by his
darts, at last loosed a shaft (resolving to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
a dart to conquer such a noble soul) which
did wound his poor heart so deeply, as that the
hand of his courage could never there-after
pluck out the dart; nor yet could the hand of
his reason cure the wound: for one morning,
going to fetch a walk in the Garden Royal, he
perceived, unexpectedly, <hi>Agapeta,</hi> who was
pulling some Cherries, the trees bowing their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33161:50"/>
branches, that she might by her own hand pull
their fruit: <hi>Megistu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that he shewed a desire to

               </gap> Fencer, who by a feint
would have his adversary believe what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not; but <hi>Agapela</hi> willing to discourse
with him, whose discourse each man at Court
so much commended, intreated him to advance,
telling him that these Cherries would rellish
the better that they were eaten in his society,
whose presence could make the worst fare a
feast.</p>
            <p>Madam, replyed <hi>Megistus,</hi> who feeds on
your ravishing looks, feasteth beyond all the
dainties that <hi>Venus</hi> table can afford him. But
whilest she was pulling these Cherries, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus</hi>
was pulling the poysoning hemblocks of
poysoning love: for, looking upon <hi>Agapeta's</hi>
eyes, he thought they were <hi>Cupids</hi> quiver,
wherein he kept all his mortal darts; every
trait of her face seemed a storehouse of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and her hair, which because of its colour,
and curlings, resembled so many gold rings,
proved to him chains to fetter the feet of his
trembling soul: he was in end awaked out of
his extasie of admiration, wherein his love had
lulled him asleep, by <hi>Philarites,</hi> who had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him from his Chamber, whom <hi>Agapeta</hi>
saluting courteously, they fetcht some walks
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33161:51"/>
in the pleasant Alley, recounting the various
and charming pleasures of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and amongst the other pleasing passages that
had occurred, <hi>Agapeta</hi> told h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m how a Lady
had fairded her decayed looks, with the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
colours that she had borrowed from Art,
was deciphered by a young Gentleman, who
by the reflection of a burning-glasse, melted
away those splendid colours, who seemed
shamefully to hast away<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> how soon they were
discovered. I remember, said <hi>Megistus,</hi> of
such an affront, wherewith just providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
a young Ladies cheating pains in our
Country, who being mistris of a Ball given her
at her own lodging, retired alwayes to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
chamber, where, by a little feather, she
sprinkled her face with some white Lilly water,
with which she seemed continually to recruit
those auxilaries, which she had hired out of
Arts territories to assist her weak beauty: a
Gentleman perceiving that the Phyol wherein
it was, stood in the dark corner of a chamber,
which she had purposly obscured (fearing lest
light should discover that work of darknesse)
went and removed the Phyol, exchanging it
with another full of Ink, which the Lady at her
return made use of as formerly, besmearing her
face with it, and returning, was welcomed by
the unrestrainable laughter of all the spectators.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33161:51"/>
It is just, said <hi>Agapeta,</hi> that the gods should
punish those, who by the pencil of vanity will
undertake to amend any thing in a piece which
hath once past their hands, they are (added
<hi>Megistus)</hi> like those cunning hunters, who
cover branches with birdlime to ensnare some
silly fowl, which little expects their Art; yet
I think that as these are sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llesse merchants,
who hazard much, where there is but little to
be gained, and where the gain, albeit they
escape, cannot ballance the losse if their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
thrive not; So those Ladies will lose more
in their repute, if once entrapped, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of a fine face can advantage them, if dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
for the one will cry them down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
all those at Court, albeit the other can
never plead preference to them before all those
raying faces which shine there: Yea, I think
they accuse themselves of some notable defect,
which they think cannot be palliated but by
some notable cheat, and detracts extreamly
from their own sex, shewing that colour is its
greatest ornament, and from ours, in thinking
that colour is a sufficient price for our dearest
liberty. <hi>Agapeta</hi> being called-for by a Lady
from the Queen, left <hi>Megistus</hi> in a drooping
condition, like a lowring <hi>Solsequium</hi> at the
Suns absence, or like the disconsola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:33161:52"/>
Not long after this, an accident at Court di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
somwhat the quiet of both the Knights,
who dragging after them one link of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
fatal chain, were followed by all its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>Some Noblemen at Court not daring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
<hi>Sophanders</hi> grandour in his own person,
resolved to affront him in the person of these
Knights, his avowed minions, and petitioned
the King that their priviledges might not be
infringed by his nimious respect to strangers;
and that seing their predecessors had planted
by their pains, and watered by their bloud, the
thriving Vine of blossoming Monarchy in that
Nation, that they their successors might now
eat with pleasure, and in safety, its delicious
fruits; and that strangers might not reap what
they had sown, Therefore they entreated his
Majestie not to prefer these strangers to them,
seing albeit they might be Nobles at home, yet
they could not be esteemed as Nobles in <hi>Egypt:</hi>
for, albeit Gentility (because it is a quality
dyed with the bloud) be the same everywhere,
so that a Gentleman in one Nation is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in every Nation, he having received that
honour from the hand of Nature, whose sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
all Nations are; whence it comes that a
Gentleman of one Kingdom may by the Law
of Arms challenge another, seing he leaves not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33161:52"/>
his Bloud when he leaves his Country; yet
Nobility is the donative of the Prince, which
none are obliged to acknowledge who are not
his subjects, and so out-reaches not his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
but, like the Loadstone, loseth its ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
when without the spheare of its allowed
activity: Therefore by the Law of Nations,
and of Arms, Noblemen are not accounted
such when amongst strangers.</p>
            <p>The King calling <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Philarites</hi>
privatly, told them the quarrel; who entreated
his Majesty to satisfie his Nobles, and not to
put them in the scales with strangers, whose
assistance was lesse valuable, and more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
than that of his natives. But the King
ashamed of their insolency, and willing to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the generous Knights, told them, that he
would advance them to be Knights, and honor
them with the Collar of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> an Order
instituted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to difference highly-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
persons from the rabble of ordinary
Knights, whom the ambition of the Subject,
and lenity of the Prince, had, by making it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
made it despicable; and that thereby
they might claim preference from all the other
Subjects every-where, without the verge of
National Solemnities, such as in Parliaments,
Senates, Councils, where none could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
but these, whose fortunes lying within
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33161:53"/>
the circle of the Nation, might oblige them to
riske their lives for their Countries safe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y; men
being alwayes most willing to go when interest
pouseth them: As also it is dangerous to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
strangers to the intimacy of national myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
neither is it thought prudence in a King,
to admit those to manage affairs who have not
estates to be hostages for their fidelity, and to
repay the injuries done, during their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to private persons. The Knights did on
their knees acknowledge his Majesties civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but told him that they wished his Majesty
not to prostitute these honours to ignominy,
by conferring them upon persons, so little me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting;
for they were sensible how destructive
the impressa of honour was to subjects, drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the purses of su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jects in buying them from
the hands of profuse Courtiers, who, as they
sinned against the King, in abusing his favours;
so they sinned against the Gods and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
in imploying its price, as suffultors to
support the shield of their matchless pride, and
how when these abject richlings, or richlesse
Gentlemen had once come by them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to make vanity and luxury to bear up
the train of these useless honours: these disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
are swelled to a prodigious excrescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
by another as bulkish as any of the former;
for, by that means trade is every-where almost

whence accresces this great advantage,

their first adventures, Whereas, if they were
destitute of this assistance, they behoved to lose
their hopes when they lost their stocks, and so
the Commonwealth would be robbed of their
endeavours, whose spirits were as great as their
misfortunes; and, on the other hand, Noblemen
by their means are encouraged to put their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

condescended not to accumulate them

them that opportunity might ripen for them

            <p>But the well-spring of <hi>Philarites</hi> hard fate,
ceased never to bubble up fresh misfortunes,
imploying all the weapons of discontentment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33161:54"/>
to rout his unconquerable vertue, hating al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
spirits of such a noble detramp, because
they scorn to make her the center of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
as if she would perswade men, that they
could not subsist without her assistance: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seing his quiet could not be disquieted by
pride, she resolved to imploy jealousie, whose
subtile hands twisted this curious snare for him.</p>
            <p>A Lady, sister to the Prince of <hi>Goshan,</hi> named
<hi>Pinasa,</hi> whose beauty suited well with her
birth, and whose birth furnish'd her respect
enough at Court, had of a long time looked
upon <hi>Philarites</hi> with loves spectacles, but
finding that her portracture could never be
drawn upon the ground of <hi>Philarites</hi> heart,
till ARETINA'S were first defaced, studied
all means to perpetrat happily, what she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
so passionatly; yet finding that <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
love could not be cheated, she endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cheat ARETINA, whose modesty she
expected might more probably co-opere with
her malice; not permitting her to trace the
crook<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d path of her sinistrous designs, so nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as <hi>Philarites</hi> male passion doubtless either
would or could; but finding that she alone
was not able to draw malices chariot, yoaked
with her self an old hagg in the same imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bribed her venal spirit, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was venal, might easily be bribed; who
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33161:54"/>
measured every thing; yea, vertue it self, by the
yard of money, not caring for heaven, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was said to be paved with gold; nor
respecting the gods, but because their favour
was a mine, out of which much precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
might be digged: this wretch did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the conduct of that wretched affair, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising,
because of her easie addresse to ARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINA,
and intimacy with her servants, to
pousse it to a wished-for period; Thus laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
out into the deeps of malice, the sails of
her diligence, were filled with an unexpected
gale of success: the barrennest earth being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilest
of such poysonous weeds; and she, who
was fit for nothing else, was by malice exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
fitted for this.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Philarites</hi> hard fortune, which had
decreed the event, had likewise marshalled very
orderly all the means, by which, as by sinews,
this great body of jealousie was to move: for,
one day walking in a meadow (whose face
was by over-spreading <hi>Nylus</hi> hid twice a year,
that it might appear the more beautifull) did,
as unfortunatly, as unexpectedly, encounter a
clew of Ladies, whose rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eations had trysted
them hither. <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Philarites</hi> had
alwayes valued highly such company, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much as now, seing they appeared to
them coppies of their Mistrisses original beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33161:55"/>
after them followed the Martial Knight,
and <hi>Aristo, Pinasa's</hi> brother; thus the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Ladies and that of the Knights was
equal: salutes being interchanged, <hi>Philarites</hi>
fearing lest the conduct of the Ladies might
hatch some private disgusts amongst either the
Ladies, or themselves, about their attendance,
(and so that they might ignorantly, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently,
relapse into the same danger out of
which they were but lately escaped) and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
that indifferencie which might oblige
all equally to wait upon all, he entreated each
Lady to lend him some concealed token, which
when he had gotten, and had hudled up in a
hat, he desired each Gentleman to draw out
one, and that each should attend and entertain
her, whose unseen token should fall to his
share: for (said he) incomparable Ladies, the
hazard is not great where none can chuse what
is not excellent, so that I may say, there was
never more of Lottry seen where there was
lesse of hazard; each of us is happy in the share
he hath gotten, and yet each of us may be
thought unhappy in wanting what share we
want; So that pleasure and disappointment
never met so amicably as in this particular.</p>
            <p>Thus they spent some time in walking (Lot
having coupled them cunningly together) but
<hi>Pinasa</hi> finding that this disappointed the desire
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33161:55"/>
she had to banquet her eyes upon <hi>Philarites</hi>
lovely countenance, intreated they might pass
some time under the shadow of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arbour; which all obeying, they retired
thither, where being seated, <hi>Pinasa</hi> broke si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thus; <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as there is nothing
lesse taking than a confused look, and dejected
countenance, (where the runaway looks repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the sad spectacle of a flying Army) so there
is nothing that can discompose a countenance

who tune it a note lower than is either allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or seant; wherefore I wish we might use
some game to sport away time, and to prevent
our blushes: But seing our accustomed recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
are covered almost with the gray hair of
loathing, I wish <hi>Megistus,</hi> ye would invent
some new one, that the Court might hereafter
hug it, as a memorial of your sparkling vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of spirit. <hi>Madam,</hi> replyed <hi>Megistus,</hi> I
have no other sufficiency for the discharge of
that duty but what I borrow from your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
commands, wherefore, Madam, it were
injustice to refuse you what is your own.</p>
            <p>Since there is no absolute perfection but in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33161:56"/>
heaven, nor absolute imperfection but in hell,
(the earth participating of their extreamities,
as it reconciles both their distances) and seing
those even who see their dearest objects in the
mirrour of love, see some blemishes in them,
(which proveth that the most accomplisht of
things wantteth some accomplishment; for if
it could be seen any where, it would be seen
there) I wish every Lady would tell what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
she could dispense best with in that
person she most loveth.</p>
            <p>What will ye propose, <hi>Philarites</hi> (continued

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asa)</hi> for this nights entertainment? Truly
Madam (answered <hi>Philarites)</hi> seing discourse
is the best physiognimy of our thoughts (the
tongue being but Secretary to that skilfull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter,
the heart) and seing neither prudence,
nor respect, will suffer us to pry narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one anothers thoughts; I wish we might
hit at some indirect way whereby our enquiry
might be somewhat gratified; wherefore I
wish one of us might tel her who sits next him,
in the ear, some remark of any person here
present, at which all the rest might divine,
according to their fancy, every one of us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to conjecture what was the first
speaker observation, and he or she who shall
be by maniest voices judged to have been most
mistake, shall forfeit some pawn, to be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33161:56"/>
of at the discretion of the Society. This
last pleased them best; and after they had by
its help diverted themselves sufficiently, the
night summoned them to remove: and <hi>Pinasa</hi>
willing to bestow something upon <hi>Philarites,</hi>
which might terrifie ARETINA'S jealousie,
did let a Ribbon fall carelesly (which she had
worn in so remarkable a place at all the last So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
as none could but remark it) which
<hi>Philarites</hi> (in whose hand hers was) taking
up, presented her with; but she, willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it as a chain to fetter his passion, desired
him to keep it, as a memorial of her grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
for that unparalell'd favour she, and all
the remanent Ladies had received at his hands.</p>
            <p>Whilest times glasse was thus running, the
old Hagg was by the coals of diligence and
treachery, kindling the flames of jealousie in
ARETINA'S breast, whose ardent affection
to <hi>Philarites</hi> had softned her to an easie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of it; contentment being like other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies,
whereof the sweetest becomes soonest
putrified, and the souls of the delicatest tramp
are like the bodies of the poorest complexion,
whose purity bowes soonest to decays scepter;
and the fear to be surprized in following the
hidden tract of mis-information, is the mean
whereby they are often mis-informed; thus
love, which perswaded ARETINA that she
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33161:57"/>
was unworthy of such a lover as <hi>Philarites,</hi>
did likewise peswade her, that <hi>Philarites</hi> would
pearch his love more worthily upon some other
object, and, by being inconstant, would make
inconstancy a vertue: But there was more
Rhetorick musted up in that dumb R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bbon

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eta,</hi>
and jealousie did enter by the same porch
that love first entered: She impeached now
<hi>Philarites</hi> as guilty of high treason against
love, and adduced her own eyes as witnesses,
who seemed to deluge themselves in tears, lest
they should see the sad effect of his prodigious
inconstancy, which durst upon his arm brave
the sight of affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cted ARETINA; yet her jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
was glutted with a more pregnant argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his assured change: for <hi>Placeta,</hi> who
had studied the musick of what enchantment
the <hi>Tarantula</hi> of ARETINA'S melancholy
was best pleased with, caused a cunning fellow
(who traded in the adulterating of Writs, and
resembling every mans character) writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with his greatest cunning, (giving him a

            <p>This Letter was given to <hi>Pinasa,</hi> who being
one day at Court, watched by the diligent eye
of sorrowing ARETINA, did carelesly, as it
seemed, let it fall, within the command of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33161:58"/>
ARETINA'S reach, who stealing it into her
pocket, retired to her chamber, to see what she
could pick out of it, and having shut the door,
did read her ruine in these fatal characters.</p>
            <p>O pattern of basenesse, how hast thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
my credulity! how hast thou stifled my
hopes, and stained thine own valour! Yet alas,
poor ARETINA, thou hast prostitute thy
faith to his roguishness, and thou appearedst
as willing to be entangled, as he was willing to
entangle thee; it was strange thou couldest be
so infatuated with a stranger, and now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
more strange that thou shouldest startle
at so necessary an event; thou who wast the
envy of Ladies, and the Image adored by Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
wilt now be the object of both their
laughters; and seing <hi>Philarites</hi>'s bewitching
deportment will bundle up respect for him at
all hands, the same carriage will surely blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thee, and thou and he will be like two
buckets in the Well of fate and fame, whereof
the one must rise to the same proportion that
the other falls; and as the ocean of fame ebbs
upon the shoar of thy repute, it must flow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his; and surely his propitious fortune will
make all thy acquaintances conclude, that he
left off to love thee because he discovered som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in thee which was not lovely. Miserable
ARETINA! who hast banquerouted that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33161:58"/>
stock of fame, which the indulgent gods had
once bestowed upon thee, and who hast now
rendred thy self as despicable as once thou wast
lovely; misery hath once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atched thee in its
arms, and will never dismiss thee; fame hath
banished thee, and will never rehabilitat thee;
thy parents joys are massacred in thee, and in
the roll of thy crimes stands likewise the black
crime of thy paracide; all those additions of
honour which served once to adorn the shield
of thy repute, serve now as diminutions to it;
and, as a punishment of thy crime, thy name
shall still last in the registers of infamy.</p>
            <p>Thus did ARETINA stand streaming out
lakes of tears, as if she would have drowned
that Letter, because <hi>Philarites</hi>'s name was
written in it; like an implacable Judge, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the malefactor to be hanged in effigie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cannot be found in person; and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out her hair because it afforded him once
contentment, her passion verged upon destra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the musick of her sury, like the six
notes, did raise themselves a degree alwayes
higher; she evited company, lest they should
upbraid her with her misfortune; and her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
were as racks wherupon her unapea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
grief did torture her, and her disease was
so much the more dangerous that she durst ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
no Physician: Thus she lived alwayes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33161:59"/>
dying, and thus she dyed whilest she was yet
living.</p>
            <p>Yet love, for its own defence, did alleadge,
that jealousie might be mistaken aswell as hope,
and especially amongst women, whose genius
byassed most that way: for as men, because of
their courage, are oftenest befooled by hope;
so women, because of their innate timerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
are oftenest betrayed by fear: and of all
women, lovers are soonest overcome by fear;
for, as their love multiplieth perfection in the
person loved, so those perfections multiply
fears in the person loving; even as they whose
coffers regorge with treasures, fear most the
losse of their treasure. Love likewise teacheth
us to overvalue others, and undervalue our
selves, and so perswadeth us that all the world
gapes after what we affect most, and that of
all pretenders we deserve least; and so there
is reason to fear, that seing we deserve it not,
albeit none pretended to its enjoyment, that
there is much more reason to fear a losse of
what we love, in the throng of so many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors.</p>
            <p>Now Pleasure intended to change its camp,
and, like the Sun, to make all the world debtor
to it splendor by turns, intending often to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greage
its respect by its absence, and to conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
respect elsewhere by its presence, so that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33161:59"/>
oftentimes it doth (like all other agents) by the
same means, produce contrary events; so that
some by being merry, others by being retired;
some by being proud, others by being humane,
attain, by these contrary midses, to the same
end of glory; like two men by opposite wayes
meeting others on the other side of perfections
globe, to which men may go by contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
For, whilst the Court was bathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their pleasure, a Currier comes, telling
the King that a Navie of strangers were riding
before <hi>Iris,</hi> expecting a safe entry from the
next tide; and that some Fishers had by their
Flags perceived them to be the Navie of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who disputed propriety in
the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For, <hi>Xistus,</hi> grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
to the King who now liveth, was by
birth King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and for his valour, elected
King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and so <hi>Prastus's</hi> father, being
his first-born, was righteous Heir of both
Crowns; but the Nation really scorning to be
annexed to <hi>Persia,</hi> and thinking that slavery
too unworthy a recompence for their respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
choice, elected the second son; because, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he was but second son to <hi>Xistus,</hi> yet he
was their Kings eldest son, <hi>Prastus's</hi> father
being born before his fathers acquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and so they preferred him to his elder brother,
so that ever since he and his successours, have
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33161:60"/>
still waited a quarrel to revenge their unjust
resentments.</p>
            <p>The King allarmed with these news, did by
his fear, adde to the strength and number of
<hi>Prastus</hi> Forces, and by looking upon his own
Forces through the wrong end of truths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
did see them lesse, and more inconsiderable
than really they were; his danger was eminent,
and his Forces scattered; his Courtiers dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and his Adversaries rich; his Soldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced,
and theirs most expert; as also,
their remoteness from their Country would
make them stack all the stock of their courage
upon the game; whereas his Souldiers, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where to retreat, would care the lesse how
to fight. <hi>Megistus</hi> perceiving that the waves
of the King's doubts raged extreamly, intended
to calm them by the oyl of his courage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
accosting his Majesty as he was solitary
in his Cabinet, he desired a Commission to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
under his Majesties Standard, such as
would make their lives their Countreys bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
and who might catch some advantage
of the unwary <hi>Persians,</hi> whom either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
or Sea-sickness, might weaken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
expectation.</p>
            <p>The King loth to hazard that ominous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
(for so the first alwayes is) upon so
great odds, told him, he would reserve his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33161:60"/>
courage as the spurre whereby all his Army
might be incited to ride triumphs carreer, and
that a skirmish was not a theatre large enough
to <hi>Megistus</hi> to display his courage upon, nor a
handfull of men witnesses enow to so renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a valour; yet at last, confiding in <hi>Megi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>'s
courage, and afraid of the peoples dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
commotions, he authorized his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> name was a trumpet loud enough
to call together all those who longed to draw
the swords of their Courage out of the sheath
of laziness, and to sheath them in the bowels
of their Countries enemies; and now he had
clewed some twelve hundred, who like a snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
became more bulkish the further it was
rouled; wherefore he intended in this his first
addresses to <hi>Agapeta,</hi> to usher himself in, with
this happy opportunity, and after a profound
reverence, said,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> I come to levy new forces out of
your looks, to assist me in this combate against
your fathers enemies, and to have my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
sealed by the hand of your pleasure;
Who dare resist when ye command? and who
would love that bloud which would not kisse
the ground for your satisfaction? I know ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
will take off that vail wherewith we see
her eyes ordinarily mufled up, to behold your
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33161:61"/>
quarrel, and will put victories garland in your
hand, that ye may crown those who stand in
your defence; wherefore, Madam, I am come
to resign my heart to you, and to leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your cure, and in the hospital of your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(where many thousands besides it lies) seing
its wounds forbids me to take it alongst with
me, and in place of it, I shall fill my breast with
a drachm of hopes which I am to expect from
the scales of your Ladiships favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agapeta</hi> fearing, lest her rudenesse might
unfit him for the journey, and desiring to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
him, who only by his example could ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the rest; and who was the axletree
whereon courage's wheels was then to roul,
told him, that she wisht her wishes could assist
him, whose valour was to assist her, and that
she thought her self most fortunate, who could
salary such Warriors with so little expence of
treasure (her smiles being all the solde which
was sought) wherefore she entreated him to
expect all the favour that a Lady could indulge
to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> being ready to reply, was called by
a Gentleman, who told him, that his Troups
were ready to march; so that leaving <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peta's</hi>
chamber, he rendezvouzed his glorious
Troups, whose glory was sublimated by the
presence of <hi>Philarites</hi> and the Martial Knight,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33161:61"/>
who seemed to be the Diamonds that set the
great price upon the Golden Ring of that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly:
from thence they marched about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and did the next morning arrive at <hi>Iris,</hi>
where they lurked all night in caves, expecting
the enemies landing (whom the boisterous
wind had hindred from landing till then) which
was not a tedious attendance; for the next
morning <hi>Sotorus,</hi> who commanded these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Forces, fearing no resistance, because of the
unexpectedness of their voyage, and the covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their designs) did foot the shoar, as if
he had come rather to triumph than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;
and expected that victory would meet
him half way to welcome him to <hi>Egypt:</hi> but
whilst he was shoaring his Regiments, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus</hi>
giving the signal to those who were in
the other two caves, commanded by <hi>Philarites</hi>
and the Martial Knight, did so terrifie by shouts
the surprized Persians, that they wished they
had never seen <hi>Egypt,</hi> since they saw nothing
in it but unavoidable dangers: That which
affrighted them most was some Fire-works,
which <hi>Megistus</hi> (well skilled in the Pyroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks)
had caused dress, whose noise and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
perswaded the Persians, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> had
lent their adversaries his thunder-bolts, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the unjustness of their quarrel: they saw
nothing because of the darknes and the smoak,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33161:62"/>
but what the light of these flames discovered
to them, which was nothing else but Death in
all her pontificals, and arrayed so variously, as
that she seemed not the same every-where; in
one corner of the field valour was punishing
resistance, and in another, courage was tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
under feet cowardishness; here the soul
was flying out of the body at a wounded head,
and there at a wounded heart, and in both, the
afflicted body was volleying the great ordnance
of groans at the beloved souls departure: some
sought to seek their graves in the waves, and
others, fleeing death, did meet it at their boats
(which <hi>Megistus</hi> did at the first encounter fire,
as if by these bonefires he would have testified
his gracious acceptance of their visit) <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
did by his sword subscribe two hundred's
pasports for eternity; and the Martial Knight
evidenced, that it was easier to overthrow
Troups of Persians than to combat <hi>Megistus</hi>
alone: Thus these three conquering Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
wounded as fast as they could strike, and
killed as fast as they could wound, the Persian
souls not daring to lodge any longer in their
bodies, than they were by their swords sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to remove, one stroak summing up all
the minutes of their process; and the souls
themselves most willing to remove, seeing their
appartements falling about their ears; <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:33161:62"/>
making breaches in the ranks, and in the
bodies also of those who stood in them, had
his sword bound (as Fencers speak) by the
cryes of a young Gentleman, who seeing <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites</hi>
ready to strike an aged man (whose
courage was in its spring, albeit his body was
in its autumn) called, Noble Knight, pity the
father of <hi>Arethusa,</hi> as ye shall be answerable
to your fair Mistris; this was the young mans
Mistris, whose beauty he imagined all men
knew aswell as he. <hi>Philarites,</hi> moved with
his passion, did condonat him his life, desiring
him to be debitor for it to ARETINA, and so
secured them both as his prisoners.</p>
            <p>The fields were become a perfect landskip
of terrour, and the greenest pile of grasse was
scarleted by the Persian bloud: but the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
fearing both what they saw, and what they
saw not (expecting no relief from the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
ships) were at last compelled to sanctuary
themselves in their enemies mercy, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their prisoners, because they could not be
their conquerours; and albeit the Egyptians
would have glutted their revenge with the
Persian bloud, yet the noble Knights barred
them from that piece of inhumanity; alleaging
that seing War was only instituted to secure
Nations from danger, and all just Wars were
meerly defensive, (for to recuperate our own,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33161:63"/>
is but to defend our own, and so invasion, if
it be to repeat what unjust enemies have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
us of, is but a species of defence; and if it
be to rob others, it is no War) that necessarily
all who were killed by the hand of revenge,
were rather murdered than killed; and that to
kill those whom they might save, imported that
the killers feared that they durst not coap with
them except they were disarmed, and so their
cruelty was not only injustice, but verged like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
upon cowardishnesse; and that in killing
them, they wounded their own interest: for,
thereafter all enemies would by despair heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
their courage, this barbarous custom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
them either to fight, or dye; and would
oblige their enemies, in requital, to deny them
their lives upon the like quarter: and as all
men should love to save their own life, rather
than to cut off their enemies; so all men should
be prone to grant quarters when but once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
and if War should by that means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a meer butchery, few would frequent it,
and the number of cowards would become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bulkish; for, scarce the stoutest of Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
would go, where he behoved either to gain
the field, or lose his life. This discourse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the Egyptians to save alive nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
captives (two thousand lying dead upon
the place) amongst whom, <hi>Sotorus</hi> had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33161:63"/>
himself to the valiant <hi>Philarites,</hi> and
they now remained rather masters of the field,
than of much spoil, and had bootied little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the ransom of their numerous prisoners.</p>
            <p>Whilst they were thus combating, a caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mathematician, who waited upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
de Camp, fearing lest death should have
surprised him before he minded to die, fled at
the first shock, and retired to a little Mount,
where he observed the Battel, as he used for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to observe the Stars, by the help of a
Telescope, which he carried in his hand in lieu
of a Musquet; this Gentleman perceiving <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus</hi>
conquerour, posted to Court (being
mounted upon a horse, which, because he was
fleet, he had bought to carry him away from
any danger, valuing his fleetnesse for no other
reason) hoping, in requital of his news, to
have some donatives bestowed upon him; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in this equipage faster to Court, than he
would have pursued his enemies, he arrived at
last at it, where he threw himself at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
feet, describing the Combat to him after
this fashion.</p>
            <p>Sir, we marched from this City, as from
the point <hi>A.</hi> (demonstrating all upon a Paper)
by a direct line to the Citadel of <hi>Iris,</hi> as the
point <hi>B.</hi> whence by a spiral line, we marched
to the Caves of <hi>C.</hi> where we eclipsed our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33161:64"/>
selves all night; the next morning, before the
Sun came from the Antipodes to our Horizon,
we marched, keeping the figure of a Paralello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramum,
conducted by <hi>Megistus, Philarites,</hi>
and the Martial Knight, who, as three lines,
made a glorious Triangle, whereof <hi>Megistus,</hi>
as General, was the Hypotenusa; in this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
we marched to the shoar, where we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
the Persians, upon whose bodies we
carved hundreds of wounds, in form of <hi>Isos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coles,
Scalenunis,</hi> and <hi>Trapezias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This discourse was interrupted by an Envoy
from the three Knights, who acquainted his
Majesty of their unexpected and compleat Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
Whereupon his Majesties Pleasant (per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiving
the Kings humour fitted for mirth, and
intending to twit the Mathematician for his
pedantry) told, his Majesty desired to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that Persian, alluding to his not understood
discourse; which the Courtiers (whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence
with his Majesty had gladned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly)
speedily executed, dragging him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Royal Hall in spight of his many
tears and protestations, that he was an Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>
            <p>The Victory being compleated, <hi>Megistus</hi>
sent to the neighbouring Towns and Villages,
desiring all both women and children to come
to the shoar, that so by a false muster, he might
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33161:64"/>
deter the Persians from landing any more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
So that they who were aboard of the
Navie, being destitute of boats and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(by that numerous, though feeble company,
having expected to surprize the Egyptians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they took the allarm) did now hoise sail,
leaving their hopes buried, and their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
unburied, upon the Egyptian shoar.</p>
            <p>The King glad of the Victory, and glader
that Providence had imployed these Gentlemen
(whom he affected extreamly) as agents in it,
because the Noblemens ambitious undiscretion
was thereby checked, and that heaven seemed
to authorize his inclinations, intended to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them with a triumphant reception; which
they fearing, directed secretly this missive to
his Majesty, entreating him to forbear both the
honour and envy, which they knew would be
linked together.</p>

            <p>This Letter the Knights wrote, scanning
upon what emergents had formerly occurred;
and considering how moe vessels were sunk by
carrying too large a sail, than by want of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last;
and how all men contributed thousands
of wishes to destroy the greatest Minions (men
being like Pyrats who pursue alwayes the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
prizes, thinking the poorest sort unworthy
of their pursuit) and that high imployments
are like high places, whose hight makes the

            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:33161:65"/>
The King pondering their desire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon the reason of their disassent, was
willing to shuffle up all the projected pomp in
a meer complement, which at their entry to
Court he delivered thus in a most obliging fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, <hi>Egypt,</hi> whose Ramperts ye have
been in this last Expedition, congratulates your
safe Return, and her very Rocks trumpets your
Praises, which is ecchoed by all her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
When I conferred that charge upon
you, I was confident, that if the Heavens had
any favours in store for us, they would bestow
them by your pure and mir aculous hands; So
that we all acknowledge our selves your deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
albeit none dare be so vain as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to be your paymasters.</p>
            <p>The Knights making a knee-deep reverence,
acknowledged themselves debtors to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
who had put that opportunity in their
hands, and that these applauses were the price
of his Countrymens bloud, who were the only
root, from which all these noble actions stem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>But we must return to recreate melancholy-ARETINA
(whom <hi>Philarites</hi> had confirmed
in her jealousie, by not saluting her at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
from Court; which he had not omitted,
but rather passed by, as an encounter which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33161:66"/>
might melt his courage, and fearing that she
might have kept him from imbarking himself
in a quarrel, to which both his respect to the
King, and the purchase of glory, prompted him
beyond resistance: yet she interpreted it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her jealous humour, not unlike a
person affected with the yellow jaundice, to
whom every thing appears of that colour; or
rather, like a cacochimick stomach, which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiates
the best of meats in its own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
humour: for, if at at any time, love
perswaded her that jealousie was a cheater;
yet even in that case love did rather distract,
than recreate her; and she being bound to the
stake of jealousie, love by these pulls, did not
pull her away, but rather pull her to pieces;
like a traitor bound to two horses, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
motions are his funest torments: thus
love and jealousie, like two twins, aguued by
their discord their comfortless Dame.</p>
            <p>Yet in fine, ARETINA (perceiving what
indefatigable correspondence was kept betwixt
<hi>Pinasa</hi> and <hi>Placeta,</hi> and how lavish <hi>Placeta</hi>
was in her invective discourse against <hi>Philari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
whom <hi>Pinasa</hi> so much adored) resolved
to fathom this design; whereupon, enquiring
diligently where they conversed most, found,
that their ordinary appointments were in an
Arbour, in the Royal Garden, at five a clock
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33161:66"/>
every morning; so that she at last, hit at this
expedient for the discovery of this their myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
correspondence.</p>
            <p>She caused the Gardener (who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Agapeta</hi> to obey her in every
thing) enter at two a clock, taking her maid
with him, and there dig a hollow in the ground,
where her maid was to lye; which he was
thereafter to cover with a sheet, leaving a rent
in the coverlet, whereby she might suck in new
supplies of air, and to straw it over with roses
and violets, as if they had been placed there to
dry at the Sunshine; that place being near the
Arbour, she could not but hear all was spoken;
neither did the heavens disappoint her wishes,
for at five a clock entered the two Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
who being seated within the reach of the
maids hearing, <hi>Placeta</hi> deduced to <hi>Pinasa</hi> the
whole story of ARETINA'S misfortune,
dwelling upon every point, as an infallible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of her own sagacity; and in the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of her discourse she demanded money to
satisfie the roguish Scrivener; who, seing he
sold his soul, intended to draw a considerable
price for it: <hi>Pinasa</hi> sucked out the honey of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ontentment from these poysonous flowers of
their discourse, and glutted her ears with so
pleasing a narration: Thus they fat drinking
the dregs of ARETINA'S affection, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33161:67"/>
somtimes their own conduct, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their successe, saying that Country Maids
were an easie prey to such Eagle spirits as were
Court Ladies; and that such a rich herb, as
<hi>Cunning,</hi> could not grow in so poor a soyl as
was a retired hermitage:</p>
            <p>This discourse ended, they returned to a feast
prepared for <hi>Placeta,</hi> leaving both time and
opportunity to ARETINA'S maid, to return
home to her Mistris, fraughted with these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
and welcome enquiries; where she
found her Mistris sitting, as if her soul had
bidden her body adieu, and had left it like an
appartement without an indweller, her hands
crossed, as if she would in that emblem have
represented the crosses of her innocent life: at
her maid's entry she raised her eyes, like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whose head being upon the block, starts up
once more to see if a pardon can be expected.
Her maid unwilling to torture her afflicted
Mistris, by twisting new delays, falling on her
knees, and throwing her eyes upwards, as if
she would have bestowed them upon heaven, as
a requital for these favours, said, Madam, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites</hi>
is not unconstant, but <hi>Pinasa</hi> is a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
so she spun out to her the whole web of
their discourse, so exactly, as that ARETINA
by the help of what her memory furnish'd her
from the Letter, and from <hi>Placeta's</hi> discourse,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33161:67"/>
did easily piece up the whole progresse of their
hellish treachery.</p>
            <p>ARETINA (who would not unvail her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
in presence of her maid) desired the
curtains might be drawn, for she intended to
sleep, and commanded the door should be shut.
The maid being removed, she accused her self
thus for her former jealousie; O unworthy
ARETINA, seing thy credulity hath declared
thee such! Was it not enough that thou
mightest be vicious by one of those vices, which
could reach its poyson only to thy self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
harbouring a vice that stained the repute of
such a spotless person as <hi>Philarites?</hi> was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his fame, nor thy experience, antidotes
sufficient against that venome of jealousie?
How darest thou place his portracture in so
polluted a room as thy polluted heart? and if
fate convoy him to paradise in the chariot of
some glorious enterprise, there to punish thee
for thy crime, and reward him for his vertue;
who shall absolve thee from that guilt which
thou hast contracted? and if he pardon thee,
that will evidence his goodness, but not thy
guiltlesness; and his very smiles shall be thy
continuall accusers. Whilest grief was thus
triumphing, love replied, that she was not so
culpable as she alleaged; for, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>alousie was at
worst but an excesse in love, and excesse is not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33161:68"/>
accounted so heinous a guilt as defects were;
seing excess had all that was to be found in the
vertue which it transgressed, and superadded
somewhat to it: whereas the defect could
frame no title to any of the least of vertues
perfections. Moreover, seing the greatness of
the temptation, was the golden rule whereby
Moralists squared the smalness of the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; that
in this case, the undiscoverablness of their plots
min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed exceeding the guilt of her escape. Lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in its plea alleageth also, that albeit womens
breasts be ordinarily Cristal-like transparant,
yet she had not blazed abroad her passion, nor
his crime; but had chosen rather to sit desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of comfort, than to receive comfort from
one whom she behoved to make conscious to
her griefs, and his escapes; and how that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites</hi>
himself had been a builder in this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
of mistakes, by not saluting her at his
departure, and in wearing the Livery of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lady.</p>
            <p>Thus ARETINA loved more now than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
resembling in that, a curious Watch,
which runneth most soundly when it is first
disjoynted, and thereafter pieced up by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Artist; or the breaches of a besieged City,
daubed thereafter with more strength than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
by the wary indwellers: Thus she spent
some restless hours, till sleep truced up a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33161:68"/>
of arme, betwixt these warring passions.</p>
            <p>After two hours sleep (which were not able
to defray so much wearinesse) she was awaked
by the deafning acclamations of a great many
street-runners; whereupon, calling her maid,
she desired to know the origine of these confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
who told her, That the Persians were
beat by the two Knights, and that <hi>Philarites</hi>
had captivated the Persian General. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
was seconded by a Letter from <hi>Agapeta,</hi>
who, to congratulat <hi>Philarites</hi> success, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her with all the passages of the Victory.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Philarites</hi> (the lungs of
whose love could breath no air contentedly,
but what they suckt in ARETINA'S pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence)

being indulged him, he came, circled in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

with a majestick (and yet discomposed) air.</p>

            <p>ARETINA'S eye travelled alongst all the

avarice did greedily bite, and the rather,
because he found every accident prognosticated
his ruine; and that his misery wanted onely
time to ripen it, Wherefore he did now begin
to bend all the force of his malice against the
Egyptian Monarchy; imploying the experience
of State which he gained in their service, to
do them now some egregious disservice, yet
so covertly as he never seemed to question the
Kings affection to him. But finding, that he
was not alone able to manage so bulkish a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel

            <p>
               <hi>Sophander</hi> finding <hi>Misarites</hi> judgment so

allowed him; calling him to his chamber, after

he had seen the King spend two hours in privat

discourse, asked him, if he and the Officers of the

of rewards, for all the bloud they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in his Majesties service, when strangers
did partage amongst them the booty of honour,
which they had foughten for? Sir, (replied

that is the greatest unhappiness imaginable, to

bulk: but <hi>Misarites</hi> affronts will weigh more
in the ballance of some mens fancies than of
others (and that is the greatest affront that the
persons affronted reputes such) and of all men
none weigh affronts so heavily, as those of
your profession: for, glory being your main

               </gap> sooner blurred than ours,
and your passions (which are alwayes afloat)
are sooner incenst than ours; vanity (which
is necessary in Souldiers) being of all others
passions, the most combustible: and seing your
disaster will have moe young men and gallants
to be witnesses to it, it must be more insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
than mine, which being at a Council-Table,
will be judged by some few wise old
men, who prize not much affronts of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33161:71"/>
and as the glory of a Souldier glistereth
more than that of Statesmen, certainly the
foil must be more grievous: Neither is ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the vice of my age, old men being rather
enclined to avarice, than panching to ambition;
for old men, not knowing by what means they
are able to gain, if necessity urged them to it,
are more greedy of it when they can attrap it,
than young men whose strength gives want a
defiance; as also, they know better how hard
it is to gain, and rely lesse upon the large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of others, than young men do; and their
bodies half transubstantiate in the earth, seems
to be near in kin to gold and silver, which are
but cadents of the same family; We want these
sparkls of courage which kindleth ambitions
fire, which not only burns in younger breasts,
but turns all other humours into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and that is the soveraign passion in you,
to which all the rest must do obeysance: But
why should our spirits be thus enthralled to
stupidity? and why should we sink in this gulf
of misery, seing the arms of our liberty are yet
loose, and the shoar of safety is so near? Where
is that shoar (quoth <hi>Misarites)</hi> where we
may find a safe harbour? If ye will follow
me as your Pilot (replyed <hi>Sophander)</hi> I shall
shoar you safely. I will most willingly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed

               <hi>Sophander</hi> glad that he was able to compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
such a considerable person in his treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
plot, devellopped to him the whole my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
and promised that if he would go a share
with him in the hazard, he should likewayes
have a share in the gains; and promised to
treat for him with <hi>Prastus,</hi> and with <hi>Sotorus,</hi>
who (being a prisoner of war there) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate
for that effect.</p>
            <p>But let us now visite <hi>Monanthropus</hi> and
<hi>Megistus,</hi> who spent their time as frugally as
their adversaries, and who were countermining
all their mines, and cantoning their friends and
associats, so that most of their exercise was
discourse, and most of their discourse was the
revolutions, whereby the heavens preached
perpetually the instability of humane affairs.
<hi>Monanthropus</hi> desirous to hear the sequel of
the Knights travels (begun at his house) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<hi>Megistus</hi> to pursue it; and <hi>Megistus,</hi>
to divert the eyes of his memory from gazing
on desolations gastly colours, condescended to
spin out that threed to a greater length, and
commenced thus.</p>
            <p>Sir, after the foundation of <hi>Philarites</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and mine was laid at <hi>Athens,</hi> and
its fabrick (cemented by assiduous familiarity)
was raised to some height, we resolved to
ramble up and down the world, carving always
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33161:72"/>
to our selves an adventure by our hungry
swords; wherefore, discharging our trains at
<hi>Athens,</hi> we desired <hi>Kaledulus</hi> only to attend
us: and beginning our journey towards <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi>
we were outed of our way, by a mist
which led us to a Wilderness; where we had
not travelled far, when a cry or two (sent from
the lungs of affliction) commanded our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to follow its tract; we posted to it,
knowing that anxieties glasse runt swiftly, and
at our coming, found a young Gentleman and
a Lady staked to a tree, looking every moment
in the face as the harbinger of death, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in such abundance, as that had they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that posture but a short time, the tears
would have rotted the cords wherewith they
were bound; our compassion had scarce fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
its eyes upon them, when we were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to place them elsewhere: for, two naked
men, covered with nothing but with their hair
(a garment lent them by dame nature, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
and stepmother) not so much out of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them to cover their nakedness, as out of
respect to the beholders, and to oblige their
modesty) did by their uneven brows (which
were to them in place of tongues) cartel us to
a combat; their arms were two long poles, to
which were fixed two shables (neither did they
offer us choice of arms) we judging gallantry
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33161:73"/>
but a nicety, where necessity was the quarrel,
and considering that they who were outlaws to
Nature, might be punished by any of her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
(all men being commissionated against
such common enemies) and that they who
would not kill such rascals, were guilty of the
bloud that was shed by them, resolved to make
use of all arms, and arm our selves with all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
against them, Whereupon <hi>Philarites</hi>
pulling out a pistol, sent from its barrel two
balls, cloathed in deaths livery, and by them
opened a salley-port to his soul to fly out of
that nasty prison, wherein it had been too long
captivated; his comrads courage fell with him,
and deaths horrid face represented in the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of his dying friend, agasted him so, as that
he was willing to ransome his life upon his
knees with tears, which fear had commissionat
to intercede for him; We who thought that
to kill a man before he was prepared to die, was
to murder the soul aswell as the body, desired
him to throw away his weapon, and he should
have quarter: but he not accustomed to hear
such a dialect, understood us not, so that we
were forced to make a demonstration our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter;
he no sooner understood our mind
than he disarmed himself of his weapon, thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
his body open to our mercy; we advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but scarce could perceive in him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33161:73"/>
of humanity, which was all mudded
over with the rubbish of desuetude and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and his tongue exprest it self as if it had
but freshly come to the school of the world;
whereupon <hi>Philarites</hi> concluded, that seing
he and his companion could understand one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that the bruits did use possibly an ideom
peculiar to themselves, aswell as these, whose
expression claimed affinity to that used by
them; or, if they had no language, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to read each others sentiments in the
characters of thoughts, like the intuitive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Angels.</p>
            <p>We untyed the naked couple, who took their
life as a donative from our hands, upon whom
fear had made such an impressa, as they could
not believe but death had them stil in its claws.
We desiring to pull up that poysonous herb by
the root, fearing lest it might thereafter spread
and pullulate afresh, resolved to know where
he nested; he would willingly have quit us, yet
in obedience rather to fear than to us, he led us
to a cantone of the Wilderness, and shewed us
there a hole, whereat he entred; it seemed to be
hells porch, and its very stink (occasioned by
the boyling of mans flesh) did fortifie it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
against all humane approaches; he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
forth at last his wife, and I must say he
was fitly matched: for, her face was a rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33161:74"/>
of all those deformities, that a petulant
fancy could have excogitated, and, except in
the case of an <hi>Incubus,</hi> he might have defied
all the world to make him a Cuckold: We
learned at last, by a discourse composed of
semibrievs and crotchets, that she and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had lived there fifty years (death having
forgot that there lived any mortals in such a
corner) and that their son was killed; We
lookt in, and perceived that the hole was all
pent up with wood, and that their best chear
was mans flesh: So we brought them alongst
with us to the next Town, where those two
lived whom we had released, and committed
them to the publick prison.</p>
            <p>Thence our inclination (which was the
compass by which we steered) led us to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi>
which was then the stage whereon
Fortune acted all her Tragedies. This Nation
had pilgrimaged through all Governments, and
seing it could not unload it self of Rules heavy
burden, it did, like the Asse, fetch it from
shoulder to shoulder, and so, contrarie to its
expectation, past from evil to worse, and from
worse to worst of all; We had not marched
but two dayes journey in this Lunatick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
when we encountred a fellow whose eyes
sparkled some of that folly which was breasted
within him, and by the inorderly <hi>Index</hi> of his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33161:74"/>
face, we might easily know that the volumn of
his thoughts could not but be confused; his
equipage was so mean, that he resembled an
old Oak, whose starved leaves had fallen away
from the stock which was not able to al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment
them, to which the obdured earth denied the
pension of its ordinary aliment; his motions
shewed, that they received no commission from
a rational soul, and were like the reelings of a
ship, whose rudder the careless Skipper had
abandoned: thus did he by his inconsiderable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
render himself considerable, and made us
notice him, meerly because he was not worth
the noticing; he past by us, without giving us
a hat, or paying a reverence; and glancing
over his shoulder, he said, Friends, think ye who
shine so upon earth because of your diamonds,
to shine in heaven, circled with the rays of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
splendor? or, dream ye that heaven will
suffer your pride to passe unpunished? Ye are
mistaken (replyed <hi>Philarites)</hi> for gorgious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in apparrel betokeneth much humility;
for, we think, that we need such weights as
these, to be put with us in the ballance of such
capricious fancies as yours, else we might fear
to be judged but light; whereas ye imagine
that your innate worth is able to create respect
enough for you: and I pray you, seing the gods
have not created these diamonds for our ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33161:75"/>
surely they have created them for our
ornament: and we see how they have varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the fields with flowers, and have enam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meled
these flowers with diverse colours,
whereby our pleasure might be baited, aswell
as our necessities supplyed; neither certainly,
would they have left man (who is the most
excellent amongst all the creatures) naked of
these ornaments, if they had not given him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and fancy to be his provisors, and the
whole earth to be his magazine: Neither must
we confine ornaments to the narrow bounds of
necessity, else why tax ye not the gods likewise
of superfluity, for having spangled the heavens
with so many and so various stars and constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
seing they might have supplyed their
rooms by two or three Suns or Moons? And
Sir, had not these eye-dazling creatures, the
Diamonds, concealed by their absence some
portion of their makers glory, if they had still
been intombed in the earths dark bowels. Well
friend (replied he) since I cannot convince
you, who lies swadled in the cradle of your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and understands not these true mysteries,
go read Grandours Epitaph in the person of
<hi>Ephemerus,</hi> who was not long since Prince of
this Country, and is now hunting near-by,
followed only by two servants; Whereupon
he paced away, leaving us puzled in what rank
of creatures he was to be placed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:33161:75"/>
He being gone, <hi>Philarites</hi> marked that of all
mad-men, those were most fortunate, whose
madness resembled most the humour of the
Country where they lived; as for instance,
Seing the Lacedemonians were ordinarily most
superstitious, that therfore that madness which
was allyed with most superstition (as in that
poor fellow) was least discernable amongst
them, seing the Natives being inured to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
superstition, would not remark its excess
so easily, as they would the excess in any other
passion: and on the other hand, strangers who
perceived such extravangancies, would rather
list them amongst the inclinations of the place,
than account them real fits of distraction.</p>
            <p>This discourse was scarce at a period, when
we overhyed <hi>Ephemerus,</hi> whose mean equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
and thin train overpowered our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and now our voyage seemed to us admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ladder, in which the higher we mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we discovered alwayes the more; but we
concluded that our amazement was now in its
Zenith, and could mount no higher; for, in
him, we saw the Mapps of fortune and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
both in one Carte, and this Gentleman
seemed to be a Skeleton, of whose bones, the
State-Ravens of his own faction had pickt all
the flesh of honour: We associated our selves
to him, to try whether those qualities which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33161:76"/>
are often admired in eminent persons, be real,
or if they be occasioned only by the sunshine of
power; and after some discourse we found,
that he stood more obliged to his birth, than
to his parts; and that he had been heir to his
fathers office, rather than to his endowments;
and that, albeit amongst bruits the young re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the old, because there is nothing in
them, which is not propagated, yet amongst
rational creatures it is otherwayes; because
the soul is not kneaded of any corporeal masse;
and Philosophers alleage, that oft-times the
wisest fathers, having evaporated either in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or contemplation their finest spirits, beget
the simplest children, who seem to be the lees
of so fine stuffe. We may see, said <hi>Philari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
to me thereafter, that albeit in all other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
objects, the higher any body be placed, it
appears so much the lesse, yet in State-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is quite contrary; for all the faculties
of a person seem aggrandized by his promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and that in the Comedy of the World, the
habit of a King or Prince neither improves nor
impairs the real habilities of the Actor. This
Gentleman talkt of hunting, as if it had been
the onely imployment quadrating with true
Gentility, and that a Gentleman and a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were but the same thing diversly exprest;
Whereupon I (willing to tilt a little in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33161:76"/>
with him) alleaged, that of all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
it was the least subservient to our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and that Fencing or Riding might possibly
be a buckler at occasions to a mans life, and
might fit the users of them to serve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
but that Hunting was useless to its users,
and destructive to the Country where it was
most used, by trampling of corns, and alienating
the inclinations of Gentlemen from their other
imployments, and that it was of all recreations
the most destructive to the health; for it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
men somtimes to ly cold a whole day, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for an occasion, and when they had found
an occasion necessitated them to move too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuously
and ardently; and at last the losse of
their prey, did ordinarily affect them too anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously:
and subjoyned, that I conjectured that
Hunting was at first excogitated by Princes
and Statesmen, to avocate factious minds from
deeper projects, and to divert them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
any thing to the prejudice of the State.</p>
            <p>Being wearied of his society, from which
nothing could be reaped, We retired to the
City of <hi>Lacedemon:</hi> where there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and so contrary tides, as that it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for the strongest vessel to sail safe in it.
Amongst many other slaveries, the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
much of the too frequent change of
State-officers (this Commonwealth being like
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33161:77"/>
the Moon, which never appeareth twice with
the same face) wherby the people were charged
with miseries: for, those who were newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled
in their Offices, did like the empty Loch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeches,
suck themselves full; and those who
were not in charge, were continually plotting
the extirpation of those who did officiate; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they know how to govern before
they were removed from the helm of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Amongst many other passages which occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
during our residence there, I cannot forget
one, which was this; An old fellow which
had outlived his wit, became so witless as to
fall enamoured of a young Girl, who lived at
our house, and now all his spirits, which age
seemed to have beaten from all the other posts
of his soul, retired themselves to the citadel
of his fancy, and being garrisoned there, gave
old age a defiance. In order to his design, he
mustered all those old suits, which had been
witnesses to his first Nuptials, which now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their mustiness, were as grayhaird as
himself, and piaffed daily before our windows,
possest by this devil of love; and imagining that
he was, not what really he was, but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he would have been: at last, having lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
with confidence, in a war defensive and
offensive against prudence; he entred the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33161:77"/>
where the young Gentlewoman was atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her self, where having, by the help of his
staff, made an antick reverence, he complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her in these words.</p>
            <p>Lady, all the time that I have spent in the
world, hath been spent in remarking that there
was never any so beautifull as you are; and all
these wrinckles which ye may perceive in my
face, are caused by the heat of my passion; as
we see the fire contracts and furroweth the
parchment. And albeit my age and your youth
are of a different temper; yet we see that
things of most different, yea, and of contrary
qualities, when separate; yet do, when joyned,
piece up the most excellentest compositions:
and strings of the most various sounds, echoes
the sweetest melody: these hairs, which seem
gray, are not dyed of that colour by age, but
by an accident; and my weakness (which was
blazed lately abroad) was not the effect of my
decrepedness, but of sickness, against whom
none can plead exemption: If there were any
to quarrel your beauty, or to account it but
second to anies else, ye should see (fair Lady)
that there is abundance of bloud barrelled up
in these veins; and that in this heart there is
courage enough to hazard it in your quarrel.</p>
            <p>A young Gentleman (one of her Suiters)
stepping in, and intending to twit his folly,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33161:78"/>
said, Fair Lady, ye may believe him anent your
beauty; for, whereas others can only adduce
two eyes, as witnesses to prove their opinion,
he can bring four: for I remarked him yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in Church, bestride his nose with specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
that by them he might perceive, what his
eyes could not. The old Gentleman (like a
lamp which albeit it be almost extinguished,
yet when irritated by a breath of wind, will
flame something more than ordinary) breathed
nothing but revenge, and would fain have
honoured his sword with such an imployment;
but its sheath and it had of so long a time been
inseparable companions, that it was very hard
to separate them; and rust had so glued them
together, that his old arms could not pull it
out. The other taking advantage of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
cried aloud, <hi>Oh he hath kill'd me, he
hath kill'd me!</hi> which cry rendevouzed us all
in the chamber, where we found the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
dashing his sword against the walls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of its disloyalty to its master.</p>
            <p>This affront did not wean him from the
breasts of his amorous folly: and seing age
was the occasion of his folly, the older he grew,
he behoved necessarily to be the more foolish;
so thinking himself too far advanced in this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of passion, he resolved to swim, though
with hazard, rather than to retire, though
with ease.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:33161:78"/>
The next morning, equipaged like one whom
we see presented in Taliduce, by some Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary,
he presented himself at his Mist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isses
chamber door, where being licentiate to enter,
he thanked the gods, who had arrested his
sword yesterday in its sheath, lest he should
have contaminated her chamber with the bloud
of so base a fellow; and continued to perswade
her, that it was neither his weaknesse, nor the
rustinesse of his sword, which had occasioned
the difficulty to unsheath it, only he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that after a combate which he had
fought not long since, he had forgot to wipe it
clean of that bloud, wherewith his adversaries
wounds had besmeared it. The Gentlewoman
applauded to all, telling him, that his sword
looked like a blade which had been Actor of
many Tragedies, and that she remembred only
to have seen one of that fashion, which her
grandfather keeped as an old monument of his
family. I heard, Sir, (continued the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman)
that in a combat ye had all these teeth
shaken out by a blow, which we perceive ye
now want; and that another blow, whilst ye
were rescuing the Royal Standard, left in lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with you that infirmity, which is perceived
in your march. The old man, who dreamed
that all these discourses were the relations of
these whose friendship he had bought, accorded
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33161:79"/>
to all, confirming her fictions by some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
which busk rendred these fictions yet
more ridiculous. Weary at last of his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency,
she entreated him to hear her read a
part of a Romance, which had come to her
hands lately; but she had scarce spent half an
hour in that imployment, when sleep closed
those eyes, which saw but dimly when they
were open, old men being like Watches, which
the older they are, run alwayes the faster, and
must be often winded-up by sleep; for, their
infirm bodies, and weak vitals, must have more
time allowed them to forge spirits, than young
bodies require; and Nature, which hates all
transitions from one extream to another, will
inure old men, to endure death by dying often.
Her other Suiter perceiving he was asleep, came
from behind the hangings where he stood, and
by a sharp knife cut the ribon wherby his bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were tied up, and thereafter retired softly;
the old Gentleman awaked, would willingly
have perswaded his young Mistris, that it was
not sleep, but an extasie wherein he had been,
and that it was occasioned by the sweetness of
her voice, and vivacity of her deportment in
reading. The other hearing that he was awake,
came bolting in, as if he would have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
the old man for his yesterdayes brusk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whereupon he rising in haste, his breeches
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33161:79"/>
fell about his feet, leaving his thighs like two
leafless and withered branches, in whose top an
Owl nested; or like an Egyptian Mummy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed
by Art, which had once been coetani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with the first founders of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Walls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi>'s relation was here interrupted,
by a confused noise which tumbled-in at the
windows; and <hi>Monanthropus</hi> looking out,
perceived a multitude, whose allarmed-like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
portended some eminent danger: here,
one running did ask his fellow what the uproar
meaned? and yet posted by; for his curiosity
would not wait for an answer: there, another
returned laughing, but not telling why: some
through fear, others through curiosity hunted
for news: Thus they floated up and down the
streets, raging and murmuring like waters fallen
from some high cataract: At last <hi>Kalodulus</hi>
entring the chamber, told them, that the <hi>basis</hi>
of that commotion, was a combat betwixt two
Persian Captains, who being Rivals in love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to terminate their debate by the dye of
a combat; but though they wanted not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
yet they wanted armour (as being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners)
neither durst they adventure to seek
any from their acquaintances in the City, lest
they should have brought themselves within
the compass of State-jealousie; at last, revenge
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:33161:80"/>
and love fornisht them this overture, That they
should walk to a Sword-sellers shop, and
should look each upon a sword, meerly as if
they intended to try them, and that there
(which was a remote corner of the City, and
early in the morning) they should make cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
Arbiter betwixt them: which project fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
well; for, before any could mediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, the one had lost as much bloud as
might have cooled him out of that feaver of
love wherein he raged formerly, and there
were sufficiently many issues opened in their
bodies, at which that unnatural heat might
have evaporated.</p>
            <p>Let us now return to the Court, which is
the Chequer wherein the dyce of favour alters
still the game; and where the Courtiers, like
so many Moons, wax or wane, accordingly as
the Sun of Royal Pleasure darts its rays upon
them; all being paved with ice, whereon none
can stand because of its slipperiness, unless they
be frosted with fortune, and Court-respect;
here all things seemed to be moulded a new, and
<hi>Monanthropus</hi> was now the house of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,
wherein the King's fancy dwelt. For
<hi>Sophander</hi> was looked upon as a person whose
ambition towred too high, and who intended
to enthronize himself in the affections of the
subjects: the King eyed him as his Rival, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33161:80"/>
the best of his actions were construed to be
treasonable: Neither was his Majesty mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for <hi>Sophander</hi> levelled at nothing lower
than the Supremacy of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he had now
devoted himself to be a Partisan of the Persian
Monarchy; and had, as best things when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
become alwayes the worst (evil being
the privation of good, and consequently the
more numerous the good qualities were in the
good, the more numerous their privations are
in the evil) So <hi>Sophander</hi> was from the best
of friends, degenerated in the worst of enemies,
and tasked himself now with the destruction
of the Egyptian Nation; In order to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
he endeavoured to have <hi>Misarites</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the conduct of the Egyptian Army,
who had combined rather to mislead, than to
lead them; and had undertaken to ruine them
without a Persian sword.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prastus</hi> encouraged by their undertakings,
and by the numbers of his Army, resolved to
prosecute the Egyptian War; and the rather,
because the body of his own State did begin to
amasse noxious humours, through want of
martial exercise, and was become so plethorick,
that it behoved to be let bloud of by the hand
of some forreign War: his Army is sent to
<hi>Egypt</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Sotorus</hi> (who had
been lately ransomed) their landing allarmed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33161:81"/>
the Egyptian Court, whose fears were fed by
<hi>Sophanders</hi> emissaries.</p>
            <p>The King commanded to rendevouze all the
solded Forces, who being but eight thousand
strong, were alwayes upon duty, whereby
the rebellion of subjects and the invasion of
forreigners were easily cohibited; a lesson
which his predecessour had learned from the
late Insurrection: He likewise ordered the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
of twelve thousand moe, which being
all bodyed together, were subjected to <hi>Misa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
command. <hi>Megistus, Philarites,</hi> and
the Martial Knight refusing any imployment.</p>
            <p>All things thus ordered, <hi>Philarites</hi> resolved
to go seek a pasport from the lovely ARETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA,
whom he thus accosted.</p>
            <p>Fair Lady, I am come to beg a licence to
employ that heart and bloud, which is really
yours, in the service of your Prince, and to
skreen your Country from its irreconciliable
enemies; honour invites me to fight for my
Prince, but love entreats me not to abandon my
dear Princess; Yet seing loves burning-glasse
can inflame at a distance, and seing my soul,
where-ever I go, carries alwayes about with it
the impressa of ARETINA, and seing I can
love in the camp, but cannot be victorious in a
chamber, I hope ye will not only pardon my
absence, but commissionate me to be absent;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33161:81"/>
that by my absence I may gather lawrels of
peace, and triumphing bays, to crown the head
of my dear Princess.</p>
            <p>If your heart be mine (replied ARETINA)
and seing ye have gotten mine in exchange, ye
must either go heartless, else stay at home and
enjoy it; for I will not render you yours: for,
seing I live by it, I cannot live without it;
Neither can the King desire you to hazard a
womans heart, whose sex exempts them from
danger; if you be lost, I lose all: And albeit
you were absent, the King will be loser but in a
part. Wherefore seing my losse may be greater,
and my gain cannot equal his; and seing your
interest in me exceeds your interest in him, I
hope ye will not rob me of that ye have once
bestowed upon me. This discourse was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by a floud of tears, whereof the least was
able to quench the flames of <hi>Philarites</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
her sighes, like great ordnances, made
breaches in the walls of his resolutions for her
perswasions to enter; so that like <hi>Mahomets</hi>
tomb, he hovered betwixt the two Loadstones
of Love and Courage: Yet at last the danger of
the State in general, and of her father in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
(whose safety moved upon the hinges of
their loyalty and courage) joyned with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
promises of shunning danger, prevailed
with her, to permit him to risk yet that one
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33161:82"/>
hazard: yet her love combated her resolutions,
and will and courage fell at variance; neither
were <hi>Philarites</hi> honour, nor her own interest,
eloquent enough to perswade her to relinquish
without reluctancy, her first intention, her eyes
protested against what her tongue spoke, and
challenged it for transgressing that commission
which her heart had given it.</p>
            <p>The Trumpets sounding a march to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
did sound a retreat from these amiable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses,
and necessitated <hi>Philarites</hi> to close that
dialogue, which else he had never closed till
death had closed his eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Agapeta</hi> had all this while
interchanged amorous glances, but albeit their
imployment was the same, the way was most
different: for, <hi>Megistus</hi> studied nothing more
than to acquaint <hi>Agapeta</hi> with his design, and
<hi>Agapeta</hi> studied nothing more than to skreen
hers from <hi>Megistus,</hi> thinking it derogatory to
a Princesse to love a Subject: and albeit that
<hi>Eudoxa</hi> ceased not continually to feed the fire
of <hi>Agapeta's</hi> love with the faggots of <hi>Megi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
praise, yet <hi>Agapeta</hi> smothered all these
flames under the ashes of a prudential silence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> finding himself consumed away
by this hectick feaver of a languishing love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
rather to die by hazarding a cure, than
to languish without it; and judging this the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33161:82"/>
fittest time to ventilate his passion, resolved to
let something of it fall in his discourse to <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peta:</hi>
So having gone to her chamber as if he
had been to bid her farewell before he initiated
his journey, after he had acquit himself of the
ordinary ceremonies customarily used in such
addresses, and after servants were removed, he
spake thus:</p>
            <p>Madam, since my heart hath been so arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
as to pretend to your love, I have resolved
to expiat its crime in hazarding it against those
who hate your Country, that they may wound
it, seing it hath wounded it self, and that they
may revenge your quarrel against me, whilst I
am revenging against them the quarrel of your
Country; every drop of my bloud, supplicates
me to be honoured in your service, and forbids
me to dispute the lawfulness of the quarrel,
seing ye interest your self in it. Madam, albeit
I be by birth a King, yet my birth cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
me to your love, whose worth is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
preferable to the whole Globe, albeit it
were all ranged under the subjection of one
Scepter: Wherefore, Madam, albeit I be a
King, yet in this I accuse my self guilty of
treason against the majesty of your worth, and
pannels my self willingly at the bar of your
pleasure. I know I was guilty even in loving
you, yet seing all <hi>Egypt</hi> is complicated with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33161:83"/>
me in the same crime, I hope, as in other cases
so in this, the number of the delinquents will
procure a pardon for the crime. Yet, Madam,
I am singularly guilty, in having avowed before
you my own guilt; which as none but I could
be so arrogant as to commit, so none but ye can
be so clement as to pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agapeta</hi> hearing that he was a Prince, but
not noticeing it, as if she heard it not, resolved
not to glut her self with those grapes of love,
untill the sunshine of time had ripened them
more maturely; yet, lest she should starve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
his passion, she returned him this
Answer.</p>
            <p>Sir, it is certainly the feaver of courage
wherein ye now burn, which occasioneth that
discomposure of spirit which ye now bewray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for else <hi>Megistus,</hi> who is loved by all, would
never be so mad as to love <hi>Agapeta,</hi> who is
loved by none; But, Sir, ye may know, that I
am one of the Jewels of my fathers Crown, and
none can dispose of me, but they who can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of it; so that I hope ye will not suffer
your self to be so much mistaken, as to shoot
at that mark: But really there is another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
in being <hi>Megistus</hi>'s Mistris, seing
she who is such will make her self the rival of
all those Ladies, who have but once conversed
with you, who doubtlesse place their happiness
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33161:83"/>
in the fruition of your favour; but, Sir, seing
ye plead guilty, and will make me your Judge,
I shall, as in all other crimes, so in this, make
the crime the punishment: Wherefore, seing
love is your gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lt, let love be your torture.</p>
            <p>As men should shun, replyed <hi>Megistus,</hi> to
look on you, because of your beauty, so they
should shun to converse with you, because of
your eloquence: every thing which is either
seen in you, or spoken by you, being a snare to
entrap unworthy mortals; who must, in spight
of prudence, like flyes, flee about the candle
which burns them. But, Madam, my love is
no infant passion; for, it bears as old a date as
since my arrival at Court: and albeit the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
so long in my guilt, be an aggravation
of it (every thought being a new crime, and
every moment forging a new thought) yet
seing I have avowed my passion, I cannot but
avow its birth. Madam, since ye have sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
me guilty, I beg fetters, which are the
badge of guiltiness. <hi>Agapeta</hi> knowing what
he aimed at, gave him a bracelet of her hair,
which she desired him to take, not as an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of his love to her, but as a reward of
his loyalty to her father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> glad to receive it upon any terms,
kissing her hand, went away, telling her, that
he gloried more in that badge of her favour,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33161:84"/>
than he would do in all the trophies which
could be raised for him upon the ruines of the
Persian Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The Army was marched, and had left <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus,
Philarites</hi> and the Martial Knight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
busied in saluting their numerous friends;
their visits accomplisht, they posted after the
marched Troops, and in their way the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Knight, in pursuit of a discourse anent the
antipathy betwixt the Egyptian and Persian
Nations, fell a chiding Astrologues, because
they attributed it to the variety of celestiall
signs: these mad fellows (said he) will needs
have all the Watches of National inclinations
set by the Sun-dyall of the heavenly Aspects,
as if the Needle of free-will were obliged to
follow the touch of that Adamant; and as if
the face of the firmament were like those op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
chambers, on whose chamber walls one
may perceive what is acted in the streets, to
which their backs are turned for the time; but
seing the humours of Nations varies, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Aspects still continuing the same; and
seing those influences are corporeal, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affect the will which is meerly spiritual, I
admire how men can fancy any influence, where
there is no passibility: But why are the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Countries alwayes most tainted with
this natural aversion, more than the remote
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33161:84"/>
parts of the Nations? Is it because the heavens
are divided in shires as the earth is? surely all
these are dreams of capricious fancies; and it
is to small purpose that men should vex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by enquiring for a reason of that in the
heavens, whereof the reason may with small
scrutiny be found upon the earth: for we
know that bordering Kingdoms do alwayes
war one against another; and these Wars are
fathers and mothers to that Antipathy; And
who would not hate these who are their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
who have massacred their antcestors?
and for this reason is it, that in these antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing
Nations, the frontier Countries hate
most one another, seing the occasions of fresh
quarrels makes them oft purple their fingers in
one anothers bloud. And upon the contrary,
the remoter Nations, are ordinarily linked in
Confederacies; for these Nations that border
on the remote frontire of the Nation hated, do
in <hi>odium</hi> of the interjacent Nation, league with
those who border upon the other frontier, So
that, that friendship is cemented with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
hatred of both the averse Nations; and
here mysterie of State is the heavenly Aspect
which causeth this contrariety.</p>
            <p>This discourse being ended before the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
they resolved that each of them should
maintain a Paradox, which, being as weights
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33161:85"/>
added to the paices of times clock, might make
it run more swiftly; <hi>Philarites</hi> being by lot
destinat for the precedency, undertook thus the
defence of Vanity.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, before I begin to wade through
this discourse, I must rid marches betwixt
Pride and Vanity; and I call Vanity, an high
estimation set by man upon his own actions,
and a confidence he hath of being able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate
undertakings above the ordinary reach
of humane power; and Pride, that whereby
one undervalueth all that is done by others,
quarreling it, meerly because it was not done
by himself; and not only esteeming highly of
himself absolutely (as is done in Vanity) but
also over-rating himself, when compared with
others. I affirm then, that Vanity is the wheels,
whereby honour, courage and triumph moves:
for, if Vanity suggested not to man the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
of something extraordinary, and if these
suggestions were not welcomed by generous
spirits, the greatest part of new inventions had
been stifled in the cradle of their first concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Commerce had never been entertained
through want of shipping; and new discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
both of unknown Countries, and usefull
Engins had never been atchieved; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
men should never rise above their own le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
if they circled their undertakings within
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33161:85"/>
the narrow compasse of their own experience:
and seing, in setting a high price upon my own
worth, I magnifie the workmanship of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
gods, and believes undoubtedly that I
am more obliged to them, than really I am; I
think my self, as to them, no more culpable,
than he who acknowledgeth himself my debtor
in a greater sum than truly he is, should be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by me: And further, seing mans misery, if
sufficiently known, were sufficient to ingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe
him in the depths of melancholy, and to ingrain
it more deeply of a black colour; Certainly
Vanity is of excellent use, seing it confects
sweetly those bitter aigrets, and skinneth over
those deep wounds, which are inflicted by the
hand of our natural misery.</p>
            <p>The Martial Knight maintained, That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality
was no wayes to be punished by the
Commonwealth; and that Prodigals in reason,
ought not to be interdicted, if they sowed not
their monies in the furrows of forreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in which case only the Commonwealth
was prejudged; but that if they spent it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the territories of the Commonwealth, they
could not be challenged; seing they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of their own, and seing the Common-wealth
was not endammaged, but rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged;
seing their money came in the hands
of frugal men (for such are ordinarily those
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33161:86"/>
who fleece these sheep) who might improve it
more to the publick utility; and if persons of
vast estates deborded not in such extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
they would in fine coffer up all the monies
of the Kingdom, so that poor Artists, and
others, should be totally impoverished; (for
the superfluities of the rich, are the granaries
of the poor) and these who were once rich,
might presume, knowing that they would not
be licentiated to dilapidate; and poor (though
ingenuous, and ingenious persons) might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
if they had not such crumbs as these to
feed on: but by Prodigality, treasure runs like
the Sea, to the water-sources of poor Artists,
and from them, by the frugality of others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
back again to the ocean of Noblemens
treasuries; by which circulatory motions, the
fabrick of the Universe is maintained in the
one, and the fabrick of the State is entertained
by the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> maintained, That there was no
Adultery in the case where the husband allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his wifes imbracements; and that it was
only the husbands dissent, which made the wifes
consent be reputed Adultery: for, said he, all
the precepts which concern man, may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with, by man; for, seing the great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator
hath only made these Laws which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
themselves in mans advantage, to be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33161:86"/>
bulworks to him against the malice of others,
it appears that where there is no wrong done
to him, the Law introduced in his favours cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;
and as, if there had never been fear of
wrong, surely the Law which punisheth that
wrong had never been statuted; even so in the
case where the party that only can be offended,
remits the offence, there the Law ceaseth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its occasion faileth: And albeit in crimes
once committed, the Law-giver may pursue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the party offended desist; yet that is where
the crime was once committed, and where the
committer hazarded upon the fact, before he
had the parties offended consent; and so, as
he contemned the Law-giver, as much as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
a private subject; the Law-giver may
insist, albeit the subject desist. And, as in the
case of theft, the Magistrate may punish the
stealer, albeit none concur with him; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the theft is committed, if the person whose
goods are taken, consent, there can be no theft;
even so, if the husband before the Adultery al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his wifes familiarity, he cannot be said to
be wronged: neither can ye obtrude here, that
the wife hath chained her self to her husband
by an oath, which adamantine chain, the weak
hands of a husbands consent can never break;
this, I say, cannot be obtruded here: for, seing
this is an oath only, and no vow, the immortal
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33161:87"/>
gods are not parties, but witnesses in it, (for a
vow is only where the thing promised is made
meerly or mostly for their honour, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said here) and so the person in whose
favours it is made, may favour the maker so
far, as to dispense with it. Nay, but (replyed
<hi>Megistus)</hi> both the Gods and the Common-wealth,
are interested in what is enjoyned by
that Law (which seems to be one of those
Laws which was made in Natures first Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and are as much parties as is the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
for, if husbands had the keys of that
Law put into their hands, they would open a
door by them to all wickedness, and would feed
the greedy appetite of that monster, Lust; and
the souls of creatures, and hearts of subjects,
would be so stuffed with this base passion, that
no room should be left either for vertue, or
gallantry; and the gardens of mens souls should
be so overgrown with this spreading hemlock
of corruption, that no ground should be found
to sow in, either the roses of piety, or lillies
of generosity: and albeit ye combat stoutly
with the weapon of the husbands consent, yet
ye shall never be able by it, to wound one who
is covered with the armour of reason; for that
husband who would by the hand of his own
folly raze down the ramparts of his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and by the mire of his madness pollute
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33161:87"/>
the wel-spring of his private satisfaction, might
justly be reputed mad and demented, and his
consent might be accounted as ineffectual, as it
is unreasonable, and so to operate no more
here, than the consent of mad-men doth in Law
elsewhere.</p>
            <p>They were arrived by this time, at the place
where the Army had encamped for that night,
and were welcomed by the applaudatory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of the Souldiery, each one esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the coals by which the green wood,
for their unexpert courages, behoved to be
kindled; and their enemies themselves (who
were rather rivals of their success than enemies
to their vertues) acknowledged them both the
patterns and patrons of true gallantry. After
they had tendred their respects to the General,
they retired to their own Tents (which their
servants had already stretcht out for them) and
thereafter <hi>Megistus</hi> exercised a Company of
foot in the face of a Regiment, teaching them
by what he did, what they should do, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinating
those who dreamed formerly, that
War was only a flash of artless courage, and
that all its precepts might be summed up in
that one, of <hi>not running away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Misarites</hi> much dissatisfied, that applause
should have so hugd these Knights in its arms,
and that all should be so much beadsmen for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:33161:88"/>
their success, sent a Gentleman to acquaint
them (as if in a friendly way) that the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Army frowned exceedingly to see
their own eggs hatcht by others. <hi>Megistus</hi>
could easily have unridled a greater mysterie
than this, and conjectured instantly that emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
was the sender of that Ambassage;
whereupon they retired to their Tents, but so
prudently, as that none could perceive their
design in retiring. Where the Martial Knight
(to dissipat these clouds of passion which were
already conglomerating in the firmament of
<hi>Megistus</hi> face) undertook this subsequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
for their divertisment. I lodged, said
he, with a Merchant in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whose
wife thought her self the widow of a living
man; and so setled her fancy upon a pretty
youth, her apprentice, upon whom she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
those respects which she denied her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
to whom, albeit she could not in reason,
yet she did in fancy, marry her self; and with
whom she spent those amorous hours which
she could steal either from her husbands assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
company, or the youths numerous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments;
but when the husband was abroad
in the Country, then they reaped the harvest
of these pleasures, which they gleaned only at
other occasions, and feasted upon those amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
delicacies, which they could only use as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33161:88"/>
desert at other times: But that I may abridge
my story, it hapned one day that the husband
was by his imployments called to the Country,
telling his wife that he would not return of a
fortnight; so that they had the reins of their
pleasure laid upon their own necks, and thought
an occasion to sin was enough to authorize
them in sin; but whilst they are in bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at twelve a clock of the night, the husband
wearied with his journey, and disappointed of
his projects, returns home, and knocks at the
door; the wife conjures her Gallant not to
budge, whilst she was opening the door to
her husband, which he condescended to, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to satisfie her, than his own reason: the
door was opened, and the kind wife caresses
most affectionatly her wearied husband, telling
him that it was pity the husband should toil so,
in amassing means and money for their wives,
who sucked the honey, albeit they brought not
home the wax; but said she, Sweet-hart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath led you home this night, that ye
might be a target to the innocency of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
wife, whose honour your apprentice
hath oft and most passionately assaulted; so
that in him ye keep a fox at home to devour
your own hens, and this night at one a clock
(which is not now far off) I trysted him in
my chamber, resolving to intrap him; but seing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33161:89"/>
ye can manage that imployment with better
success, I entreat you go to my closet, and put
on my cloathes, and meet him at the door in
that way which he deserves: The honest hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
smiling at the conceit, undertook the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of that business; and retiring himself to
her closet, opened a door to the Gallant to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
who having shifted himself in his cloaths
upon the top of the stairs, returned to act what
the wife had promised in his name; and he
grating the chamber door, was answered by
the husband; the door was no sooner opened,
than our Gallant buffets the poor husband
most sadly, calling him disloyall base whore,
and unworthy to be wife to such a civil Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
as was his master; and that it was not
to satisfie his lust, but to experiment her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
that he had thus courted her to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.
The master surfeited with blows, and
satisfied both with his wife and servants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
desired him to leave off to strike him, or
revile his wife; but the other continued his
rage, till, as he alleaged, the wifes cryes deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered
to him his mistake; and then imbracing
his master, did, after a full information, beg
pardon upon his knees for his errour: which
both of them promised not only to pardon, but
also to reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Philarites</hi> had that morning,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33161:89"/>
been comparing the rise of their several affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their Mistrisses, and each disputed the
precedence to his own; <hi>Philarites</hi> seemed to
have fallen into a burning feaver, and <hi>Megistus</hi>
love had crept upon him like a hectick: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they resolved to submit in this to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Knight, who commanded <hi>Megistus</hi> first to
plead his cause, which he obeyed thus.</p>
            <p>Sir, Nature, which is equal and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
in all its periods, seems to ominate a speedy
death to that which hath a speedy birth; and
it is probable, that that heart of straw which
flameth soon, will not flame long; and those
creatures whose nativity is ruled by the Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack
of a night, or hour, may expect to meet
with their climaterick the next day: whereas
that passion which resembleth the Elephant in
its slow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>paced conception, may probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
it likewise in its admired bulk, after
that it is once conceived: and that love which
like the Hart, lodgeth so long in the belly of its
dam, may like the Hart prove long-liv'd after
its arrival to the world: and those impressions
which are made upon the ashes of a soon-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
soul, may be easily obliterated; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the obdured marble of a resisting spirit, will
hardly suffer ever its impressions to be effaced;
and seing love should stand upon the basis of
reason, the broader that basis is, the longer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33161:90"/>
love will stand; and that soul which resisteth
longest by reason, will persist longest by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.
<hi>Philarites</hi> contended thus:</p>
            <p>Sir, the purest air is alwayes soonest infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and enlightened by the rayes darted from
the Sun, and those are but foggie and misty
vapours which resist its illuminations; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth
a body wet with the dull phlegm of
stupidity, not to be presently heated by a vast
fire: and those spirits are not powder fitted
for the war of generosity, which cannot kindle
at the first touch: great beauties are like the
Sun, which spreads its beams all in one instant;
and that is the best eye which discovereth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
all the excellencies which are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
in the objects.</p>
            <p>Both parties having closed their plea, the
Martial Knight adjudged victory to both: for
(said he) <hi>Cupid</hi> confines not himself to one
way of gaming, and all his shafts may be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, albeit they wound not equally soon;
and the bodies may be equally resistant, albeit
the darts pierce not equally deep: for, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
may, and doth oft proceed from their
being better or worse armed, either by indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,
or inanimadvertency; and albeit the
Sun be the same still, yet its heat is not still
communicated after the same manner, because
of the nearness or other position of the body,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33161:90"/>
which should concentrate its beams.</p>
            <p>The Army next morning marched, each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
that week, once to cope with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
Forces, who besieged the Citadel of <hi>Iris,</hi>
and were like to conquer it, because of the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the defendants: <hi>Misarites</hi> hoping to
blunder <hi>Megistus</hi> with unsuccessfulness, or
else willing the Persian (whom he now adored)
should possess himself of that strength, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated
him to march thither with two
thousand foot, to try if he could by any means
rescue that place, whilst he, and the remanent
Forces expected there the advancing Troups
from the remoter parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Philarites</hi> and
the Martial Knight, obeyed his Order; seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to rate as a complement, what they knew
was an injury; and albeit he commanded them
to make brick without straw, yet they shewed
as great alacrity as if he had furnished them
with means proportionate to such an end. The
next morning, they commenced their march,
and having at night fortified themselves in a
neighbouring marish, they plotted thus to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the City. The Martial Knight was to
choose an hundred stout fellows, who were to
carry burdens of provenant to the Persian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
they were to drop in to the Camp by two
and three, as if they were coming to provision
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33161:91"/>
the Army, but were enjoyned to value all
things so highly, as that there should be but
little sold til their number were compleat; and
that thereafter, those who were within should
sally out upon that corner where they were
lodged, with whom they should instantly joyn,
and march in to the Citadel, whilst the others
were disputing the event with courage: This
undertaking framed prosperously, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel
flanked with fresh Souldiers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by the conduct of the Martial Knight,
was now impregnable.</p>
            <p>The noble Knights fearing that the malice
and skill of their adversaries at Court might
somewhat (if not altogether) misreport their
ingenuous procedures in that expedition, (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
spirits being like corrupt stomacks, which
can corrupt the best of viands) resolved to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the whole tract of what was done in a
Letter to his Majesty, whereof the tenour ran
thus.</p>

                  <p>MY reason (befooled with credulity) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
me whilst I lived at Court, that
lapse of time, and distance of place, might have
effaced some of those impressions, which the
diamond of passion had engraven upon she long
resisting cristal of my love-fearing spirit: but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33161:92"/>
I find now that I have been abused in this, by
my credulity; for I perceive that the wound
is not cured by distancing it from the sword
which made it; and that love resembles an
impetuous river, which swelleth the more the
farther it runneth from its source; and that
albeit the weakest wit might wade through it
near its fountain, yet the strongest reason is
not able to ford it, when it hath run farther
off. Madam, every beautiful face which I
see, hath some trait in it, which proves a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer
to me of those incomparable lines
which the Pencil of Nature hath drawn in
yours; but they are but dull copies of such an
original, and can represent it in nothing else,
besides in making me infortunate, in beholding
that, which I can only behold and not enjoy. I
lye here, tortured by the sharp ague of passion;
sometimes scorched with the flames of love, and
at other times frozen by the cold chilnesse of
despair; and as in all poysonings, so in this, I
must seek the antidote from the same body,
whence came the poyson. Fair Lady, live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,

                  </opener>
                  <p>ALbeit the desperatnes of my design, might
make you eye me, as either distracted or
malecontent, and like one, who being in fear to
drown in the gulf of despair, is content to hang
by the smallest twig of comfort that he is able
to grasp to; yet the publick advancement of
my Nations interest, makes me over-look all
such difficulties, and willing to exchange my
own losse with their gain: for, I think it most
reasonable, that one member should rather be
cut off, than that the whole body should be
endangered; and especially such a member as is
already in apparent danger of being lost: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Sir, seing the Enemy is to passe this night
alongst a wooden Bridge over the <hi>Nile,</hi> hoping
to attaque unexpectedly your Camp, I entreat
ye may suffer me to inclose my self in an Arch
of it, with some barrels of Powder, that when
such a number of them as your Army is able to
encounter, hath past alongst it, I may blow up
the Bridge, and so stop both the passage of
those who are not already past, and the return
of those who are gone over. Sir, lest my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33161:93"/>
my self in this danger, and the horrour
of the danger it self, should make you think it
is rather treachery than affection which hounds
me out to this enterprize, ye shall be pleased
to know, that these ravenous Physicians, who
have these two years preyed upon my fat purse,
and practised all their cheats upon my wasted
body, have at last told me, that my cancer
shall at last irrecoverably period my dayes:
Wherefore, Sir, finding that I could not by
Art prolong my dayes, I resolved to do it by
fame; and to sweeten the harshness of death
by the generous manner of it, that so my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
might have the breath of my praises to
dry up the tears of their compassion; and that
by destroying one subject to my Prince, I might
preserve him two thousand; having thus satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my reason, I resolved to satisfie my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which is that great Controller of all
our actions; whereupon I addressed me to a
Priest, my intimate acquaintance, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
me, that it was as lawfull for the Civil
Magistrate (whose command he desired me to
ask) to dispose of me for the publick utility,
as it was lawfull for a private person to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
his life by the losse of a member, and that
such a generous resolution was a key able to
open the gates of Paradise: and if it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a man to hazard his life in battel, where
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33161:94"/>
he could kill but two or three; how much more
lawful was it to buy the safety of many friends,
and the destruction of so many enemies, with
so worthlesse a farthing as my single life was?</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> having deliberated with <hi>Philari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
the expediency of this Overture, resolved
to accept the offer: whereupon, having both
thanked and encouraged the young man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard that the Enemy was to passe alongst
the Bridge the next day, he went under silence
of night to the Bridge, and opening an Arch
thereof, he inclosed in it the Gentleman, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with some barrels of Powder, and some
Match; and guarded the Bridge with some
Souldiers, lest any should carry intelligence to
the Enemy of their intention: The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the Enemy (according to expectation) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in view, which made the two Knights
make a shew as if they would fight (for they
were now four thousand strong) and having,
after some resistance, abandoned the Bridge,
they suffered the Persians to passe alongst it,
three thousand of them being on this side al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<hi>Megistus</hi> caused shoot some Peeces of
great Ordnance (which was the signal conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
upon betwixt the Gentleman and him)
and which was instantly obeyed; for, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fired, the Powder did, to the terrour of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33161:94"/>
the spectators, and ruine of the passers, blow
up both himself, them, and the Bridge, and
sent them all to heaven in a fiery chariot, their
bodies convoying their souls half way, and
would have entered the upper spheares with
them, if heaven had not shewed its unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to lodge such contaminated guests, as
bloudy carcasses were: those who had passed
over, finding themselves destitute of the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their friends (who were able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
nothing now but their prayers and
wishes) resolved to imbrace an honourable
death, since they could not procure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a long life, and to shew, that rather
fate, than fearfulnesse, had occasioned their
overthrow; yet courage had its eyes so dazled
with the unexpectednesse of their former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster,
that it could not see what was fittest to
be done in that juncture of affairs; and they
beheld their enemies through the multiplying-glasse
of fear, and as those for whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
had displayed a Banner. The Knights
assaulted them whilst thus perplext, and put in
disorder the ill-marshalled right wing; and as
ordinarily those who draw one link of fortunes
chain, will make all the rest follow it; So this
partial victory was seconded by a total, and
the Persians were forced rather to imploy their
tongues in demanding pardon, than their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33161:95"/>
swords in seeking victory, leaving the two
Knights both the victory and the field, as the
recompence of their gallantry:</p>
            <p>These news wrought as different effect at
Court, as the Sun doth upon the earth, when it
causeth the roses smell sweetly, and the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
stink insufferably, producing effects accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the dispositions of the bodies wrought
upon: Thus all the truly generous spirits at
Court shared with these noble Gentlemen in
their good fortunes: (virtuous men honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true Generosity, as that whereby they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have already been, or hopes to be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
but <hi>Sophander</hi> and his faction, made the
sunshine of their glory, appear as dapled with
some obscure spots, and alleaged, that it was
intolerable arrogance in them, who were but
strangers, to place the Martial Knight in the
Citadel of <hi>Iris,</hi> which being a frontier Town,
could not be disposed of but to a native; and
that it was the custom of <hi>Egypt</hi> not to bestow
frontier strengths, either as appanages upon the
children of their Prince, nor as governments for
the use of strangers: as also, they challenged
them for fighting the Persians, albeit with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
yet without order, <hi>Misarites</hi> having
only commissionated them to rescue <hi>Iris,</hi> and
no more; and if private persons should follow
rather the dictates of their own reason, than
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33161:95"/>
the commands of their Superiours, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were unnecessary, and ruine behoved cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to attend such disorder: and albeit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
should make such undertakers victorious,
yet it could not justifie their undertakings;
neither could the dammage which might ensu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
upon such exemplary contempt, be compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated
by the advantage which might accrue
from an accidental victory.</p>
            <p>Amongst all their friends at Court, none
were so much satisfied, nor esteemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much interessed in these victories, as
<hi>Agapeta</hi> and ARETINA, who kindled bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires
of joy in their breasts, to congratulate
their great success; and albeit they could not
then in modesty nor prudence cry up these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exploits themselves, yet they respected all
those who did it. <hi>Sophander,</hi> who had at the
council table of his own thoughts, declared
himself an enemy to the Royal Faction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
now, that the only way to ruine the
King, was to ruine these noble Gentlemen;
knowing that those who would fell a great
Oak and pluck it up by the roots, behoved first
to cut the earth about it: to effectuate which,
he bribed a Mesopotamian at Court, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the pedigree of his Prince <hi>Megistus,</hi> and at
last to declare to the King, that he had carried
Letters from him to <hi>Agapeta:</hi> and now confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33161:96"/>
of this fellows perseverance in his roguish
business, he addressed himself to the King the
next morning thus.</p>
            <p>Sir, if my being entrusted by you, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
I have in you, and the experience I have
of you, did not imbolden me to unfold to your
Majestie such mysteries of State, as is that
which I am presently to discourse of, I would
not dare to dip in affairs of so great importance;
and seing Princes have not the leisure to pry
into all particulars, nor informers either the
opportunity or confidence to give them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
information of what toucheth them, I
think it is prudence in Princes to imploy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of State to learn, and duty in Ministers of
State to acquaint Princes with what they have
learned; and since all Subjects are tied by their
condition, to detect what may wrong the State,
or endanger the person of their Prince, what
a strict obligation is laid upon Minions to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
to their Masters, what may ruine them
and their Subjects? and albeit there be great
danger in being misconstrued by their Prince,
yet expediency should not be disputed in those
actions which are commanded by duty. Sir,
this Gentleman, named <hi>Megistus,</hi> is of a birth
rather answerable to the extraordinariness of
his qualities, than suitable to the meanness of
his equipage; his deportment tels, that he is a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33161:96"/>
Prince, and my author confirms me in it: for,
I am informed by a Mesapotamian (whom I
have brought alongst with me) that he is Son
to the King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and is come to your
Court to court your daughter. Sir, this may
seem improbable: yet if we ponder the hazard
he runs in travelling abroad, and the desire pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
have to keep their children under their
eye (especially when he is their successour and
the expectation of a whole Nation) your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
may think that is not altogether impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
but Sir, if ye consider the pains he is
at in your service, and the perils he layeth
himself open to in a forreign Nation, ye may
eye it as probable. And if yet further, ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the correspondence he keeps with your
Daughter (which this fellow will assure you)
ye may justly conclude it certain. Where the
danger is great, the proofs needs not be most
clear (neither can we expect plenary probation
in those plots which are hatched so covertly)
and the fear of a disease is enough to command
its prevention: Neither can there be greater
danger anywhere, than here; for, <hi>Megistus</hi>
being by birth, a Prince; in stature, handsom;
and by fortune, successfull; it may be feared
that your Daughter will prefer his bed to that
of a subject, upon whom she fears ye will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
her: And if once he master her affection,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33161:97"/>
(which is easie where he is so accomplished,
and hath so few competitors) she will die, if
she marry him not; or your Crown will be
carried to a stranger, if she marry him: Neither
lies all the danger there; for it is to be feared,
that if he married once your Daughter, either
your Majesty behoved to nominate her your
successour, and then possibly they will rather
hasten than expect your death; or else, if ye
do it not, he may secure himself in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by the assistance of your mercenary or
discontented Subjects, into which two files, all
the Commons, and many of the Nobility may
be ranked. Sir, I know he is your Favourite, and
so I may be misconstrued as being thought to
to fear that he is my rival; but, Sir, I know
that a Prince will not stay long here to inherit
your Majesties favour, and so to slight his own
Royal Inheritance at home; Sir, it is rather
my affection to you, than my dislike of him,
that animates me thus to inform you: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I hope your Majesty will endeavor a cure,
since you know the disease, and will not suffer
repentance to be your first informer.</p>
            <p>This discourse some what allarmed the King,
yet considering how oft <hi>Sophander</hi> had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his belief by such like State-cheats; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to suspend his judgment, till the matter
were fully determined by <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anthropus</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33161:97"/>
and knowing that <hi>Sophandor</hi> and he were
of different humours and contrary judgments,
he knew that such contrary ingredients might
make up the dose of a most solid advice; and
that his own judgment, which <hi>Sophanders</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
had crooked a little to his side, might
be streightened by <hi>Monanth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>opus</hi>'s drawing it
somewhat to the other; and resolved by this
means to keep the scales of Court equal, by
placing them each on a side; Wherefore send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>Monanthropus,</hi> he laid out the whole
matter before him, who returned him this
Answer.</p>
            <p>Sir, albeit it was my interest, yet it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my humour to detract from any of your
Majesties servants; for, by ranting against their
insufficiency, I behoved to challenge your sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
in making choice of them. But, Sir, I
may the more freely give your Majesty my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
now, that I never gave you it till it was
desired; and I think, that as in witnesses, so in
advisers, those who intrude themselves, are to
be suspected; and the rather, because the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
delated is of so unspotted a repute, that
his very deportment is able to answer all the
cavils that his enemies can object against him;
and, Sir, since that accusation is only seconded
by a presumption, his generous humour and
singular successe (the one whereof testifies his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33161:98"/>
affection to vertue, and the other whereof te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
the gods affection to him) is able to
fortifie him against ten thousand such weak
assaults; and the general presumption of all
mens being presumed good (the only hinge
of all credit amongst men) added to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
presumption of his repute, is too strong
a defence, especially for a defender whom ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
owneth always of her client in all actions,
and secondeth in all combats; and we have a
proverb, called <hi>Suffragium Minervae,</hi> whereby
we signifie, that if any be accused and the votes
of the Judges be equal, the Defendant is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
because that goddess voteth likewise
the absolution of the party accused: And seing
he proveth him a Prince, meerly by his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I may by the same argument conclude,
that he will do nothing unworthy of a Prince:
but admit he were a Prince, we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thence, that he resides here upon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
for, else he had never abandoned the
Court, where he might enjoy the frequentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that beautifull Princess: Sir, it is most
unprobable that he could dream of joyning two
Crowns which lye at so great a distance, as lye
the Crowns of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> certainly
he knows that by force he could never subject
<hi>Egypt</hi> to him, and without force <hi>Egypt</hi> would
never suffer it self to be adjected to <hi>Ethiopia;</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:33161:98"/>
by which course they would forfeit their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
presence, and be in fine possibly reduced to
a Province; Wherefore, Sir, condemn not a
Prince upon so frivolous grounds, but rather
re-examine your authour, to see what more
truth ye are able to milk from him. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pleased the King exceedingly, and sending
for the Mesapotamian, he threatened him to
professe whether what he had spoken to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phander,</hi>
was truth or not, or was voluntarily
informed or not; telling him withall, that he
would cause presently streatch him upon the
rack, because he had heard that <hi>Sophander</hi> had
bought that Confession from him. The poor
fellow fearing that all was deciphered, and
begging the King's privacy, he confessed inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
the progress of the whole matter, and
that he never heard any inclination which his
Prince had for <hi>Agapeta;</hi> neither delivered he
her any Letters from him; but that that les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was dited to him from <hi>Sophander's</hi> own
mouth: but contrariwise, he knew, that it was
concluded by <hi>Megistus</hi>'s father, that he should
marry a neighbouring Princess, whose estate
was adjacent to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and did secure it as
a frontier, albeit it was but of small revenue,
and she of mean parentage; and he heard at
Court, that his father answered those who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
him for bestowing his son and gaining
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33161:99"/>
no Allies by him, That marriage could never
solder up the cracks which were in Princes
friendship, and that Princes might be friends,
but their Crowns were alwayes enemies. The
King satisfied with this Confession, dismissed
him after he had rewarded him, and enjoyned
to him that he should never reveal to <hi>Sophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
what he had acknowledged to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monanthropus,</hi> after he was gone, resumed
his discourse, thus; Sir, those who intend to
perswade too eagerly, are not unlike those, who
fearing to shoot short of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r mark, shoot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
over it. I am confident, if <hi>Sophander</hi> had
not been distracted by envie against <hi>Megistus,</hi>
he would never have endeavoured to perswade
your Majesty, that a business of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could have come to the ears of such a
fellow as this; but, Sir, since his pretended
reason, which was alleaged to be zeal to your
service, is now found not to be the cause of
his information, your Majesty may perswade
your self that there is some poysonous hook
lurking under that pleasant bait; and ye may
justly turn the edge of your jealousie, which
he hath desired you to unsheath against <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus,</hi>
against himself; and since <hi>Sophander</hi> is
a stranger by birth, and by inclination most
avaricious, ye have reason to fear his projects,
and eye narrowly the comportment of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33161:99"/>
by whose motion ye may come to know
the nature of that machine which moves them.</p>
            <p>The King thanked <hi>Monanthropus</hi> for his
advice, and entreated he would tell him how
he behoved to carry himself in a business so
ticklish. Your Majesty (replyed <hi>Monanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus)</hi>
must seem to believe <hi>Sophander,</hi> and may
to him promise, to narrow your affection, and
abridge your respects to <hi>Megistus,</hi> whereby
ye may the more covertly discover by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to you, what his scope is in this his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Monanthropus</hi> had thus enstated <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus</hi>
in the Kings affection, he acquainted
<hi>Megistus</hi> with what had passed by this Letter.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>SInce unkindness is a vice, I will not requite
it; and albeit I regrate that ye should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
me unworthy of half a sheet of paper, yet
I shall rather think my self so unworthy, before
I think you mistaken. Your great successe
hath made all men your admirers, and some
your enemies; fearing lest your noble hands
should unwreath that yoke of slaverie which
they have so laboriously tied upon this poor
Nation. Sir, admire not that Pirats follow
alwayes the richest Vessels; for, as vertue,
which reigneth in you, imployeth you as her
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:33161:100"/>
subject, to maintain her honour; so vice, which
reigns in them, entreats them to deface yours.
<hi>Sophander</hi> hath informed the King, that ye are
Prince of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and intended to court his
Daughter, and enjoy his Crown; but I have
counter-informed, and his Majestie is now fully
assured of your innocencie, and resolveth to
rely mainly upon your conduct and courage;
So, if ye intend to gain his Daughter, lose not
himself; and manage your passion with more
indifferencie than lovers ordinarilie do: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that Kings have long ears, and many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasits
to fill them with detracting clamours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sir, leave not off to be a Prince, when ye begin
to be a Lover; but since ye are a Prince who
loves, love rationally like a Prince; and let
those whom ye are born to rule, see that ye can
rule your self: I know love scorns to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the tutory of reason, thinking it too severe
a master, and knowing that if it had reason
for its associate, all its victory would be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to reason; whereas now it shews, that it
can both war and triumph, not only without
reasons assistance, but even against and over
reason: Yet, Sir, seing the danger is great
here, a Ladies Honour and Crown being at
stake, I hope your prudence will deal warilie,
where your unwarinesse may be so prejudicial
to her and you both: all the Nobles of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33161:100"/>
will band against you, and will think this
Crown too large for any strangers head; and
that the Throne of <hi>Egypt</hi> is too easie a seat for
any besides themselves: And ye will learn by
the change of affection in those who pretend
now to be your friends, that love is but the
handmaid of interest; and that as they love
you now for their own interest, so they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
hereafter their own interest to your love.
Whatever be the carriage of others, if ye man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
these affairs prudently, ye shall find <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthropus</hi>
your very humble servant.</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>This Letter came to <hi>Megistus</hi> hands as he
was sending away the captives to <hi>Misarites,</hi> to
be disposed of at his pleasure, and after he had
dismist them, he did reade it, and thereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to his chamber, fearing lest any of the
Soldiers should discover the pangs wherewith
he found his soul tortured; he did now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that his love-voyage would be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
seing at his first lancing forth he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
by such storms; and to admire the
folly of men, who having received freedom as a
patrimony from providence, did, like unfrugal
heirs, sell their ancestors old inheritance; their
thoughts did no sooner appear, than love muste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all her forces presently, quelled them, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
them with no other Ordnance than that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33161:101"/>
picture of <hi>Agapeta</hi> which <hi>Megistus</hi> carried in
his breast: Could such a prize as this (said
love) be gained without a contest? and would
ye marry a woman whose affection were not
tryed by the competition of many rivals? how
should her love, or their courage be known,
without opposition? or, can things be deemed
difficult when undergone for her? Ye think
both her face and endowments incomparable,
and they are so; wherefore, if ye would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
your deserts to them, shew your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be so too; and think not strange, that
vertue, to shew the world for their instruction
an example of constancy, should, like all wise
teachers, cull out you, who is one of her prime
scholars, to make men admire her skill in your
proficiency; neither can she be so unjust, as not
to reward your pains with lawrels: if your
voyage be harsh, there is a good harbour atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and albeit the storm be boistrous, yet
if the vessel of your resolution be strong, ye need
not fear: fear puts on oft-times the vizard of
terrour and difficulty upon the face of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
to terrifie us, which if ye can by the
hand of courage pluck off, ye will find your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
very smooth-faced: seing ye are entered
into the river of difficulty, look not to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-running
streams lest your head by troubled,
but look over to the shoar of contentment, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33161:101"/>
which ye intend to set foot; complain not of
the loss of your liberty, for necessity, in things
that are excellent, is to be preferred to liberty:
Thus we see our liberty is no wayes impaired
by loving the immortal gods, nor by loving
that which is good, albeit we do both the one
and the other necessarily; Yea, rather we are
infinitly obliged to them for necessitating us to
love something, which possibly if we were left
to the disposal of our free will, we might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
relinquish; and these same gods who have
bestowed freedom upon us, do likewise excite
us to love: So that seing love is of a divine
extraction, it must be of a most pure essence:
the gods disdaining to put their impressa upon
any mettall that is not in it self excellent:
and that it is the effect of some divine influence
we may conclude from this, That it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for Nature to raise instantly such an
emotion in the soul as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve occasioneth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is transported beyond the ordinary limits
of its ordinary strength; yea, often produceth
effects contrary to its wonted humour: so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it makes cowards stout, and fools witty,
we may infer that this is not natural; for, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
no cowards can be stout, nor no fools
witty.</p>
            <p>Having ended this melancholious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
he called for <hi>Philarites,</hi> who helped
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:33161:102"/>
him alwayes to bear the burden of his grief;
and related to him the whole passage circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated,
as he had learned it from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Philarites,</hi> not a whit dismayed, told
him, that at Court the minds of Courtiers
changed fashions as oft as their cloaths: and
as fortune changed oft-times her favourite, so
her favourites changed oft-times their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the reason whereof was not, because
Courtiers were of a more facile humour than
others, (for ordinarily they were men of the
most pregnant spirits, with which facility can
never suit) but because their affection was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so deeply fixed, as the affection of those
who lived retiredly; for, seing they had many
to bestow their affection upon, they could not
bestow much of it upon all; whereas those
that live retiredly, meeting with few worthy
of being beloved, fix all their love upon those
few: Neither was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove of Courtiers unlike
an anchor, which albeit it be great and strong
in it self, yet, if it be not deeply fixed, will be
raised by the first storm; As also, mis-informers
at Court were so many and so busie, and the
jealousie of Courtiers so great, that it was
wonder how love lasted one week even in the
most constant among them: And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(said he) that providence useth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
of favour at Court, as an argument
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33161:102"/>
to deter generous spirits from places which are
ordinarily in themselves most vicious; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<hi>Sophander</hi> promised upon our first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
at Court, to befriend us, yet it is one of
his tenents, That a Statesman should be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to his word, to obey it in a rational way;
but that he is not obliged to be a slave to it, in
obeying it in things both against his reason and
interest; and I heard a Gentleman say, that
he defended ordinarily, That all State-promises
were no longer obligatory, than things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the same way they stood when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
was made: for, said he, I promise, because
I am informed, or imagines, that the person to
whom I promise is of such a temper; so that
if he be of a different or contrary temper, the
condition failing, the thing conditioned cannot
be sought; and since promises are ordinarily
donatives, there is reason the donator should
have the priviledge of explaining his owne
mind; for, seing they to whom I promise can
pretend no right to the thing promised, but
because I willed it; therfore if my will be not
clear, their right is null: and seing none can
be so well acquainted with my will as my self,
none should be admitted to explain it but my
self: and ordinarily, so many and so great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
would follow upon the observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of such promises at Court, that there would
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:33161:103"/>
be greater danger to the Commonwealth in
keeping them, than there could redound to any
private mans conscience by the breach of them:
but, Sir, (continued <hi>Philarites)</hi> think not
strange that fortune should graple with you;
for it is her ordinary, never to list her self but
against some noble spirit, whose conquest were
worth her pains, scorning the easie victory
which she might have over silly clowns: but
possibly she intends to try your courage, which
when she comes once to know, she will think
you worthy to be her minion: She can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
weak spirits, but great ones are born to
command her: And since the mustering false
hopes is able to make a man victorious, and
the basest of men gain oftimes, because others
think that their brags and threats are true;
how much more shall the best of spirits
(amongst whom ye may be ranked) become
victorious, if they but hope really that they
shall conquer? hope resembles a bridle, whose
motion is able to recover the stumbling feet of
our courage; And how many Armies have
gained more by presages, and happy omens, than
they could have done either by skill or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
This is the reason why speeches are
made to Souldiers; and for this audacious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are usually most fortunate.</p>
            <p>This discourse was interrupted by a Letter
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:33161:103"/>
presented from <hi>Misarites,</hi> wherein they were
ordered to return to the Camp with those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their conduct; which they were most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obey, knowing that the Souldiery there
might easily be misinformed of what was done
at such a distance from them: The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
they did begin their march, and being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two dayes arrived, they were welcomed by
the acclamations of the Souldiers (but coldly
entertained by the Grandees, whom <hi>Misarites</hi>
had poysoned) who, in spight of all misinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
admired the rare qualities of these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gentlemen: for, albeit it be an easie task,
to defame amongst the vulgar sort, those,
whose prime quality is wit; because their wit,
which should antidote all these aspersions, is
not easily perceived by that sort of people; yet
it is hard to defame those whose chief part is
courage, because the most ignorant cannot but
see that; and ordinarily the vulgar sort is more
led by their sense than by their reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Misarites</hi> delayed alwayes to fight, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that it was fitter to starve than to fight
the Persians; who being far from home,
could not subsist long in a forreign Nation:
but his intention was to ruine the Egyptian
Army by these delayes, who finding themselves
near home, and overburdened with hardship,
did drop away daily. Nothing was acted all
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:33161:104"/>
this time, except by skirmishes; wherein <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarites</hi>
imployed all those whose courage was
formidable to the Persians, and whose loyalty
was formidable to himself, and many of them
were swept away by this means; neither omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he to entice the Knights with this point of
honour, but all in vain: for they resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
themselves for archievements of lesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
and more honour. <hi>Misarites</hi> caused like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
mix the meal, which was sent to the Army
with lime and chalk; whereby diseases became
both numerous and dangerous, and the whole
Army began to resemble an Hospital, wherein
there was greater need of Physicians than of
Field-Officers: He likewise, together with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phander,</hi>
perswaded the King, not to send the
Army their pay, assuring him that poverty was
the best encouragement to fight, for it made
them fight couragiously, out of a desire to gain
the Enemies spoil; whereas those who were
rich, were unwilling to hazard what they were
assured of already, for what they were not sure
to gain. <hi>Sophanders</hi> drift in this, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the money for himself; but <hi>Misarites</hi>
scope was meerly to turn the Souldiers male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents:
Neither ceased the Knights covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make the Army remark these passages,
thereby to enrage them against <hi>Misarites.</hi>

such a quarrel, ye walk upon a narrow preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,
wherein there is great difficulty to stand,
and certain ruine if ye fall: think not that the
Gods will suffer Princes, who are their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and who govern for them, to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened
by such treacherous designs; in vain
have they been at so much pains for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his honour, if they abandon it now:
and albeit it did thrive in your hands, yet after
the game is plaid, there will be danger in your
Master's parting the stakes with <hi>Sophander;</hi>
who will lay him aside when he findes that in
peace he stands not in need of him: But albeit
your Master did injoy his promised preferment,
who knows but he will cause cut your throat,
both fearing lest you should thereafter upon
some discontent divulge his cheats, or fearing
that he could not safely therafter imploy you,
who betrayed your Prince? Wherfore if ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to perpetuat your happiness, and to prevent
your inevitable ruine, desert that, interest, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33161:105"/>
own the interest of your Nation, and I promise
you in his Majesties name greater preferment,
than ye are to expect from your Master; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
need you stumble at this, as a breach of
trust, and as a sin comitted against the affection
which your Master bears to you, for ye should
pay the oldest debt first; and ye were a subject
to your Prince, before ye were a servant to
<hi>Misarites;</hi> wherefore ye should endeavour to
acquit your self of your duty to his Majesty,
as being both of greatest importance, and of
oldest standing; Neither doth your oath of
fidelity, given to your Master, oblige in things
unlawful; for the gods will not be witnesses in
things abominable, and there is no oath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they are not called as witnesses; they will not
suffer a man to be bound to the stake of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by such sacred chains; and since the thing
sworn is unlawfull in it self, there can be no
confirmation of it by oath: for, how can ye
confirm that which is not? as also, Sir, all oaths
are given with this proviso, that they wrong
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot our Superiours; for, our subjection to
them not being ours, we cannot dispose of it
without their advice.</p>
            <p>This discourse surprized so the Secretary,
who entreated some time to advise; but <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus</hi>
fearing that he might detect him to his
Master, or at least, might dissemble with him,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:33161:105"/>
told him, that to relate things already done,
there needed no consultation, which was only
required to prevent things to come, wherefore
he insisted passionatly for a present discovery;
which the other, convinced by his conscience of
his errour, and considering that he had already
half confessed the truth of what was doubted,
by seeking some time to solve the doubt, which
else had been needless; desired <hi>Megistus</hi> to
swear in his Majesties name, what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and that he should unriddle to him the
whole mysterie; which when <hi>Megistus</hi> had
done, the Secretary spoke thus.</p>
            <p>Sir, I cannot tell whether it be by sagacity,
or divine inspiration, that ye come to know this
mysterie, but it must be by either; for those
who were privy to it, were all of them so much
concerned, that I am confident they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
divulge it: but, Sir, you have conjectured
rightly, for my Master hath devoted himself to
the Persian service; and one day by a compact
betwixt him and the Persian General, I was
desired to walk out to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ield, where I would
find a Persian, of such a statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and garb, who
would suffer himself to be taken my prisoner;
which succeeded accordingly, and whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to my Master, and who was brought to
his bed-chamber, upon pretext as if he would
examine him privatly; my Master commanded
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33161:106"/>
him to prison for two dayes, but thereafter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
him upon his promise to stand by the
Egyptian quarrel, so that he walk'd up and
down the Army, and was countenanced by the
most eminent in it; till at last acquainted both
with our strength, and knowing fully <hi>Misari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
mind, he made shew to go out one day in a
party, but forgot to return: and yesterday
there came a Trumpet, under pretext of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for some prisoners, but secretly he delivered
my Master some Letters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> did send immediatly for <hi>Philari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
to whom he related all that had past, and
after some debates what was fittest to be done,
they concluded, that they would acquaint some
Colonels with it, who were not of <hi>Misarites</hi>
his faction; as also a young Nobleman, who
was the King's sisters son, and thereby had
much command and following in the Army:
after they were all assembled, and had taken an
oath of secresie, and had heard the case dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
they resolved that same night (because
two of their Regiments were upon the guard)
that the King's sisters son <hi>Stirias,</hi> should take
the Letter, and ensure <hi>Misarites,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
divulge the Letter to the Army; but
they concluded presently to acquaint the King
with what had past, that he might secure <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phander</hi>
as they were to secure <hi>Misarites,</hi> lest
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:33161:106"/>
if they were not secured both at once, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
of the one, might advertise the
other of his danger; wherefore they wrote to
his Majesty this Letter.</p>

Prisons were made for Traitors, and

secure ye the other; and let neither his reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
protestations, nor his cunning discourses
buy him off from a condign punishment. We
have sent alongst <hi>Misarites</hi> Secretary, to whose
loyalty your Majestie owes the discovery of the
whole plot, and who hath been as honest as his
master was disloyal; We hope your Majestie
will recompence the one, and punish the other:
and that ye will acquaint your humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who shall be preferred to <hi>Misarites</hi> his

and the ruine of your affairs here prevented.</p>

            <p>The two Knights addressed also another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Monanthropus.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:33161:107"/>
After this Gentleman was dispatcht, and the
Guards set, <hi>Stirias,</hi> accompanied with the
Knights and the Officers, went to <hi>Misarites</hi>
Tent, and there made him prisoner: he would
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve raised some tumult, but was prevented
by <hi>Stirias,</hi> who calling the other Officers,
shewed them and the Souldiers the Letter, and
immediatly prevented the tumult, and arrested
two or three others who were of the same ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal:
this done, the Guards were commanded
to let none passe who might acquaint the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
with what had occurred, but to lie quiet
till to morrow; for, in the twilight they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to set upon the Persian Army, who were
secure, relying upon <hi>Misarites</hi> infallible affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to them: The Souldiers witnessed by
their looks, their joy and willingnesse to fight,
weary of the insupportable fatigue of that
slow-paced War. Whereupon the Council of
War preferred all in one voice, <hi>Megistus</hi> to be
General in the <hi>interim,</hi> and <hi>Stirias</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
to command in vice of the other reduced
Officers: at midnight they marched, the sickest
among them shewing himself healthfull, and
the most sullen shewing himself chearfull. At
two a clock in the morning, they assaulted the
Persians; ilk defended trenches; who opprest
with sleep, and distracted with fear, could
neither give nor receive orders; some had their
<pb facs="tcp:33161:107"/>
beds turned in their graves; and others were
from the imbracements of their dear friends,
sent to the cold imbracements of cruel death:
<hi>Sotorus</hi> was, after much resistance, taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
and in his conquest ended the conquest
of the field; the General being like the heart
of the Army, which is the last part in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
which lodgeth life. Thus ended that War
so formidable to the Egyptians, that they had
concluded necessarily their own ruine; and so
glorious to these two Knights, that they only
were esteemed the wel-spring, whence flowed
that large river of happinesse, whose streams
fatned so all <hi>Egypt.</hi> The diligence used at
Court was as great as what was used in the
Army: for, immediately upon the receipt of
the above-mentioned Letter, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Sophander</hi> to prison, each at Court
contributing his assistance to his disgrace; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that many small Vessels might be built
with the ruines of that bulkish one; and each
one endeavouring to testifie his own innocency,
by the rigour of his carriage to <hi>Sophander;</hi> and
now the Court, which resembles ordinarily an
Orange tree, whereupon there is alwayes some
fruit flourishing, some blossoming, and some
withering; did now resemble an Aspen tree,
where all the leaves trembled, rather by an
innate quality, than by any outward storm;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33161:108"/>
So all trembled here, rather astonisht with the
novelty of the accident, and fearing unjust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
(which are ordinary at such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
of which private enquiries takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
and when it is a crime even to be dilated)
rather than from a consciousness of their own
guilt. A servant of <hi>Monanthropus</hi> admiring
the inconstancy of Court favour, presented his
Master with these lines.</p>

               <l>How can those stand, who on the slippery ice</l>
               <l>Of Court are plac'd? when by the storms of vice,</l>

               <l>Who from his cottage doth these disasters see.</l>
               <l>Court is a firmament, whence stars oft fall,</l>

               <l>Not with good blood, but humours swell each day.</l>
               <l>They grow so big, that vertues narrow gate</l>

               <l>Luxuriant pride shakes often their hour-glasse,</l>
               <l>And their debordings seals to them a passe,</l>

               <l>Who would be fixt, must grip to vertues hand:</l>

The Court was upon this occasion remodel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and all those who had been <hi>Sophanders</hi>
confidents, were either imprisoned or disgraced,
as persons in whom the King could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide;
and now <hi>Monanthropus</hi> was the only
Minion, by whose advice, and through whose
hands all things passed.</p>
            <p>The War being ended, the King, to secure
himself at Court, resolved to call back the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and ordained the two Knights to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in triumph, and withall posted away a
Commission to <hi>Megistus</hi> to command in chief:
The Commission being received, <hi>Megistus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
his march to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and stopped
by a Warrant from the King, four miles from
the City, till all things should be in readinesse
for his reception. The next morning they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
all the streets being tapistred as they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
alongst, and Guards standing upon both
sides. After the Infantry, marched <hi>Megistus,</hi>
with <hi>Philari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es</hi> on his right hand, and <hi>Stirias</hi>
upon his left: In the Market-place stood a
Scaffold, whereon was represented the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the gods, before whom <hi>Themis,</hi> as
goddess of Justice, and <hi>Mars,</hi> as god of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
did plead which of them should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to welcome these worthy Gentlemen;
at last <hi>Mars</hi> was preferred for the Armies bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
satisfaction; who at their arrival delivered
them this speech.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:33161:109"/>
My darlings cadets of my house, whose hands</l>
            <l>Were made to execute the just commands</l>
            <l>Of divine powers; it's (my sons) to you,</l>
            <l>That Victory her lofty top doth bow;</l>
            <l>That ye your heads may with her glorious bayes</l>
            <l>Encircle, like unto a Sun with rayes:</l>
            <l>Ye who hold fortunes wheel by the strong hand</l>
            <l>Of Courage, making her swift course to stand;</l>
            <l>Iustice and Courage, shrewdly did contend,</l>
            <l>Which of them as ambassadors the gods should send,</l>
            <l>But seing Courage, Iustice doth include,</l>
            <l>(No Courage being, but where the cause is good)</l>
            <l>Therefore the gods have Courage sent to greet</l>
            <l>Your safe return to this most joyfull street;</l>
            <l>And were it not to leave on earth a seed</l>
            <l>Of Heroes, they would surely with all speed</l>
            <l>Transplant you to the heavens, there to shine</l>
            <l>Amongst those other deiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s divine.</l>
            <l>Live then, brave Heroes, and more praise possess,</l>
            <l>Than Mars rude tongue is able to expresse.</l>
            <p>After that scene was ended, there appeared
an Egyptian loaded with fetters, and making
his approaches to the Knights, entreated them
to untye his fetters, which they did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and thereafter he made them this gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>Invincible Gentlemen, this that ye have
now done, is but an emblem of that ye have
done formerly; It is not so mysterious that I

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to explain it: Our liberty is a debt which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33161:109"/>
we owe you, and our thanks are the only coyn
we can pay it in; all the by-standers partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
with me in the common freedom, and
would return with me the common thanks, if
order would permit it: our thanks and your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are no wayes proportionable, the one being
empty, and the other excellent; but our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and your deserts hold a better propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both being inexprimable; they are twins
both springing from the womb of your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
Live then happily, worthy Princes,
and inherite these praises, which ye have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast
by your blood and pains.</p>
            <p>The reception at Court exceeded in splendor
that of the Market-place, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Agapeta</hi> and ARETINA were there, in
whose affections the Knights desired more to
triumph, than in any thing else; caring only
for those honours they had received, as means
to make their peerless Mistrisses honour them
the more: all the inventions at Court was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in honouring the Knights, and they
were esteemed wittiest who pleased them best:
Tiltings were continually used; for, courage
being once wakened, behoved to have some
exercise till it were fully re-setled; neither
could it change its pace so extreamly, as to fall
from a gallop to a still standing, but behoved
to retire by piece-meal: this joy was in it self
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33161:110"/>
great, but was thought the greater, that it was
the successor of a pannick fear; and at last the
King resolved to sacrifice <hi>Sophander</hi> to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their solemnities: for, many thought
it not fit that such a plodding head should have
leave to rest upon its old shoulders, and that
there could not but ensue great alterations
amongst the Nobles upon this late innovation;
and those who were postponed, might probably
study his releasment, desiring rather he should
bear sway, than their own competitors; and
expecting by his releasment, to return affairs to
their old confusion; that a living man might
alwayes finde friends, but dead dogs would
bite none; that to keep him in perpetual fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
was in it self illegal, prisons being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
rather to reserve men for punishment,
than to be a punishment it self; and that it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as far from punishment, as the means did
from the end for which they were appointed;
or, if perpetual imprisonment was at all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
it was only, either where the person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carcerated
was furious, and so there was fear
that in executing the body, they should kill
both soul and body; or else, where the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
was a person loved by the people, whose
death would irritat them; or else, of great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
so that their expectation of his life, or
fear of his death, would justly poise all his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33161:110"/>
friends undertakings, and over-awe all their
insolencies: But that neither of these was to
be expected by <hi>Sophanders</hi> execution, whom
all hated, and none loved; and possibly, if it
were continued, he might convey away out of
the Nation most of his Estate (which he had
ever keeped in movables, as being most trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
and so it was best to wring the spunge
so long as it was full: The King resolved to
execute him presently, and therefore sentenced
him to be hanged in the Market-place; but the
Church-men petitioned his Majesty, that he
might be first examined by them, being one of
their number; and as being the ambassador of
the immortal gods, he should not be sentenced
by any mortal Prince; and that they behoved to
examine first, whether what he had done were
done for the glory of God, in which case there
could be no crime, and to which none were
Judges but Church-men: for, if the secular
power might at pleasure cut off Ecclesiastick
members, it would follow that it were in his
power to suffer a Church to be, or not; for so
he might hang them at his pleasure: neither
should ever any vice in the State, or Statesmen
be purged or enveighed against; for, all such
reproofs should presently be declared treason:
And seing Ecclesiasticks were naturally too
prone to connive at vice, they should now be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33161:111"/>
necessitated to do out of fear, what they did
formerly but by omission and negligence. The
King rejected this Petition, and told them that
as they cognosced upon the errours of Laicks
when committed against their power, so he
might cognosce upon the escapes of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
when committed against his; that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phander</hi>
had offended as a subject, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
to behoved to be punished by his Prince,
and that it were safer being a shepherd than a
King, if they who were ordinarily governed by
some two or three factious fellows (the best
of Ecclesiasticks alwayes shunning command)
should be Judges competent to treason; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
seing they had their protection from him,
it was fit he should challenge subjection from
them, which consisted in nothing more than in
this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megistus</hi> hearing that the King resolved to
cause hang <hi>Sophander,</hi> thought, that albeit he
could not beg his life, as being a Trai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or, yet
that he would endeavour to mitigate the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his death, as being his old friend and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron;
whereupon both <hi>Philarites</hi> and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
his Majesty, that he would cause cut off
his head, and not hang him, as being once ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by himself with the title of Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of State; and that it was customary
amongst all Nations, to punish in the least emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33161:111"/>
way those who had been most eminent in
dignity, both because the smallest punishment
is greater to them, than the greatest would
be to others, as also, because punishments
being ordinarily inflicted, not for what was
past, because that could not be re-called, but
for prevention of the like by that rigour for
the future; and so seing fewer great ones
would probably incurre these guilts, the Law
needed not punish them so severely, as it did
the meaner sort, who would more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall in the crimes forbidden. That Maxime
holds only true (answered the King) in those
crimes which degrade not a man of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
as in combats and private injuries, which
crimes are consistent with true honour; but in
treason and treachery, the committer declares
himself unworthy of his honours, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
should not enjoy those priviledges due
to them; yet, to satisfie your desires, I am
content his head be struck off, and his body
buried.</p>
            <p>At the day appointed for his Execution, all
the City, yea, and the Nation flocked to the
Market-place; some to satisfie their inhumane
revenge, (which that circumstance of time
made most unjust) others, to remark the period
of humane glory; and a third sort, to glut
their boundlesse curiosity. After some time so
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33161:112"/>
spent, <hi>Sophander</hi> appeared upon the Scaffold,

                  <p>I Am by providence presented here as an
emblem of unconstant grandour; I wish
my case may be remarked by all, but imitated
by none: I am set up as a beacon upon the
rockie shoar of Court-favour, that ye should
not approach the place where I have splitted;
I mean not that ye should all retire your
selves from Court, for that were impossible,
seing the Nation must be governed by some;
and unlawfull, seing Nature hath bestowed
publick spirits upon some, that they might
imploy them for the profit of all; but I
mean, that none should thrust themselves
into the crowd of Minions, wherein many
have perished in entring, and all have perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
almost before they could retire: And that
all should be so wise, as to be the last who
will go to Sea in such storms, and the first
who will retire from them: I know many
are taken with our greatnesse, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not our hazard; many envie our access
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33161:112"/>
to our Prince, but they advert not the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informations
given in to him against us; some
eye greedily our riches, but remembers not
our vast expences and numerous attendants:
And, on the other hand, they see the poverty
of a private life, but are strangers to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and contemns its lownesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
weighing its security: thus greatnesse,
like a whore, presents her self unto us fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereas chast vertue appears only in her
homely habite; and, believe me, albeit ye
may for a season recreate your self more tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
with the first, yet ye will live more
contentedly with the second: O! who were
lodged but one night in the breast of a Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,
to see what confusion of thoughts were
there, would thereafter buy himself off from
the ensnaring pleasures of that anxious life;
May ye not consider that the gods who have
created all things for the use of man, have
made things which are most usefull and good
to be most common? and so, seing they have
ordained many to be governed, and but few
to govern, we must conclude those who are
governed to be happiest: for, if they had
thought Crowns and Scepters as requisit for
mans happiness, as were private estates and
cottages, they could have made as many of
the one as of the other, and created as many
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33161:113"/>
Kingdoms as there were men to be Kings in
them; yea, I believe that Kings and Courts
were ordained, not to make happy those who
lived in them, but to maintain the happinesse
of those who lived remote from them: your
sleep is not interrupted, whilst we are disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted;
neither is your danger worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeing,
whilst ours is often inevitable: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the number of our competitors, the
multiplicity of our businesses, our own fears,
and the Princes jealousies; and you will soon
conclude, that we are like poor peasants who
make and sell good wine to others, but drink
little or none of it our selves. Since there
are so many reasons to disswade us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ambitious, we must conclude Ambition
to be a cunning Sophister, which can solve all
those unanswerable arguments. I remember
that the Christians observe, That seing it
tempted the Angels, before they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with any other sin, it is no wonder
it should tempt us who are but men, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
tainted with sin; and that since it was
the first sin, it must necessarily be the sin we
have greatest inclinations; for, seing we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
first ordidarily that we affect most:
Ambition then is the Devils first-born, and
so no wonder it claim precedency before all
other vices; and as ordinarily proud men of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:33161:113"/>
all men have alwayes the greatest train, so
Pride it self of all vices hath still the maniest
attendants; for, it must be waited upon by
covetousness, to fill its prodigal coffers; with
revenge, to repair its imaginary affronts;
with murder, to remove all those who stand
in its way; and in fine, it is the great bellyed
vice, which spanneth all the rest. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
if I were speaking this to you, incircled with
my former honours, ye might imagine I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
against greatness, as wishing all others
to flee it, that I might share alone in it; or,
if I were to live banished, ye might say that
I disparaged it, because I could not retain it;
but being to dye, ye may be confident that
all I say are the dictates of meer ingenuity.
I am now upon the brink of my grave, and
can leave you nothing in legacy but my tears
and precepts; which, if ye follow, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the great losse this Nation hath suffered
by me.</p>

unproportionatness of the bodily organs to
such contemplations, and when it is emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated

he recommended his friends and nephews to

               <hi>Megistus</hi> sadned exceedingly, partly by the

with the thoughts of <hi>Sophanders</hi> prediction;
retired to his chamber, where his Landlord, a
witty fellow, came presently to solace him, and
related to him this story, which had occurred
that same day in the City.</p>
            <p>A young Country Gentleman, accustomed
at home to whistle following the plough, to
domineere amongst a great many Countrey
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33161:114"/>
Clowns, and to feed a kennel of dogs, was by
his friends brought into the City to court a
young Citizen; whose beauty lay in her cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
and whose perfections were counted by
thousands: yet this Jet was able enough to
draw straw to it, and her blacknesse did cast a
curious lustre when enambled upon gold; his
friends cared not whether she had a golden
mind, seing she was a golden mine; neither
looked they to her age, seing it was a golden
age: to speak truth, such a statue fitted well
such a worshipper. Being come to the City,
he was all gilded with gold: and indeed such
an harsh pill had need to be so; and ye would
have sworn that his cloathes being upon him,
were another <hi>Iasons</hi> fleece, and himself the
sheep: Thus accouted, he marched up and
down the City, dreaming that all persons were
busied in viewing him, and pointing out his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
asking who was that, or the other; which
a young Gallant perceiving, watched till he
holding out his finger to a Coach, to ask what
a Cart was that so covered? which his servant
not hearing at first, as being a busie as his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
he asked the second time, with his finger
outstretched, What was that? to which the
other Gallant, making a low congie, answered,
That it was his Honours finger. He admired
likewise for what use served those Chests that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33161:115"/>
men carried about the streets (meaning the
Sedans) to which a merry bystander answered,
That it was to carry Gentlemens hounds and
dogs, lest else they should stray, or be robbed
by the Courtiers; whereupon the Youth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
himself to the bearers, and commanded
them to take in his dogs (for the other had
perswaded him, that if he spoke calmly to them
that they would think him blunt and silly) at
which the bearers, thinking he spoke so, only
to affront them, and knowing by his garb that
he was but a fresh-water Citizen, reviled him
most pitifully, saying that the shepherds in the
Country were much to blame, who suffered
their sheep so to stray, and that they behoved
to fleece him; whereupon they pulled away
his cloak, and had not restored it, if his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who went up and down crying that his
Honour was massacred, had not amazed many
people, who caused restore him his cloak, each
one swearing that what he had spoken, was
spoken out of simplicity: home he went with
his cloak lined with this affront; and the next
morning was admitted to see his Mistris, who
albeit she was not fair, yet could go fair to
cheat him; and was able to play her cards so,
as that she was able to counter and beast such
a Gentleman; and if they had begun the game,
doubtless she had by turning up alwayes the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33161:115"/>
ace, made my Gentleman throw down his cards.</p>
            <p>The Gentlewoman being informed of his
pure wit, resolved to let him see some of hers;
whereupon she commanded her maid to put on
her cloathes, and to sit in her chair, and receive
the visit for her; and withall, after the young
Gallant should begin to extol her beauty above
all others, that she should then ask what he
judged of her maid? All things being thus
ordered, she sent to entreat his friends, that
none of them should come to her chamber
with him the first day, because she would be
too bashfull if any else were there to remark
her; to which they easily condescended.</p>
            <stage>Enter Gentleman.</stage>
            <p>The Gallant the next day enters, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his arm about her neck, kisses his Mistris
loudly, fearing that else that they had imagined
that he had not kissed her at all, and thereafter
tumbling back confusedly, made another low
reverence, where he lost misfortunately the
paper upon which his compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
(which he very often repeated at home to
his uncle) He entreated her to sit down in the
highest chair, thinking that to be some prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
whereto the Gentlewoman wittily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
Sir, the woman should be lowest. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this debate was ended, he insisted thus.</p>
            <p>Mistris, when I came first to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33161:116"/>
thought this City the prettiest thing in the
world, but now when I see you, I esteem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it; for, I think that all our Country
maids, may be handmaids to you; whose beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is as far preferable to theirs, as this City is
to ours. Here he stopt, hearing a horse passe
by upon the street, and called for his servants
to look if that was his young horse or not, and
thereafter insisted thus; Madam, I believe
that my father's house hath all accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
requisit for sweetning the harshness of
a solitary life, only it wants such an accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Lady as you are, to be Mistris of all, (and
there he recounted to her what choice fields
for hunting, and what excellent pasturages
for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rding, were there) But Sir, replyed she,
seing we see Country Gentlemen leave all these
rural pleasures, pretending to come to the City
for converse; and those who are in the City,
leave their well deckt chambers, and sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
parlors, and go abroad to recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their friends, we may infer, that
society is preferable to all these; for, when ye
come to the City, ye acknowledge it is to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your spirits; and when we go to the
Country, our end is only to refresh our bodies,
So that the Country may be thought as justly
to cede to the City, as the soul is preferable to
the body. O Madam, but ye could make any
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33161:116"/>
place happy; and happy were the son of that
father who might be husband to such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Lady as ye are. What think you of my
maid, if compared with me (said she) I think
her a beautifull young Gentlewoman (quoth
our Gallant) but no beauty when compared
with you: Whereupon the Mistris, who had
played the maid hitherto, did now sit down in
her own chair, and commanding her waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
to stand by her, she thundred thus the
poor simple Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Sir, I admire the lesse what hath past, that I
expected to hear what I now hear; but I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
that men should lavish out so profusely
praises of what they know not: for, Sir, if we
were so simple as to believe, that your heart
conceived what your tongue brings forth, ye
might rather wish us in <hi>Bedlam</hi> than in your
Beds; and if we are so wise as to discern your
dissimulation, ye may conclude, that we think
you as unfit to be our husbands, because of
this last, as ye might judge us unworthy to be
your wives because of the first; wherefore,
Sir, consider for the future, that albeit women
are so discreet as to connive at your dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet they are not so ignorant, as not to
know it. Ye wrong our sex hugely, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us so simple, and your own, by making us
conclude that ye are all dissemblers: and of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33161:117"/>
all vices, dissimulation is one of the worst, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it not only is evil in it self (as being a
cheat) but likewise is an abuse of what is good,
even of respect and friendship, making them
bauds to your vicious cheats: Sir, those strings
are not well tuned, which are tuned too high;
and those praises are but flatteries, which are
palpable lyes; yet, Sir, I pardon you more
than others: for, as those who shoot seldom,
must be pardoned when they shoot over; So
those who complement but unfrequently, must
be pardoned albeit they do it imprudently.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman struck dead by these thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts
of wit, remained speechless, as if
his soul had fled away for shame; he essayed
often to speak, but his words no sooner peeped
out, but smelling this reply, they retired back
to their old quarter in great disorder; leaving
their master helpless without them, who had
been formerly but little holpen by them. Since
his own soul hath left him, said <hi>Megistus,</hi> it is
reason we leave him also, and so he went to
bed.</p>

            <p>THe next morning <hi>Megistus</hi> went to
to tender his respects to <hi>Monanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
and at his entry, told him, That
it was not too little, but rather too
much respect, which had estranged him so from
waiting upon his Lordship at his chamber all
this while; and that he shunned much to be so
sacrilegious, as to rob he State of those hours
which would be spent in its service, if they
were not mispent by such trifling visits as his
were. After this they discoursed of present
affairs, and after these, <hi>Monanthropus</hi> entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Megistus</hi> to walk some time in the garden,
and there to continue the story of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian
War, which <hi>Megistus</hi> at his entreaty
commenced thus.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I will not trouble your attention,
in making it trace all the tracts of fortunes
wheel in that Commonwealth, whose reelings
were so many, that it appears she intended to
shew the world how often she could turn in a
short space; Those who stuck upon her, were
in her Circumgirations crusht to pieces, only
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33161:118"/>
those were preserved, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foreseeing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy,
did leap off, exchangeing necessary
ruine with a voluntary fall: and albeit their
story resembles your <hi>Nilus,</hi> the sources of
both being unknown; yet I shall acquaint your
Lordship with those mysteries which time hath
now unmasked: for, albeit Statesmen often
gild their greatest cheats with specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts,
yet time at last wears out that gilding,
and then all things appear in their true colours:
and as from gray-haired men, so from gray-haired
stories, truth is often best learned;
Wherefore my Lord, please to know, that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon</hi>
and <hi>Athens</hi> were enemies as vindictive
as old, till at last by the marriage of the King
of <hi>Lacedemons</hi> daughter, with the King of
<hi>Athens</hi> son, the Crowns were both molten in
one; or rather the one lined with the other,
(the gods making often friendship and amity,
the eldest son of such marriages) After <hi>Sophus</hi>
his succession to the Crown of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> (for
he was an Athenian born) he enobled many in
<hi>Lacedemon,</hi> both fearing lest he should lose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
friends, if these many pretenders losed their
suits; as also, because in making them Nobles,
he made them friends; and that those who had
gotten patents from him, would imploy both
their estates and patents for him; knowing
that if he fell, their honour behoved to fall
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33161:118"/>
with him: There were others who alleaged,
that he intended to make the Nobility lesse
powerfull, by making them more numerous;
and by dividing this great torrent of popular
command in many chanels, he made it foorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for his wit, even where it was deepest: for,
as it is hard to gain one of ten, so it is easie to
gain one of twenty: and those plots which
might easily have been concealed amongst the
Noblemen if they had been few, were easily
learned from them when they were many; and
forreign Princes, who intend to invade the
Countries, may easily gain one Grandee, (who
being one of few, might be formidable to his
own Prince, and most helpfull to his enemie)
whereas it was difficult to gain many, and they
were not very dangerous when they were gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
yet whatever was the reason which did
instigate this wise Prince to this, certain it is,
that this obfuscated much the resplendent rays
of Honour and Nobility; for Nobilities great
priviledges, being preference amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and respect from the people, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
must be the lesse worthy, by how much
the moe competitors they have; and their
respect from the people must be the ebber, that
the people is obliged to divide it amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
This wise Prince likewise, finding what
great influence the Priests of that Nation had
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:33161:119"/>
upon the people, and perpending how hard (if
not impossible) it was for a Prince to gain all
their affections, or retain them, when once gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
resolved to chuse some few to govern the
rest, by whom he might govern the others at
his pleasure; and to whom he might intimate
his thoughts without trouble or fear of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
and by whom he might antidote the
factions, which he foresaw either their own
pride, or the factious Nobility might hatch
amongst them; as also, that thereby the sons
of Noblemen, and possibly his own friends,
might have some void Charges and Offices,
whereto they might pretend; and wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once installed, they might evidence more
loyalty to him, than strangers would do: as
also, that the Nobility might be counterpoised
and might not share alone in all the Offices of
State, in whose hands they were more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than in the hands of Ecclesiasticks, whose
revenues were not great, nor whose vassals and
kinsmen were not numerous: these the other
Ecclesiasticks grudged infinitly, not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they thought their promotion illegal, as
angry because they were not promoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
ambition perswading the soberest
amongst them, that the higher they were,
they would be the nearer to heaven. Many
judged likewise, that he was most ill satisfied
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:33161:119"/>
with the Lacedemonian Senate, which was
composed ordinarily of the wittiest and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest
persons in the Nation, and intended of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to have each City choose, as their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
some Residenter, who might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
best the necessities of his Town, and
would nible lesse at the Royal Prerogative;
whereas Lawyers, and others, being often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated
by them, dipped too much in what
belonged to the King, and too little in what
concerned the place represented by them; and
in <hi>Athens</hi> when it was tabled, whether each
County and Town should be licentiate to chuse
any they looked upon as fittest, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by the Nobles there that this choaked
their interest; for, if they should be permitted
to chuse the Lawyers or Wits of the Nation,
the Nobles should be topped by them in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
and upon all occasions.</p>
            <p>He likewise was most unsatisfied, with the
dependences of the Tribes of that Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own Families, and upon the Princes
thereof; to whom the King in their affection
was but second; for he esteemed these, the
storehouses of faction and nurseries of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
none daring either follow the Royall
Standard, except under their conduct; nor
daring countenance a stranger if not in bloud
or affinity with them: and as that wise Prince
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33161:120"/>
often said, these could not be properly thought
his subjects, who were so much in subjection to
others, nor could not imploy both their hands
in upholding the Throne, the one whereof was
busied in paling up the Prince of their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
and so by dividing their hearts betwixt
their Prince and him, they made them unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
for either,</p>
            <p>These seemed but dwarf discontentments,
when placed beside that gyant prejudice, which
was conceived against him, because of his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and monster-like affection to <hi>Phratus</hi> his
Minion; who enhanced all the Royal favour,
as due to none but to himself; whose mean
extraction, when collationed with his top-high
preferment, seemed insufferable to those of
higher birth, and lower fortunes; but these
adverted not, who seing no familiarity nor inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
can be, betwixt those amongst whom
there is no equality; that therefore Princes
must advance some one above all the rest, to
whom he may communicate, and in whose
breasts he may pour out his greatest secrets,
that so he may not be vexed alwayes, in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down to speak to them, or to hear what
they would speak to him; and customarily
Princes pile out those, whose birth cannot oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
any fears that they will entertain any
nimious pretences: These Favourites are the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:33161:120"/>
skreens which defend Kings from popular ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and the pack-horses upon whom all enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and miscarriages are laid; and their ruine is
often the main article of pacification betwixt
the King and Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who to repay their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
taxations and losses, seek no other requital
than their destruction; and whom Princes
themselves often suffer, like spunges, to suck in
treasure from the people, knowing that when
they are filled by them, they will devour lesse
of what pertains to the publick cash; as also,
that they may wring them when they are full,
and so be thanked by the people, for retaking
that treasure from the Favourite, which if they
had immediatly taken from themselves, they
had been most bitterly exclaimed against: this

is at the first entry; and commonly those who
are well descended, have all the bars of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
laid in their way by their competing equals;
and many to pull them down, whilst they are
mounting, whereas many persons mount these
stairs undiscoveredly, without being once leted:
Yea, oft-times they imp themselves in some
Noblemans train, who in flying high drawes
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33161:121"/>
them after him: Another great mean of his
advancement, was his favour amongst the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
who are more prodigal of their encomions,
to those whom they affect than are their wary
husbands; and whose sex and charms procure
often both countenance and respect, to those
whom they once honour with the title of their
Favourite; non daring offend such, lest they
should be forced to take up the cudgel of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
against a Lady; and all being most ready
to signifie their respect to these Ladies in the
persons of their Favorite, seing most want the
means of engaging themselves: from this grain
of mustard-seed did grow up that large stalk,
whose fruits did thereafter so bite the mouths
of all the Nation, and by this sparkle was
kindled that great fire, which did thereafter
both scorch his enemies, and warm his friends;
and whose flames were the only lights which
shew Courtiers the way to preferment. Yet
the people ceased not to cry out against him, as
the Canicular Star, which made the influence of
Court so noxious; all the dayes of his reign
being their dogg-dayes; his prodigality was
called the occasion of the many taxations, and
his pride the reason why all others were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced:
which a zealous friend to his Majesty
did one day thus remonstrate to him.</p>
            <p>Sir, it is not your own, but your Favourits
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33161:121"/>
prodigality which uncoffereth your treasury;
for, all Kings that ever reigned in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi>
have successively lived at the same rate that ye
live, yet have their treasuries often grown fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whereas yours becomes daily more lean:
but the reason why one King spends more than
another, is, because their Minions are more or
lesse profuse; for, when a King chuseth for his
Favourit a lame wit, which needs silver stilts to
uphold him, then is the treasure impoverished;
he feareth all, and so must bribe many; and
his intelligence (I mean not for his Princes
maintenance, but for his own) must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at the publick charge; as also, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
of your Majesties Nobles at Court, is
one of the moths which consumes this poor
Nation; for, luxury having made lean their
purses in an instant, they must be privatly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded
with publick treasure, and the carcase
of some Pension or Monopolie, must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
thrown to them to feed upon: neither
is this the only inconvenience which ensueth
upon their constant attendance at Court, for
they must, when there, contend with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whose train shall prove most sumptuous,
and so like two stones knocking against one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
both must necessarily lose some of their
substance; it is at Court that all their jarring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
are commenced amongst themselves, and it is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33161:122"/>
there that their plots are hatched against the
publick interest; and as a body whilst it is in
health, is still amassing humours, which will
certainly one day give life to some disease; So
your Majesty may expect that their frequent
meetings here, will one day occasion some War,
which neither ye nor they will be able to
quench; their stay at Court occasioneth the
misgovernment of their estates at home (it
being the masters eye that makes the horse fat)
and what was formerly spent at home in hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
is now spent at Court in luxury: they
bring alongst with them the sons of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and these return back to their Countrey
fraughted with vice and vanity; and so the
mony which the poor country men buy with
their sweat, must be sold for silks and spices;
and we must give forreigners things that are
necessary, returning nothing but what is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
and by this your enemies War is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
against you with your own money, and
your Natives unable themselves to war for you
because of their e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eminate imployments, which
they now use: Wherefore it is the wish of all
your Subjects, that you would command all
your Nobles home till they be called-for, and
so pull from them those firebrands of vice and
luxury, whereby they enflame the Nation.</p>
            <p>That which heightned the popular fury, was,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:33161:122"/>
that he never courted their favour, holding it
as a maxime, That seing that which made Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
formidable to their Prince, was, their too
great popularity, (for, seing Kings endeavour
so much to enthronize themselves in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
affections, they both do and look upon
all such as their rivals, who court the same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
with them) and therefore it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to believe, That to renounce any share
in the peoples affection, was the true way to
ingratiate himself with the King; intimating
thereby to his Prince, that his favour was the
dye, from which they were to expect a good
or bad game; and no doubt but this is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
way of subsistance: for, a Grandee may
subsist by the favour of the Prince, without the
favour of the people, but cannot subsist by the
people without the favour of the Prince; with
this <hi>proviso,</hi> that the Prince, upon whom he
depends, be not so silly as to depend upon his
people; for else it is not good to depend upon
him, lest when the Subject begins to open his
mouth against his Prince, the either timerous
or facile Prince, throwes his Confident in their
mouthes as a lump to stop it.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were upon the file, this
excellent Prince dyed, leaving after-ages an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
proof, that the ocean of affairs hath its
own tydes, and fair gales (which are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33161:123"/>
not commanded) and in which <hi>interims</hi>
the Prince may recreate himself with his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pleasures; for, this Prince was never one
who lost his pleasure for his business, nor his
business for his pleasure: Some tainted his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
repute with cowardishness; but since Kings,
except they be rash, are not tolerated to spend
their own bloud, it follows, that his crime was
that he was too frugal of the bloud of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
which any sound wit will interpret to
be rather love than fear; but to what purpose
should he have unsheathed the sword of his
courage, seing the sword of his wit conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his enemies; neither is it an imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to a Physician, that he prevents all diseases
so dexterously, as that he suffers not his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
to fall in any disease. Many did miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue
this worthy Prince in many things, never
considering, that it is as unbeseeming a subject
to censure the actions of his Prince, as it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
in a patient to find the pulse of his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician;
for, since Princes are often acted in what
they do from principles unknown to us, and
have aims which we are strangers to, and seing
the motives and ends of the agents, are these
things which determine our actions, it follows
that it is not only absurd, but even impossible
for subjects to discant truly upon the actions of
their Princes: and since a Deputy is only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33161:123"/>
for his carriage or miscarriage to him,
by whom he is deputed; and the Gods are
those who have commissionated Princes, it
must be undeniable that they can be arraigned
before no tribunal else, but theirs; but admit,
that really they escaped at some times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some occasions, that proves only they are
men, and who denies that? but if they must
be condemned for that, I should desire him who
hath spent his life (though private) without an
omission, to cast the first stone at them; and if
private men who have time to deliberate what
is incumbent to them to do, and few to remark
what their failings are, cannot notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plead exemption from infirmities; what
may Kings plead, who are over-charged with
businesses, mis-informed by Sycophants, and
have thousands of eyes to eye the meanest of
their escapes.</p>
            <p>To him succeeded <hi>Anaxagius,</hi> a Prince
whose perfection taught the world, that all
Princes who had devanced him, had their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
allyed with some imperfection when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with his, and by which future ages may
measure the perfection of his successours;
him providence sent to the world, fore-seeing
that these crooked times would need such a
streight patern as was his integrity: and that
innocent and vertuous souls (whom that age

would abominate) needed the patronage of
such an accomplished patron: so that it seemed
that providence hath casten his soul in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
mould, wherein none had been formed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
a person whom vertue would have
chosen to be, if birth had not already made him
a King; and whose innocent life convinced all
men, that greatness and goodness were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible;
in his heart lodged a compleat
body of accomplishednesse, only it wanted a
splean; and by him all concluded, that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as well as vice wanted not its own excess;
yet such an excess as, seing it was in him, could
not be vicious: Neither was this soul ill lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for, as the soul was a pure diamond, so it
was enchassed in a body of pure gold; his face
was both a King's face, and the face of a King;
and all the other members of his body were
such, as suited well with such a face; so that
neither could the eye in his body, nor the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his life challenge the least imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>He stept no sooner up to the Royal Throne,
than his enemies began to belch out their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
against him; considering, that if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
not the Nations of those imperfections
which they alleaged he was tainted with, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
that he would shortly refute them by
his admirable integrity; Wherefore an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian

Nobleman named <hi>Prastus,</hi> dispersed many
Papers, flush of aspersions against his Majesty,
at least, they were after search, found to be in
his cabinet: whereupon he is arraigned, and a

               </gap>h per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed;
but at last (as the worst of inventions
are alwayes the readiest) resolved, that as his
Judge, he would first condemn him; and then
as his intimate, he would intercede for him:
which he did effectuate, and procured him a
remission for that crime, for which he formerly
found him guilty. Whereat a true friend to
his Majesty much offended, did remonstrate to
the King his errour after this manner.</p>
            <p>Sir, your Majesty having once by Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Prastus,</hi> if ye now absolve him, ye
must condemn the Law which found him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y:
for, if he be guiltless, the Law did wrong
in sentencing him; and if he be guilty, the
Law is wronged in your absolving him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
admire I, to see your Nobles intercede for
him; for who knows but these in this plead
for their own case? and if either they, or any
of them, be already, or shall be hereafter found
guilty of those crimes, with which he was
charged, then they may alledge for themselves,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33161:126"/>
not only what they now alledge for him, but
likewise may triumph in this precedent; So that
in sealing a pardon for him, ye abrogate all the
penal Statutes, and layes up remissions for all
that shall have the confidence but to seek them:
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> being commanded by Nobles, who
have the Commons fully at their devotion, and
that your absence feeds this humour in them,
(the face of a King being able either to charm
subjects to a complyance, or to command them
to obedience) but what may ye expect, if they
be once connived at by those who should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them? the Law was the only mastiff which
kept the house from robbers, but if his mouth
be musled, what security may be expected, the
Law should be most rigid and best observed,
where vices are most enticing, and to which we
are most propense; wherefore, seing nothing
lures us so strongly as a nimious desire of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the desire of self-rule; nothing should
be so severely punished as Rebellion, which is
the product of both these: and if even when
Laws are execute against them, the numbers of
such offenders are numberless, what may we
expect when the Law prevaricates and sideth
with them? Sir, the lesse able men are to resist
the wrongs done them, or to foresee them,
the more grievously should the offenders be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33161:126"/>
punished; as poyson is more grievous than
murther (so that the horrour of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the best guard against these) therefore
of all treasonable plots, defaming Libels should
be most severely punished, because it is most
difficult to detect those, and when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
it is impossible almost to refute them,
neither is truth, soap sufficient to wash out the
spots which Libels make, apprehension being
enough to perswade men of what they fear.
Sir, after he is released, will not his enemies
vaunt, that either in courage ye durst not, or
in justice ye could not condemn him? so that
either ye must proclaim your self rash in the
first, or a coward in the last; And who will
as Judge condemn any attached hereafter as a
Traitor, knowing that the person so condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them will survive their sentence to prove
their enemy? And thinks your Majesty, but
<hi>Prastus</hi> will endeavour to revenge this affront?
neither will he ever ponder your courtesie in
pardoning him, but will rather eye the affront
done in once staging him: the wound may be
cured, but the cicatrice will remain; and if the
children of Traitors are often secured, often
banished, and often forfaulted; because the
Law presumes that they will yet possibly avenge
the death of their fathers: how much more
may we conclude, that a peson whilst alive
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33161:127"/>
himself, will resent his own disaster more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously.
Sir, augment not the number of your
enemies, by recalling to life <hi>Prastus,</hi> who is
already civilly dead, and remember that ye
have thorns enow in the garden of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
albeit ye plant none your self; neither
can ye expect any thanks from <hi>Prastus</hi> for this
act of superstitious clemency, for your Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
who have interceded for him, will reap
those, and he will say, that ye declared suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
your malice against him in his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
albeit thereafter ye declared your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to those intercessors in his absolution;
and, Sir, since the papers were found with him,
certainly he must be the leading card in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al
game, and the ring whereupon all the other
keys hung. And I fear, Sir, ye must one day
treat with him as your party, whom ye now
pardon as your supplicant. But, Sir, seing ye
fear the peoples envie on the one hand, and yet
dread <hi>Prastus</hi> loyalty upon the other, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
your self from both these difficulties,
keep him in prison, and in suspense, feeding him
alwayes with hopes of releasment, providing
his friends and dependants carry soberly; by
which means ye will secure him, and he will be
an hostage to you for the good behaviour of
others.</p>
            <p>The Court-favourite who bestirred himself
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:33161:127"/>
so much for <hi>Prastus,</hi> was one named <hi>Taurus,</hi>
whose honours were the donative rather of his
Prince, than of his birth; for, he was by birth
but a Gentleman, rather of great parts than a
great fortune; but being of a singular spirit,
and accute wit, was commissionated by the
Athenian Gentlemen to represent their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
at Court, and to reside there as their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,
to manage their employments against the
Nobles of their own Nation, with whom they
had then some debates: the Courtiers (who
study alwayes mens humours as much as their
business, knowing that most of men make it
their business to satisfie their own humour, and
that as men love not others so well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so they endeavour not so much to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
others as themselves) did smell at last, that
if he were created a Nobleman himself, his zeal
against the Nobility would cease with his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
wherefore finding, that his pulse did beat
highly, they perswaded the King to enroll him
amongst the Peers, which promotion cooled
soon that feaver of respect which he had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
for those who employed him, so that
he wrote home to the remanent Gentlemen,
That since he ceased to be what he was when
they commissionated him, he behoved likewise
not to act now what they had entrusted to
him, and that seing he was a Nobleman, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33161:128"/>
they would construe it to be no breach of
trust, that he antagonisted not the Nobilities
interest: for, since we are desired onely to
love our neighbours as our selves, it is presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
that self-love will alwayes be the more
prevalent; as the square is alwayes streighter
then that which is squared by it: and he
thought that he did acquit himself sufficiently
of his trust, in acquainting them of what had
past, and in fore-warning them, that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
charge did now stand empty. The
Gentlemen finding themselves thus befooled,
resolved thereafter to imploy alwayes two or
three, knowing that they could not then be so
easily bribed.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Taurus</hi> did thereafter find the King's
ear alwayes very open to him; and as he was
happy in being his Master's Confident, so each
man thought himself happy if he could but
once obtain the favour as to be his; yet his
Majesty was much mistaken in this choice, for
this wit was too subtile to be imployed in such
subtile times, and it did afterwards prove so
sharp that it cut himself; sharp wits being like
sharp razors, which should only be used by
very stedfast hands; else, if the hand vary, the
razor cannot but make some gash, which was
sufficiently verified in <hi>Taurus:</hi> for he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
so much to cheat all, and please all, that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33161:128"/>
he was in fine cheated by all, and pleased none;
for, not being able to head one faction himself,
he was alwayes zealouzed by both the other
factions, who endeavoured both to ruine him,
seing neither of them could ensure him; for as
winds that changes oft, are hated by all sailers,
because they can neither serve those who are
to go or come; So these changelings are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by all parties, neither can they ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
themselves, for whoever gains, they will
be still losers, whereas if they did constantly
adhere to any faction, they would either gain
when their interest were masters, or at least
they might secure themselves by their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
capitulation; neither are ever these chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
admitted to the cabinet-counsels of either,
nor know ever more nor what the revealers
fear not to divulge.</p>
            <p>He was admitted by his Prince to oversee
his treasure, wherein it was thought, that his
Prince was much misted, and wherein he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did likewise bewray some weaknesse; his
Princes errour was, that he should have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
one whose estate was yet to be founded
by the government of his Cash, which was all
one as if he would put his full trencher to the
mercy of a hungry dog, and especially seing it
was notory, that not only his necessity but even
his humour poused him too much to these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33161:129"/>
his own errour was, that he should have
begun to reform those errours in the State,
which, because of his poverty, and humour,
were concluded to be inventions, hatch'd rather
to enrich himself than his master: Thus flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
and thus perished <hi>Taurus,</hi> whose wit
occasioned both his advancement and his ruine,
like one thrown down those same stairs, by
which he mounted.</p>
            <p>Taxes and gabels are as necessary in the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
body, as the spleen is in the natural, yet
in both they engender many diseases; private
men thinking that lost which goes from their
own privat coffers: and as patients often judge
the moneys bestowed upon Physicians ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
after they find themselves re-instated
in their former health, attributing their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
more to Nature than to his pains; So
subjects, when they are enstated in that peace,
which the vigilancy of their Prince, aided by
their taxes, hath procured for them, judge their
taxes superfluous: never pondring in the scales
of prudence what advantage the reap by
them (which indeed the meaner sort who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
most, cannot faddom) but ruminate still
upon the losse in once paying them; yet this
natural aversion they have from them, is oft
scrued up to a greater height by the bad choice
of those who are by the Court destinated to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:33161:129"/>
collect them, who being avaritious and odious
persons, for those alwayes offer most for the
farm of them, knowing by their rigidity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
those vast sums, and so are still preferred;
which incites the people to abominate those
taxes more than formerly, knowing that not
only they go from themselves, but likewayes go
to fill the purses of these detestable miscreants;
Neither is the unequall distribution of these
taxes a small disadvantage to the Prince: for,
as it grieves a man to pay any at all, so it
grieves him yet more, that they should pay
more than others; So that whilst the friends
and clients of some Courtiers are spared, others
must bear their burdens; and so men being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prone to compute their own wrongs by
the Arithmetick of comparisons, those who
are wronged, judges their injuries so much the
greater, that they see their neighbours totally
exempted: for, albeit the Prince may satisfie
his people, in telling them the true cause of
such impositions in general, or hoodwink them
in forging reasons where there are none; yet
there is no Court-sophister so cunning as to
shew a reason why some are exempted, others
not; whereupon those who are extortioned,
they exclaim first, and then are oft-times se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by those to whom no wrong was done
at all, who hope by these vociferations to get
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:33161:130"/>
these impositions totally banished; or else do
fear, lest the case of their vexed neighbours may
one day become their own, seing they have no
leases of these favours more than others, and
which they know to be mortal, aswell as those
who indulge them; but if people would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
how that twenty or thirty crowns a year,
keep off either a forreign war, or prevents a
civil, which would moulder away the half of
their estates, if not prevented; yea, and rob the
wife of her husband, and the father of his
children; they would then condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
because they now condemn their Prince:
and it is often seen, that those Nations flourish
best, and conquer most, whose subjects are
poorest, and whose treasures are fullest, the
riches of subjects occasioning their luxury, and
their luxury kindling a war (that which is fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
kindling alwayes soonest) whereas the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the publick cash are a rampart against
publick invasions, and forceth strangers not to
interrupt the Nationall Commerce, nor to
abridge, but rather to enlarge their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>These contemptible grievances, were the
small Machines which first moved that bulkish
body of the popular fury in <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> not
against the King, but against Court-parasites,
as they pretended; the mal-contents of that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:33161:130"/>
Nation, who were then members of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
taking occasion of <hi>Anaxagius</hi> his present
necessity, being engaged by a National consent
in a forreign war, which, as it tended to the
repute of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> should have in reason
been prosecuted upon their charges; Some
thought, that these debates might have been
easily reconciled: for, many (at least some) of
these taxes, had been granted to some of <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agius</hi>
his predecessors, for their own life-time
only; the subject thinking, that the securest way
to preserve his priviledge, and the Prince think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it sufficient to satisfie his present necessity;
and considering that if his successors were able,
either by love, or power, to command their
people, that then he might prorogate that
tax for their life-time also; but if contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
his successors would be so simple, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to beg, than to acclaim these taxes as due,
that then they could never expect to obtain
them, albeit they had been granted as appan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of the Crown; wherefore seing the Senat
denyed them only as due by succession, they
thought, that the King might either have past
altogether from the superfluous desire, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
them to posterity, or at least might have
superceded the prosecution of his royal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
till a more favourable occasion, wherein
his treasure might be richer at home, his affairs
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:33161:131"/>
in better order obroad, and the grievances of
his people fewer; and till he had been more
surely fixt himself in his newly mounted throne,
and that for the present he might have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esced
to a personal concession of those taxes,
which they could not refuse him more than to
his predecessors, seing his necessities were as
(if not more) urgent than theirs. Others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
him not to passe from, but to change these
taxations, in others as lucrative, and lesse odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
such as the imposition of a tenth part of
all pleas and legal pursuits, as should be found
to be calumniatory, and intended to vex litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
their honest neighbours; which would
be both profitable to the treasury, and pleasing
to the subject; both because these taxes seem
alwayes most tolerable, which are least univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
and which the subjects may evite; and
which if they evite not, not the Prince who is
the imposer, but the subjects who are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traveeners
are to be blamed; as also, because
those taxes are for repressing of vice, and so
must be in themselves good, seing they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what is evil. He was likewise desired
to change all corporeally-penal Statutes unto
pecunial mulcts; as the cutting off of an arm,
unto so many crowns: for, by cutting off the
arm, in place of satisfying the Commonwealth
which is offended by the crime, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33161:131"/>
is yet more wronged by augmenting
the number of her beggars (such as those are,
who being mutilated of their members, cannot
employ them for to gain their bread) and so
necessitated in charity, to aliment those, who
have wronged her in malice.</p>
            <p>There is also another mean, whereby this
grievance of levying money by taxes may be
averted, and that galling sore cured by an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
remedy; which is, By heightning the Crown
Rents to the true avail, whereby the King's
purse may be fed with what growes upon his
own ground: but the Officers of State have
alwayes opposed this, as an enemy to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations;
for, if this were used, then should
not Courtiers get Lands, worth five hundred
pounds yearly, as if they amounted not to three
hundred pounds; nor should they exchange or
buy Lands from the Prince at so easie a rate, as
now they do. Princes likewise, should hear
the meanest grievance of the poorest subject,
against Toll-masters, themselves, and not refer
the cognizance of such debates to his Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who being pensioners to these money-suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
cannot but acquit themselves as favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judges, where their interest is debateable:
As also, by such Delegations; Customers are
encouraged to fleece the poor people, who, like
sheep, dare not open their mouthes, and the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33161:132"/>
Prince is robbed of the right of appellations,
which should be accounted one of the chief
Jewels of his Crown: besides this, many judge
it expedient that the Prince should, after that
such taxes are granted to him by the people, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
portions of it to those to whom he is debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
as to Ambassadors, to Merchants, to his
Navie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby he may save the expenses
of Collectors; as also he may obviate the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
and avarice of Courtiers, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorbes
it often in gifts and pensions, before the
King receives it in to his coffers. Others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the Prince should compel those, who
having farmed the customs have inriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
hereafter to be his Customers, allowing
them a petty sallary, and so to inform him how
he may inrich himself with his own, as they
have inriched themselves with what is his; and
in my own judgement I prefer either of these
wayes, to that way which hath been formerly
practised by the Lacedemonian Senate, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
some of their number to distribute what
is granted: for, either these will condescend
through complacency or fear, to follow the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the Kings inclinations, and in that case
are superfluous, or else the King and Court will
become their implacable enemies, in which case
all become factilus. There were many other
advices furnished to his Majesty, but his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33161:132"/>
pressed him not to suffer his Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
to be so obumbrated, and that he who
yeelds once ground, is alwayes followed, and is
glossed to be of kin to a coward.</p>
            <p>This grievance in the State, was seconded by
many grievances in the Church; the Church
and State being like the soul and body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the one followeth alwayes the temperament
of the other.</p>
            <p>Pretended zeal is alwayes the step-mother of
true loyalty; and such a crime as treason would
seem horrid, if it were not palliated by imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Religion; and many Statesmen, perpending
how many Religions have been at first hatch't,
meerly to tame wild humours, which albeit
they have been known to their first founders to
be the product of their own brains, yet have
thereafter been by their posterity imbraced as
sacred truths, and the violaters of them puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
as blasphemers, do therefore conclude, that
possibly, if not probably, these truths which
they now profess, are come from the same
mint-house, since they carry the same impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa;
and therefore are meerly subservient to
their secular ends: and that seing they cheat
others in making profession of their zeal for
Religion, when really they have none, nor cares
for none, Why may it not be probable, that
others have after the same way, hatch'd these
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33161:133"/>
opinions which they and others do in a manner
believe; as also these Statists see, that events
ordinarily answer their expectation, and are
consequential to their designs, which induceth
them to believe, that providence and policy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
only as do two words: as also these two
maxims, That all men have more or lesse of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
faith which obliges them to believe what
Ecclesiasticks say; and that other, That we
ought not to confine Religion within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
boundaries of reason: I say, these two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
men oft to anchor their faith upon that
which is in it self most unreasonable, and stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
men to act many things not only without
asking a reason why they should do so, but
even oft-times when there are many pregnant
reasons tendered them why they should not do
so, and when men are once engaged in these
bigot quarrels, their order is both inexprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and irresistable; they fear not death, since
they expect to be covered by the target of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
or, if they fall under Religions Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
they are confident that their cause will
canonize them; they respect not friends, nor
spare not their relations, as thinking themselves
more nearly realted to the gods than to any
else: and thus oft-times the gods are made the
patrons of rebellion, and their temples, asyles
in which the wickedest offender dare sanctuary
himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:33161:133"/>
This was one of those pretended quarrels,
which both the Lacedemonians and Athenians
incensed the people by, against <hi>Anaxagius;</hi>
the Nobles in both Nations, finding that the
Mufties did enhance all preferments, and were
beginning to seek restitution of those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
which had at first been doted to pious
uses, and which were thereafter, because of the
debordings of Churchmen, taken by the State,
and bestowed upon the Nobles, because else,
they had never condescended that old abuses
should be reformed, seing they were still dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of those Church Revenues themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that innovation; the Nobles therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that they would pull away those Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
from about the Throne, pretending Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and intending gain; alledging that these
were innovators, and did busie themselves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in State affairs.</p>
            <p>These were the main hinges of all the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian
troubles, yet they were not the sole;
for besides these may be numbred the nimious
clemency of the Prince, and the depraved facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the subjects: As for the Prince, he
was a superstitious adorer of his subjects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and desired rather to have his own, than
his subjects bloud spilt; and albeit it was oft
remonstrated to him, that the surest way to
reign, was by the scepter rather of power than
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33161:134"/>
of love: for power and austerity was in his
own hand, and depended upon none else;
whereas the scepter of love was swayed by the
hand of a popular affection, which was as vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
as themselves; and by it he was rather
their slave, than their Prince, and that his rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
(if it were a fault) yet was but personal,
and infected none besides himself; but his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
was the nursery of all those enormities
wherewith the Land swarmed; and seing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
persons sinned not, more through fear of
punishment, than through love to vertue, that
Prince who bewrayed too much clemency, did
proclaim an im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unity to all vice; and that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
were like a top which did run the fleetlier
that it was sometimes lasht; neither could that
Prince expect to be obeyed, who punished not
disobedience, notwithstanding of all those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances
made to him by his friends, and of
all the dangers which were foreseen by his pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spirit; yet he resolved st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll, rather to be good
than great, and to make the hearts of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the throne whereon he would only sit;
saying, <hi>that it was the part of a subject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
but of a King to pardon;</hi> and seing the
actions of predecessor Kings, were the register
of their successors, he resolved to learn his
posterity how to pardon; knowing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and corruption would teach them to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:33161:134"/>
well how to punish; that the gods, whose vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
they were, gloried more in this attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
than in any else, and that the King of the
Bees (which is an hierogliphick of Monarchy)
wanted a sting: these were his principles, and
proved his bane: and he who was mistaken in
nothing else, was mistaken in this; for, albeit
the gods arrogate clemency as their special at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
yet that is because the injuries of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
cannot reach them; whereas the rebellion
of subjects can, and oft doth ruine Princes:
and the omnipotent gods can at any time easily
both foresee and repair those wrongs which
they have suffered, yet a King and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may receive a wound, which none will be
able to cure; and he may, by the malice of his
adversaries, be thrown into a ditch, out of which
none can recover him: And albeit a Prince may
pardon those crimes which are committed
against his own person, yet he neither can nor
should pardon those crimes which are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
against his government and authority;
which since it is not his property, and to which
seing he is only administrator, he can no more
delapidate, than a tutor can dispense with those
who wrong his pupils estate. As to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versnesse
of the subject, it was also one of the
cards wherewith this fatal game was played;
for, albeit at first the crime resided in few, yet
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:33161:135"/>
did thereafter extend it self to all; for, albeit
the number of those who disaffected the Royal
interest in the Senate was but small, yet those
few vexed all, and perverted many of those
who were at first but neuters, and those publick
Conventions are like Watches, which will not
go soundly if but any wheele or pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order:
for as in the natural, so in the politick
body, a sore in any part is able to disquiet all
the other members: thus it is here; for those
who were dissatisfied, did so by the pestiferous
breath of their treasonable discourses, infect
others, that they became now as numerous as
they were formerly viperous; and at last dared
to ventilate those treasonable discourses even
in the Senate-house; thinking that the only
way to engage the remanent members in their
quarrels. <hi>Anaxagius</hi> challenging these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and desiring the authors should be put
in the claws of justice, this was refused him,
so that now the cancer of jealousie did begin to
spread, and one of the Senators when this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
was tabled, enveighed thus against the
Kings suite.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, seing I am to enter the lists of
this debate, I am glad I should have Justice for
my Client, and you for my Judges, not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because I know that ye are interested (albeit
that be likewise true) but because I know you
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:33161:135"/>
to be both judicious, and experienced; judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
whereby ye may know what is reasonable,
and experienced, whereby ye may know what
hath been the uncontroverted priviledge of this
House; and albeit all the Lacedemonians were
assembled, yet would I appeal by choice to your
judgments, to whom I must necessarily now
appeal, as being chosen by them to be their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives.
Gentlemen, seing Liberty is that
by which we are differenced from beasts, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
necessarily, that the more free men are, the
more they are elevated above a brutal humour,
and the more Liberty they lose, the nearer they
verge upon brutishnesse: how necessary must
Freedom be to subjects, seing without it they
are rather slaves than subjects; and of all the
Liberty which subjects can contend for, that of
debating freely before any Taxation or Law be
statuted (which is our case) is the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:
for, seing Kings are very apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and exact Taxes, without the assistance of
a Law, surely they will be more rigid, when
they will have the patronage of a Law to assist
their rigidity, and sein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> after any Statute is once
made, the subject is not free to controll it, it is
necessary that he have some freedom indulged
him in controlling it before it be statuted; and
who dare use this freedom, when it is hedged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
on all sides by fear of Treason, and of Court-hatred?
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:33161:136"/>
whereby he will certainly risk, and
may possibly lose both his life and fortune;
and albeit the marches of subject-priviledges be
already narrow, yet they will be more narrow
when such precipices are the marches; for then
none will dare to approach the outmost lines,
fearing that fall which may prove irrecoverable;
and if it shal be licite to a King (who may prove
a Tyrant, for goodnesse was never entailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly
upon any one succession) to
challenge what is here debated freely, may he
not alwayes forge some quarrel to pick out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatly,
those whom he perceiveth most able
to counterpoint him, and so shall leave us like
Wine which cannot rellish well when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are once extracted; and albeit ye be all of
you eminent, both for wit and experience, yet
there are, and shall alwayes be some more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
than others (for albeit all run well, yet all
cannot run equally) whom if the Prince who
shall then reign, do remove, their absence, and
the terrour injected upon other therethrough,
will certainly render this Judicatory altogether
useless: Remember, Gentlemen, that ye are the
Hedge, planted to defend the Garden of this
Nation from all oppressory incursions; if ye be
not pointed, and stick not near one another,
enemies will either leap over, or break through,
and especially where the design is, to steal away
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:33161:136"/>
the golden apples of the subjects priviledges,
and seing your antcessors, have preserved for
you this freedom, as a patrimony, endeavour
to derive it to your posterity; neither do ye
prove banquerouts, of what your fathers have
been so parcimonious; and as ye all endeavour
to accumulate riches for them, so endeavour
also to secure their priviledges, without which
their estates are of small value.</p>
            <p>This discourse did stir up those sparkles of
rancour, which lay formerly smothered in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their breasts; and they concluded, that
it was both fit and just, to owne and intercede
for those who were challenged; and at last,
finding, that they could not prorogate their sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves, without the Kings special ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and consent; and finding that their many
and great projects could not be perioded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some considerable time, they resolved to
buy a lease of some years liberty to sit, with
the grant of a taxation; and the rather, because
they considered, that they had most unjustly
irritated his Majesty already, as also, that these
Taxes would in fine be taken, if they were not
given; wherupon their seance is continued by
the King, and the taxes are immediatly exacted
by their special approbation; yet so, that they
inform the people every-where under-hand,
that their assent was extorted from them, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:33161:137"/>
that such a small morsel would rather sharpen
than satisfie the appetites of the insatiable
Courtiers.</p>
            <p>Now fear of being punished in some, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information
in others, did alienate their minds
fully from their obedience; Loyalty was now
accounted slavery, and the meanest act of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
tyranny; yet businesses were not so
ripened yet, as that the leading men durst yet
appear publickly, but the prologue of this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie
was committed to the people, who in a
tumultuary way were sent with extravagant
Petitions, sometimes against the Favourits, and
at other times against the Mufties, the people
being like the Sea, which the Nobles, Priests,
and Wits, like so many Winds make stormy or
calme at their pleasure: In <hi>Athens</hi> the women
were ordinarily imployed in such expeditions,
knowing that both their number and sex would
plead immunitie for them from any deserved
punishment. And because their simplicity like
the straw could kindle soonest; neither could
they be repressed, either by harrongues or the
sword, the ordinary calmers of such tempests,
for as to reason they could not patient so long,
as to hear it, nor ponder it so maturely, as to
understand it; neither would any man staine
the lustre of his sword with the blood of a
woman: Yet <hi>Autophilus</hi> the Vice-roy in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:33161:137"/>
               <hi>Athens,</hi> was desired to punish the husbands of
those irregular women, knowing that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigated
them to, or at least connived at their
disorders; either of which was a crime which
merited incarceration: as also, the husbands
punishment would easily tame these reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
creatures; Or else, to lay fast some of the
plodding Nobles, whom they might keep as
hostages for those heteroclite factions. But
<hi>Autophilus,</hi> as we shall hear afterwards, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
too much their projects, to punish their
courses; for he, hating the Mufties secretly,
did desire both the King and them to act what
might most incense the people, and so made
their own actions their burriers. The first mark
at which they did shoot those darts of popular
fury, was on <hi>Basilicus,</hi> a Lacedemonian (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the way to weaken <hi>Anaxagius,</hi> was to
waste the bloud of his principal veins) upon
him they fastened the teeth of their envie, and
it must be treason against the people, not to
punish him as a traitour; his accusation is
founded upon some excerpts gotten from one
of his Majesties Secretaries; but what needs
proofs, where death is once decreed? His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
rigidity, which could never be exerced
against his enemies, must be now burrier to his
friends, like an unaturall heat in the body which
can consume it self, but cannot consume the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:33161:138"/>
meat which should rather be consumed by it.</p>
            <p>When any thing falls to pieces, it is surely near
ruine; and when a Nation doth by faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
two, it will probably at last become none
at all: wherefore when the Nobility doth like
an hair, begin to branch it self; the King, like a
skilfull Barber, should crop it in that place, for
certainly the hair it self cannot then grow lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
Factions are those State-convulsions,
which can hardly be cured except they be soon
adverted to, and after the ring-leaders of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
have once engaged many innocent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in their quarrel, it is both difficult and
dangerous to repress them; and they being the
roof under which many poor innocents have
retired, ye cannot pull down the roof without
smooring those who are under it.</p>
            <p>Another great inconvenience in factions (as
there is nothing convenient in them) is, That
where the Standard is once erected, all the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
and discontented persons run to it, and
must be both received and protected, both to
requite their kindness, and to invite others, So
that these prove not only the sanctuaries, but
even the encouragers of malefactors; and as
that person cannot but be concluded distracted,
who dashes his one hand or foot against the
other; So, that State must be thought demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
wherein the one half clashes against the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:33161:138"/>
other; <hi>Lacedem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> joyntly, were
both disjoynted now by factions in their
Church, some adhering to their old rites and
ceremonies, whereupon they were called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnists;</hi>
others were perswaded to imbrace
the new, were named <hi>Iovists;</hi> worshiping <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
because they conceived him most rational,
albeit not so old as <hi>Saturn,</hi> and who influenced
most strongly upon Princes; these last, were
both more zealous, and more numberous, and
did at last impropriate to themselves all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Nations, whereupon many flocked
to them, making Religion a mine, out of which
they expected to dig gold in abundance.</p>
            <p>In the State of <hi>Athens</hi> there were likewise
two factions, who like two twins strugling in
the womb of the Commonwealth, tortured
vehemently their miserable mother; the one
faction was led by <hi>Autophilus,</hi> a man of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
prudence, and who had even from his
youth suckt the breasts of State-education, and
had so familiarized himself with its mysteries,
that they were become now no wayes mystical
to him; but whose misfortune it was, that his
fortune could rise no higher, except it had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed
preference with the Royal Throne; and
that is the unhappiness of those happily born
subjects, that naturally ambition elevates them
alwayes above their own level, and yet their
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:33161:139"/>
present state admits of no higher to which they
can pretend, without rivalling their Prince. So
ordinarily the eminentest of subjects, are born
either to be fools or traitors; from which they
can hardly be diverted, except some forreign
imployment abroad, or formidable Prince at
home, either feed or starve that genial humour:
This made many alledge, that <hi>Autophilus</hi> did
in thoughts design himself to be Prince of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi>
intending to marry <hi>Anaxagius</hi> neece,
and by inveighing against the Queen, to get all
her children declared bastards; and his sisters
other children declared rebels, by engaging
them in a war against the Nation: but these
projects were so improbable, and so treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that none could assent thereto, but were
rather construed to be forged by his enemies,
than to be his own, either wishes or hopes.</p>
            <p>The other faction was founded by <hi>Phanose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
a man of a deep reach, and one who might
have shared in the highest imployment, if he
could but have expected it patiently; but he,
like many others, did spill, by drawing violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to him, what he might have had entire, if he
had waited till it had been bestowed upon him
willingly: Many characterized him to be a man
of more wit than vertue, and of more cunning
than of either, many followed him (as was
said) meerly because they hated the other; so
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:33161:139"/>
that he stood more engaged to the others mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
than he did to his own abilities:
those who adhered to him, were such as could
signifie nothing without him, and yet who with
his assistance were successfull enough, yea, and
too much; like ciphers, which without a figure
signifie nothing, yet when joyned to a figure
makes the figure signifie more than it could do
alone: Some in the body of this faction acted
the mouth, and were fitted for nothing else;
others the hands, to execute what they had
commanded; and some the feet, to run where
any thing was to be acted, till at last these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts got adjoyned to them a Nose, which,
because of its bignesse, overshadowed the face,
and made the rest seem terrible; which, as is
rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> did thereafter fall by the
pox; yet possibly these are but jealousies, and
not proofs which can be adduced against him.</p>
            <p>Both these factions fomented the increase of
the <hi>Iovist</hi> faction, and were but like small ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
running in to swell up that ocean: for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they differed in their aims, yet seing they
aimed both at the ruine of the <hi>Saturnists,</hi> they
concurred in that who could concur in nothing
else; like two travellers, who albeit their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
or homes, be far separated, do ride toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whilst the way is the same; Yet the <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vists</hi>
favoured more <hi>Phanosebus</hi> faction, both
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:33161:140"/>
because they were most favoured by them, as
also because they jealoused <hi>Autophilus</hi> to be
too subtile.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Phanosebists there was one
<hi>Oranthus,</hi> a Gentleman whom hundreds of
years cannot parallel, as if Nature needed so
much time to bring forth such an Elephantine
vertue, and whereof a Nation could lodge but
one, as if it were not able to bear two such
great burdens of worth; this Gentleman was
in affection a <hi>Iovist,</hi> and persisted so, but hated
in the end the <hi>Phanosebists,</hi> as persons whose
interests was their god, and whose godlinesse
was their gain: for, finding whom they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to share the Provinces amongst themselves,
under pretext of regulating abuses, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
insurrections, did forsake them, because
he found that they had forsaken their duty,
and refusing their proffers, refused them also
his assistance; thinking it Treason rather than
Reason, to assist them who resisted their Prince,
and persisted in their Rebellion: Yet did he
alwayes love the <hi>Iovist</hi> interests, albeit he hated
some of their darlings, and relinquished not
their party, albeit he relinquished their persons;
wherefore finding his danger both imminent
and eminent, he posted to <hi>Anaxagius,</hi> and was
by him commissionated to command his Army
in <hi>Athens;</hi> but before he went thither, he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:33161:140"/>
assembled his friends, and disclosed thus to
them all the mysteries that had past.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> State-designs are like herbs,
which cannot be known at their first starting-up;
and errours may be pardoned, if they be
not continued; especially, where the pretexts
are so specious, and the dissimulation so deep:
this is both our case, and our misfortune, and
I may say our misfortunate case; we have been
nose-led by some, whose ends have been to end
our loyalty, and to plot the ruine of him who
hath kept them and this Nation from ruine ever
hitherto; they pretend piety, but who can be
so childish as to think that these would open so
liberally both their veins and purses for that in
publick, for which they would not open their
very mouths in private? and how can we think
that those who would not bestow scarce a
crown in charity, or an hour in prayer, clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and pardoning of others, which are the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
of Religion, will bestow all their time
and estates for the maintenance of what is but
ceremonial. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> let us not give suck to
these bastard projects, nor credit to these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
discourses, but let us both condemn
and resist these intentions, let us pay our Prince
the tribute of respect, and respect such as will
become his tributaries; they have not yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized
the affection of the Nation, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:33161:141"/>
to get them disaffected, and let our
swords cut the knot of such plots: the design
is somewhat practicable, because the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
always be cheated; for time will decipher
cheats, and such vast projects cannot be prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
without vast expences, and many will
weary of paying those who are traytors, who
would never weary to be traytors themselves;
for certainly, all men have, as they are men, some
inclinations of being loyal and honest; and if
they unpath themselves from it, it is to follow
the tract of some golden or gilded vice; which
if they misse, they will presently return: and
it is impossible that where all seek, that all can
find, especially where there is so little to be
found by any, and where the Grandees will
endeavour to enhance all: They are likewise
divided, and the one may help to destroy the
other, whilst we are endeavouring to destroy
both. <hi>Anaxagius,</hi> against whom they war,
is so good, and his cause so just, that it were
an offence against the immortal gods to think
that they will not favour him, and blesse it;
and albeit they be numerous, and we few, yet
let us not be discouraged; for desperat and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
exploits flourish alwayes most first, whilst
the actors have not time nor conveniency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon what they are doing; but at last
when that fervour is abated, their honesty will
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:33161:141"/>
encrease; Our cause is honourable, seing it is
in defence of him who is the source of honour,
and we shall finde our recompence payed us,
both by our Consciences and our King; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
shall admire our memories, and erect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
of our loyalty; and what we do by
our swords, shall be done over again by the
pens of learned Historians. But to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
shall I enlarge my self, seing I know you
to be Gentlemen, whose ancestors have been
the ramperts of this Nation, and loyal subjects
to their Prince? Is it possible that ye are heirs
to all their estates, and to none of their worth?
or, may ye expect obedience from your yeomen,
who will not defer it to your Prince, to whom
ye are tyed by many oaths, whereas they are
tyed by none to you? and under whom your
predecessours have lived hundreds of years,
whereas theirs have lived under you but since
yesterday; Can ye be so rigid exacters from
others, who are so bad payers your selves? Let
us then hazard our lives before they be taken
from us; or at least, lest we live to say, that
we have lived too long, as having out-lived the
freedom of our Nation, and security of our
Prince?</p>
            <p>All admired, and the most part allowed this
discourse, and condescended to list themselves
amongst his followers, and to run the common
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:33161:142"/>
hazard with him, knowing that the hazard
could be but either small, or at least glorious,
where the Conducter was both so skilfull and
so generous.</p>
            <p>This good cause was followed with good
success; for, the Athenians considering, that
the raising of an Army was requisite, if not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
seing that which is unnatural cannot
be maintained without violence, and thinking,
that the only way to make themselves formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to their Prince (those capitulations being
most favourable which are written with the
point of the sword) and most fit, seing it would
remunerate their friends and dependances, as
being a mean to afford them salaries and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
did raise a numerous Army well
equipped: For horse-courses which had been
alwayes much frequented, both out of pleasure
and policy in that Nation, had stored them with
excellent horses: And surely that Nation is
happy, where trains consist most in gallant men
and able horses, which may serve aswell in war
as in peace; rather than in laquies, who are
both roguish and undiscreet; and in coaches,
which are both expensive, effeminate and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
and which habituate men so, that they
can neither ride, nor suffer themselves to be
exposed to the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igues of wind or rain: that
Nation was likew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se well armed, each mans
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:33161:142"/>
house being an arsenal, and each arsenal able to
arm numbers of men; which some keeped for
pleasure, but the most part for intestine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
for to be neighbours, and to be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
were alwayes joyned: Peace having
thus prepared the materials, it was easie for
war to arm it self, which did afterwards like
the prodigal, spend totally that great stock
which its predecessor had laid up for it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was their Courage wanting more than
Arms; for none was so niggard of his life, as
to spare it at this occasion: Yet this chariot
of war had other wheels besides that of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
for, young men went out of gallantry,
old men out of zeal, and both out of avarice;
knowing that <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where they were to
march, was a rich meadow, where they might
all feed abundantly, leaving their host nothing
but their leanness to pay their reckoning; so
that they seemed like bees to go out of their
barren hive, to suck honey from the flowers of
the neighbouring gardens; this was the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
whistle wherewith their cunning hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
called these grayhounds to the prey; and
it is oft the greatness of the prize which makes
the goodnesse of the cause. After these were
all marched, <hi>Oranthus</hi> entereth the Athenian
bounds, backt by none but by the Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
which made his cause good, but not
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33161:143"/>
his party strong; Yet at last some from all
corners flocked to him, the Royal Standard
being an Orator eloquent enough, to perswade
those who could hear with loyal ears, and
who reverenced not their estates as their King,
thinking gold the prince of hearts as it is of
mettals: It was reported by some, that the
<hi>Iovists</hi> had placed domestick Priests in each
family, for the service of their houshold gods,
to remark mens actions, and to convince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or at least to tutor the wives, by whom
they might thereafter know the husbands; and
that this restrained somewhat the confluencing
of the subjects to <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nthus:</hi> but these were
rather personall prejudices, than true conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Others alledged, that <hi>Oranthus</hi> pride
deterred others from joyning with him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a person, who as he was in worth equalled
by none, so who in pride surpassed all: But
that likewise was a mistake, for what was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in him pride, was really prudence; for he
considered prudently, that those who kept a
distance with all, will be tempted to reveal
their secrets to none, and will have time and
convenience to canvasse fully what is fittest to
be done upon every emergent; However, if
this was his fault, he was happy in being taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with no other fault but this; and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in his carriage to his equals, was compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33161:143"/>
with the moderation used by him to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours;
for, as they branded him with the
one, so they could not but allow him the other:
It was admirable how a body inured to much
ease, could endure so much trouble: for, in
spight of his former custom, he accustomed
himself to dispense with what pleasure he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
formerly, shewing the world, that as his
spirit was of gold, so his body was of brasse,
and it appeared that he had changed his body
as well as his opinion; or rather, that his
body resolved rather to suffer the hardest of
hardships, before it would suffer so rare a soul
as his was to change its dwelling, and quit its
imbracements; grasse was his best bed, stones
his ordinary pillows, and the heavens his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
cannopy; his drink was water, and his
diet opportunity; his counsellors few, and his
enemies many, and yet it appeared that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
kept those from him, meerly to shew
that without these he could conquer, and that
<hi>Oranthns</hi> alone was strong enough for these
many.</p>
            <p>The Senate of <hi>Athens</hi> resolved to fight him
before he became stronger, whereupon they
dispatch'd some Forces under the conduct of
<hi>Phanosebus,</hi> who was no sooner seen than
vanquish'd; as if he had come not to fight, but
to render only, he himself whose leggs was
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33161:144"/>
armed with swiftness, did run as if he had
pawned his life against death, who should run
fastest: After this many followed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
who would not have followed <hi>Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
and seing fortune came to encamp with
him, many came to incamp with fortune. It was
thought folly in <hi>Phanosebus,</hi> whose strength
lay mainly in his wit, to hazard in those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
where rather strength than wit was
requisite; for, as some said, it was an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
a Statesman to act the Souldier, as it
was to a Physician to practise in Law, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where the adversaries valour was redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and that by so doing he wronged himself
without wronging his enemies; for thereafter
many said, that he was neither stout nor fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
whereas if he had stayed at home, he
might have salved his repute in both, and might
have kept himself as a Reserve, making his
friends, after they should have been often beat
without him, hope that they should conquer
when he went alongst with them; and seing
fortune is half play-maker in all humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is a great disadvantage for a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker
to be thought misfortunate: but
surely his motive was, that he feared lest <hi>Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
should flourish too much, and that it
would be too late resisting him when he would
become both more skilful, and more famous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:33161:144"/>
This victory was seconded by many others,
so that he conquered as oft as he fought; yea,
rather he could not fight without conquering;
all his actions were maturely deliberated, and
speedily executed, and so could not be but suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfull:
His Army consisted partly of natives,
partly of forreigners, the one whereof did
emulate the other in courage, and so could not
both but act gallantly, seing gallantry was their
motive: The forreigners behoved to fight,
knowing that else they had not any where else
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>refuge themselves, in having neither their
own homes, nor the houses of their friends to
shelter them, and would not flee because they
knew not where. The natives were assured of
the gallows, if they ensured not themselves by
their courage; and their quarter was no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but a respit from death; not a preserving
them from the sword, but a reserving them for
the block, that so ignominy might be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves, and terrour left upon their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishers.</p>
            <p>Many of that Nation exclaimed against the
cruelty used by his Souldiers, and their other
exorbitances; but these adverted not when
his Army wanted pay, and so he was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to allow them plunder; neither should
they have so exclaimed against him upon that
account, seing their relenting in coming in to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:33161:145"/>
him did oblige him to imploy strangers, whose
enormities were the only crime of his well-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
Army: neither was it strange to see
those who were starved in the hils and deserts,
eating oft nothing but roots, and drinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but water, drink and feed somewhat libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
when they came where they might have
it, and even exerce some cruelty towards those
who caused those their many miseries; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
a General may govern men, yet cannot
he make men, not alter their inclinations<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and

               </gap> so
reconcile different humours, nor govern so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
rash and impudent Souldiers, as he did;
his Army was divided in factions, and opposed
by factions, yet did salve the inconveniency of
the one, and guard wise against the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of the other, making himself an arbiter
when they were at variance amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and a target when they were assaulted
by their enemies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phanosebeans</hi> and the <hi>Autophilists,</hi> were
vying all this while for precedency, the Clergy
and Cities adhering to the <hi>Phanosebeans,</hi> many
of both being stipendiated by him, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry following <hi>Autophilus;</hi> their
main aim being to repress the Mufties, thinking
to stop there; but it is hard for any who tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
down the hill of vice, to stop till he have
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:33161:145"/>
once run down to its root; for vice is none of
those manageable horses who can be stopped in
the midst of their carrier; and since man is
naturally so depraved, as that he cannot abstain
from what is ill; what may we expect of him
when his depraved humour is fortified by these
depraved habits? and many have gone aside
from their way, intending presently to return,
who having once strayed, were never able to
return to it; and the immortal gods deal most
justly with mortal men in this: for, to think
that men can be good at pleasure (much more
then, to think that he is able to exchange vice
for vertue in an instant) is to exalt man upon
the pinacle of arrogances temple; and if the
event answered the expectation, besides the
original depravednesse of mans humour, man
should likewise be invited both to be wicked,
and to continue in his wickedness by this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
and succes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>full encouragement; neither
should goodnesse be taken as a donative from
heaven, but should be esteemed such a flower
is might grow in the baddest soil upon earth.</p>
            <p>Albeit then the <hi>Autophilists</hi> intended not to
spin out the threed of their opposition to their
Prince to such a length as the <hi>Phanosebeans</hi> did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet, being once engaged, the hatred they bore
some privatly-well-affected persons, and their
desire to overreach the <hi>Phanosebeans,</hi> did oblige

whereupon knowing, that all extraordinary
changes must be effectuated by extraordinary
means, he alledgeth that he is pang'd by his
conscience for his but luke-warm affection to
the <hi>Iovist</hi> faction; and sending for some of
their Grandees, he entreated them to suffer
him to appear in sackcloth before the Altars,
to hear sacrifice offered there for himself to
atone this sin; they thinking his remorse to be
heart-deep, agree to the motion; So that <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
is now admitted to prostrate himself before
the Altar, in the presence of many thousands,
whom the extraordinarinesse of the action, as
a bell, had called hither, where with all pomp
and solemnity imaginable, he is absolved from
that crime; and is permitted to harrangue the
by-standers, whose hearts, like good ground;
were soon softned by those showres of tears,
which deluged from his eyes, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that he was now, because of his piety,
incantonized amongst the gods, so that now

the <hi>Iovists</hi> (glad to bridle the one faction with
the fear of the other, and willing that they
should emulate one another, hoping thereby
to aggrandize their own respect) did carress
both almost equally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phanosebus</hi> would never imbrace any charge
himself from the Senate, knowing that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he would be obliged to appear always him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to subscrive Papers, wherein the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

This discourse being ended, the Executioner
first hanged, and then quartered him; and the

            <p>
               <hi>Anaxagius</hi> affairs in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> were by
this time wholly ruined; for, the specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of liberty being displayed as a banner by
the Senate, all the Commons rendezvouzed
themselves under it; and albeit their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and experience did therafter inform them
sufficiently of their errour, yet fear of being
punished, obliged them to continue in their
crime, telling them in the ear, that albeit their

            <p>
               <hi>Anaxagius</hi> own servants likewise did sing
their own parts in this treasonable song; for
they (as they pretended, when challenged by

break away a piece off her, whereon they may

to see the Devil, who cheated the judgement
before the commission of the sin, cheat the
conscience after it is once committed; and by
such impious sophistry, defend his cheats against
the just accusations of piety and duty. These
miscreants did pick nightly his Majesties poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,

some auxiliary Forces against them, did by
their Ambassadors buy with considerable sums
<hi>Sophander's</hi> friendship, representing likewise
covertly, that such a War would pick his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
purse, leaving little or nothing to his
friends and favourites, who otherwise might
expect largely; and that it was the interest of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> to see <hi>Lacedemon</hi> in such a hubbub.
They likewise treated with the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to advance them Arms,
promising that they should have liberty of
fishing in their Seas, without any toll: a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which the Corinthians feared <hi>Anaxagius</hi>
would both question and recall.</p>
            <p>The Sun of <hi>Anaxagius</hi> power was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to set, the Nobles, of whom his Army
consisted mostly in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> were, like flies,
returning in the cool of the evening; and many
attributed his ruine to their military disorders,
and unskilfulness: for, each of them behoved
to be preferred to some command in the Army,
which occasioned, that those who had followed
martial imployments abroad formerly, were
constrained to sue for imployments from the
Senate; as also the jars and emulations which
were amongst themselves, destroyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
unity, and made the Souldiery fear, that
the house which had so many rents, would one

               </gap>y fall; and that those would prove in end
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:33161:150"/>
wisest, who retired soonest: But contrariwise
the Senate governed their Army most prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
preferring experienced Souldiers to the most
eminent charges, and proveanting them most
opportunely upon all occasions; for, having
the City at their devotion, it did suppediate
them both with money, pitch, cordage, and
other materials for their Fleet, and by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Fleet they victualled their Army
in all places: whereas <hi>Anaxagius</hi> Army desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of such necessaries, were constrained to
prey upon the Country, and thereby lost total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their affections. The Senate likewise doted
their Army with all priviledges imagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able; for
they licensed the Apprentices of all Cities, and
of all Trades, to serve in their Army, and there
to fulfil those years for which they were bound
to their Masters; As also they recompensed
with Offices in the State all such as had merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well of the State in the Army, and received
their lame Souldiers in hospitals, and pensioned
some others who were more eminent, and
erected tombs for those who were killed in
their service; punishing severely all who either
openly or covertly promoted or favoured <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axagius</hi>
interest.</p>
            <p>The Senate weary at last of being either
authors or spectators of these bloudy conflicts,
which hapned daily betwixt <hi>Anaxagius</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:33161:150"/>
and theirs, resolved to patch up these
differences, and to seek now by treaty what
they formerly would have extorted by war;
perceiving that they expended more treasure in
the pursuit of their priviledges, than they could
gain by them, albeit granted: and that <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agius</hi>
successors would re-assume what <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agius</hi>
would be obliged now to concede; which
the Army perceiving, and concluding that
their gain would be hereby totally drained;
for the intended peace behoved to infer a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
of their Forces: and albeit an Act of
Amnesty would lull them asleep in a promised
security, yet old quarrels would be one day
wakened by the malice of those, whose friends
and kinsmen they have cut down; or by the
avarice of Courtiers, who would endeavour to
render them criminal, because their estates were
opulent: Wherefore they concluded, that it
was fit to possess themselves of <hi>Anaxagius</hi>
person, that so a peace should not be concluded
but at their pleasur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or at least if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that it should be to their advantage;
and that any courtesie should be conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, might be taken as a donative bestowed
by them. These were the pretexts which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus,</hi>
General of the Lacedemonian Forces,
used, to induce his Souldiers to an assent in
this particular, but his thoughts levelled at
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:33161:151"/>
another mark; for he was at this time laying
the foundations of his future greatness, a stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
which his subtility and boldness did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
rear to an unspeakable height.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Autophilus</hi> did now finde by the designs
broached, that he and his adherents would be
smothered under the ruine of <hi>Anaxagius</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if it did once fall; and that those
Merculiasts (for so were they termed who
owned the Army, because they worshipped
<hi>Mercury)</hi> intended to pluck up the branches
of Nobility, with the root of Monarchy, did
now condemn his first projects as disloyal in
themselves, and, as prejudicial to his own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance;
whereupon he addresseth himself to
<hi>Anaxagius,</hi> and gets a Commission from him
to levy thirty thousand men in <hi>Athens,</hi> which
he effectuated accordingly; for, his faction,
which was numerous in it self, was swelled up
greater by the concourse of those who affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated
<hi>Oranthus;</hi> and who found that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosebus</hi>
would have massacred them, if they
had not refuged themselves at this Altar. But
both the one and the other were animated by
the horrid usage which their Prince did meet
with from the Mercurialists: those who had
been loyal formerly continuing so still; and
those who had been disloyal, thinking their
zeal for him now, the only way to deprecate
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:33161:151"/>
his wrath, and satisfie their own consciences.</p>
            <p>This Army marches, carrying alongst with
it both all the warriours and warlike furniture
of the Nation; and, as providence had taugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that Nation formerly, that few, assisted by it,
might beat many; So it taught them now, that
many, when resisted by it, might be beat by
few; teaching in both, that it useth numbers
rather as a shadow than a sword, imploying
sometimes those, lest ordinary means should
altogether be neglected, and vanquishing often
without these, lest ordinary means should be
too much relyed upon; and least, in both, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
patience should be omitted. But these
proved like the Witches, who can do ill, but
cannot do good; and albeit they had raised the
Devil of Rebellion, yet could they never lay
him again, the heavens disdaining that any of
its infant projects should de nursed by those
who were once its enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phanosebus</hi> had all this while opposed this
design, not but that he wished the releasment
and enlargement of his Prince; but hating that
he should be released by the <hi>Autophilists,</hi> estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
every thing lawfull or unlawfull, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
as it could advance or rebute that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
Wherefore after the <hi>Autophilists</hi> were
marched, he levyes some inconsiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who had lyen at home, like some chaff in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:33161:152"/>
the corner of a barn, after the wheat is all
carried away. These were with much cunning
trysted to the fields, not out of any intention
to fight (for if they had dreamed of that, they
had never moved) but as if it had been only
to recreate themselves; yet then they were
once mustered, they mustered all their courage
in their faces, which they were necessitated to
do, because their hearts refused to lodge such
an unruly guest; and seing their breasts were
already filled with golden hopes, they judged
it folly to fill them with thoughts of steel: thus
they resolved to conquer all, because they saw
none to be conquered; and cartelled by their
eyes all who would swear that they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arms nor courage: Here stood one in
arms, complaining that his iron coat was too
stiffe; and besides him stood his fellow, whose
armour was armed with rust, which desired to
be left at home to recruit the plough as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
pleading exemption, as not being betwixt
sixty and sixteen, and so not obliged to go to
the fields, but by twenty years older than both;
telling him how they had fifty years since hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his fathers flight, who because thereof
had vowed never to bring them abroad again:
and withall that the bearing armour was too
weighty an imployment for a clown, but whilst
they are thus busied, an old wife, or rather one
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:33161:152"/>
so old as that it could not be known whither
she was a wife; complained to a Captain, that
her son had stollen away from her, a thing
wherein her hens hatched their eggs, which
he called a steel-cap, and which was at that
present upon his head; which the young Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
slighted, calling her old hagg, and telling
her that they were vexed in defending her and
such others from their enemies: whereat she
became inraged, and commanding her old
hands by a young heart, pulls him from his
saddle, from which the least pull could easily
have invited him, the saddle it self disdaining to
serve such a childish master: The field where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they mustered appeared a comedy, wherein
cowards acted gallantry; but that gallantry
was defectively monstruous, because it wanted
hands, yet they seemed Basilisks, who could
kill with their eyes, which seemed granades,
from which they did shoot thousands of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
looks, their mouthes were the Arsenals
where they kept all their arms, yet their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lodged in their legs, which had proven their
trusty friends in many other occasions: When
they were all thus convocated, the trumpet
breathes them out a march, but, alas, their
unexperienced horses begun to dance at such
musick (where those danced best who had
learned least) and did instantly send their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:33161:153"/>
to the ground, as if they wished them to
dance there also, seing they could not dance on
horseback: their Commanders thought, that
they had lighted to kisse hands with the ground
their old acquaintance, with which these
clowns had spent most of their time; but alas,
they, poor creatures, did lie there, perswaded
by fear, that they had been overthrown by their
enemies, and like assaulted travellours, who
throw away to the robbers their purses before
they should be violently taken from them, were
breathing out their souls willingly to death,
fearing lest it would open another passage than
their mouth to facilitate their esc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pe. But
amongst those many, who were all remarkable,
there was one whom fear had marked for its
own head-quarter; this fellow had gotten
from his wife a linen bag, with some raw flesh,
which had sealed its impressa in bloud upon the
outside of the bag; which the coward percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in this twilight of fear, imagined that it
had been tinctured with his own bloud, which
occasioned his present death: here lay one
opening his eyes, and presently closing them
again, fearing, lest fear should wound them,
if they were not armed with his eye-lids:
only in this playing the gallant, that he could
not endure to see either himself, or his friends
wronged: over him crosse-wayes, did lie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

crossed extreamly by his own timer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from them was a third, who had covered his
face with a mask of paleness, desiring not to be
known, and hoping that none could expect to
find life, where no bloud was to be seen, and
had given order to his looks, to tell those who
had searcht for his life, that it was gone to the

yet at last they agreed to carry a sheep in it, to
testifie the innocency of their cause, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

things thus prepared, they take their horses,
and are advised by him to make them observe
Lent, in not giving them flesh for fourty dayes,
as a punishment for dismounting their masters:
and now these bastard sons of <hi>Mars,</hi> upon
whom he had bestowed rodomantade words
and looks; being ready to march, they, by the
help of a stone, mount their weak horses, being
sadled with straw, and bridled with hair, and
seemed at every step to have wagered, whether
their horses did rise higher from the ground, or
they from their saddles; resembling a young
Gentleman, who at his first setting to Sea, is
deserted by his feet, and tossed by the merciless
waves, looking on horseback like patients on
a close-stool: thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>grech fruit were flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in their march, tumbled up and down
by their unskilfulness in horsmanship, like the
young bud of tender branches by a gentle gale
of Northern wind; the more the horses vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the nearer they clapt their spurs to them,
but the poor beasts who understood no more
such imbracements, than their beastly masters
did understand the Art of Horsemanship, did,
by kicking and flinging, show their displeasure:
whereupon a witty fellow told some of them,
That it was no wonder that their irrational
beasts could not abide to be spurred cruelly by
their masters, seing the masters themselves
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:33161:154"/>
could not endure (though rational) to be spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
gently to their duty by their Prince: Which
observe touched them so nearly, that they
vowed never to fight any till that fellow were
removed; which behoved to be obeyed, albeit
their General entreated them to permit him to
stay, to learn them how to sit on horseback:
which was refused, whereof the Gentleman
seemed very glad, fearing that if ever they did
engage with their enemies, they should either
leave him, else he behoved to leave his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
But before I leave this discourse, I must
tell you a pretty jest of a Gentleman, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appointed an Officer in the Army, was as
dejected thereat as if they had condemned him
to fight, albeit in the justest of quarrels, a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
which he judged too great for any
crime; yet home he comes, and imparts the
whole matter to his wife, who entreats him
not to accept it, telling him how unfit he was
for that charge, having fewed out his courage
to his tenants, and that his complexion was so
sweet, that he would not abide to stand where
blood was shed. Notwithstanding whereof, he
entreated her to let him see a calf killed, which
she denyed him, swearing that it would make
such a noise, that few were so stout as not to
tremble at it; but that to experiment his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
she was willing to let him see a chicken
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:33161:155"/>
murdered; yet, to satisfie his desire, he beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to see a calf killed: so the poor beast (I
mean the calf) was brought to the utter court,
where the Gentleman stood beholding it, and
there seeing the knife in its throat, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poor beast bellow so sadly, the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
Gentleman, seemed to die for comrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with it.</p>
            <p>By this time the Athenian Army in <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
under the conduct of <hi>Autophilus,</hi> was
advanced as far as the heart of the Country,
but their discipline was as bad as their courage
was great: for, some by drinking, others by
plundering, lost both the affection of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,
and their own senses, which
seemed to leave them, because they were so
disorderly masters, who, to satisfie their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
drowned them at all occasions, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Anaxagius</hi> sufficiently obliged by them,
if they drank his health; And surely he had
been so, if they had thirsted as much for Blood
as for Wine, and imployed their hands as well
as their cups, bestowing that health in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
which they debauched in the tavern, and
which ominated to the Lacedemonians their
extirpation, and deterred them from joyning
with them; they intended not to fight that
season, expecting that <hi>Anaxagius</hi> wel-wishers
would adjoyn themselves as limbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they would not over-charge the Country

they heard that he was upon his march:
sending the one half running back to tell the

them so oft formerly, and were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
to see it in their own hands, which they
feared so much whilst it was in his.</p>
            <p>We may perceive by this defeat, how nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
confidence is alwayes waited upon by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
disasters, and how the gods disappoint
those who appoint for themselves boundlesse
honours, which they assure themselves so of,
as that they think that fate cannot rob them of
them; and it is just that prudence minde them
who will not minde it, and thinks it deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to their valour to fight under its colours,
scorning deliberation as superfluous, where the
conquest is certain, and thinking it cowardise
to doubt, where courage concludes the project
infallible: this is that vice which makes youth
madness, and one Statesman worth twenty
Souldiers, and causeth the look of a wise man
conquer more than the sword of a fool; and
he who wears not his sword in the sheath of
prudence, but keeps it alwayes naked, will
doubtless one day cut himself by it; and will,
when conquered, be hung up as a trophee of
deliberations true worth, in fames immortal
temple. Prudence is courage's eye, without
which it is blinde, and so may be easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by what is weaker, and will stumble
where there is no difficulty; this was partly
the cause of their total ruine, for they wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rather to triumph than to fight; but because
they did not fight, they lost the triumph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Autarchus</hi> who had long been hovering,
whether to aspire to the chief (if not the sole
command) of the Nations, did now resolve to
set up for it: for, he found that all the old
factions had weakned one another, and would
still continue so, and that by picking quarrels
against the members of the Lacedemonian Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
he had expunged those who were most

               <hi>Anaxagius,</hi> installing some of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
in their vice, only he found the Army
planted with many who favoured excessively
the Senate, as being members in both, and so
tyed too narrowly his actings, and informed
too opportunely anent what passed there; to
remedy which, he entreats the Senate to advert
how dangerous it was for the Nation, to suffer
any person to command in both, whereby he
might one day command both, and how su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
it was, seing one enhanced the sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and imployments which might entertain
many, especially now when they stood in need
of many servants, and stood in fear of some
few masters; as also, that their charge in both
was neglected by their retaining both: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:33161:157"/>
their offices in the Army, than in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
hoping that the Army should be soon
disbanded, and finding that its members were
already hated by the people, and might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be punished by the Prince; and that
from the Senate they might expect a civil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
more lucrative, and of lesse danger;
and that the Army were but servants to the
Senate, whose members they might cashier at
pleasure, and who could never know the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of what was commanded; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <hi>Autarchus</hi> became sole Arbitrator of the
whole Army.</p>
            <p>There was one thing yet wanting to settle
him, which was an association with the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;
wherefore he goes in person thither, as
if he went to root up the remainders of the
<hi>Autophilist</hi> faction; but his intent truly was,
to ensure the <hi>Phanosebeans</hi> to his interest,
whom he knew would close with him upon his
own terms, to have the <hi>Autophilists</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereas he feared that after <hi>Autophilus</hi>
were once destroyed, and his faction extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
they would not so willingly associate with
him, and here the event answered his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for, at his coming to <hi>Athens,</hi> and his
meeting with <hi>Phanosebus,</hi> they after some
previous treaty, agreed in these Articles; That
<hi>Autophilus</hi> who was then prisoner in <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:33161:157"/>
should be beheaded; and that <hi>Phanose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
in requital of this, should destroy all who
opposed the Lacedemonian Senate in <hi>Athens;</hi>
and that none should be admitted to any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
office in <hi>Athens</hi> who had served in that
war, except such as the Senate of <hi>Lacedemon</hi>
should approve: this they did, fearing lest else
each Nobleman should bring in his friends,
which those Athenians who were there could
scarce hinder. This Treaty ended, <hi>Autarchus</hi>
stayes with them till all uproars were setled, all
suspect persons secured, and all the Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
filled with those of <hi>Phanosebus</hi> faction, and
in testimony of their respects to him, they court
him, feast him, and present him with some
rich Jewels.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Autarchus</hi> return to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> he
endeavours to weaken the Country musters,
pretending that they were too obsequious to
the Nobility, and those too much devoted to
<hi>Anaxagius;</hi> and albeit the continual custom
of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> might plead for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
they being only at first instituted, and
since continued to supply the want of Armies,
could not be now either necessary, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
where the Senate were served by a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and potent Army: By which means, he
obtains from the Senate, that these should be
discharged; Yet whilst this was a doing, he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:33161:158"/>
causeth prorogate the treaties betwixt the King
and Senate, purposly that he might afford <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axagius</hi>
well-wishers some hope, and so keep
them quiet, till his own faction were well fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
that they might flee abroad upon their
own wings.</p>
            <p>Yet the carreer of his ambition stops not
here, but he prevails with the Senate, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
some, and alluring others, to execute <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophilus;</hi>
and thereafter his fury flies at so
high a pitch as to stage <hi>Anaxagius,</hi> and after
some formalities of process, O horror, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more horrible than horror! they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him as a traitour, and even those who
were traitors to him; and as in all furious and
desperate exploits, this is no sooner intended
than executed.</p>
            <p>That fatall day being come wherein wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was to shew to the world its masterpiece,
the Army is made to approach near the City,
and those whose humour was known to be
barbarous, and whose crimes were by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
judged unpardonable, were chosen to be
upon the guard, where about ten a clock <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axagius</hi>
comes forth upon a scaffold, which
was all covered and hung with black, wearing
Majesty in his looks, albeit they had devested
him of its robes; his very face might have vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
him from more probable crimes than
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:33161:158"/>
those they could charge him with, and it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that he came rather to take up, than to lay
down a Crown: After he had setled himself a
little and beckened for silence, he gave the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers
this farewell.</p>
            <p>AMongst the many miseries wherewith
miserable mans life is chequered, it is
none of the least, that man should be mans tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer:
but amongst those afflictions which
spring to men from one anothers malice, those
are most insupportable, which are caused by
near relations, seing it is a double affliction
both to themselves afflicted, and to be afflicted
by friends, from whom else they might expect
some assistance; and what stranger will not
condemn him as horridly guilty, to whom his
relations are willing to be bourriers? It is not
the fear of death (for my life hath not been
so sweet of a long time, that my death needs to
prove bitter) No, it is the fear of what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
will ensue upon my death which thus
appales me; Neither would I grieve, if I
judged that the one might prevent the other:
but why should I not grieve, when I see that
the one will occasion the other? And seing I
fear that these Leeches will find the blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

for, since neither the priviledge of my person,
nor the justnesse of my cause, was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the hand of injustice from stretching it
self out against me, what subject (in none of
whom either of these is to be found in a more
eminent way) can expect exemption? or, if he
be exeemed, he owes that more to his fortune,
than his innocence; And what a misery is it
to live, where both life and fortune depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a may be? and to live where vertue can
neither expect preferment, nor evite punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the one being now the price of perjury,
and the other the effect of hazard: As for my
crime, it is such, as the worst of Kings cannot
be guilty of, seing it can only be admitted
against Kings: And so, seing not any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can be both accuser and defender, no King
can be accounted a Traitour. It is true, some
Lawyers do alleage, that a King, selling his
Kingdom to a stranger, or betraying it to an
enemy, commits Treason; but the reason in
both these, is, because after he hath sold his
Crown, or willing by treachery to convey it
to another, he ceaseth of his own consent to be
King, and so being a private person, may be
guilty of that publick crime; but to sit upon

of their crime: for there is no evil which
is judged practical by hellish persons, but
histories swarm with instances of it, only this
the worst of men have deferred to perpetrate,
as being the worst of actions, till Iustice should
in the end become so old and weak, as that
it was not able to defend it self against even
the highest of injuries: And as to those who
were my Iudges, they had either no power;
else if they had any, they derived it from me:
for, if they condemned me as members of the
Lacedemonian Senate, then they derived their
authority from me, who only did establish it,
and it was in obedience to my command, that
the respective Counties elected them to be their
Representatives: and consequently, when I was
staged by them, they annulled their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
even then when they exerced it against
me: but if they pannelled me not, as commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionated
by that Senate, how could they be
said to represent the Lacedemonian State, more
than any other did; and so they judged me,
without being constituted Iudges themselves:
But no wonder to see those who neglect the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:33161:160"/>
main, slight likewise particulars. As for me,
I pardon these wrongs they have done me, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it the prerogative of a King to pardon,
whereas it is the part of a subject only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
which since it argues parity, suits ill
with royal Majesty. Neither value I any
injury they can do me; for, seing they make
me exchange earth for heaven, misery for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
felicity, I account their wrongs, favours,
but I grieve for those grievous wrongs which
I fear will be exercised to you wards; for, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happinesse consisteth in being vertuous, and
since patience is one of the cardinal vertues,
I can in being patient without their permission
make my self happy in spight of their malice;
for surely, since the gods will remunerate men
according to the pains taken in their service
(a piece of justice which the most unjust among
men could hardly decline) Certainly, there is
no vertue can expect a greater reward than
patience, seing there is no vertue which toils
so much for it: Neither is there any vertue
which is not acted in acting patience; for, in
not grieving too much, we act temperance; in
resisting the assaults of rage, we evidence true
fortitude; and in submitting to the heavenly
powers, we manifest our justice: but my soul
is troubled, at the trouble which I fear is a
preparing against you; and as the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:33161:160"/>
of your priviledges was my main care
whilst I lived (esteeming the repose of the
subject the only patrimony of the Prince) so
now, nothing vexes me more at my death, than
to foresee how these miscreants will glut their
malice with your bloud, and their avarice with
your estates; for, how can these love other
mens children, who have murthered their own
father? and how can they fear murder, who
are guilty of parritide? Yet be not totally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;

this Land hath raged in this feaver of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>After this discourse was ended, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
(acknowledging the wickednesse of his

end his unparallel'd life.</p>
            <p>Pity it was, to behold how pity by its iron

for not a face there was scarleted by
one drop of bloud, as if all their bloud had
been transubstantiate in water, to suppeditate
tears to their prodigal eyes, which stood like
clouds, first darkned with sorrow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
distilling in showres of tears, which did

those vessels which are so full, that
they can drop none; or else, because their souls
sick of an appoplexy of grief, had forfaulted
all its senses and faculties; but amongst many

and whom rage had so grieved, that reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               <p>O distracted heart! why borrowest thou
not wings from dispair to flee after thy peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

of my cloudy breast, thou shalt be fed with
sorrow and drowned with tears. O super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
powers! (if I may call you powers who
suffer your selves to be overpowered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice)
must we term you both good, and
gods, seing ye permit such innocent souls to be

is it not enough, that ye should send us
a barren and heavie age of iron, but that ye
must likewise edge it with steel, that it may
the better cut to pieces our grieved souls?
Was not the treasure of mans misery great
enough before, but that ye behoved to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it with their new coined afflictions? O

is it, because ye fear to contaminate your pure

            <p>After this he would have killed himself, but
prudence whispered him iu the ear, that it was
fitter to live and see the fatal period of those

Regicides; to which resolution he acquiesced,
washing his hands in innocencie with his

            <p>The heavens likewise gloomed at what past,

disdaining to look streight to those, who
were not streight themselves, and the clouds
keeping up their rain, darkned the face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
either unwilling to fatten the earth, which
was by its fruits to fatten those Traitours; or
fearing to let its drops fall in a Country where
Kings were murthered; the air likewise (each

so grosse, as that the grossest lungs could
not breath it, nor the sharpest eye pierce it.
Thus Nature seemed to clothe all her houshold
in mourning for the losse of her dearest darling,
and she became enraged at these villains, for
breaking that Tableau which she had distinated

            <p>
               <hi>Theopemptus,</hi> eldest son to <hi>Anaxagius,</hi>
succeeded to him, a Gentleman of a noble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and well limb'd eloquence, who knew well
by the bridle of cunning, to govern the fierce
monster of popular fury, and whose <hi>genius</hi>
(quadrant-like) was able to measure the height
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:33161:163"/>
of the highest imployment to which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
and who by the art of patience, could
make the rarest flowers of vertue and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
grow in the cold and barren soil of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which did continually yeeld so abundantly
the seeds of precepts and example, as that
thereby in short time he stored therewith the
gardens both of Court and Country, which
was formerly judged impossible, because of the
largeness of the one, and weediness of the
other: yet providence judged fit to enamel
this golden spirit with the black colour of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
giving him an opportunity thereby to
evidence, that chance did not share with him
in his vertue, but that he could be vertuous,
not only without the assistance, but even in
spight of the resistance of that blind (though
ordinary) helper: or, if chance played ever in
his game, it was because it knew none could be
a loser who was associated to such a gamester:
and so, that to which all thers were debtors,
was a debtor to him, who thought it more
princely to give, than to receive. The Synod
had pained themselves oft, to draw him to be
their Leader, thinking it easie to perswade
a young Prince to be an absolute King, and
fore-seeing that he would be very helpfull to
them, seing the sons presence would impatron
their defection from the father; and seing
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:33161:163"/>
the father behoved either to condescend to
their overtures, fearing lest the people might
uphold the Crown upon his tender head, which
was not yet strong enough to bear it; else, if
that framed not according to their wishes, they
might keep the son, as an hostage for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
obedience, intending to cut him off how
soon the father cut off their hopes: these were
the endeavours of wicked <hi>Autarchus,</hi> who as
he was wicked in this, so was blind in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that providence perceived his bloudy
designs.</p>
            <p>The Mercurialists, who had a long time ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
under the Jovists, did now begin to trade
for themselves, these were persons whose zeal
was so hot, as that it burnt their charity, and
whose charity was so cold as that it did frieze
their natural affection, interesting themselves
in all businesses, and busying themselves with
all interests; who sighed not so much out of
piety (albeit that was pretended) as because
they saw their faction crossed, or themselves
not advanced; and whose tears gushed out,
fearing that if they stayed within, they should
be contaminated by their pestiferous breasts,
which the dullest of men might by the breath
of their words know to be infected: these had
in their hearts abjured their Prince, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
themselves (perjuring themselves in so
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:33161:164"/>
far as they had abjured their Prince) and by
tolerating all sects, and slagitious persons, had
almost possessed all the Offices of the Army;
and who were perswaded to desert the Jovist
faction, when they resolved to desert their
Prince, knowing that these two justled one
against the other, whereupon they proclaim
immunity to all crimes, providing the criminals
be willing to associate with them in the crime
of treason, when any thing was to be agitated
in the Senate, they sent abroad those members
who were of the Jovist faction, imploying them
either in levying men or monies in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or in transactions of small importance up
and down the City, and under pretext of guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Senate; they placed alwayes guards
of their own cabel (for all the Souldiers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their principles, as those which licensed
them most to satisfie their own irrational ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites)
and by that means hindred all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
who were not of their judgment, from
entring to give their judgments in subjects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batable;
and this cheat they used when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axagius</hi>
was declared by the Senate guilty of
treason, as we related formerly; yea, at that
time they caused some of the Guards call them
out of the House, pretending some particulars
with them, whom when they came they pulled
away, not suffering them to enter till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:33161:164"/>
was ended, and hurrying away others to
prison, alledging an order from the Senate for
what they did, which none durst challenge,
seing they dared once to alledge it: But after
<hi>Anaxagius</hi> death, all the Jovist faction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
themselves, abhorring by their presence
to authorise such illegal actings: as also <hi>Cyrus</hi>
Generall of the Army, resigned his batton,
finding that <hi>Autarchus</hi> endeavoured both to
defame and ruine him in the Army.</p>
            <p>Meetings amongst subjects have alwayes
been esteemed unmeet by the Prince, as being
the nests wherein the Cockatrices of Rebellion
are oft hatcht; and seing in them treasonable
projects are oft, at least may be easily ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Prince hath reason to advert to them,
and may justly prohibite them: for, since they
resemble Incorporations, they should aswell
as those be authorized by his permission, but
especially such Conventicles as dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
light to be a member; wherfore Law just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
presumes that to be done illegally which is
done secretly: for, if the actors might avow
publickly their meetings, it is not probable that
they would be at the pains to hunt for priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
especially, seing ambition prompts the least
vain amongst men, to act what they think al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
before witnesses: In these Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
all the cheats of that faction were hatched;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:33161:165"/>
for, whilst they perswaded men that they were
sacrificing at these times to the immortal gods,
they were really but borrowing the seal of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
that they might affix it to the forged
writs of their own capricious and rebellious
fancies, and were afterwards inhibited by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus,</hi>
when sole Governour; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
best by what means he had cheated the
people himself, knew best how to close those
back-passages upon others; and who by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
it in others, acknowledge it damnable
in himself.</p>
            <p>The Athenians perceived now their errour,
in believing the Lacedemonian Senate; and
<hi>Phanosebus</hi> did now conclude, that since <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
and <hi>Oranthus</hi> were removed, he would
monopolize his Princes affection; wherefore
he moves the Senate of <hi>Athens</hi> to send to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
where their Prince lived in exile, to bring
him home, which is done instantly, and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemptus</hi>
is brought home privatly, lest the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian
Fleet should have ensnared him at
Sea: but all who had served <hi>Oranthus,</hi> or
stuck by <hi>Autophilus,</hi> were banished from
Court, and <hi>Theopemptus</hi> is necessitated to
submit to all the determinations of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosebean
faction, who vex him daily with new
suits, and fill his Court with new favourites,
whose clownishnesse dissatisfied his noble and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:33161:165"/>
courtly spirit; and whose ignorance tortured
his accute wit and vast experience: all affairs
were chewed by the rotten teeth of these dolts,
who determined all things in their private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claves
before they came to the Council-table,
studying rather how to crosse, than how to
serve their Prince; yet shunned that wise
Prince, either to offend them, or to seem to be
offended at them; for albeit he was so judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as to discern their follies, yet was he so
prudent as to dissemble his resentments, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that cheats are like flowers and herbs,
which are best discerned when they flourish
most, and most hated when best discerned.</p>
            <p>The Lacedemonian Senate, hearing that the
Athenians had refuged <hi>Theopemptus,</hi> resolved
to send an Army against them, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Autarchus,</hi> who assured the Senate
that he was confident of many friends there,
and their factiousness would prove his intimate
well wisher; as also, that it was surest game
to fight <hi>Theopemptus</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> lest if he
marched into <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> his Army might
prove like a ball of snow, which the further
it rouls, grows alwayes the greater; and that
possibly the command of a King, joyned to his
diligence, might piece up those differences,
which did like wedges, for the present, cleave
assunder that rent Nation. Besides these, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:33161:166"/>
design was, to engage further the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian
Senate in that rebellious quarrel,
and to imbrew so their hands in the Bloud-Royal,
as that no capitulation might be able to
wash it off; and by this new imployment, to
acquire new respect to himself from the Army,
and to render the Army necessary in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
fearing lest they should come to
want respect, if they come once to want im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
He marcheth to <hi>Athens</hi> with a
well equipaged and long-experienced Army;
having exact intelligence from his Army of all
that passed there. The Phanosebeans who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded both Church and State, made
head against him, but their Army was so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd
by a Committee from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all their Orders, that <hi>Autarchus</hi> needed
none to conquer them besides their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness
and confusion. Sometimes in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of greatest expedition, they could not be
convocated, and when they were assembled,
their opinions fought each one against another,
whilst all should have imployed themselves in
fighting against the common enemy: thus they
continued to distract that poor Nation by their
distracted fancies, till at last <hi>Autarchus</hi> falls
upon their Camp privately, and cuts them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all
to pieces.</p>
            <p>That old Army being beat, a new Army is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:33161:166"/>
ordered to be levied; and now <hi>Cletus</hi> who
succeeded to his brother <hi>Autophilus,</hi> gains to
his party, some of those who owned <hi>Phan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebus</hi>
interest formerly, and by their assistance
obtains (after many and long debates at the
Council-table) that all those who had followed
<hi>Autophilus</hi> and <hi>Oranthus</hi> faction, should be
re-admitted to their old charge, and admitted
in others then vacant, alledging, that else the
Counties who were much enclined their way,
would never engage cordially in his Majesties
quarrel; for, who would be so mad as to
fight in that Army, where they feared their
own Commanders more than their enemies;
or, who would strengthen that Army by new
Levies, who would be imployed to assist their
inveterate enemies at home, after they were
once victorious abroad? Adding, that who
could hinder any man to quench that fire which
was burning his own house? or, who could
hinder a son to defend his mother?</p>
            <p>The Phanosebeans finding themselves beat
from all these bulwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks, did at last retire (as
their custom was) to the Citadel of Religion,
alledging that their consciences could not allow
them to associat themselves to those, whose
sins would prove like so many bosome enemies;
and that to contract friendship with such, was
to declare war against the immortal gods: yet
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:33161:167"/>
               <hi>Theopemptus</hi> had so cunningly insinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the Jovist Priests, that the greatest
and wisest part of them, did not only tolerate,
but likewise approve that association, by which
the Phanosebeans became enraged, and devoted
themselves to the Lacedemonian faction, albeit
many thought that <hi>Phanosebus</hi> self continued
loyal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cletus</hi> (a singularly well accomplisht Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman)
became by this means <hi>Theopemptus</hi>
darling, and promotes exceedingly their new
Levies, so that in a short space an excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is drawn to the fields; yet they were so
wearied by delayes, and starved with hunger
by the Phanosebean Officers, that many dropt
away, being near home, and many were affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished;
occasions of fighting were neglected,
and the loyallest persons sent upon desperat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits:
which <hi>Theopemptus</hi> perceiving, and
fearing that the continuance of this evil should
prove an irremediable evil in the end, resolved
to march to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> having assurance from
some, and well-grounded hopes from others in
that Nation, that they would assist him: but
at his entry, the Athenians, who wanted pay,
and feared both the tediousness of the journy,
and treachery of their Officers, did like Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Ice, drop away before the Southern
Sun, and were at last overtaken by <hi>Autarchus</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:33161:167"/>
(to whom those fresh forces whom he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
did joyn incontinently) and so did dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
that poor handfull, whom the tediousness
of the journey had left alive; yet in spight of
all enquiry, providence so mudded the eyes of
those who enquired after him, that he escaped
their hands, and blows a gentle gale out of its
mouth, which conveys him over to <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Autarchus</hi> hoises up now the sails of his
ambition, which were instantly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>illed with the
smiling gales of success, and placing confidence
at the helm, steers streight for the haven of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie.
He marries his daughters to the
most eminent Officers of the Army, and diggs
deeply in the secrets of the wives, that he
might learn the secrets of the husbands: he
bribes the Astrologues to foretel his conquests,
making his wishes the heavenly houses by
which they foretold his successe, and instigates
a great many Enthusiastick persons to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
his happiness, authorizing themselves by
revelations, by which means he animates his
own, and terrifies his adversaries, wringing
new pay and priviledges to the Army from
the Senate, by which he both fortifies the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and brings a masse of <hi>odium</hi> upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>The door whereby he was to enter Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies
parlour, was now bolted by no other
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:33161:168"/>
bar, than by his jealousie of <hi>Anarchus</hi> interest
in the Army; who in all this war being his
colleague, he feared he might become his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor;
wherefore he perswaded him, to suit
for the Government of the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi>
and perswaded him, that if he would lay down
his charge in the Lacedemonian Army, that he
would procure it for him from the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Senate; for in the present scarsity of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
none could enjoy two at once, especially
of two so eminent as those were: <hi>Anarchus</hi>
imbraces the proffer, choosing rather to be first
in the Army of <hi>Patmos,</hi> then second in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and demits his charge, which
he no sooner demits, than the Senate by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus</hi>
instigation, presently accepts, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
slights him; whereupon he is constrained
to retire home, byting his lip because he had
condescended to that unfortunate transaction.</p>
            <p>The stage being thus cleared of all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
<hi>Autarchus</hi> begins to act his chief
scene, and endeavoureth to irritate the Army
against the Senate; which he might the more
easily effectuate, by reason that the Senate did
now begin to discover his roguery, and the
Armies tyranny, and were endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
some of their Regiments, and affront some
of their Officers; which <hi>Autarchus</hi> adverting
to, ordered all the nearest lying Regiments to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:33161:168"/>
march up unexpectedly to the City; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
one morning to the Court of the Palace
where the Senate did then sit, he closes the
gate, lest any of the number should escape;
and turning him to the Souldiery, opening his
mind thus to them.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Fellow Souldiers, your bleeding wounds
and wounded bodies, deserve better requital
from this Senate than frowns or threats; and
albeit ye be not actually in service against
their enemies, yet that is no more a reason
why ye should not be paid and cherished as
formerly, than a Mariner who hath served
his Master in a storm at Sea, should be shaken
off and refused maintenance when he comes
a shoar: Ye have abandoned your houses,
and renounced your trades, that ye might
make their Army your house, and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
your trade: And must these, in whose
hands ye have put the sword, take your
swords from you, and ruine you after that
ye have ruined their enemies? What may
this Nation expect from these Masters, who
refuse maintenance to the best and loyallest of
their servants? and seing they disoblige us so
much, who have so much obliged them, what
shall the rest of the Nation expect, who have
never obliged them at all? And may we not
see that their quarrel against us, is our just
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:33161:169"/>
pay, which otherwise they might coffer up
themselves? What shall the world say of us,
if that after we have banisht Monarchy, we
establish Tyranny? and to counterpoise the
antiquity of the former Government, should
not we endeavour to evidence as much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and moderation in this, which we are to
establish, as the former could alledge anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
or prescription? Remember that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and prudence have so strict an alliance,
that valour without prudence, is no valour,
but rather temerity: wherefore if ye shew
not prudence after these many victories,
wherewith fame hath crowned you as with
so many lawrels, your former victories will
be attributed either to blind chance, or to
your enemies imprudence; and how can ye
be termed prudent, if ye suffer your selves to
be trampled upon by the feet of Tyranny?
Wherefore make the world witnesses of your
gallantry, in refusing to serve those, who
could neither prize nor reward your services,
and settle in your own persons that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which ye have suffered so much for.</p>
            </q>
            <p>All condescended to this overture, and <hi>Aut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
dismisses that ignorant rabble, who had
formerly by his assistance thrown out those
worthy patriots, who had been their former
colleagues, and by this means, he who had been
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:33161:169"/>
in appearence so much an enemy to Arbitrary
Government in the person of <hi>Theopemptus,</hi>
became an affecter of it in his own; and was
declared by the Army Governour of <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
and <hi>Athens</hi> in this <hi>interim;</hi> promising to
render up his power to the first Senate which
should be legally conveened, by the Authority
of the People; Proclamations are immediatly
issued out, to remonstrate to the People the
reasons of raising the Senate, and of establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government for the <hi>interim</hi> in the
person of <hi>Autarchus:</hi> but both these actions
were so black that they could receive no other
tincture, and the faces of their cheats so large
that no vizard could be found big enough to
cover them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Autarchus</hi> endeavours to retain by cheats,
that power which he had gotten by force; and
because he perceived that the Church had been
an occasion of many great alterations in the
State formerly, by reason that the Ecclesiasticks
debated every thing, and retarded most of what
was resolved by the State; he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to moddel such an Ecclesiastick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as might wholly be subordinate to the
Civil; for which cause amongst those many
Religions which were at that time professed in
<hi>Lacedemon,</hi> he chooses one, which allow no
publick Conventions amongst Ecclesiasticks;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:33161:170"/>
which being once setled, he sets himself to
crush the faction of <hi>Theopemptus,</hi> which he
doth by inhibiting all publick Conventions,
wherein mutinies might be hatched, such as
horse-matches, feastivals, &amp;c. he carresses some
of all factions, shewing thereby that all might,
if they pleased bring favour; and supports
the weakest faction, that so it might by his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
counterpoise the other, knowing that
by these, all joynt Insurrections would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded,
and that the one in <hi>odium</hi> of the other,
would unseale one anothers mysteries, and
countermine one anothers projects: He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
the people, whereby he both disabled
them to act any thing to his prejudice for the
present, and weaned their spirits from all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
imployments for the future; and likewise
filling his own Arsenal richly, he made himself
seem terrible to all that wisht his ruine. Being
thus secured against foreign Incursions, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to secure himself against intestine
broils; lest else he might prove like to one of
those theeves, who leaves their own door open
whilst they go abroad to steal from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
to obviate which, he imploys the most
eminent amongst the Officers, as Counsellor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of State; both, lest they should repine at his
being the sole Arbitrator in all affairs, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they might bear an equal share in the <hi>odium</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:33161:170"/>
what was done by him to displease the people;
yet lest they should twist themselves too far in
the Government, he appointed alwayes some
festival dayes of worship for the gods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to busie them, whilst he himself is busied
in dispatching matters of the greatest moment;
and lest those who were Governours of Cities,
and Countries, should insinuate themselves too
far in the affection either of Soldiers or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
he transplanted them oft from one
place to another; and to prevent the idleness
of the Soldiers, (which might have given them
both leisure and opportunity to fall by th'ears
amongst themselves) as also to have some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
to levie moneys from the people (which
poor people he fleeced like a sheep at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure)
he warred continually against some
neighbouring Prince, buying to himself repute
with the bloud of the Souldiers, and money of
the people.</p>
            <p>Amongst his many other State-sophismes,
this was one most remarkable, because oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated.
When <hi>Autarchus</hi> had notice given
him by his Spies, of any Royallist who had
more avarice than money, and who could be
no longer honest, than he was rich; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sent for them, and after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
them, that he was master of their life
and fortunes; and of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olly in adhering so
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:33161:171"/>
pertinaciously to <hi>Theopemptus</hi> faction, he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them considerable sums to owne his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
and to seem to draw a faction for <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemptus,</hi>
pretending Commissions for that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and getting a great many hands to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrive
some Remonstrance, and especially the
hands of those whom he suspected to be loyal,
or knew to be rich: which being gotten, that
he should acquaint him with the Rendevouze
appointed, or suffer himself and the Papers to
be apprehended by some of the Souldiery: by
which means he rid himself of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and enriched his treasury by the alledged
treason of his most considerable enemies, and
made his own wit to be admired, and brought
his adversaries to that passe, that they could
not trust one another.</p>
            <p>Another stratagem which he used to ensnare
that generous Prince, was this: He had notice
given him of one called <hi>Asebus,</hi> whose pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
behoved to have some bone to gnaw upon,
albeit he should have drawn it out of the devil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
side; him <hi>Autarchus</hi> sent for, hearing that he
was an Agent for the Royal faction, and after
many allurements (it being easie to perswade
where avarice opens the ear, and necessity play<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the Oratour) he prevails with him to go to
<hi>Theopemptus,</hi> and carry alongst with him six
thousand crowns, and assure him of the like sum
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:33161:171"/>
yearly, in pension from some friends in <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon</hi>
(whose purses loyal compassion had
opened) <hi>Theopemptus</hi> desires to know their
names; but <hi>Asebus</hi> pretended that he was
sworn not to tell that, wherewith he rests sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
but perswades himself that the senders
were his friends, and that <hi>Asebus</hi> was a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of theirs, else they had never trusted him,
and a friend of his, else he had never underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the imployment; and thus he acquaints
him with all his designs, which the other no
sooner know than he reveals them to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus.</hi>
Yet the gods (who are not idle spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
but just judges of mens knavery) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m at last; for having one day seen
some dispatches which were sent to <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
by <hi>Theopemptus,</hi> he acquaints <hi>Autarchus,</hi>
who apprehends and executes the Gentlemen
who were entrusted: whereat <hi>Theopemptus</hi>
extreamly enraged, accuses a Nobleman, who
had only seen those Letters besides <hi>Asebus,</hi> the
Nobleman vindicates himself, but not being
believed by his Prince, he runs in fury to
<hi>Asebus</hi> his Cabinet, and there finding some
Letters of correspondence from <hi>Autarchus</hi> to
him, he causeth him to be presently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
            <p>Amidst these triumphs, triumphing death
cuts his treacherous dayes, and hurries him to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:33161:172"/>
eternal torment, who tormented others here;
And thus died the most hatefull Tyrant who
ever lived, leaving behind him a son, in whose
simplicity the gods punished the fathers cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prudence; this was that <hi>Ephemerus</hi> of
whom I spoke formerly, who being nominated
by his father his successor, was admitted by the
Souldiery, not so much out of any respect they
bore him, as fearing that if the charge were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
vacant, emulation should cut the throat
of their quiet. It was thought that <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
(finding his own insufficiency) resolved to
recal <hi>Theopemptus,</hi> but his design was choaked
by timorousness, fearing least the Army per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his design, should ruine him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
his project: Others thought, that his
enemies used only this, as an argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Army to relinquish him, as they did
afterwards. However, he was induced by some
who favoured the Royal faction, especially by
<hi>Monus</hi> General of the Athenian Forces, to
convocate a Senate, whereby they expected to
establish Monarchy. <hi>Anarchus</hi> all this while,
like a boyling liquor could not contain himself
in a private condition, without running over,
and like the children, chose rather to be burnt
in the sunshine of a publick imployment, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
stay in the shade of privacy; wherefore he
deals with some Officers to recall him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:33161:172"/>
in a confederacy among themselves, they
deal with <hi>Morus</hi> General of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Forces, to concur with them in perswading
<hi>Ephemerus</hi> to set the Senate a packing; which
<hi>Morus</hi> (poor fool) assents to, and whereof
<hi>Ephemerus</hi> is simply perswaded, the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the glory of governing the Army,
who was to govern all; and the other terrified
by fear, concluding that the Army would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
by force, what was denyed in favour.
Thus we see glory makes men too credulous,
because it ponders danger too little; and fear
makes men too credulous, because it ponders
danger too much; the one not seeing what is,
and the other seeing more than is: which are
the two ordinary diseases both in the eyes of
body and mind. And as in things corporeal, so
also in spiritual productions, we see monsters
both in defect and excesse engendred; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
missing its mark in the one, as nature
misseth hers in the other: for, as hot-spurr'd
ambition will not suffer prudence to stand to
hear its errand; so leaden-footed fear suffers
the occasion to slip before it brings prudence up
to the place where it should act; and as one
who runneth can never see any object which
he posts by exactly; so one may dull his sight
after such a fashion in looking too long upon
one object, that he may come to see nothing,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:33161:173"/>
because he hath looked too much: And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation
is like the fire, whose flames shew
equally little light at first when it is kindled,
and at last when it hath burnt too long.
But <hi>Ephemerus</hi> was hugely misted by his own
folly in this (fear being alwayes like a mist,
which makes the object appear greater than it
is) for, seing there are only two wayes, either
to acquire or retain Supremacy, the one by a
pretended authority, such as the Senate was;
and the other by irresistable force, such as the
Army was: and since he was confident that
<hi>Anarchus</hi> had debauch'd the Army from his
obedience, he should never have abandoned the
Senate. Neither did <hi>Morus</hi> evidence lesse folly
in colluding with <hi>Anarchus,</hi> for he might have
seen (if the eyes of his reason had been open)
that since <hi>Anarchus</hi> was able to dissolve the
Senate by the assistance of the Army, that he
might in time by their assistance ruine him far
more easily, who was but a single person; and
seing many of those who commanded, had been
under <hi>Anarchus</hi> his charge, when they were
<hi>Morus</hi> his competitors and equals, he might
have concluded that they would far more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
obey an old master, than one but late
equal; as also, that the Souldiery who had
been victorious under his conduct (and so were
confident of his courage and prudence) would
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:33161:173"/>
more cordially follow him than any else; and
by <hi>Autarchus</hi> eying him as his competitor,
<hi>Morus</hi> might have feared to take him in to be
his colleague. No sooner is the Senate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
than the Army establishes that old Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
which <hi>Autarchus</hi> had at first dissolved;
for seing they found that the Nation could not
be satisfied without a Senate, they resolved to
establish that wherein many of themselves were
members, and whom because of their paucity
they might easily command. Yet many judged
that they recalled these fools, not out of any
affection, but meerly because they were not
able themselves to settle their own differences
in so short a time; which conjecture was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven
by the event: for, these Officers of the
Army, finding that the Senate consulted them
not in all particulars, nor called them to fill up
the vacant places which were many amongst
them, did endeavour to re-assume that power
with which they had invested those ingrate
fellows formerly; who look'd upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storers,
as if they had only been their servants,
which they perceiving, ordered the casheering
of these daring Officers, and especially of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
and <hi>Anarchus;</hi> but being hated by the
people, as those Leeches who had suckt the
Bloud Royal, and as those burriers who had
strangled the tranquillity of the Nation, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:33161:174"/>
being jealoused by the Army, as the persons
who endeavoured to wrest the power out of
their hands, they were turned out by <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
and the whole power was retained by
the Army; who resolved to subject themselves
to none, and to make all subjects to them:
Hereupon <hi>Monus,</hi> whom the late Senate eying
as a Royallist, had called to bear charge in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi>
intending really to have laid him fast
by the heels, did refuse alwayes, pretending
that he was bound by promise to the Army of
<hi>Athens,</hi> not to remove thence till they were
compleatly satisfied of their Arrears; whereby
he found a pretext to excuse his stay (seing he
knew that they could not advance so much
money) and endeared himself to the Souldiery,
and did fully engage them to him; and now
perceiving, that the Commonwealth would one
day perish by their convulsion fits of schism,
to which it was so subject; and knowing by its
change of colour, that it did begin to faint, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to lay hold on this occasion, and to purge
away these malignant humours out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the State, whilst they were thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;
wherefore he declareth War against
the Council, because they had banisht the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
yet covertly he hated the Senate as much
as them, but resolved by helping the weakest,
and by ruining the Army, to re-establish <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemptus:</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:33161:174"/>
for effectuating whereof he cashiers
instantly all such in his Army, as he feared did
encline too much to <hi>Anarchus,</hi> and morgages
all his Plate and Jewels for money to pay his
Army, making the Athenians advance the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplus;</hi>
for they were perswaded, that if <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
gained, that all their goods should be
confiscated, and their lives, if not endangered,
at least imbittered: As also, he advances one
degree all his Officers, obliging them to fight
for their own dignities, if they would not in
his quarrel. Many judged <hi>Monus</hi> a fool in this
attempt, like those who seeing only the first
draughts of a pencile, though never so curious,
yet thinks the face deformed, whereas the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Painter himself, or any exquisit Artist, knows
that it will prove well: for, he considered
wisely, that all the Senates faction, and which
was more, all the Royal faction, would owne
him, and that possibly he might gain some of
theirs (expecting pardons for their crimes) but
that doubtlesse they could never debauch any
of his; that the Cash being in the Senates
hands, and at their disposal (none being in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to levie money except a Senate) and the
Cash being the breasts by whose milk the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was kept alive; he knew they could not
long subsist without it; likewise he found by
his well founded intelligence, that dispair was
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:33161:175"/>
arming all men, in all the corners of the Nation.
Yet to encourage his souldiers, he convocats all
the nobility of <hi>Athens,</hi> and communicats to the
wittiest amongst them, his design, to re-establish
Monarchy, and desired them not to startle at
any publick protestations to the contrary, which
necessity might wring from him; and desires
them to be ready waiting his call, and for that
effect he fills up all the vacant places in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with Athenians, and author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zes the rest to
wear Arms as formerly. But the Mercurialists
in <hi>Athens</hi> endeavoured to oppose his designs,
alleaging that he desired a convocation of the
Nobility, only to ensnare them, and laboured
to impede the payment of those taxes which
he required, pretending that <hi>Anarchus</hi> would
cause them be payed over again, and not only
so, but would likewise impute the first payment
of them to the Nation, as an unpardonable
crime: by this means they thought to have
hindered the payment of the Souldiers, and
without that, they knew that <hi>Monus</hi> could not
subsist; As also they endeavoured to set the
Nobility and Citizens by the ears, alleag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
that the Nobility laboured to cry down usury,
and to necessitate their Creditors to accept
Lands for their Money, which would ruine
Trade. But such was the zeal of the Nation,
for the re-establishment of <hi>Theopemptus,</hi> and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:33161:175"/>
such was their affection to <hi>Monus,</hi> that these
Fanaticks gained nothing by all their pains but
ignominy to themselves, and a curse to their
posterity: <hi>Anarchus</hi> Army hearing that the
Athenians were all in Arms covertly, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ambushes in a Country where they were
both unaquainted, and hated; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Anarchus</hi> wanted money to pay
their Arrears, whereas <hi>Monus</hi> had paid those
who served him, they refuse to advance to
<hi>Athens,</hi> whereas it was thought, that if he
had advanced immediately, that most of the
Souldiery enclining his way, that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
<hi>Monus</hi> and followed him. Whilst <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
is upon his march from <hi>Athens,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

Officers, whom the Council had disobliged,
and whom the Senate had bribed with promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of future preferment; which necessitated
<hi>Anarchus</hi> to return; but in his return, all his
Souldiers either dropped away privatly, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
openly; which for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

capitulation, but robbed him of the means of
capitulating handsomly: <hi>Monus</hi> follows, and
marches straight to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and in his
march, is welcomed by the applauses of the
people, and addresses of the Gentry, and found
an unanimous desire in all men to have <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemptus</hi>
called home. At his entry to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:33161:176"/>
he is carressed by the Senate at first, yet
afterwards they conjecture that he byasseth
<hi>Theopemptus</hi> way; wherefore to try him, and
to make him odious to the people, they imploy
him in razing down the gates of the City;
which he obeyes, fearing to be discovered too
soon; but obeyes so wittily, as that he makes
the <hi>odium</hi> rebound upon themselves; malice
being a ball, which, if thrown violently, bolts
up presently upon the thrower; and in stead
of making the City his enemies, he gains them
to be his friends; whereat the Senate shewes
themselves dissatisfied, fearing that such an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
servant would never satisfie such roguish
masters. <hi>Monus</hi> resolves joyntly with the
City, to procure the re-admission of those,
who being Colleagues with their present Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
were excluded because of their adherance
to <hi>Anaxagius;</hi> which he effectuates happily,
and thereby puts a bridle in the head of that
unruly beast the Senate: yet, albeit those who
were re-entred were the more numerous, the
old members so perplext them by debates, and
so oft discovered their secrets, that they brake
up the present Senate, and called a new one.</p>
            <p>In this Senate <hi>Theopemptus</hi> is called home;
not limited by conditions, as some desired; for
how could Subjects give Law to a King? and
possibly these conditions would have been by
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:33161:176"/>
the next ensuing Senate, declared T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reason, and
the Treaters declared Traitors, but absolutely
each endeavouring who should strengthen his
prerogative most.</p>
            <p>At his Proclamation the people kindled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
bonfires, as if by them they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to purge the air of these Nations, which had
been polluted with blasphemy against the gods,
and rebellion against the King formerly; or
else, as if they intended to bury in these graves,
and burn to ashes those cares, wherewith they
had been formerly afflicted; Their flames
mounted so high, that one might have thought
that they intended to carry news of those So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
to heaven; and the smoke covered
the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owns pend-ways, lest heaven should have
discerned the extravagancies whereof the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
were guilty; for gravity was banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as an enemy to their duty, and madnesse
was judged true loyalty; the trumpets were
ecchoed by the vociferations of the people, and
those vociferations seemed to obey the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the trumpets; the bells likewise kept
a part with the singing multitude, so that both
bells and people did both sing and dance all at
once; and the air no sooner received these
news, but it dispersed them to all the corners
of the City, and ears of the Citizens; it being
no crime to be in this a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ale-bearer; and the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:33161:177"/>
bullets did flee out of the Cannons, as if they
intended to meet him half way: wine was sent
in abundance to the earth, that it might drink
his Majesties health also, and the glasses capreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the air, for joy to hear his name: some
danced through the fire, knowing that the wine
had so much m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dified them, that they needed
not fear burning; and others had bonfires kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
in their faces by the wine which they had
drunk.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Theopemptus</hi> was remembred, so
<hi>Monus</hi> was not forgot, some admiring his
loyalty, some his prudence, and many both:
for, he finding that the Army was the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
which defended the late Tyrannie, did
macerate it as much as was possible: for the
old Senate by his connivance, did levie their
County Bands, which served as a counterpoise
to the Armies weight; those Officers who
shewed themselves dissatisfied, were reduced,
and their Regiments disbanded: but lest the
Souldiery should repine and mutiny, they were
instantly received into the County Bands; and
those Regiments which were continued, were
either given to loyal persons, or those who
were disloyal were gained by a certain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pardon, and future imployment; for
which cause it was surmised, that <hi>Theopemptus</hi>
intended for his own safety, to keep a standing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:33161:177"/>
Army, whom he was to pay; as also, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
caused rumour, that they were to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
such persons as they jealoused, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
if they were guilty, they presently either
fled, or drew a faction, in both which cases
they afforded certain proofs of their knavery,
and furnish'd the Senate the means to ruine
them. And because their presence over-awed
alwayes the Senate, it was ordered, that the
City Bands should guard the City, and the
Army should remove from it, So that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
being once removed from the heart, the
cure of the body was thereby much facilitated;
the Companies likewise of every Regiment,
were dispersed into all the corners of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
under pretext of preventing Insurrections;
But really their design was to impede their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies,
and to make them the more conquerable,
if they should dare to oppose that royal design,
some of them were sent unto <hi>Athens,</hi> because
the Revolution was to begin in <hi>Lacedemon;</hi>
and others were sent to assist forreign Allies, at
the suggested request of their Ambassadors.</p>
            <p>All things being thus prepared, <hi>Theopemptus</hi>
enters the City of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> in the greatest
pomp that loyalty, or luxury could invent:
Above him at the Gates stood clouds, as they
seemed, which rained down Wines of all sorts,
and at each side of the Gates stood a large
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:33161:178"/>
Glass, the one whereof afforded a perspective
of a Country, where all the trees were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled
of their leaves, and all the flowers
blasted by the winde; wherein widows were
bathing their starving babes in their compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
tears, and where tax-masters were beating
the peasants, who declared upon their knees,
that they could not pay their taxes: In the
other Glass was to be seen, a pleasant Spring
in the ruffe of its pride, and a Prince sighting
against a Tyrant with one hand, and sowing
gold and money with the other. These and
many other expressions of joy were presented
to him, whose recital might be as tedious as
the view was pleasant. At the same Gate stood
all the Senators and Citizens in robes, amongst
whom one delivered his Majesty this harangue.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Most gracious Soveraign,</p>
               <p>ALbeit your Return hath effaced these sad
impressions which our miseries had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
upon our spirits, yet duty hath reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
an <hi>idea</hi> of them, that by comparing them
with the happy condition wherein we are like
to live under your Government, we may find
what a vast difference there is betwixt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy
and Anarchy, betwixt slavery and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
We know now what a silly carcass
a body is without a head, and what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it is for a body to brain its head against
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:33161:178"/>
the rocks of danger and rebellion. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
is our head, and nature teacheth all men
to guard that, even with the hazard of their
other members; and Physicians prescribe moe
maxims for its conservation, and moe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments
for its cure, than for the cure of any
part beside. Ye may be confident, Sir, that
we who have had our purses robbed so oft by
Tyrants, will not now refuse some part of
them to our lawfull Prince; and who should
command the childrens purses more freely
than the father? Our refusing to defray your
necessary charges, may procure to us national
affronts, and lose us our forreign interests:
and herein consists our mutual happiness, that
as our Nation hath a Prince who will require
lesse than they would willingly contribute, so
our Prince hath now a people, who upon all
honourable emergents will cordially contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
more than he will demand. And we who
have been flung in heaps, that Tyrants might
over our bellies and upon our shoulders mount
their unjustly acquired thrones, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
willingly lend our hands to help our
born Prince to ascend that Throne, which
his birth, and our prescribed consent, hath
built for him; and as a company of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
who are linked together in one society,
cannot be accounted the lesse rich, that their
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:33161:179"/>
gold lies not in their private coffers, but in the
common cash; So Subjects are not to be lookt
upon as the lesse powerful, that their strength
lies in the hands of their Prince. Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
only to be powerfull, either to restrain the
insolencies of Forreigners, or to suppress the
insurrections of mutinous Subjects; So that
seing we are protected by the first, and but
justly corrected by the last, we can never in
justice repine at the powerfulnesse of our
Prince. Sir, seing man desires to sway Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
Scepter, and hates to stoop to the shrine
of anothers power, doubtlesse they had never
willingly subjected themselves to Monarchy,
if they had not been convinced by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
of its signal advantages. It is that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which preventeth the emulation of
competitors, which concealeth what is to be
acted, and is able to remedy those evils which
delay might make insuperable: neither of
which advantages can be expected, or hath
ever been perceived in a Commonwealth: and
as amongst figures the pyramide stands most
firmly; so amongst Governments, Monarchy
(which in the geometry of policy, may be
called the pyramide) is of all others the most
sure-footed: whereas that round figure, the
Commonwealth, is globe-like always rolling;
And as it is reasonable, that the gods should
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:33161:179"/>
govern men, because they are more rational
than men, and that man should goven bruits,
because he is more rational than those; So
amongst men, it is rational and just, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some are more ingenious than others,
and one yet more ingenious than these some;
that therefore those few (such as are Nobles)
should govern the rest of the people; and
that one Monarch should govern those few
Nobles. Neither is it fit, that those who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
once the mysteries of State-affairs,
and who have their Intelligence setled once
with Forreign Princes and Ministers of State,
should then be removed (as we see is, yea and
must be done in Commonwealths) for that
were to remove one from a trade when he
hath past his apprentisage, and if these be not
removed, they will prove Monarchs at last;
so that in shunning one, we shall have many;
and those many, because of their factions and
treacheries (for all can neither be honest nor
concordant) shall be more insupportable, and
lesse usefull than that one. Sir, our rambling
to and fro, tasting all Governments, evidences
our folly, but addeth to your glory; for none
can alleage now that it is only your birth,
which hath entitled your Majesty to these
Crowns, which is the ordinary opprobrie
wherewith other Princes are upbraided; no
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:33161:180"/>
Sir, for now the hand of our reason hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
your election; and if there be any
thing more desirable in elective Monarchy,
than there is in hereditary, your Majesty may
justly pretend to both; we have nothing to
excuse our defection, but over-powering ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
so that we may be compared to a stone
which violence may take from its place, and
throw up in the air, but its natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will draw it presently to its former cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for no sooner did occasion acquaint us
with the possibility of your Majesties return,
but immediatly our acclamations and bonfires
joyned hand in hand to testifie the ardour of
our desires, and height of our zeal for your
re-establishment: and for the future, our
chearfull obedience shall attone our former
obstinacy, for which we shall ever stand in the
sackcloath of repentance: And since all good
is desirable, and is desirable, because it is good;
the more desired any thing is, the better it may
be judged to be; and I am confident, never
Nation desired more passionatly, nor expressed
more vehemently their desires than we at this
time, whereby we have according to our small
abilities, witnessed what high thoughts and
great expectations we have of your Majesties
incomparable goodness: and as both our
wishes and expectations of your goodness are
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:33161:180"/>
great, we hope your Majesties endeavours to
satisfie both, will be as great as either: and
that since injustice hath made our former Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
abominable, that ye will by justice make
your Reign amiable; remember, Sir, that as
the contests and litigiousness of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
together with the desire to have them
terminated, was the first motive which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
men to bow to Monarchy; So it will be
now, that which will endear Monarchy to all.
Remember, Sir, that all your noble ornaments
are badges of that noble vertue; your Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is given you, to shew your Legislative
power, your Sword is given you to punish
those who disobey it, and your Crown as a
reward for acting in obedience to it. That is
the vertue which Moralists esteem so much,
that they think it can have excess; a quality
which is attributed to no other vertue, besides
these that are divine; such as the love of
God, and such others. Your Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
are the stomack of your Kingdom, which
first digests truth and equity, and then diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it to the remotest parts of that politick
body; But, Sir, if the stomach be corrupted
by depraved or flegmatick humours, what a
languishing condition will the body be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacted
to? as to war against neighbouring
States, and such like martial imployments;
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:33161:181"/>
they are not necessary, but as they defend Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
and may justly be compared to a hedge
about a garden, which bears no fruit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but defends these trees which do bear;
whereas Justice is that fruit-tree which bears
the golden apples of peace, plenty and vertue,
and under whose shade your subjects may rest
securely. All we can do is, to submit to your
Decrees, and to pray to the eternal and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
gods, to accumulate your Majesty
with all prosperity and happiness.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Nation did now begin to look like a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
reconvalescing after a feaver, which grows
more fat than it was formerly, and like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
brought to bed, did forget its former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series:
and I remember that being in a barg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of pleasure, which was covered with gold and
cristal; after we were weary with musick, we
fell a discoursing of the poverty of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for seing the mines did every year cast a
golden fleece, and seing forreigners had never
forraged the Country, it was strange to see
such an ebb of treasure, where there used for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to be so many spring-tydes of wealth:
To this another Gentleman answered, That in
all nations, there was much of the substance of
gold lost in gildings, laces, and embroideries
much treasured up by misers, and lost by thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:33161:181"/>
unexpected deaths; That fires in towns, and
shipwrack and sights at Sea, sunk much of it;
and that the low value which was daily put
upon it, lower than formerly, made it seem
more scarce. But besides these, there were
some reasons peculiar to this same Nation;
such as its being cashed up by those who hid it,
fearing to be called rich, and fearing publick
borrowings (which was the ordinary practice
of those Rebels) or, because those who bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
payed but small usery for it, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupted
often with it, so that the danger was
great, and the profit small: As also the money
formerly was in Noblemens hands, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of other exigences were alwayes using it;
whereas those wretches who had it now, did
lay it in coffers, living rather conform to their
low births than their rich fortunes; Likewise
neighboring Nations by raising the value of it,
drew it to them; neither did any coin passe
here, but what carried the impressa of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which made no Nation send in money
to it.</p>
            <p>After this discourse, we did begin to debate,
whether in these times wherein the Country
swarmed with Traitors, a kinsman or friend
could in reason intercede for his friend or kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who was a Rebel? which one <hi>Philanax</hi>
alleaged was unlawfull; for else (said he) man
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:33161:182"/>
being naturally enclined to rebellion, (sparkling
ambition flying naturally upwards) if the fear
of punishment did not deter them, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
should increase immeasurably; and who
would fear, if friends would interceed for
them, and if intercession could ransom them?
and what Rebel wants some friend or kinsman?
but rather loyal persons should be ashamed of
such relations. Likewise men are born sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to their Prince, aswell as kinsmen to their
relations, and so nature requires subjection to
their Prince, as much as affection to their
friends: And as for friends, there can be no
friendship where there is no vertue, and there
can be no vertue where there is no loyalty, and
much perjury; and seing a kinsmans intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may make him guilty of all the blood that a
spared Traitor may spill, thereafter no man can
be obliged to interceed for a Traitor, though a
friend, no more than he can be obliged to comit
murder upon his accompt. And since it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematick
in Law, whether a father ought to
dilate his son, who hatcheth rebellion, or shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him after it is once committed, doubtless it
will determine, that a friend (whose relation
is remoter than that of a father) should not
interceed (seing to interceed is to shelter) for
a notorious Rebel.</p>

my discourse hath been tedious, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
impossible, your soul being a vessell,
which can hold no more than is measured by

that I can never serve your Lordship enough;

            <p>THe hard-hearted ice had now dissolved
it self in tears, through rage to see it
self conquered by its enemy the Sun,
who advancing to his former height,
from which that rebel, Winter, had degraded
him, was sending forth his beams in troops, to
subdue Winters auxiliaries; and in that sweet
moneth of <hi>May,</hi> wherein the earth, as a badge
of her gratefulness to the Summer, begins to
put on its livery; and when the air layes aside
that vail of thick mist, wherein it lapped it
self during the coldnesse of the Winter. In a
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:33161:183"/>
sweet morning of that sweet season, the two
Ladies, <hi>Agapeta</hi> and <hi>Aretina,</hi> who had lien
together the last night (resolving to overtake
the Sun in bed) did rise very early, leaving
their Waiting-maids lying in <hi>Morpheus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
who was begetting on them that bastard
babe called Laziness; and so were necessitated
to play the hand-maid to each other, which
was notwithstanding no great task, seing their
cloathes seemed most willing to hing upon
them, as if they knew how much they were
honoured by being theirs. Yet the Ladies were
no sooner entered the Garden, than they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Sun walking in the heavens, who
had risen that morning sooner than formerly,
to view that pleasant prospect which the earth
afforded him; and, like an indulgent father,
seemed to rejoyce, to see those lillies and roses,
which were the off-spring of his own rayes. At
the corner of a hedge they encountred <hi>Megi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
and <hi>Philarites,</hi> who were signetting that
sweet air, with the yet more sweet names of
their matchless Mistrisses. <hi>Philarites</hi> would
willingly have tendered his respects to them,
but his heart, which did climb up his throat, as
if it would have propined it self to <hi>Aretina,</hi>
had already stopt the passage: which <hi>Megistus</hi>
perceiving, and bowing, as if he would have
by that posture, shewed the Ladies how much
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:33161:183"/>
he esteemed himself below them: Fair Ladies,
said he, if our attendance upon you might suit
with your diet and quiet, we should court the
imployment with thousands of wishes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
our selves of it with all possible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> replied <hi>Agapeta,</hi> seing we
cannot meliorate you by our society, we dare
not vex you by such fruitlesse attendance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any thing in such a barren imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby ye could advantage your alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
accomplisht spirits, except in evidencing the
strength of your patience, in vanquishing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anxiety the importunacy and impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of two, rather innocent than well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht
Ladies. Accomplishments, said <hi>Megi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
were very imprudent if they choosed not
to lodge in such rare bodies as yours are; for,
I am confident they may travel the world over,
before they finde any such other receptacles;
and as for us, seing nature glories of you as of
her master-pieces, the best of men, and much
more we, may be vain of the title of your
servants; an honour rather to be wished than
merited. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> answered <hi>Aretina,</hi> if
nature had intended to glory in our shapes, she
would have made us <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Philarites,</hi>
whose praises are so large and numerous, that
no mouth is large enough to contain them, but
all mouths run over of them; and to express
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:33161:184"/>
whose praises, duty endeavours to make each
tongue eloquent. Incomparable Ladies, said
<hi>Philarites,</hi> we have acted nothing since our
arrival here, but what we have acted as your
servants, so that if men admire us, it is because
we are persons upon whom ye are pleased to
lay your commands (attributing that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
which is the meer effect of favour) and
so by telling us that we are admired, ye remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
us of those vast obligations which we owe
you. Well, Sir, replied <hi>Aretina,</hi> since ye have
disarmed my tongue of complement, and hath
turned the edge of my own weapon against me,
it were high time to yeeld, to which I am the
rather willing, that I know that all that I can
yeeld to you, is yours by merit formerly; for
since we owe our lives to you, and since all that
a man hath he will give for his life, it is clear,
that ye may challenge as yours, all that we
could bestow as our own. <hi>Agapeta</hi> desired
them to end these complements, and that each
of them would remark something in that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
where every thing was remarkable, and
that I may begin, look how the flourish peeps
out of its green palace, to behold this sweet
moneth, and to smell that excellent perfume,
wherewith the Sun hath poudered the heads
of the undergrowing hills. <hi>Aretina</hi> remarked
how time had borrowed youth from an old
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:33161:184"/>
apple-tree, to lend it to a young cherry-tree
which grew not far from it, whose coat was
so long worn, that it was now all in rags; See
ye not (continued she) how it hath stood so

provided a staff for its age to lean upon? and
yet in spight of age, ye see how its fruits do
flourish, ripening alwayes as the tree grows
old, and bringing seeds in their bosome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to plenish the earth after they are gone,
and the tree fallen. Observe, fair Ladies, said
<hi>Megistus,</hi> how these red roses blush, and these
tulips grow pale, through anger to see their
beauty so outstript by yours, and how these
cherries, albeit they be but hard hearted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yet understand their duty so well as bow
downwards to do you obeisance, and would
willingly throw themselvs at your feet, if their
stalks did not hinder them; and how yonder
pond hath drawn your picture, and placed it in
its bosome, presenting it to you when ye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
to indicate the high value it sets upon
your beauty, and concealing it when ye are
gone, fearing lest any should rob it. <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
recommended to them, to advert, how
the gods had cleared the sky purposely that
morning, that they might have the fuller view
of them; and how the grass propi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shoes with their pearly drops, which seemed
to kiss their feet in token of subjection. This
gave them occasion to laugh at one anothers
pretty conceits, wherein their wanton inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
seemed to sport themselves.</p>
            <p>After this, they went to repose themselves
a little in an Arbour, where all the branches
had laid their heads together, to resist the
scorching Sun, and to shelter those who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
under its protection, and whose walls like
strainers, did separate the light from the heat,
keeping out the one, and letting in the other;
refuting thereby the opinion of some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who opinion that light is nothing but
fire dilated, and that fire is nothing but light
contracted. <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Agapeta</hi> stayed a
little behind, both that they might the more
freely entertain one another, and that they
might give <hi>Philarites</hi> the conveniency of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
<hi>Aretina,</hi> who finding that none eyed
him, threw up his eyes, as if he durst not fix
them upon <hi>Aretina,</hi> and passionatly sighed up
these few words. O heavens, what favour
have I done you, that ye should lend me this
hand? or rather, wherein have I offended you,
that ye should, as a punishment, crown my
soul in this ocean of joy? Can I, miserable
<hi>Philarites,</hi> be so happy, as to find an occasion
of evidencing to <hi>Aretina,</hi> how that his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:33161:185"/>
depends solely upon her? Whereto <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
smiling, replyed, Can passion conquer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable
<hi>Philarites?</hi> or, is it <hi>Philarites</hi>
pleasure, to act the personage of an enamorato,
to testifie how exquisit he is, not only in real
vertue, but even in apparent passion? <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
would have proceeded further, but was
interrupted by the cryes of one who came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to him, and who look'd like one who had
propined his wit to love for his Mistris sake,
thinking all donatives besides, unworthy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
for so divine a passion; his flaming zeal
which had stayed within so long as there was
any thing unconsumed for it to feed upon, did
now flash abroad at his nostrils, and by its
smoak had obfuscated his native colour: his
eyes by their rolling and continual motion, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
that they missed the object, whereon
they desired to fix their rayes; and the variety
of his motions, shew the lightness of the body
which was moved, his words were cut to
pieces by his inconsiderate irresolution, and the
torrent of his discourse resembled a river,
which the broader it grows, grows always the
shallower; such was the heat of his passion,
that it made him tear off all his cloaths, and his
looks and thoughts strove, which should change
oftest. This was the miserable <hi>Moragapus,</hi>
who was enamoured of a young Lady called
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:33161:186"/>
               <hi>Calista,</hi> who gave him a very kindly requittal
of his love, which an Alexandrian Gallant,
who was his rival, perceiving, perswaded him
that <hi>Calista</hi> had deserted him, and had bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her affection upon another; whereupon
<hi>Moragapus,</hi> who lived then in the Country,
desires to return to the City, but was impeded
by his father, who conjectured his errand, and
who protested withall, that as he had fettered
himself by love, so he should be fettered by
chains, if he turned not proselyte to a fathers
entreaties. This made <hi>Moragapus</hi> melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and his melancholy did dictate to him some
expressions, which enraged his father, so that
he hermitaged him in a chamber, denying him
company, which was the sole cure of his sick
fancy, and diversion, which was the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
mean to recover him out of his frantick
love: this restraint did fully fling him over the
rock of distraction, upon whose edge he stood
formerly (passion resembling those spiritfull
horses, who stir most and are maddest, when
the bridle is most straitly held by the rider; and
men resembling oft fine cloathes, which corrupt
most when they are kept closest; and the will
is of the nature of these things, which spill by
being packed up in too narrow bounds) and
thereafter he became so demented, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they kept him formerly under restraint for
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:33161:186"/>
prevention, they were obliged to do it now,
through necessity: at last the mercilesse fire
having one night seized upon his fathers house,
he was brought out, and amidst the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
wherein all were involved at that time, he
escapes their hands, and comes streight to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and finding the Garden door open,
he enters, and apprehends <hi>Aretina</hi> to have
been <hi>Calista,</hi> whereupon he runs to her, and
flings himself at her feet, quivering out the
irregular notes of his ill tune'd passion; leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from sentence to sentence, and sometimes
running over one sentence twice, till <hi>Aretina,</hi>
sorry to see this tyranny of madnesse, assured
him, that <hi>Calista</hi> was in another corner of the
Garden, which information posts him away,
(his light body being easily blown away by the
least puft of perswasion) and accidentally he
spieth <hi>Calista</hi> walking upon the brink of a deep
pond, which was hemmed in with marble, he
no sooner spies her, but he runns to her, and
she no sooner spies him, but that terrified with
the unexpectednesse of the sight, (for it had
been concealed from her) and fearing some
outrage, she offered to step back, but her gown
feltring her feet, trips up her heels, so that she
falls in the pond, her weight and haste carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to the bottom: but the water, which
seemed to glory that so rich a pearl was to be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:33161:187"/>
found there, did throw her body presently up
again, as if it intended to shew that she was
in its possession; yet albeit the water shew
her, she could shew no appearance of life, for
death (that rather tyrant than conquerour)
who like a rigid creditor, exacts of us that last
debt oftimes before the ordinary term of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
had possest it self of all the chief forts
of her soul, and had displayed his ordinary
standard, paleness, in her face, to shew that
the place was conquered: at her fall, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did flee circular-wise from her body, fearing
to be accessory to the murder of so choice a
person, and look'd drumely at so tragick a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;
yet she might have escaped, if the
thrice infortunate <hi>Moragapus</hi> had not leapt in
after her, and there by strugling to save her,
had not drowned both himself and her.</p>
            <p>The Knights and Ladies who knew nothing
of this sad occurrant, were sitting all this while
in the Arbor; and <hi>Megistus</hi> was remarking
from <hi>Moragapus</hi> looks (wherein all might
have read his distraction) how much they were
to blame, who blamed Phisiognomy, as an Art
both artless and uncertain: for, said he, seing
the dullest amongst men, may perceive by that
fellows looks, his madness; certainly others of
more prying spirits, and a more frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
may come to discern the nature of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:33161:187"/>
less observable looks, for there is not so great a
disproportion, betwixt those evidently known
looks, and others that are less discernable, than
there is betwixt an artlesse observation, and a
serious and experimental remark; for as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
clown, can see nothing in the face
of heaven, albeit a skilfull Astrologue can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostick
from it, what weather is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
So a skilfull Phisiognomist may perceive,
what is undiscernable by the eye of a skillesse
guesser: And we see, that different tempers
have different faces, the Melancholians looks,
differing for from those of a Flegmatician; and
so, since these temperaments are natural, we
may conclude, that the difference of those looks
which are proper to them, must be likewise na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and if natural, why not discoverable by
Art? seing it is natural to man, to know all
Natures operations: for, albeit there be many
Provinces in the Globe of Learning, which are
yet unknown (mans laziness restraining him
from such new adventures) yet the Needle of
Reason being observed, we may come to coast
Natures greatest difficulties. We see likewise
that a mans looks, changes as his thoughts,
which argues clearly, that there is some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
and dependance betwixt the thoughts
and looks: for, our bodies do resemble a lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
wherein that divine light, the soul, is
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:33161:188"/>
placed; and our faces are the horn through
which may be easily perceived, whether the
within shining light be in it self clear, or not;
and it would appear very suitable to divine
Providence, that ingenuity should wear some
badge whereby it may be known, and being
known may be respected; whereas roguery,
wearing its own colours, may be found out, and
so evited, lest else honest men should be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon all occasions by soulless knaves.</p>
            <p>Your sex is much obliged to this poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
said <hi>Agapeta,</hi> for he hath vindicated you
of that aspersion wherewith generally all men
are tainted, which is, That all their passion is
but simulate; wherefore, Sir, I could wish to
hear from you, whether men can be really ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
of such ugly faces at all, and whether
they can be so deeply taken with the best, as to
become distracted through missing them?</p>
            <p>Madam, replyed <hi>Megistus,</hi> providence seems
for ornament, to have filled the gallery of this
world with faces strangely different; yet, on
the other hand, when we consider, how the
most exquisit pencile is not able to draw two
faces in nothing unlike, we may judge, that this
variety hath been rather the effect of chance,
than pains; and if we consider what a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of thoughts are to be found in the world,
there being some dependance betwixt thoughts
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:33161:188"/>
and faces, we need not admire the difference of
faces: for, mans face being patched up of so
many traits and colours; and the eye (which
influenceth hugely upon the looks, the face
changing according to the difference of the eye,
as a picture doth by the several positions of an
optick glasse) being so varying in it self, it is
rather a wonder, to see how two faces should
be found any-wayes like, than that two faces
should be so dislike; wherefore, Nature having
produced all men and women to be coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and nothing being so able to couple
them as affection, it hath given several inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to men and women, whereby they are in
a manner constrained to love those different
faces; for, man being naturally incompleat,
needs a fellow-helper to accomplish him; and
as every piece will not serve to accomplish and
fill up the vacant room of what is wanting,
neither is it enough that it be either greater,
or of better stuff, So it is not sufficient, to make
a man love a woman, that she is of nobler ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
richer, or wittier than her whom
he loves: no, that is not sufficient, for it is
likewise requisit, that she be exactly adapted
to his fancy; for, if all men loved only those
who were wise, rich, or noble; there being
many women who can pretend to neither, there
should be many who behoved for ever to live
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:33161:189"/>
unmarried, and albeit a man may think that he
could marry any of many hundreds whom he
sees, yet he is in that mistaken; Not unlike an
Artisan who takes up several pieces, thinking
them fit enough to fill a void, which when he
applies he finds most unfit. And the difference
of the eyes which look, makes the difference
oft of what is looked upon; for as in a plain
glasse, that object seems great which is lessened
much by a concave mirrour; so some eyes
judge that beautifull, which others account
ugly; and if reason were imployed as the only
proxenet, yet we should see as much of this
variety in the love of faces, as we see there is
in the love of opinions; and as there is no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
so absurd but it will still find a patron;
so there should be no face so ugly, but it should
find a lover: And seing there would be such
different choices, even albeit reason were um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
what may we expect from fancy, whose
acts being but simple apprehensions, must be
more different than the acts of the judgment,
which never traces in any path except where
reason is its guide. And as to the other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
which your Ladyship proposed, Whether
loves storms may blow so furiously, as to shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our reason, and may appear so terrible as to
fright us out of our wits: I believe certainly,
Madam, that it may; for, as a person may
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:33161:189"/>
over-reach himself so, to the effect that he may
grasp that which is placed in a high place above
him, that he may disjoynt his body thereby;
so the soul of man may endeavour so to reach
up the hand of desire, that it may disjoynt it
self by its nimious attempt; and a mans reason
may flie for shame to see it self so disappointed,
as that what it desired most to enjoy, should
be enjoyed by another: And as the body may
weary it self so, in hunting and traversing to
and fro, as that it may by that immoderat tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
fall in some uncurable disease; so, the soul
may by too anxious cares run it self in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
distemper; Neither can I blame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
such a generous wit, as scorns to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
its own felicity, and who desires to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
nothing, after he understands that his
Mistris disaffections him; for then, the wit
which formerly served him as an ornamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
will then serve him only as a torturer. And
such a lover may appositly be compared to one
who draws a cord, or any thing else to him,
with such vehemency, that if it break, he must
undoubtedly fall; and his wits may be said to
leave their old residence, that they may by
roaving up and down, try if they can find her
whom they so much admire, and adore so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensly;
Yet, Madam, albeit I revere passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly
that divine vertue, Love, I cannot not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:33161:190"/>
but hate that species of it, which
being nursed by avarice, languishes thereafter in
discontentment (and no wonder that such foul
milk should occasion an ill tempered complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
neither can I comprehend how true lovers
can be soldered together by gold, a mettal
which the gods seems to have hid in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the earth, lest our avarice should have
taken notice of it; must that dross which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
only the impressa of some Monarch, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the rich mettal of true love? which
bears the effigies of the immortal gods, and
which is only forged in heavens mint-house,
whence nothing that is impure proceeds, and
where nothing that is pure is lacking: And
must the Suns bastard be preferred to that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
off-spring? Are <hi>Venus</hi> chains become
weaker than formerly through too much usage?
or hath the Suns continued influence, refined
gold to a greater excellency than it was of in
the dayes of our predecessors? Can avarice,
which ingendreth murders, rapines, thefts, and
rebellion, be the parent of so divine and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
vertues? or can that which cannot incite
a man to the acts of generation, be the basis of
that whereby all true generation is warranted?
as also there is much imprudence in this choice,
for gold having made a man dispense with the
tenderness, lameness, or uncomliness of a wife,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:33161:190"/>
she brings him forth such children, as that their
ugly shapes, and crabbed humours, makes him
ashamed to term himself their father; and
who needs more money to patch up those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
in each of them when they are to
be matched, than he received by his match with
their mother? beside what treasure he must
squander daily amongst Physicians and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
(from whom they must buy a lease
of their life) to maintain that ruinous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
which totters from the first day it was
founded; neither need I swell up this sum of
their fathers miseries, with either his inward
frettings, which must be as numerous as are
the views which he hath, either of his defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
wife, or formless children: or the outward
opprobries, wherewith he hears both her and
them daily aspersed, by jeering neighbours and
railing adversaries, who are glad to find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whereon to fix the teeth of their envie;
who will not miss to upbraid him with his
avarice, and them with their defects; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
there be no infallibility, yet there is much
probability in that conjecture, that such as is
the body, such must be the soul, Nature having
like a wise merchant, bestowed the finest cases
upon the richest Jewels or Watches. There are
lkewise another race of <hi>Cupids</hi> bastards, who
love assoon as they are acquaint, and these love
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:33161:191"/>
oft times because they are not well acquaint;
they love oft, before they try one anothers
tempers, and so joyn oft with those of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
tempers, and this being as opposit in their
humours, as fire, water, and the other elements,
they agree oft as these assimbolick elements do,
the one extinguishing the other, and the one
devouring the other; and as the conjunction
of these can never parentate any production, so
their copulations are oft barren, and never very
fruitfull. Neither do the inconveniencies which
accress from hence sist in their personal preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
only, but turns also to the prejudice of
many others, for of these two who are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
matched; the one might have been a good
wife, if she had marryed another husband, and
so it occasions that others misfortune; and the
other might have proven a good husband, if he
had married another wife; and so that match
hath occasioned that other womans prejudice.
Wherefore seing willing rashness marreth so
many marriages, I admire why Judges and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislators
should by constrained inconsideratness
occasion moe; for, if a fantastick youth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by a fond passion, do promise marriage
to a woman, they oblige him to marry her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e neither understand what is the strength
of a promise, nor the nature of marriage, a
thing in it self not so reasonable as legal; and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:33161:191"/>
yet, if straitly examined, will scarce be found
legal: for, if the consent or promise of a mad
man, or a fool, will not oblige him to a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
why should they who are both mad
and fond, either through love, or lust, be so
straitned? and that they are either ideots, or
furious, may be conjectured by the effects,
(which are the means whereby in all cases such
persons are dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>osced) for if they were not
such, they would never throw themselves away
upon such bargains, nor sell themselves and
their liberties at the rate of one hours pleasure;
and if we may justly account him distracted,
who sells an opulent fortune for a toy, how
much more may we conclude him such, who
exchanges his liberty, which is by far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than his fortune, for that which is much
worse than a toy? and if the Law rescinds bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
where the buyer is cheated in a half, why
should they confirm this, wherein he is cheated
in all, and where he gains nothing but discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
which is worse than nothing? and
if we will turn over the Records either of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
or experience, we will learn there, what
murders, rapins, and massacres have budded
from this same root, which this same promise
springs from, even from distracted love, whose
slames burns oft reason to ashes, and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
all the faculties of him with whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:33161:192"/>
and if the Law obliges not him, who
hath tied himself by a causeless paction, albeit
of the smallest importance; how can it tie him
to perform a promise which hath no cause, or
if it hath any, is such a cause, as is abominable
and filthy, and so rather invaliditats than cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborats
the thing promised; and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the expectation of a promise, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
many to whore, who otherwise would
continue chaste (many being content to sell
their chastity who would never bestow it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
and it is most sacrilegious to see that divine
contract, which should be only celebrated in
the temples of the immortal gods, celebrated
in bordels and whorish beds.</p>
            <p>This discourse ended, <hi>Agapeta</hi> entreated the
Knights to remove a little, to prevent miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
for, said she, our tender repute may
be easily wounded, except it be armed with
caution, and our favours which we bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you as strangers, will be certainly envyed,
except they be palliated by prudence: The
Knights, in obedience to their desire, removed
presently, leaving the Ladies to their private
entertainment, and congratulating their own
indicible happiness: but <hi>Philarites</hi> was scarce

that it was to recall him home, broke it open,

who perswaded him, presently to obey his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
For, said he, will ye hazard <hi>Aretina's</hi>
Crown by your lingring? or, would ye wish to
marry her, except ye had a Crown to bestow
upon her? or think ye, that she will mind him
who minds not his own businesse? Sir, Love
requires that ye should ensure your Ladies
Kingdom, Nature requires that ye should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
your old Father, Justice requires that ye
should punish Traitors, and Gallantry requires
that ye should rather follow, than flee dangers.
Let not your Valour be like the Physician, who
can cure others, but not himself: and whilst
those who know you not, talk of your courage
and conduct, let not your subjects, who know
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:33161:193"/>
you, smile at your esseminate cowardishnesse.</p>
            <p>This discourse determined the question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Philarites</hi> affection and his courage: so
leaving <hi>Megistus,</hi> he march'd streight to <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>'s
chamber, where finding her alone, <hi>(Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hropus</hi>
being gone to the country) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
waited on only by a chearful countenance,
and after a low obeisance made, he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
himself to her: Incomparable <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi>
my Fathers commands, and the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of my Nation, rather drives, than takes me
away from this place: neither is it so much to
ensure a Crown, as it is to ensure <hi>your</hi> Crown,
that I undertake this pilgrimage. If I wanted
natural affection, I were unworthy to be your
Servant; and if I wanted a Crown, I were
unworthy to be your husband: Wherefore I
come to beg your permission to return home, to
satisfie the one, and to fix the other; hoping
in my absence, to testifie my constancy, and by
my speedy return, to witness what a high value
I put upon your presence, in which I taste the
choicest of contentments, and without which
all things besides seems but tastless to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of my pleasure. <hi>Aretina</hi> surprized, but
not dejected at what she heard, did, much to
his satisfaction, deceive his expectation; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
him this sweet answer. <hi>Philarites,</hi>
Vertue and I are not at such odds, as that ye
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:33161:194"/>
must displease the one, to obey the other; no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Philarites,</hi> I am confident the gods will prove
a target to defend you, whilest ye prove the
sword of your family: my sex makes me fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet my experience makes me confident of
the unalterableness of your affection; and I
know you to be too generous in every thing
else, to prove base in that, wherein the basest of
men prove often generous. Wherefore go, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<hi>Philarites,</hi> victory waits for you; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
remember your friends, when either your
leisure, or pleasure, can steal an hour from your
more weighty imployments, and with that she
imbraceth him, and intreats him instantly to be
gone: for, said she, a womans courage should
be tryed, not tempted, and if ye would wish
me to pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vere, take from me by your speedy
removal, the means of repenting. <hi>Philarites</hi>
was confounded by this command; for albeit
she gave him leave to go, yet she did that with
so much grace, that it invited him once yet to
stay wholly. But whilst he was thus debating
what was fittest to be done, she fell upon an
expedient her self, of taking at her own hands
what she desired from him; for stepping in to
her closet, and closing the door, she left him
alone, obliged in civility to depart her chamber.
Yet in retiring, she glanced over her shoulder,
and then, only one tear broke the pr<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ison of her
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:33161:194"/>
fair eyes, prest out by the multitude of those
other tears which stood behind it; but no
sooner was she entered, but that unruly crowd
forced themselves a passage, and as a volley of
small shot, discharged themselves in honour of
<hi>Philarites</hi> intended voyage: who rather dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
than quenching his passion, went to
<hi>Agapeta's</hi> chamber, accompanied by <hi>Megistus,</hi>
to tender his respects to her, for his Majesty
was then gone abroad; to whom, immediatly
upon his return, he addressed himself, and by
whom he was dismist with many extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
testimonies of his singular affection to him,
ordering his Guards to wait upon him to the
utmost confines of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all the Ordnance
to send their shot a piece of the way with him:
he ordered likewise by the Lord Chamberlain,
that his Master of Ceremonies, should carry to
him some Jewels, and that the Kings Jeweller
should carry to him some Plate (for these were
the formalities of all those Nations) all which
he refused, accepting only from the hands of
<hi>Agapeta</hi> (to whom the King entrusted that
particular, hoping by the quality of the giver to
oblege him to accept the gift) his Majesties
Portrait, richly deckt with inestimable Jewels,
which he accepted, telling her, that he thought
himself much honoured, by having the means
when he pleased of coming in his Majesties
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:33161:195"/>
presence: and so he departed <hi>Alexandria,</hi> all
who met him, proffering him their attendance;
but he, acknowledging their courtesie, told
them, that his business with <hi>Megistus</hi> required
some retiredness: and thus they two rode out
together, followed only by <hi>Kalodulus,</hi> whom
<hi>Megistus</hi> commanded to wait upon <hi>Philari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and prest him further to accept of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
alleadging, that he could not now
abandon him in difficulties apparently greater,
and certainly such as related to him more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than those wherein they had been formerly
joyntly engaged; but <hi>Philarites</hi> declined it
most resolutely: for, said he, our affairs here
requires that one of us should be present, and
my pressures at home are not yet come to that
maturity, but that I alone may suppress them,
So that since your presence is necessary in the
one, and would be superfluous in the other, I
will entreat your stay; and if these weeds wax
higher, I will then, and not till then, entreat
your absence; and will in this play the wise
General, who keeps the choice of his forces as
a reserve, till the latter end of the day. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
locking themselves in one anothers arms,
they shewed more compassion than could be
expect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from men of such a vast courage, bold
mens veins and eyes being filled with bloud,
whereas those of compassionat men are filled
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:33161:195"/>
with tears, for those objects which move the
one to compassion, move the other to revenge;
We see ordinarily that steel cannot be softned,
nor can the fiery flint be hollowed by the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
drops of water, as the softer stones are:
yet sometimes sorrow, which cannot beget re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
nor ease it self that way, breaks out in
compassion, and when the heat of affection
tempers the steel of courage, it becomes plyable
at pleasure. After this <hi>Philarites</hi> ships in, and
by the help of the complacent winds (who
whistled like a waggoner to move the ship to
run more swiftly) in a short space, takes leave
of <hi>Megistu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> long-tracing eyes, who stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the shoar both sorrowfull, and glad of his
so ready passage. After a fortnights journey, he
arrives in <hi>Thracia,</hi> and writes to <hi>Evander</hi> his
father, to provide Coaches, Suits, and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for him, and shortly enters <hi>Bizantium</hi>
the capital City of <hi>Thracia,</hi> and passeth alongst
all its streets, with a cavalcade of all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry of the Nation, who, conscious
to their own guilt, and fearing that it would be
revealed by some of their Colleagues, each la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
by his discovery to prevent the rest of
the Complot: and thus, every one fearing to
speak to his neighbour of a Combination, they
acquiesce to what <hi>Philarites</hi> commanded; yet
he, desirous, like a good Physician, that that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:33161:196"/>
ulcer should ripen, that so it might break, and
purge the body of some pestilential humours,
suffereth some to be dissatisfied, who running
to their arms, flocked to one <hi>Philenus,</hi> a Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Nobleman, whom he had immediatly upon
his return secured, and whom he caused the
Jaylor suffer now to escape, who rendevouzed
shortly six thousand men; for he expected, if
not to gain the field by fighting, yet at least, to
ensure his life and estate by capitulation; to
which effect, he writes presently to <hi>Philarites,</hi>
promising to draw all under his command to
his Highness obedience, upon the security of
his life and fortune: This <hi>Philarites</hi> no sooner
received, but he dispatches copies of it to his
Agents in <hi>Philenus</hi> Armie, who disseminate
amongst the Soldiery <hi>Philenus</hi> treachery, who
used them only as means to gain his own, and
not their peace, which so alienated the hearts
of his dependers from him, that they quit him
peice-meal; whereof <hi>Philarites</hi> (who with
two Regiments of Horse waited this occasion)
being ascertained, falls upon him and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
and suffers few of them to escape;
which catastrophe of these bold rebels brought
the Nation to its former obedience.</p>
            <p>Let us again glance a little at <hi>Aretina;</hi> upon
whom <hi>Ophni</hi> Duke of <hi>Iris</hi> had look'd through
the prospect of respect; which usually aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:33161:196"/>
all things that are represented by it;
which dye had tinctured so all his thoughts, as
that neither the soap of pains, nor the Fullers
earth of reason, were able to return them to
their former colour: love being like pitch, which
no sooner touches than it sticks; and which
when it once sticks, can hardly be removed:
wherfore finding that this barbed arrow which
<hi>Cupid</hi> had stuck in him, could not be drawn
back, without leaving its head in the wound,
he resolves to drive it forward, and resolves
either to lose himself, or to gain her; seing
without her, he concluded himself fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
and albeit the vastness of her fortunes
(being only heir to a potent Duke) were gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
mountains, over which his meaner condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(being low in his estate) could scarce
scramble; and which being past, the difficulties
were not yet all overcome, for she was yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by her fathers honours, and her own
beauty; to batter all which ramperts, he could
bring no other engyns, besides those of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
patience, and confidence: but alas, poor
<hi>Ophni,</hi> the fort of her affection is strongly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the high thoughts she hath of <hi>Philari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and is provisioned daily by the perswasions
and cunning of <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Agapeta,</hi> and all
the avennues of her servants and familiars are
already blocked up with gold (cemented with
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:33161:197"/>
civility) by <hi>Philarites</hi> during his last residence
at Court; and as to thy pains, these small ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
will never reach her, love being like to
these shapes which are casten in a mould, which
if they be not rightly moulded at the very first,
can never (or at least hardly) be helpt by any
future endeavours; and the wild fancy is of
the nature of all other untamed beasts, which
must be taken at a start, else can hardly be laid
hold upon.</p>
            <p>He endeavours by company, to conjure away
these hopgoblin fancies, but all in vain; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
whilst he is with his friends it leaves him,
yet no sooner leaves he them, but instantly it
returns to him; for albeit a melancholian may,
like an ill-going clock, have the <hi>index</hi> of his
humour put right by the hand of a friend, or of
company, yet the in-works of his soul being
distempered by that corrupt rust, he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
run wrong as formerly. Finding no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacement
here, he wanders in woods and groves
(the ordinary galleries of such enamorato's)
but there he is more distempered than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for those fancies which could not follow
him foot for foot in the crowd of Court, finds
now room to walk side for side with him; for
meditation being but a digested representation
of what species and ideas were hudled up in the
memory formerly, it can do nothing else, but
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:33161:197"/>
make a <hi>more</hi> of what was but a <hi>much</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and so, if it find a man to have much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or piety, it will make him to have more
of both; whereas if it find him to have much
impiety, or passion, it will screw them up to a
greater height: and hence springs that proverb,
that a solitary person must be either a Saint or
a Devil; for, it being an extraordinary custom,
it must argue an extraordinary <hi>genius;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
meditation be a mirrour wherein one may
see himself represented without errour or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
yet it is such a mirrour as is the Sea,
which if troubled, can represent no object
whatsoever: Even so, if meditation be tossed
with the storms of passion, its surface can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
nothing but horrour. And man being
sociable naturally, as we see by all the faculties
of his soul, and number of his senses, which
were useless, if he were cloistred up in an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage:
for, why was the tongue given him,
but to express to others his own thoughts, and
to answer theirs? why his ears, but to hear
others, &amp;c. doubtless therefore his retiredness
must be supernatural; and so either angelical,
or diabolick. And the gods by distributing some
perfections to one, some to another, have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
us either not to aim at any further
accomplishment, or if we do, to learn it from
one another; and how can that be done but in
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:33161:198"/>
society? As also, in heaven we shall be fully
happy; and yet there shall be there no hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
but we shall cleave together; which
evidences, that hermitage and happiness roul
not upon the same axletree. But neither could
<hi>Ophni</hi> sing a <hi>requiem</hi> to his passion here, for
his love presents to him the disparity of their
fortunes, and this starts avarice; his love mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to him all those who may pretend to be
his rivals, and that starts up his envie, or at
least, a passion less vertuous than emulation:
his love terrifies him with the numbers of her
fathers honours, and that puffs up his ambition.
And thus hounded by all these raging passions,
he knows not where to run, nor how to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
he tumbles down upon the ground, as if
like an itchy horse, he meant to ease himself by
rubbing with it; and immediately starting up,
with his arms crost, he pawes with his foot, as
if he intended to beat the earth, because it could
not relieve him; but finding the earth could
not help him, he throws up his eyes to heaven
(an ordinary posture even amongst disconsolat
Atheists, fore-ordained by providence to prove
their dependance upon supernal powers) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the other goddesses had taken her up
there, to be their colleague. After this he turns
to the by-running streams, but they glide away
so swiftly, as that they will not stay to hear
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:33161:198"/>
him; and the fishes, as if it were in derision,
leaps up, to shew him what a priceless thing is
freedom. The inhospital air likewise, to aggrege
his misfortunes, no sooner receives his dolean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but each part of it, as if it were weary of
them, posts them away immediatly to another
part yet remoter, and at last refuses flatly to
carry them any further: he vexes to see the
crows, like frugal masters of families, build their
nests, and feed their young ones; and to see
those organists of heaven, the chanting larks,
from their natural cage the firmament, quiver
out their melodious notes, the air opening it
self willingly to receive such a pleasant harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
and all these free from court care, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
affection; whereas he, who brags of
being created the master of all these, hath his
head toiled with the cares of his family, and his
breast burnt with the flames of love. At last,
being refused shelter by all these, he addresses
himself to that bold undertaker, confidence;
who perswades him to return to Court, and
promised to make way for him. I am (said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence)
that skilfull Physician, who hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thousands of patients, after that others
have condemned them to die; I am that bold
Warriour who hath oft recruited desperat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and by my hands have gallant and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
Ladies been thrown in the arms, of by
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:33161:199"/>
them despised Gentlemen. Goutish fear is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
able to overtake his prey, and he stands so
long hearkning to reason, that the bird is flown
before he come to the nest; I strike so oft that
I must kill at sometime; and I rally so sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that I can never be beaten, or if I be beat,
none dares twit me, lest I fall foul on them also.
And I pray you (continued confidence) as a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
favour is the greatest prize in the world, so
her refusal is one of the smallest affronts: for,
since all men confesse that none can sufficiently
merit a Ladies favour, what wrong is done, or
what affront is received in not obtaining what
was not merited; and seing a womans choice
is attributed to her fancy, what wise man will
esteem you a whit the worse, that her fancy
conceited that ye were worse than ye are? He
may be a good archer who misses his mark once,
and an excellent merchant who loses one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture:
choice things are like diamonds of
the rock, to gain which, pains are required; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the lame hands of fear, fit to dig in the
mine of golden love. Fear is a cold humour,
and so extinguisheth these divine fires, whereas
courage is an oyl fit to conserve it. She loves
you possibly, albeit she proclaims it not; and
there may be fire in that which seems only an
hard flint; she intends like all other women, to
set a price upon her affection by the difficulty
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:33161:199"/>
of obtaining it, and will have the race to be long,

            <p>To extricate himself from these jarring debates,

that he gains by her mediation her husbands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;

               </gap>ms, and that
the second should have the Dutchy of <hi>Iris.</hi> To
which <hi>Ophni</hi> agrees, since the honour of his own
family was not in the least obfuscated thereby,
which was to be maintained intire, in the person
of his second son. This being agreed to, betwixt
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:33161:200"/>
               <hi>Ophni</hi> and the parents, they begin to sound the
daughters inclinations, and her mother presses
first, that she should marry, that the estate might
be entailed upon her; whereas if she who was
her mother, dyed, her father might marry a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
wife, and so settle the estate upon her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>Aretina</hi> seems not to heed that discourse

distracted with rage, and confounded with
shame, trembling by the chilness of the one, and
burning by the heat of the other; cursing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for the niggardly allowance of strength it
had bestowed upon him; and his own heart, for
daring to engage in a quarrel which it was not
able to maintain. Yet <hi>Monanthropus</hi> and his
Lady, who valued not much such trifling affronts,
did prosecute their former intention, but with
very bad success: for <hi>Aretina,</hi> who could never
remember <hi>Philarites</hi> but with affection, could
never remember <hi>Ophni</hi> but with disdain: neither
could her affection taste any more satisfaction in
his society, than a stomach which is full already

ordinary dish which is set before it. Which at last
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:33161:203"/>
               <hi>Ophni</hi> perceiving, he resolved to undermine, what

            <p>
               <hi>Monanthropus</hi> had now retired to hsi own
Country-house, for a fortnight, where <hi>Ophni</hi>
goes to give him a visit, after that he had first hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a Pirat, who frequented those coasts, to go
and lye before the house secretly. At his coming
there he deals with <hi>Aretina's</hi> Nurse (whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all her servants his bribes, and her Mothers
commands, had gained to his faction) to tryste
<hi>Aretina</hi> down to the shoar one morning very
early, where she was no sooner come, than the
Pirat who waited behind a rock with fourteen
men, falls upon her, and her Nurse, and Maids,
and makes them prisoners; which <hi>Ophni</hi> at some
distance perceiving, comes running to them, with
his sword drawn, as if he would have rescued
her, and begins to combat with the Pirat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he who held <hi>Aretina,</hi> holding a sword to
her breast, swore that he should kill her, if he
yeelded not: This seemed so to prevail with him
(joyned to the cryes of her hellish Nurse, who
knew all the mysterie) that he submits, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
their prisoner, and are all carried a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
<hi>Aretina's</hi> Maid only excepted; whom
<hi>Ophni</hi> had ordered, that she should be suffered
to escape, both fearing that she favoured too
much <hi>Philarites,</hi> as also, that she might inform
<hi>Monanthropus,</hi> that <hi>Ophni</hi> was not accessory to
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:33161:203"/>
the plot, but rather testified much courage in
fighting, and much affection in rather yeelding,
than that she should have suffered by his resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
At their entry a ship-board, the Pirat te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
very much respect to <hi>Aretina,</hi> protesting
that he had no design in her surprisal, but only
to oblige her father thereby to mediate his peace
with the King: For which reason likewise, he
thought himself most fortunate, in having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped
<hi>Ophni,</hi> whose friends at Court might be
very stedable to him: wherefore he permitted
them for their mutual solacement to stay all day
long in one cabine, allowing each of them a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cabine at night. But all these opportunities,
albeit seconded with much importunity, both
from <hi>Ophni,</hi> and the old Nurse, could not pull
<hi>Aretina's</hi> ear so low, as to hear what they pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ed
in relation to that match; she seemed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
those dangers, which would doubtless
have seemed terrible to others; For, as she said
one day to the Master, high spirits were like high
mountains, whose tops being abvoe the cloudy
firmament, were no wayes troubled with the
storms and tempests which molest the valeyes;

which scarce the greatest windes could move out
of their places; these discourses astonisht the

               </gap>yrate, and rendered <hi>Ophni</hi> yet more desperate

               </gap>hen formerly; finding that neither fear nor
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:33161:204"/>
love, necessity nor affection, were able to effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
his design; for when he spoke to her of his
passion, she told him that neither the present
place, nor her present humour could permit her
to treat of such matters; which required calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of spirit, and the assistance of friends, of both
which she was destitute at that present; as also,
that she was confident, the world would miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
that love, whose birth-place was a prison;
and would blame that choice, which was made
when there was none else present to be chosen.</p>
            <p>These endeavours were unexpectedly blasted
by an accident, which manifested how much the
divine powers affected that match, betwixt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites</hi>
and <hi>Aretina,</hi> which they themselves had
at first made. For <hi>Aretina</hi> one morning, alledging
that she was indisposed, entreated the Pirate to
set her ashoar to take the air, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she heard that the coast whereupon they
failed was the coast of <hi>Thracia,</hi> where she knew
her dear <hi>Philarites</hi> residenced for the time. To
which the Pirate, at the entreaty of <hi>Ophni,</hi> after
some reluctancy, condescended, knowing that the
adjacent Land was a meer Wood and Desert,
where no surprisal was to be feared; and suffered
<hi>Ophni</hi> to go alongst with her, in company with
himself and twelve others of his train, well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and after they had sent one to view the shoar,
who returned, assuring them that all was secure:
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:33161:204"/>
They came ashoar themselves, and for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
went up to a pleasant Wood, where the
thickness of the trees afforded them a pleasant
shade. They were but immediatly seated, when
the clashing of armour near the shoar, invited
their curiosity to try who were the combatants,
and so starting up, they perceived two Knights,
disputing with equal courage, a quarrel wherein
their fury made <hi>Ophni</hi> believe that they were
much interessed. <hi>Ophni</hi> who never used to be an
idle spectator of such disputes, girding himself in
the Pirats armour, after he had past his parole to
return a ship-board (lest else his complot with
the Pirate might have been discovered) he runs
down to them, offering to be umpire betwixt
them: But they were so busied with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that they had neither time, nor desire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
or thank him for his proffer. At last the
Knight with the black feathers called to the
other, to leave off their groundless combat, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, that <hi>Aretina</hi> was the only Lady living,
for whom he carried any affection; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he had spared to strike at him hitherto, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
only his own defence, yet hereafter
he was to expect no further favour: and as to
<hi>Arethusa</hi> he disclaimed any interest in her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what all others of her sex and endowments
might justly challenge. The other (who because
of his mask) was only to be designed by his buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:33161:205"/>
of white and red feathers, throwing imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
down his sword, lighted from his horse,
and craved the other pardon; protesting, that
next to <hi>Arethusa,</hi> he would honour him above
all the world. Whilst they are thus imbracing
one another, <hi>Ophni</hi> who raged to hear <hi>Aretina</hi>
owned by any besides himself, cryes, Sir, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you are who wears the black feathers, you
must satisfie justice for daring pretend to <hi>Areti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
favour, and before ye depart from this place,
my sword shall punish such unpardonable arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
and with that drawing upon him, he forced
the Knight with the black feathers to depute his
sword to answer for him, and in sharper terms
than <hi>Ophni</hi> expected; for at the second blow,
<hi>Ophni</hi>'s armour suffered the black feathered
Knights sword to enter at a breach, which his
strength had made for it, near the heart, out of
which, in a very short time the life issued out,
waited upon by a floud of blood, running away, as
it seemed, from the merciless hand of pale death.
The Pirat and his attenders perceiving <hi>Ophni</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
had hitherto keeped back, fearing to rob
him by their assistance, of a victory which might
possibly endear him to <hi>Aretina,</hi> but now seeing
him fall at his enemies feet, did run down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
a death, which with so much grief they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented:
the two Knights did joyntly encounter
them with so much courage and resolution, that
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:33161:205"/>
four of these Pirats were killed before either of
the Knights had received one wound, and whilst
the Knight with the black feathers was dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another, two Gentlemen who missing their
Master the black Knight in the morning, had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him thither, came galloping up, one whereof
struck the head from a fellow who was drawing
a blow to strike his Master. The other Knight
likewise had by killing the master Pirat, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the other two to flee to their boat; but they
were easily overtaken by these two Gentlemen,
who were on hors-back, from whom they begged
their lives upon their knees, which was granted
them, and so they were brought back to the two
Knights; the one whereof, and who wore the
black feathers, was the generous <hi>Philarites,</hi> who
stood disarming <hi>Ophni,</hi> whose head-piece he no
sooner took off, than he knew him to be his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friend the Duke of <hi>Iris,</hi> to whose civilities
he had been so much addebted during his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
at the Court of <hi>Egypt:</hi> it astonisht him
to see the Duke in that place, and it grieved him
to consider that his sword should have put him
in that condition: and albeit he remembred how
the quarrel was for <hi>Aretina,</hi> yet friendship pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him to a compassionat resentment, and to
deck the mournfull hearse of the Duke of <hi>Iris</hi>
with pearly tears; albeit he could not but hate
the lover of <hi>Aretina:</hi> But whilst <hi>Philarites</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:33161:206"/>
eyes were writing in tears <hi>Ophni's</hi> epitaph, <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
(whom her two keepers had abandoned) not
knowing who these Knights were, had flung her
self at his feet; but no sooner raised she her
eyes, nor threw he down his, but the rayes which
were darted from either, seemed to know one
another at their first approach, and posted as it
were back to acquaint the body from whom they
were sent, what a strange encounter they had
met with. <hi>Philarites</hi> no sooner perceived that
this was the divine <hi>Aretina,</hi> than presently rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her with both his hands, he throws himself
at her feet, who was lying at his formerly, and
with an accent which spoke passion, he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
himself. Peerless <hi>Aretina,</hi> it is a crime to
doubt who thou art, seing none resembles thee;
or, how can he forget thee, who minds nothing
besides thee? for the meanest of those hundred
curious traits (which are but mean when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with what we see not) is able to convince
the dullest amongst men, that ye are doubtlesse
<hi>Aretina;</hi> and the only thing which disswades me
from believing it, is, that my destiny hath been so
hard formerly, that I can hardly now believe that
it would permit <hi>Aretina</hi> to land in a place where
<hi>Philarites</hi> might be serviceable to her. Here
<hi>Aretina</hi> interrupted him, saying, That he was
injurious to the most and ever just gods, in alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that they favoured not a person of his high
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:33161:206"/>
deserts; neither were his petty afflictions to be
listed amongst real misfortunes: for as the earths
off-spring is ripened by the cold and dark nights,
aswell as by the hot and bright Sunshines; even
so, generous minds are accomplisht oft-times as
much (if not more) by their misfortunes, aswell
as by their success: wherfore use moderatly this
occasion, which ye seem so to value, and lose not
by your insolence that affection in <hi>Thracia,</hi>
which your modesty &amp; patience gained in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, she entreated him to lead her to
some retired house, where she might recreate her
weather-beaten body; which sickness formerly,
and joy now both had, and did infeeble extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for our life being a lamp, it cannot no more
be said to burn well, when by the nimious heat
of joy it is all on a fire; then when cold melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
seems to extinguish its flames. By this time
the other Knight, who was the renowned <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobulus</hi>
had come up, and after his surprisal (oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by the extraordinariness of <hi>Aretina's</hi>
beauty) was somewhat over-past, he accoasted
her thus. Madam, I hope ye will pardon me for
calling in question what you are; for my heart,
as a subject to the divine <hi>Arethusa,</hi> hath taken
oaths of supremacy and alleagiance, whereby it
is bound to acknowledge none her equal, either
in beauty or endowments; wherefore, Madam,
I wish ye were no mortal, lest your being such
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:33161:207"/>
should tempt me to commit treason against her
beauty, by forcing me to acknowledge that it is
but second to yours. <hi>Arethusa's</hi> beauty (replied
<hi>Aretina)</hi> is so much noted and admired by all
who have but heard the smallest catalogue of
beauties recited, that it's rather a jest than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
to place such an ordinary face as mine in
one file with hers, to whom it were a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to say that my face and hers had any traits
that were common to both; the one having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and the other wanting nothing, which the
proudest amongst men can esteem praise-worthy.
After this they retired to an house of pleasure,
which <hi>Philarites</hi> father had caused build for
himself, whilst he was young; and which <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
self had caused repair and replenish, wherein
he did often solace himself with the remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of her whom he now enjoyed; after their
arrival, <hi>Aretina</hi> fetcht a short walk about that
sweet place; which lurked in the bosom of a
wood, fearing (as it were) to be discerned by
any, upon the brink of a shallow river, to whose
bottom the weakest eye might easily travel; and
whose streams mumured as they past by, because
they were not suffered to stay longer in so sweet
a place; and where the hand of accident, had
carved in the surface of the over-topping rocks,
thousands of various shapes and figures, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
a melancholy fancy, and which, like a stone
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:33161:207"/>
book, seemed full of apprehensive <hi>memento's.</hi>
Here <hi>Philarites</hi> used oft to read, as he imagined,
the story of his love. Something represented to
him <hi>Aretina,</hi> something <hi>Agapeta,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
his kind friend <hi>Megistus.</hi> At other times
he thought them emblems of his love, and at a
third time, he thought them horoscopes of his
good or ill fortune, accordingly as he himself was
for the time affected. After this they entered a
chamber, wherin pleasure had made parade of all
her richest furnitur, and here, whilst the supper
was a preparing, and <hi>Arist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bulus</hi> was gone to
sleep after his long watching, occasioned by his
torturing jealousie; <hi>Aretina</hi> leaning upon a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
(in at which the vine and orange trees see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to peep, as if they desired to admire the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuousness
of the room) entreated to hear a brief
relation of his adventures since his departure
from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam (replyed <hi>Philarites)</hi> my journey was
rather pleasant than memorable: for after that
a gentle gale had civilly convoyed me over to
<hi>Lacedemon,</hi> as if I had been related to <hi>Neptunes</hi>
family. I landed at <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pis,</hi> where I did meet a great
many officious servants, some whereof carried
my boots, and others my spurrs, and I believe
some were so willing to testifie their respects to
me, that they would have carried my purse also,
if I would have suffered them: At supper my
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:33161:208"/>
Landlord came to taste my wine, and alleadging
it was not good enough, desired the Drawer to
fetch some out of another tun, which liked him
not neither, wherefore he desired (after he had
chided him) that he should bring some of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
colour; but finding that my servant grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
(which was really to see so much wine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon us by a cheat) he rose himself from
the table, and as if my servant had been offended
at the badnesse of the wine, he said that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
should go fetch some better, and albeit my
servant entreated him to stay, telling him that he
was mistaken, yet he would needs go, craving us
still pardon for his Drawers mistake: so down
he goes, and brings up that same wine which had
been presented to us formerly in a flaggon, and
fearing lest my servant should discern that it was
but little more than half full, he did out of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to my Lordship, fill it himself; and pouring
it in a glass, coloured somewhat like the wine, to
conceal its sophistication, he holds it up to the
candle, sweating that it was a lovely wine, but
that it had ripened no where so well that year as
it did the last. His discourse all the time of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
was in praise of the Egyptian Nobility,
whose generosity and liberality he commended
much, without mentioning any other vertue. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
supper, he caused remove my clogbag out of
my servants chamber (as my servant told me
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:33161:208"/>
afterwards) telling the Chamberlain, that albeit
he served a Nobleman, yet he knew by his looks
and deportment, that he was a Gentleman, and
so it was not fit so to embarass his chamber;
but to morrow he made us pay for that chamber
also, alledging that if it had been void, he might
have had a guest for it, but if that occasion had
not offered, we should not have payed for it.
Thereafter when I askt why there were so many
cheaters in that Town? they told me, that all
frontier Towns were so: for being accustomed
with strangers, whom they prefumed ignorant of
all prices, they extortioned them at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>The next morning I took horse, and having
dined at <hi>Elpis,</hi> I strayed in the afternoon, and
could find no house, till at last the dark clouds
clad in the nights livery, did usher their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
mistris into our hemisphere, and told me,
that after that darknesse did set its guard, stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were not permitted to passe. Wherefore I
retired to a castle, which I saw afar off; and by
the time I came to it, the charitable heaven had
set forth its lanthorn the Moon to shew passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
the road: and as I entered at the gate, I saw
a poor fellow helping an old bridle at the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine:
My servant thinking it had been the host<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
called to him to hold the horses: but at last
came one of the servants, who hanging out the
sign of a, <hi>Please your Worship</hi> to that poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:33161:209"/>
gave us to understand that he was a Knight,
he advances to us, and told us that we were out
of the road; for <hi>Thesbone</hi> the next Village was
but two leagues off, where we would be very
well accommodated; but <hi>Kalodulus</hi> assured me
that it was three, and entreated me to stay:
wherefore I at last perceiving that this was the
Master of the house (who stood helping his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
at the Moonshine to save a candle) I told
him, that I behoved to stay that night. This
made him reply, that he could not accommodate
me, for all his furniture was transported to his
other house. At this reply, his son who was an
ideot, cryed out, <hi>Ha, ha, father, devil another
house have ye.</hi> This put the father out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
but he desired us not to notice what he
said. At last, overcome by our importunity, he
rather suffered than invited us to advance, and
welcomed us as an old miser welcomes death,
when the Physician assures him that he cannot
live: but all the sport was, to see with what a
troubled countenance, the Lady was brought to
bed of a consent to let us stay; meer necessity
supplying the part of a Midwife to that hard and
painfull birth. After we entred the house (which
seemed because of the infrequency of the indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
like a body without a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) the Knight with
a discourse of the poverty of the Nation, and of
the greatness of the taxes, joyning to this, that
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:33161:209"/>
large houses, such as his, were monuments of the
builders folly; for besides the money spent both
in building and maintaining them, they did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
invite strangers to lodge, and enemies to
garison in it. Whilst we were thus passing time,
I heard my Lady scold at her servant, for suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the beer to run out, by pulling the spigget
out of the barrel, and thereupon coming in to us
in a chafe, she ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>used her own misfortune; but
she told us that we should have a drink of whey,
which was very wholsom in that hot season; as
also, we should have sack to correct its coldness:
so the sack is brought in a great bottle, and all is
filled out in a big glasse, and given to the Lady,
who drinks to me, but when I intreated her to
taste it a little better, she told me, that albeit
that sack was not hot in the mouth, yet it was
very hot in the stomack, and that the Physicians
had forbidden her husband to drink any more
than two spoonfulls of it; but I no sooner got it
in my hand, than I drank it off: foreseeing that
I was in a place, where all the year was a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<hi>Lent,</hi> wherefore I resolved to make drink
aliment, albeit Philosophers and Physicians both
call that much in question. At supper we had
some pulse, egs, and pease, but no flesh; for, as
the Lady said, she could hardly in conscience suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a poor pullet to be murdered to satisfie her
appetite. Truly wife, added her husband, that is
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:33161:210"/>
good philosophy; for flesh is not thought natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
food for man: for we see that children (in
whom nature is not adulterated by custom) love
fruit better than flesh; as also, if it were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
we might eat it as nature hath provided it;
but now we see that we roast, seeth, and fry it,
else it cannot be eaten: as also, nature hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
long and small teeth upon those beasts,
and long beaks upon those fowls, which most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
flesh for their aliment; whereas it hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
man teeth long and broad. Physicians also
esteem it not so wholsome as other meats are, for
it being before concoction, equal to our flesh, it
is by concoction sublimated above it, and so not
fit to feed us: and we find that when it corrupts
(for all of it cannot become aliment) that it is of
all putrefactions the most hatefull; for bread,
roots, and such like things, albeit they putrifie, yet
stink not; but flesh, when corrupted, stinks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.
After supper, we went to bed, without
having any drink put in our offer, to excuse which,
the Knight alleadged, that he heard that it was
the custom of our Country, for the Egyptians
used to say by way of proverb, <hi>that he who goeth
to bed thirsty, riseth wholsome;</hi> for thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions
were occasioned. The next morning the
Knight appeared in an old sattin doublet, having
a little piece taffata hanging down from it, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us that it was lined with it, but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:33161:210"/>
that it was only doubled with green linen.
He wore likewise silk stockens, but exceedingly
shattered by age, to conceal which he had folded
them all in degrees. After I rose, I went to the
Garden, where my Lady was gathering nettles to
make broth for us; I perceived she wanted her
stockens and shoes, which she thought was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
by the length of her gown; whereupon
(to revenge my self upon her for my bad enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment)
I took her hand and walked alongst a
place with her full of nettles, which, as I perceived
by her countenance, did burn her feet; yet durst
she not complain, fearing to discover thereby her
own nakedness. After my departure from this,
my stomach had almost expired, leaving me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but hunger in legacy; a debt so urgent,
that I behoved to ride to a neighbouring Village
to satisfie it: but whilst I was in my way to it,
the angry heavens, sighed wind, and weeped rain
for the suns absence, which some troubled clouds
had imprisoned all that morning; I over-hyed a
fellow, whose gray hairs, rather than grave garb,
informed me that he was ancient; he was riding
in a pair of Spanish leather boots, which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
rain had mollified so, that they seemed to
become tender-hearted at the heavens weeping
condition; his head had been well poudered, and
by the rains assistance had made excellent mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
yet all the morter which was there, could
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:33161:211"/>
hardly have patched up those cracks which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
thereafter to be in his brain: His cassock
was of black satin, which was so hospital as not
to refuse the rain lodging; thus he rode and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
all at once. After we had ridden half a mile
together, he asked if I had ever heard of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
called <hi>Nisus,</hi> who lived in that Country,
whose skill had kept so many alive, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
complained that the place was become
too populous. I who perceived, or at least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
by his habit, that he was of that faculty
himself, told him that I had oft heard of him;
and that it was reported that he could defend
the weakest body against the strongest assaults of
death, and that he could chase out deaths ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
avantcurriers, melancholy and sickness, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they were once entred; and that the great-grand-children
of ancient families had conspired
against him, for starving so their wearied expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for none dyed (as I heard, except some
few Sextons, whom want of imployment had
quite famished; Truly (continued I) I would
ride forty miles to see him. Good Sir, replied my
companion, ye extoled him too much; but such
as he is, Sir, he is your servant, for I am the man:
At which I seemed so overjoyed, that grasping
him kindly (though rudely) in my arms, I pulled
him quite from his horse; and thereafter, craving
him pardon, I helpt him up again. After a miles
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:33161:211"/>
march, his horse did begin to weary, and at last
became so uncivil, as to refuse to bear his master
company; whereupon the Doctor lights down,
and taking up his foot, he endeavours to find his
pulse, which he swore was a caprezant, and that
he behoved to cause give him a clyster; but (ah
misfortune) whilst he is musing upon the disease,
the horse, weary of standing upon three feet, kicks
his Lordship into a ditch which stood near by,
whence we could hardly pull out: when we had
pulled him out, <hi>Kalodulus</hi> sayes to him, Truly,
Sir, it appears ye dive deep in any thing wherein
ye once enter; but I admire why ye carry with
you such a horse, except it be that because ye are
a Physician, ye cannot want a skelleton for your
anatomy. After he was re-mounted, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
me with a description of a Lady in <hi>Nisbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
whom he loved dearly, describing all the parts
of her body, as if he had been anatomizing; and
to conclude all, he took a Letter out of his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
which he had directed to her, and whereof
he bestowed upon me this copie afterwards.</p>
            <p>Fairest of all created creatures, yea, fairer than <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
and all her Nymphs, albeit they were chopt in one;
the harmony of your well-agreeing colours, makes my
pulses dance to their musick; and your beauty, like a
great gale, hath so filled the sails of my desires, that it
hath driven me out of the harbour of ease, into the ocean
of Love. A surfet of your disdain, hath (as all cold
things do) easten me in a feaver of rage: your Answer
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:33161:212"/>
to this Letter must be the crisis, by which I am to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostick

and there I did enqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e how affairs byassed

whom that large orb of Court did roul; after
this we digressed from Courtiers, to Court-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
whereupon he thus charactered to
me the emptiness of that so much desired trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> my experience hath pilgrimaged through
most, and my meditation through all those fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
wherwith our reason is ensnared, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our happiness is betrayed; yet amongst them
all I perceive that none hath gained so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes,
as Court-vanity: There it is that men
run to ruine in Coach, and flee with feathers to
folly; and I am confident, that if men took as
much pains to gain favour in Heaven, as they do
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:33161:212"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o ingratiat themselves at Court, that they could
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> miss to be canonized as the most eminent in
the Kalender of Saints. That is the Butt at which
all men level the arrows of their affections, and
that is the Idol which all men worship. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Sir, at my first arrival at Court, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to find out the reason why in the circle
of humane happinesse, Court was made the
only center, to which all the other pleasures, like
so many lines, tended, and in which they were
all terminated; but I must acknowledge, Sir, that
without borrowing the eyes of those who so
much admire it, I shall never be able to see in it
that satisfaction and amiableness, which they so
much dote upon: But to make your judgment
judge, I shall relate to you the trade which I
conceive most of them drives. All night they
wrestle with their giant, fears and cares, til at last,
necessary, with much difficul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, draws the curtain
of rather slumber than sleep before their wearied
eyes: but yet their judgment no sooner leaves
off, than their fancy begins to work; and as they
thought whilst awake, so now whilst asleep they
dream of competitors, and enemies; of mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
and challenges; and after some time
their eye lids start up in spight of sleep, and then
their minds are presented afresh with a large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory
of by-pastaffronts, and future fears, all
written with the black ink of disquietness. And
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:33161:213"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:33161:214"/>
thus they toss and tumble, where a poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man
would find much refreshment; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon one side, sometimes upon another,
their souls (which only in this, are masters of,
and command their bodies) drawing the bodies
after them, and making them toss and turn, as
they are tossed themselves. After that the Sun
hath sent its rayes to salute them in its name,
then they must sleep, because sleep is then unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:
the morning being thus spent, they spend
(or rather mispend) the forenoon, betwixt a
comb and a mirrour, consulting now and then
their pages, whether they be well drest or not.
And now they ask whether the King be gone a
hunting, or not? (his motion being the only
science which they study) and if not, they post to
Court, putting that complement upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
that for haste to wait upon him, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with their matines. And there, like <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi>
atomes, they wander up and down in the
sphere of chance, and possibly stand in some anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
like those pictures which the cunning
needle hath depenciled in the curious hangings;
meditating upon nothing but how to make some
Grandee take notice of them, or how to pay an
earth-deep reverence to any whom they know
to be a Court-darling. At dinner they surfet one
day, and are starved another, their purses being
like the damme of an ill-going Mill, which must
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:33161:214"/>
be clused up two dayes to make it go the third;
there, if they meet with any Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
they tax him for being unfashionable in
his cloathes, and rural in his deportment, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to disarm him of his confidence,
that thereafter they may foil him at pleasure.
And really, Sir, I perceive that they mould their
fashions and modes of new every year, not so
much to pleasure their vagrant fancies, as to
make Courtship an Art which one must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
learning: For, if these stood alwayes
fixt upon the same center, a Gentleman who
had spent a year at Court, and then had retired
to the sweet bosom of a melancholy life, might
know as much as they, but now they in this,
(and in this only) must learn something from
the nothing-besides-knowing Courtier. This
done, they proceed to discourse of affairs of
State, dropping a word or two of some myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
forreign transaction, and stopping there,
as if they would not decipher so great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and shake their head, as if they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostick
the event, of that whereof they know
not the cause. Wherefore, Sir, I will recount
to you a jest, put lately at this Court upon one
of these State-mountebanks, by a Country-Gentleman,
who coming one morning to visit
the Courtier, he asks what news? none, sayes
the Gentleman, save only that <hi>Thrastus,</hi> one
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:33161:215"/>
of the Thracian Nobles, is dead; which they
say is an irreparable losse to our King. <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
dead, replyed the other, the gods forbid,
for he was one of our intimate friends, and
with that he fetches a turn or two, folding his
hands, and testifying much grief; wherupon the
Gentleman turning to one of the by-standers,
tells him in his ear, with a smile, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
he never heard of any such person: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dinner is ended, they return to Court, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
alongst with them their Country friends,
and in their way salutes hundreds of persons,
whom they scarce know, pretending that these
are their special good acquaintances: And if
the King smile (though his smile be occasioned
by some inward thought) they will swear it
was upon them; or if he call them, though
meerly by accident, and desire them to do any
thing of the meanest concernment, they will
pretend that it was a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ighty particular which
he did communicate to them. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they mis-spend much of that little time
which providence hath not given, but lent
them; making their bodies their souls, and
their pleasures their paradise, till at last, after
they have acted the personage of youth in this
comedy of Court, age dismantles them of all
those ornaments and perfections, which made
them formerly be accounted Gallants, and then
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:33161:215"/>
they are turned off without any reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the hatefull name of an old Courtier.
Oh then happy he who impales himself within
the circuit of a Country Cottage, suffering his
thoughts to travel all over the large orb of the
creation; and when they return loaded with
the spoil of solid knowledge, feasts them with
home-bred morality; there none compets with
them, neither are they opprest by any, their
time is not trifled away by idlings, nor their
humour violented by debauch'd persons; how
much then are we obliged to Court, which like
a boil in the body politick, draws to it all those
malignant humours, which else might hugely
annoy all the other members? But I admire
what pleasure can the Country be debarred
from, whereof the Court participates; for,
whilst the species of all these soul-delighting
pleasures, are in the eye, they are no pleasures,
(else brutes might t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ste that true sweetnesse)
and when they are from the eye conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yed to
the inward faculties; then they differ nothing
from pleasures meerly imagined; so that a
Country-man, may under the shade of some
great Oak, or upon the bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k of some mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
River, tast as much pleasure, in envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saging
or viewing his own contemplated hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
as a Courtier can in eying the real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Court delights. There are some who
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:33161:216"/>
(like the Whales) never leave the Ocean of
pleasure and publick imployments, till they be
wounded by the darts of affronts, or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;
and then they run ashoar upon a
private life, but, like ships beat into a harbour,
stay no longer there than the boistering storms
arrests them in it. These are not the true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of sacred prudence, else the same expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
which sent them thither, would retain
them in it, and their life and their resolution,
should have the same period.</p>

change the greatness of my affection to you;
neither is there any thing in this the archest of
terrours, which afflicts me besides the thoughts
of leaving your favours unrequired, and your
person unguarded, yet, Madam, I hope that
the unexpectedness of this fatality, will pardon
the first, and that the Omnipotent Justice of the
never good relinquishing Gods, who have arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalled
thousands of thunder bolts in the clouds,
to execute their just commands, will never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the last to be opprest: for, albeit some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementary
Athiests, thinks it a disparagement
to the Al-disposing Dieties, to eye and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decree
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:33161:217"/>
the meanest of actions, yet it were a great
ebness of faith, to believe that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
a person, for whose satisfaction, and to
celebrate whose praises all the rest of the world
seems (next to that of the immortal Gods) to
have onely been created: but should I fear mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,

my separation from you, let me die regrated
by you, and erect for me a monument in your

            <p>This discourse had almost entranced the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
compassionate <hi>Aretina,</hi> when her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Monanthropus</hi> (who had all this time been
an undiscovered witness to what had past)
touched with the affliction of his daughter, and
sufficiently convinced of her affection to <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
which he could never formerly believe; is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
out, and imbracing her, entreated her not to
fear the event of a fatherly experiment. <hi>Megi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
did at the same time unvizard his face, and
running to <hi>Philarites,</hi> hugged him in his arms.
Whilst one of the Souldiers did unty him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
thereafter they entered the Cabine;
and having shut the door, <hi>Monanthropus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to them (whilst they were yet astonished
with amazement) how that <hi>Megistus</hi> had plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that supprisall, to convince him of the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:33161:218"/>
affection that they caryed to each other; and
thereafter turning him to <hi>Philarites,</hi> he assured
him that he esteemed his daughter happy, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
noticed, and much more in being loved by
a person of such eminent qualities, but that he
was sorry that he was able to bestow no better
requital upon him; to whose valour he owed
first his life, and next the rescue of his daughter,
who only made his life and estate desirable to
him. <hi>Philarites</hi> interrupted him here, with
this reply, Sir, albeit I had as really engaged
by my services the immortal Gods, as ye in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
acknowledge that I have engaged you,
yet could not the treasure of their unexhaustible
al-sufficiencie, remunerat me with any thing
more acceptable then <hi>Aretina;</hi> So that, Sir, if
you will Authorize my pretentions to serve her,
you shall thereby put me above the power of
desiring any new addition to my present hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
to whose hight, fate shall not be able to
add the least measure. After this, imbraceing
<hi>Megistus,</hi> the Gods (said he) fearing that man
who placeth all vertue in advantage, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
put a true estimate upon friendship, if it were
not seconded by reall advantages, do oft afford
friends occasions of succouring each other in
their mutual extreamities; neither have I time,
nor you modesty, to hear me catalogue your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
which I shall alwayes esteem as such, as
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:33161:218"/>
that none but you could bestow them; and as
oft as my pulse beats minuts, my heart shall coine
thankfull resentments of them.</p>
            <p>Thus did these overjoyed lovers, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
friends, both admire, and congratulate each
others happinesse; thanking fate for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
in leaving them nothing to seek now,
but the continuation of what she had bestowed
already, and unbridling their own passions with
an indicible satisfaction, yet such a satisfaction,
as that albeit it was compleat for the present,
did notwithstanding receive a new accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the apprehension of the future; and
albeit love possess't intirly all the corners of their
breast; yet were they repleat with friendship
like a tunn, which albeit it be full of burnt coals,
will never the less hold its just measure of water.
Neither did the intensness of their friendship,
cool, in the least, the heat of their love, but both
like two hands, did by their mutual heat excite
mutual order in each other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarites</hi> glad to have these Nobles in a
place which he was born to command, entreated
they would do him the honour to go ashoar, to
recreat their incommodat bodies, against whom
the sea, and season had us'd so much rigor. And
to this they presently condiscended, and went
ashoar at that same place from which they were
carried; but whilst they were walking through
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:33161:219"/>
the forrest, which verged upon the ocean, the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of armour not far from the beaten path, did
awak the courage of the three generous Knights,
and importuned them to ride hitherwards: at
their arrival upon the place, they perceived a
Gentleman, whose armour was windowed with
breaches, and whose blood was removing from
its shattered lodging; beside him lay two of his
servants slain; against him fought only one, who,
to their admiration, was covered with <hi>Philarites</hi>
armour, which the bearers sword (seconded
by much skill) had so well defended, as that they
had as yet suffered but little in the quarrel; they
were scarce advanced his length, when he had
disarmed his adversary to whom he thus spoke.</p>
            <p>Sir, these who fight without a quarrel, fight
oft without success; neither are the Gods so
idle spectators of humane actions, as to suffer
courage to be the sole arbiter of such conflicts:
your civil inquiry might have probably gained
you a friend, whereas your rudeness hath lost
you your sword, and your want of discretion,
hath put you now upon the discretion of your
enemy. Noble Sir, (replyed the other) your
armour occasioned both my inconsideratness, and
my mistake; for they induced me to believe that
you were <hi>Philarites,</hi> against whom my revenge
was only levelled. You are not much mistaken
in this quarrel, answered the other, albeit ye be
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:33161:219"/>
mistaken in the person; for our quarrel shall
still be one, though our persons be different.
Upon this, <hi>Philarites</hi> presently started out, and
calling aloud to him who was the conqueror,
hold, Noble Sir, (said he) least ye pluck from that
<hi>Philarites,</hi> for whom ye pretend so much friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
the occasion of punishing one of his own
disloyal subjects, who breaths by his clemency,
that life which he would so willingly hazard
against him; he shew him formerly by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
his life, how little he feared his malice, and
now by condiscending to fight him, he will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
how little he dreads his courage. This
discourse surprised both the vanquished, and
vanquisher; but <hi>Megistus</hi> and <hi>Philarites</hi> were
as much surprised, as either of the other two;
when he who had spoken so affectionately by
throwing off his cask, shew them the face of the
<hi>Martial Knight;</hi> who having come to <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
in pursuit of the Pyrate, and for the defence
of <hi>Aretina,</hi> had accidentally fallen upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned
house of pleasure, which because
he had lost his own armour, he had taken alongst
with him that morning, and because of them had
been pursued by this Gentleman, whom he had
now disarmed, who was <hi>Osiris,</hi> general of that
rebellious Army which opposed the interest of
their native Prince: The King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> after
these three old and intimate acquaintances had
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:33161:220"/>
witnessed to each other their kynd resentments
of former favours. <hi>Osiris</hi> ashamed of his ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and fearing punishment, humbled himself
upon his knees before <hi>Philarites,</hi> and made him
this confession. Generous Prince, albeit the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
number, and unpardonable qualities of my
crimes, might detract from the truth of what I
am to say, yet believe, Sir, that my conscience
sick now with repentance, will freely vomite up
these noxious humors by which it was formerly
so much distempered: It is not, Sir, that I intend
to buy with this confession the continuance of
my life, which because it is so spotted with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
will be persecuted by legions of divine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments;
I rather abhorre then desire it, no
Sir, it is the sence of duty, presented to my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by a dying temper, which wrings it from
me, wherefore, Sir, I shall unbury to you a miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
wherin your repose is much interessed; and
by which, if I cannot wipe off my former rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
yet at least, I shall evite the Commission of
new crimes. Sir, many of your Nobles (of
whom I shall deliver yow a particular list) have
combined amongst themselves, to levy an Army,
hoping that I should have, according to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
either killed you privately, or have
brought you to them as a prisoner, in order to
this design.</p>
            <p>I have waited at yonr house of pleasure till
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:33161:220"/>
this morning, at which time, perceiving this
Gentleman in your Armour; I followed him
expecting to have had you at my devotion, but
providence, whose decrees are unrepealable,
hath ordered it otherwise. Our rendesvouze is
to be six dayes hence, so that, Sir, ye may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the disorders which we have projected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristobulus</hi> had all this time darted such
looks at the Martiall Knight, as evidenced suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
his rage against him; but at last, when
that impostume of rage broke, it blustered
forth this envennomed matter,</p>
            <p>Base <hi>Menaleon,</hi> dares fate declair war
against the immortal Gods, by shouldering up
an Interest, which is so much their enemie:
and shall the feet of thy cowardishness, be still
so swift as to carry thee away from their and my
just revenge: no, no, thou must resolve to
quite that Life, which thy want of Courage
endeares to thee above thy Repute; and I will
rather resolve to pudle my Sword in the blood
of a Traytour, then suffer thy Treason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unpunished.</p>
            <p>The Martiall Knight convinced that <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
and <hi>Megistus</hi> knew his courage; resolved
to shew them his patience, and so returned
this answer.</p>
            <p>My innocency <hi>(Aristobulus)</hi> needed not
the patronage of my Sword; if ye had as much
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:33161:221"/>
patience, as I have courage; yet seeing ye will
choose no other Umpires, but our Swords. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
your self, that my courage is not so fast
a sleep, as that it needs such clamorous oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bries
to awake it: nor is my Sword so fixt in
its Sheath, as that it needs such shrewd pulls to
pluck it out. Come, come, experiment that
Gallantrie which ye so call in question; and
receive a just punishment from him, who was
once willing to pardon your escapes.</p>
            <p>They were brisling up their despight, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to exchange their noble Lives: when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites</hi>
(whose common Friendship to both
made him an Enemie to both their. resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
lodged <hi>Aristobulus</hi> in his armes; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
<hi>Megistus</hi> to keep fast the <hi>Martiall
Knight, Aristobulus</hi> screwing himself out of
<hi>Philarites</hi> embraces, and finding that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
behoved to be differred till another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
bolted away, leaving the <hi>Martiall
Knight</hi> this adiew. Dregg thy worthless Life,
through these disasters, which the just Gods
are preparing for thee; and live fears Martyre,
till occasion suffers thee to relaps within my
power. <hi>Philarites</hi> rode after him, hoping to
reconcile them, but all in vain, for <hi>Aristobulus</hi>
horse carried him away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philarites</hi> was because of this discourse, and
at the intercession of the <hi>Martiall Knight,</hi>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:33161:221"/>
induced to pardon <hi>Osiris;</hi> and returning to
<hi>Monanthropus,</hi> and <hi>Aretina,</hi> (who were much
satisfied with the sight of the <hi>Martial Knight)</hi>
it was resolved, that <hi>Osiris</hi> should be left at
the house of pleasure, both as an hostage of
what he had promised, as also to ease him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his desperate wounds. And that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larites</hi>
should endeavour before the six dayes
were expired to ensure the Bonte-sense of
that irreconcilable faction.</p>
            <p>Affairs thus ordered, <hi>Philarites</hi> entreats
them to go alongst with him to visite the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Hermitage in the World; wherein they
might see a Gentleman, who being a stranger,
entreated my Father (said he) to gratifie him
with some retired valley, wherin he might clois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
up himself for the residue of his Life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
this valley was given him, in which he
hath at his own expence built a House, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
and Garden: which the Universe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
equall; here hath he lived these fifteen years
by past, tutured by the rigidest austeritie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature is able to endure; by this time
they were advanced as far as the avenues of the
house, where, betwixt two files of well ranged
trees, coasting upon the water, they perceived
a Gentleman, walking the pace of a funerall;
followed by two pages in a mourning liverie;
his face mantled with Melancholy, resembled a
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:33161:222"/>
rich cloth of Gold, concealed under a black
Tirfanie, where the coruscant splendor did but
scarsly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ep out. His cheeks stood like empty
palaces, where those noble Guests, Beautie,
and Vivacitie, had lodged formerly; and his
whole body resembled an house of pleasure, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to be a Charnell house. They no
sooner perceived him, than they lighted down,
and after the first Salutes, <hi>Megistus</hi> thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoke
him.</p>
            <p>Sir, it is not to divert, but to divertise you,
that we come to profer you our attendance;
wherefore if ye apprehend, that our Society
suits evil, either with your leasure, or pleasure,
We beg that ye would congediate us instantly.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, (replyed the Melancholy knight)
ye may easily perceive, that my hard destiny
hath placed Melancholies all destroying Sword,
at the door of joyes Paradice, to forbid me a free
entrie: and albeit it change the kinds of my
torture, yet it never changes the desire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
it hath to torture me. Yet Company is
a torture which seems more unsupportable to
me than any other; because I am sensible, that
others there suffer with me; yee are now in a
place, wherein yee can observe nothing that is
worthy, besides the unvaluable worth of him
who bestowed the use of the place upon me.</p>
            <p>This pleasant valley, which was mantled
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:33161:222"/>
with a pleasantly pyled grass, was Garlanded eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where by nature, with curious flowers; in its
middle did run a sweet river, which by its fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
windings, shew how unwilling it was to
leave so sweet a valley; one of its bancks was
twifed with Orange, Figg, and other pleasant
trees. Whose fruit hang down, as if they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
desirous to fall in the lap of their Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
the Earth. From this, they went in
to a well proportioned Chappell, whose floor
being white Marble, was indented in the middle
with many Deaths, Heads, don couriously in
black. It was hung round with dead mens Skuls,
in each whereof stood a great waxe-taper,
which brunt continually, from the middle of
the roofe did hing a hearse of cipress, all deckt
with faded flowers, under it stood the statue of
a young Lady, in white Marble likewise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the artist had been so happy, as that it seemed
twains with her whom it represented; at the one
end was placed an Altar, all in black Velvet
(with which all the room was Tapistred) all
spangled with wormes, tears, and bleeding hearts
wrought in golden Embroidery. It was then the
hour, wherein he used to celebrate the obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
of his dead Lady: wherefore he entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Aretina,</hi> and the other Knights to share
with him in his devotions, which when they
had yeelded to, there entered two Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:33161:223"/>
in deep mourning, with two Lutes; who
were consorted in their singing by two Priests;
all choise voices, the Organ likewise helped
them to tremble out these lugubrious Lines;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Since she is gone, why stay I here?</l>
               <l>Seing we were one, and she my dear,</l>
               <l>My halfless Soul must sure be lame;</l>
               <l>This bell doth tole, that it may blame</l>
               <l>My leaden motion to that sacred place,</l>
               <l>Where with devotion, I her raying face</l>
               <l>May still admire, with eyes voided of sorrow,</l>
               <l>From whom the Sun so clear, yet further light
might borrow.</l>
               <l>But sure, the Gods will not admit that I,</l>
               <l>Should so near sit to such a dietie.</l>
               <l>Let her then live, whilst sadned I,</l>
               <l>Must ever grive, and never dye.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>He had all this time kneeled before her Statue,
and prosused so his tears, as that he seemed to
wash the place whereon her Statue stood. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
ended, they dined; and after dinner he
conducted them to a Park, where under stately
Oaks, and tale Firres, did run a great many
Dear, whose heads were so well branched, that
they seemed to glory in being natures Cuckolds,
the Lyon, Leopard, and Tygre likewise (tamed as
it were by the dejectedly magestick looks of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:33161:223"/>
their Master) grazed contendedly. From this
they entered a Garden, where all the Figures
were cut out in Deaths-heads, and hemmed in
with Dead-mens bones: in one corner of this
Garden was a walk, guarded upon both sides by
Cipress-trees, each whereof was topped by a
skull; at the one end stood a Tombe, and at the
other a Grave; here <hi>Aretina</hi> begged of him
the Story of that Peerless Lady, whose death he
so devoutely bemoaned: to which he returned
this answer.</p>
            <p>Madam, that question renewes to me these
Convulsion-fits of dispare, by which my tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Soul is so much distempered, and rackles that
sore, which is incurable, though the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were my Physitians; for I mourn for
what is past; and since it is impossible, that the
preterit should be recalled; it is impossible that
my wound should be cured: Yet, Madam, lest I
should seem not to prefer to my private repose,
the satisfaction of one who is so farr in affinity
with her, as to be of her sex and qualitie. I shall
relate to you that tragick History, which embi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to me the legend of my Life.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Lacedemon</hi> grovelled under the feet
of fate, burriured by the hand of its own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots;
a Knight called <hi>Lacetus,</hi> married a Lady
who shortly dying, left one Daughter, whose
beauty and parts, made her fully equivalle
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:33161:224"/>
numbers of other Children; and who, because
of her features, as well as of her oneness, was
every way singular: it appears that the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of this one, encouraged him to marry
that he might beget moe, so that before his
widowes bed had left the impression of his
first Lady, he gives it that of a second; who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his young Daughter had creeped up to the
years of marriage, seing that she extenuated
her beauty, and fearing that she might exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
her Sons fortune, she treated her with all
these rigours that a step-humour could sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate
to her: blunting her confidence, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
her expence, so that her fathers house did
appear a prison to her. A young Gentleman who
lived in the same Countie, and was there much
admired both for the greatness of his parts, and
goodness of his humour; regrating this down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed
condition, frequents much <hi>Lacetus</hi>
house, and goes oft a hunting with him; hoping
to gain <hi>Pisetas</hi> affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for so was the
Daughter called) neither failed he in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
for importunity and opportunity, did in
end engage <hi>Piseta</hi> to him. Which <hi>Ipsetus</hi> (this
was the Gentlemans name) managed so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
as that none could bottome the mistery;
at last press'd by <hi>Piseta,</hi> that he would relive her
from that servitude, under which he truckled:
and desirous to enjoy so peerless a Mistress, he
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:33161:224"/>
suits for her at her fathers hands, who deferred

that pernicious Step-mother, whom the custom
of doing mischief, had made bold to execute, and
the intense desire to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this poor Lady, had
made cunning to contrive all that her hellish-heart
could invent; did now with more cruelty
and less fear then formerly, continue to afflict
poor <hi>Piseta.</hi> But amongst her other projects,
this ensuing prank was the blow which was
hardest to be warded; because it disarmed her
of her Fathers protection; which she sconced
her self alwayes with formerly. She writes a
Letter, as directed from one, <hi>Noretus,</hi> a pedling
Merchant of <hi>Lacedemon:</hi> wherein he thanked
her for the encouragement she gave him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:33161:225"/>
in his affection, and regrated with her,
her Fathers and Step-mothers rigour. This
Letter she sewed in a Pin-cushion, which a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lady had bestowed upon her, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of that, she had alwayes kept very diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
This being done, she addresses her self to
her husband, and there with tear-bedabled eyes,
she condoles his Daughters folly; which did so
prostitute her affection, and might possibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
her body to such mean persons as <hi>Nore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
was, and acquainted him how she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Letters from him; and as she was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by one of her Maids, was coverted up in her
Pin-cushion: Wherefore, she resolved to seek
presently the Pin-cushion before himself. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seta</hi>
is sent for, from whom her Step-mother
seeks it; whereat <hi>Piseta,</hi> sorry that her Step-mother
should seek that, which she behoved to
refuse; denies modestly with a blush to give it.
her Father perceiving that she both blushed and
denyed it, flings away immediately to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and taking it away with him, rips it up, and
finds the Letter, which soothed all that was told
him. When he had collationed this with <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus,</hi>
giving his daughter some Gloves and Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,
(which the honest Gentleman had given
out of his affection to the family which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
imployed him) all is concluded infallibly;
This so inflamed him, that those flames of rage
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:33161:225"/>
brunt his fatherly affection to ashes; and armed
him with the cruellest of resolutions against
her: wherupon calling for her, he first chid,
and then beat her; so that scarce so much life
was left her, as to resent the miseries under
which she lay loaded. But after that her hard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny
had lent her further strength, that it might
sport it self yet longer with her afflictions,
she teared away her year like dayes, in regrating
the sadness of her misfortunes, till at last like a
too young branch, she yeelds under the unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portableness
of her burden; and resolves to
leave her Fathers house, which her Step-mothers
malice had enchanted: and to sanctuary her self
in some unknown corner, where at least none
should upbraid her with the disproportionated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her condition to her birth: having thus
packt up these Jewels which her Mother had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to her Nurse to be given her, she steals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
one morning to <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> but being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with such foot Journeys, she retires into a
meddow, a mile from the City, where after half
an hours stay, she perceives a Lady with her
waiting maid come in a hackney Coach, to breath
in some Country-air. After they had taken a
walk or two, <hi>Piseta</hi> accoasts the Lady, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out his condition to her, entreated her Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
charity in promoting her to some service;
the other who was a Baud, glad of such a servant
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:33161:226"/>
accepted her in her own service, assuring her that
she should be tasked with nothing that was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult:
So that both being willing, she takes her
in Coach with her, and alots her a Chamber very
well equipaged, and the next morning cloathes
her in a new Gown, and all other necessaries.
That night I (whose youth clustred forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
new grapes of wickedness) came in to
ravell away my time and moneys in that mother
City, and recoursed immediately to the house
of that old Baud, where I used to feast my lust
at all occasions; at my entrie she rejoyced (as
she said) at my good fortune; for she was able
to give me the fairest and sweetest Maid she had
ever eyed; but told me, that I behoved to double
her Salary: I who thought gold but money,
when imployed to such uses, pactioned with her
for a double fee: Whereupon she brought me in
to <hi>Piseta's</hi> chamber, and retiring, lockt the door
behind her. <hi>Piseta</hi> was imploying her time
and needle very industriously, when my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
startled her: I must acknowledge that
never any was so admiration-beaten as I was, at
the first sight of that divine beauty; but when
I began to carresse her, she entreated me to be
more reserved, and the more I pressed her, the
more she recoiled: at last, longing to enjoy so
desirable an object, I asked, why dwelt she here,
being of so coy an humour. I came here to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:33161:226"/>
serve my Mistress, but not to suffer such uncivil
addresses (replyed <hi>Piseta)</hi> which suits as
ill with your discretion, as they do with my
modesty: This answer touched my very
soul, and finding that chance rather then
resolution had guided me hither, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
her, how she was in a mistake; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
poor Lady, falling upon her knees, she
begged from my Sword, an issue to her end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
troubles; and told me her birth, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of her coming there; with such speats of
tears, as were able to hurrie away before them,
the strongest bancks of obstinat perversness, and
with so pathetick expressions, as were eloquent
enough to enforce the greatest of cowards, to
unsheath his sword in her quarrell. I found by
her relation, that she was the same person
whom I was to go in suit of, and acquainted her
with my Name and Style, which did much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
her. Lady (said I to her) if I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricat
you out of this danger, and re-enstate you
in your former liberty, will you condiscend to
marry me, to which after some reluctancie she
at last condescended; upon which I went to that
old Baud, and menaced her with the discovery
of her wickedness, if she dismist not that young
Lady, whom she had so betrayed, and withall
satisfied her for what expence she could alleadge
she was at, and brought her to mine own house,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:33161:227"/>
where I waited upon her without offering the
least indignity to her person, till our love was,
authorized by Marriage.</p>
            <p>But alas, this summer of joy lasted not long;
for a fourthnight after our Marriage, a Pilgrim
did one morning desire to speake with <hi>Piseta,</hi>
whose devotion made this suit very acceptable.
When she came in view, the Pilgrim after a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
reverence thus occoasts her; <hi>Madam,</hi> My
misfortune must sure be unavoidable, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
both of the number and zeal of
my services, and in spight of your own vertuous
inclination, it hath carryed you to forfeit your
engagment to me, and because that my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and your honour, were insolvably twisted
together, to enrigide you so far against me, as
that ye were content rather to risk your own
repute, then to suffer the integrity of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
if I shed not my blood in your quarrell,
it was because ye wanted daring enimies, and
if ye were kept from the knowledge of what I
suffered for you, it was out of fear to make
you suffer with me; but that I was racked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
by your disasters, the Gods who are
now my punishers, may in that be my witness.
But alas, <hi>Madam,</hi> I had offended too much these
just Dieties, to expect such promotions from
them, and they were too intimatly knowing to
your condour, to suffer; that match to be made in
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:33161:227"/>
Heaven: neither would I (if I were not weary
of this Life) remember the Gods, by re-itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my complaints, how I was guilty of so
boundless presumption, which deserves as many
chastisements as there dwells Thunderbolts in
the Clouds to punish it withall; yet, <hi>Madam,</hi> as
one who reposes all his weight upon one thing,
must needs fall if that fail him, so seing I only
lived to do you service, I must now die since
my services are rebuted, and with that pulling
a Dagger out of his sleeve, he sent it to his own
heart, to acquaint it that he behoved to die:
<hi>Piseta</hi> convinced that this was her dear <hi>Ipse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and reflecting upon her own ingratitude,
retired immediately to her Chamber, and there
uncloathing her self, she went to bed, and calling
for me, immediatly she expressed her self thus
to me.</p>
            <p>It must be an unsupportable burden of grief
(Dear Husband) which your al-curing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is not able to alleviat, and since I am cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minell,
both in slighting my Oath, and in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the lovely <hi>Ipsetus,</hi> why shou'd I yet
commit another crime in endeavouring to evite
the punishment? And since I was not so vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as to take example by others, I should be
now so vertuous, as to desire others to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by me. My own conscience hath senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me guilty of death; why should not then my
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:33161:228"/>
own grief execute that so just a sentence? and
why should I by prolonging my life, leave my
self a possibilty of being yet more vitious? No,
no, Dear Husband, the Gods are too just, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to live to betray you, who hath betrayed
him whom I loved once as well as you. And
since the bonds of promise were not, they have
reason to try, if the bonds of death be strong
enough to fetter me. Neither could they suffer
that your progeny should have been contagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the vitions Leprosie of such a Mother,
or that your liberty of matching one to your
vertues, should have been forbidden you by
the valueless Life of the worthiless <hi>Piseta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words epilogued her life, and made me
a lifeless witness, of her tear-creating death,
leaving me nothing but as much grief in Legacie,
as my never idle eyes shall be able to pay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they imploy the whole stock of my
moisture, for acquitting me of that obligation.</p>
